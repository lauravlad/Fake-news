      "body": "<p>When a programmer builds software, they do so based on requirements which are likely to change in the future. Requirements change because software interacts with the real world which is dynamic.</p> <p>When these requirements change, the developer, who perhaps did not write the original version, must implement the new requirements. In order to do so, they read the original source code, understand the different abstractions, identifies what needs to change and then implements the changes. Readable source code facilitates the reading and understanding of the abstraction phases and as a result, facilitates the evolution of the codebase. Readable code saves future developers\u2019 time and effort.</p> <p>Code readability is key for large software projects with many developers, and where the source code that is being written will have to be modified by another person.</p> <p>Code readability plays a central part at the Guardian digital department, where the scale of the projects is large and developers are encouraged to rotate teams. For example the <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/frontend\">frontend project</a> has 164 contributors and over 86000 commits.</p> <p><br>In order to develop readable source code, we should ask ourselves: \u201cIf I re-read this piece of code in fifteen days or one year, will I be able to understand the abstraction I\u2019ve made here?\u201d or even better, <strong>\u201cIf a programmer who just joined the development team reads my software, will </strong><strong> they be able to understand what I have written here?\u201d</strong></p> <p>There are many tools and practices that help increase the readability of a project. Here are some:</p> <p><strong>Code review</strong></p> <p>The code review process means that every piece of code is read by as many people of varying experience as possible. If these people can understand the abstractions the developer introduced, then the source code is more likely to be understandable to others. Also, it is advisable to have rotating code reviewers in order to make our code even more readable and at the same time spread the knowledge throughout the team.</p> <p>The code review process could take different shapes depending on the development process defined in the team. For example, it could be two developers side by side discussing the different abstractions of the codebase or via an online tool using a version control system like git or SVN. At the Guardian the majority of our projects are hosted in Github, and we perform code review using Pull Requests. For example, see <a href=\"https://github.com/guardian/frontend/pull/20466\">the introduction of new font files on the Guardian website</a>.</p> <p><strong>Keep the code concise</strong></p> <p>It is fundamental when we write source code to try to keep it as concise as possible, for example only write the source code that is absolutely necessary to cover all the cases defined by the requirements. The extra source code is additional source code that developers will have to read, maintain and that may generate bugs in the future. <strong>The best source code to maintain is the one that does not exist.</strong> If you are modifying a portion of existing source code and there is a part of the source code that is not used anymore, delete it and it will avoid future issues. In line with the <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html\">Extreme Programming</a> principle of <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html\">Yagni</a>, which stands for \u201cYou Aren\u2019t Gonna Need It\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Consider using a linter</strong></p> <p>For large projects, where many developers are involved, consider using a linter. Linters prevent regular bugs and enforce a common style guidethrough the project.</p> <p>Linters don\u2019t guarantee readable code per se. If a piece of readable code doesn\u2019t comply with the style guide, a Linter will mark the line as failed. Nevertheless, sharing a code style across the entire project will make the code easier to read by new and current developers as it eliminates the need to adapt to a new code style per file.</p> <p>Some linter utilities that we use at the Guardian are <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> for JavaScript and <a href=\"http://www.scalastyle.org/\">ScalaStyle</a> for Scala.</p> <p><strong>Tests as documentation</strong></p> <p>Readable tests are the best up-to-date documentation as long as they are set up to run every time the codebase is compiled. When a requirement changes, the developer will update the codebase, causing the old test to fail. Therefore, the developer will have to update it in order to ship the feature. Additionally, well-defined tests give the team the confidence that new features or big refactors will not break the existing expected behaviour. Some test frameworks that we use at the Guardian are <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> for JavaScript and <a href=\"http://www.scalatest.org/\">ScalaTest</a> for Scala.</p> <p><strong>Meaningful variable and function names</strong></p> <p>When giving naming, it is worth spending a couple of extra minutes (and bytes of memory) to come up with meaningful and specific names which will boost readability in our codebase. It is important to avoid abstract names that could lead to a poor and unmaintainable codebase. Finally, when re-writing a piece of source code to reflect requirements that have changed, it is important to update the variable name to reflect the latest logic.</p> <p>This blog post is only an introduction of readable code, and they are other practices used to improve readability such as <a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/124\">comments</a> and <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionLength.html\">small functions with name based on intent</a>.</p> <p>In summary, readable source code saves developers\u2019 time and therefore reduces costs and creates a better work environment of collaboration with increased productivity. In order to produce readable code, it is advisable to perform code reviews, write tests and use them as documentation, choose meaningful variable and function names and consider using a linter to have a shared code style in large projects. Last but not least, keep the code concise and write only the necessary source code to fulfils the requirements.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When a programmer builds software, they do so based on requirements which are likely to change in the future. Requirements change because software interacts with the real world which is dynamic. When these requirements change, the developer, who perhaps did not write the original version, must implement the new requirements. In order to do so, they read the original source code, understand the different abstractions, identifies what needs to change and then implements the changes. Readable source code facilitates the reading and understanding of the abstraction phases and as a result, facilitates the evolution of the codebase. Readable code saves future developers\u2019 time and effort. Code readability is key for large software projects with many developers, and where the source code that is being written will have to be modified by another person. Code readability plays a central part at the Guardian digital department, where the scale of the projects is large and developers are encouraged to rotate teams. For example the frontend project has 164 contributors and over 86000 commits. In order to develop readable source code, we should ask ourselves: \u201cIf I re-read this piece of code in fifteen days or one year, will I be able to understand the abstraction I\u2019ve made here?\u201d or even better, \u201cIf a programmer who just joined the development team reads my software, will they be able to understand what I have written here?\u201d There are many tools and practices that help increase the readability of a project. Here are some: Code review The code review process means that every piece of code is read by as many people of varying experience as possible. If these people can understand the abstractions the developer introduced, then the source code is more likely to be understandable to others. Also, it is advisable to have rotating code reviewers in order to make our code even more readable and at the same time spread the knowledge throughout the team. The code review process could take different shapes depending on the development process defined in the team. For example, it could be two developers side by side discussing the different abstractions of the codebase or via an online tool using a version control system like git or SVN. At the Guardian the majority of our projects are hosted in Github, and we perform code review using Pull Requests. For example, see the introduction of new font files on the Guardian website. Keep the code concise It is fundamental when we write source code to try to keep it as concise as possible, for example only write the source code that is absolutely necessary to cover all the cases defined by the requirements. The extra source code is additional source code that developers will have to read, maintain and that may generate bugs in the future. The best source code to maintain is the one that does not exist. If you are modifying a portion of existing source code and there is a part of the source code that is not used anymore, delete it and it will avoid future issues. In line with the Extreme Programming principle of Yagni, which stands for \u201cYou Aren\u2019t Gonna Need It\u201d. Consider using a linter For large projects, where many developers are involved, consider using a linter. Linters prevent regular bugs and enforce a common style guidethrough the project. Linters don\u2019t guarantee readable code per se. If a piece of readable code doesn\u2019t comply with the style guide, a Linter will mark the line as failed. Nevertheless, sharing a code style across the entire project will make the code easier to read by new and current developers as it eliminates the need to adapt to a new code style per file. Some linter utilities that we use at the Guardian are ESLint for JavaScript and ScalaStyle for Scala. Tests as documentation Readable tests are the best up-to-date documentation as long as they are set up to run every time the codebase is compiled. When a requirement changes, the developer will update the codebase, causing the old test to fail. Therefore, the developer will have to update it in order to ship the feature. Additionally, well-defined tests give the team the confidence that new features or big refactors will not break the existing expected behaviour. Some test frameworks that we use at the Guardian are Jest for JavaScript and ScalaTest for Scala. Meaningful variable and function names When giving naming, it is worth spending a couple of extra minutes (and bytes of memory) to come up with meaningful and specific names which will boost readability in our codebase. It is important to avoid abstract names that could lead to a poor and unmaintainable codebase. Finally, when re-writing a piece of source code to reflect requirements that have changed, it is important to update the variable name to reflect the latest logic. This blog post is only an introduction of readable code, and they are other practices used to improve readability such as comments and small functions with name based on intent. In summary, readable source code saves developers\u2019 time and therefore reduces costs and creates a better work environment of collaboration with increased productivity. In order to produce readable code, it is advisable to perform code reviews, write tests and use them as documentation, choose meaningful variable and function names and consider using a linter to have a shared code style in large projects. Last but not least, keep the code concise and write only the necessary source code to fulfils the requirements.",

We started with a goal, but the rest of the game, we did not have the rhythm that we need to impose our game. We were slow, we did not commit, we couldn\u2019t find our players, we didn\u2019t believe we could find them. Nothing. We had our chances. But I congratulate Newcastle for the victory.\u201d He\u2019s then asked about the controversial De Bruyne / Aguero free kick incident in the first half. And he needs to be reminded of it by someone off-screen. He doesn\u2019t seem of a mind to complain about it. \u201cYeah, maybe, there are episodes and actions which can change the game. Of course. But in general our game was not in the rhythm we need. In many details our game was not there. It is now difficult [in the title race] because we now need to win a lot of games. The advantage is not huge, so we have to continue.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c50d111e4b037f7f77a352d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T22:21:23.895Z\">10.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>While we wait to hear from Pep, let\u2019s take a late-night dip into the mailbag.</strong> \u201cRafael Benitez is the best manager in the EPL,\u201d suggests Terence. \u201cHe has minimal resources (quality players) yet he beat Manchester City. Imagine if Mike Ashley had given him money to purchase players, Newcastle would be challenging for the league.\u201d Meanwhile here\u2019s emotion\u2019s Hubert O\u2019Hearn, from an email headed <em>Yes!</em> \u201cI can barely see this screen for my tears of joy. I\u2019m one of those people who have two clubs that they love. For Liverpool\u2019s old gaffer to lead Newcastle to a famous win. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve loved football so much since Istanbul.

They are so good, so when you get three points against them, it means the players did really well. You could see until the 95th minute, everybody was running, trying, fighting for each other. To keep pushing until the end, you have to be really proud of your players. Salomon Rondon is a key player for us; he was very good today. Hopefully we can finalise [the Miguel Almir\u00f3n deal] tomorrow. I am confident the team can do well to stay up.

The main thing was belief. I\u2019m not sure too many people believed we could win the game, but certainly in the dressing room we did. To go a goal down so early, we showed fantastic spirit, and the second half ... what a performance! It was a kick in the teeth to concede so early, but it was great spirit from the lads. To get in at half-time 1-0 allowed us to regroup, and then Ronnie [Rondon] scored a great goal. And obviously the penalty. To hang on at the end, we defended really well, and all of what the manager asked, we did. I was going to place the penalty, but it went on so long I decided to smash it. Luckily enough it went in. The place has been low but we have belief in the group that we could have a good season. We beat Manchester United at home last season, and that was a turning point, so hopefully this will be similar.\u201d He then presents the man-of-the-match award to the thoroughly excellent Salomon Rondon, whose smile is wider than the Tyne.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c50ccdae4b084eaaff7fca0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T22:03:20.272Z\">10.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>You have to say Newcastle deserved their victory.</strong> City dominated, of course, and can legitimately feel irritation at the chalking off of a goal from a quickly taken Kevin De Bruyne free kick. For the want of a referee with a lighter touch, City would have been two up and surely on their way to three points. But they were strangely listless in the second half, as Newcastle held firm, battled hard, and eventually applied enough pressure for them to buckle. It didn\u2019t take too much, which might explain why Pep walked off looking very disheartened indeed.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c50cbc5e4b084eaaff7fc91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T21:59:26.774Z\">9.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Pep warmly congratulates Rafa before disappearing down the tunnel.</strong> Rafa allows a small smile of satisfaction to play across his face. St James\u2019 Park celebrates ecstatically; it\u2019s a crucial three points in Newcastle\u2019s battle against relegation. They catapult all the way up to 14th place: on 24 points, they\u2019re now five clear of the relegation places, with Burnley, Crystal Palace and Southampton now beneath them. City meanwhile remain four points behind leaders Liverpool, on 56 having played one game more.

You have to defend with everyone, but you also have to attack with everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93cfc86bdf2561d193f035da1c1e9b6018f89b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93cfc86bdf2561d193f035da1c1e9b6018f89b59/0_102_3312_1988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dapper Rafa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dapper Rafa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c50aa44e4b0fbf19bc3bdd9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T19:41:10.726Z\">7.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bang bang. </strong>Here\u2019s a young man hoping his heroes shoot down Pep Guardiola this evening.

They\u2019ve only conceded one goal since the turn of the year. </p> <p><strong>But here\u2019s the most relevant statistic of all: they\u2019ve emerged victorious from 16 of their last 18 matches against Newcastle United.</strong> This one looks like a shoo-in for the reigning champions.</p> <p><strong>Yet in football, there\u2019s always hope for everyone. </strong>Newcastle may only have won two of their last 13 games, a sequence that\u2019s seen them plummet towards the bottom of the Premier League and say farewell to the FA Cup, all dreams of a first trophy in half a century extinguished. And those rare wins were only over fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town and Cardiff City. But they won their last league match at St James\u2019 Park, that spirit-replenishing 3-0 against the Bluebirds. Salomon Rondon, their vital number nine, is rested and refreshed. And they gave a pretty good account of themselves at the Etihad back in September, City requiring a Kyle Walker piledriver to squeak a win over lively opponents.</p> <p><strong>It should also go without saying: on their day, any side drilled by Rafa Benitez can be a match for anyone. </strong>So yes, there is a little hope for the Toon tonight. Just not a lot: they\u2019ve lost all eight of their games against the top six this season, and are accordingly priced tonight at 16-1 for the win. City are hot favourites on a freezing night in the north-east. It\u2019s cold ... but it\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T18:59:17.114Z\">at 6.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that, dear friends, is your lot. It\u2019s been a great night for Newcastle United in their battle to avoid the drop, but a grim one for Manchester City as they strive to retain their title. They\u2019ll be hoping Leicester City do them a favour at Anfield tomorrow night. Thanks for reading our MBM; nighty night and sweet dreams! Pep talks to BT Sport! \u201cWe were not at our best. We started with a goal, but the rest of the game, we did not have the rhythm that we need to impose our game. We were slow, we did not commit, we couldn\u2019t find our players, we didn\u2019t believe we could find them. Nothing. We had our chances. But I congratulate Newcastle for the victory.\u201d He\u2019s then asked about the controversial De Bruyne / Aguero free kick incident in the first half. And he needs to be reminded of it by someone off-screen. He doesn\u2019t seem of a mind to complain about it. \u201cYeah, maybe, there are episodes and actions which can change the game. Of course. But in general our game was not in the rhythm we need. In many details our game was not there. It is now difficult [in the title race] because we now need to win a lot of games. The advantage is not huge, so we have to continue.\u201d While we wait to hear from Pep, let\u2019s take a late-night dip into the mailbag. \u201cRafael Benitez is the best manager in the EPL,\u201d suggests Terence. \u201cHe has minimal resources (quality players) yet he beat Manchester City. Imagine if Mike Ashley had given him money to purchase players, Newcastle would be challenging for the league.\u201d Meanwhile here\u2019s emotion\u2019s Hubert O\u2019Hearn, from an email headed Yes! \u201cI can barely see this screen for my tears of joy. I\u2019m one of those people who have two clubs that they love. For Liverpool\u2019s old gaffer to lead Newcastle to a famous win. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve loved football so much since Istanbul. Hugs to Rafa!\u201d Rafa - whose decision to rest Salomon Rondon for the FA Cup at the weekend has been vindicated, at least in the context of this match - speaks! \u201cIt was a great effort from everyone, and to win against a team as good as Manchester City ... they can pass, they can run behind, they are dangerous at set pieces. They are so good, so when you get three points against them, it means the players did really well. You could see until the 95th minute, everybody was running, trying, fighting for each other. To keep pushing until the end, you have to be really proud of your players. Salomon Rondon is a key player for us; he was very good today. Hopefully we can finalise [the Miguel Almir\u00f3n deal] tomorrow. I am confident the team can do well to stay up. These players, they care.\u201d Matt Ritchie speaks! \u201cEspecially after our home form of late, that\u2019s a fantastic result. The main thing was belief. I\u2019m not sure too many people believed we could win the game, but certainly in the dressing room we did. To go a goal down so early, we showed fantastic spirit, and the second half ... what a performance! It was a kick in the teeth to concede so early, but it was great spirit from the lads. To get in at half-time 1-0 allowed us to regroup, and then Ronnie [Rondon] scored a great goal. And obviously the penalty. To hang on at the end, we defended really well, and all of what the manager asked, we did. I was going to place the penalty, but it went on so long I decided to smash it. Luckily enough it went in. The place has been low but we have belief in the group that we could have a good season. We beat Manchester United at home last season, and that was a turning point, so hopefully this will be similar.\u201d He then presents the man-of-the-match award to the thoroughly excellent Salomon Rondon, whose smile is wider than the Tyne. You have to say Newcastle deserved their victory. City dominated, of course, and can legitimately feel irritation at the chalking off of a goal from a quickly taken Kevin De Bruyne free kick. For the want of a referee with a lighter touch, City would have been two up and surely on their way to three points. But they were strangely listless in the second half, as Newcastle held firm, battled hard, and eventually applied enough pressure for them to buckle. It didn\u2019t take too much, which might explain why Pep walked off looking very disheartened indeed. Pep warmly congratulates Rafa before disappearing down the tunnel. Rafa allows a small smile of satisfaction to play across his face. St James\u2019 Park celebrates ecstatically; it\u2019s a crucial three points in Newcastle\u2019s battle against relegation. They catapult all the way up to 14th place: on 24 points, they\u2019re now five clear of the relegation places, with Burnley, Crystal Palace and Southampton now beneath them. City meanwhile remain four points behind leaders Liverpool, on 56 having played one game more. A huge result at both ends of the table! And there it is! You\u2019d have got a good price on this result after 24 seconds. Rafa Benitez has done his old team Liverpool a solid favour here! But it\u2019s not all about the title race, and Newcastle\u2019s magnificent second-half performance has given them a huge boost in their quest for survival! 90 min +6: The corner\u2019s lumped into the mixer ... and Stones heads it harmlessly over. As Dubravka takes his sweet time to tee up the goal kick, the crowd bay for the final whistle. 90 min +5: City press Newcastle back. But Newcastle hold their shape. City are playing it slowly and patiently, despite it all. Then suddenly Aguero bursts down the right and wins a corner. One last chance for City! 90 min +4: Hayden has the chance to release Rondon down the right, but his pass is short and allows Laporte to intercept. 90 min +3: Dubravka collects an aimless long ball and the clock continues to tick in his team\u2019s favour. 90 min +2: Laporte has been booked for complaining at the award of a Newcastle throw. City are losing their heads a bit. But there\u2019s still time to grab a precious point if they calm down. 90 min +1: Perez is replaced by Manquillo. 90 min: Sterling dribbles down the left and wafts a soft cross into Dubravka\u2019s arms. The keeper gathers and makes a big deal of flopping to the floor, needlessly, in the time-honoured time-management style. There will be five added minutes. 89 min: A rare passage of play in the City half. Not what the champions require in their desperation. 88 min: Laporte hesitates under a long ball down the right, Perez nearly nicking it off him and zipping clear. But the defender does very well to recover and hoick clear of danger. 87 min: Hold on, no free kick for that Yedlin tackle on Laporte?! It\u2019s just a throw-in. Ah well, it makes little difference. It would have been practically a corner, and City win one in short order anyway. From that, Dubravka flaps, and Aguero very nearly fashions enough space to shoot at the far post. But he can\u2019t prod home, and once again, amid a melee, the flag goes up for offside. 86 min: Yedlin puts an old-fashioned reducer on Laporte. Before any free kick can be taken, Atsu makes way for Kenedy. 84 min: No. Gundogan batters it witlessly into the Newcastle wall. Bernardo Silva tries to keep the pressure on, hooking back into the penalty area down the inside left, but a lot of City players are caught offside. 83 min: Before the free kick can be taken, Gundogan comes on for Danilo. And Gundogan will take the free kick! This could be some first touch! 82 min: On the touchline, Pep swings moodily from a bottle of water. Meanwhile the locals are bouncing. But for how long? David Silva nips down the inside-left channel and is cheekily clipped by Schar, just to the left of the D. A free kick in a very dangerous position! But he can\u2019t stop it! Ritchie doesn\u2019t take a particularly good penalty, sending it just to the right, within reach of the keeper. But Ederson can\u2019t quite get down quickly enough, and though he gets something on it, the power of the kick takes the ball under the keeper and into the bottom right! 79 min: Ederson stalls, pointing towards his groin. He\u2019ll get some treatment before Ritchie can take the penalty! Ritchie is made to wait for what seems like an eternity. Is Ederson coming off? Yes! Hold on, no! He\u2019ll face the penalty after all. 78 min: Danilo, out on the left, passes to Fernandino in the City box. Fernandinho thinks he\u2019s got an age to clear, and turns back to face his keeper. But Longstaff is right behind him, nicks the ball away, and is then bundled over by the City man from behind! Penalty all day long. 76 min: Rondon and Hayden combine crisply down the right. Hayden reaches the byline and whips hard and low into the six-yard box. Ederson does very well to claim. A palpable tension has now descended on St James\u2019. 75 min: With the box packed, the free kick\u2019s pulled back to Danilo, who shoots low and hard from the edge of the area. His shot can\u2019t get through the thicket of players, though, and after some pinball several City players are caught offside. 74 min: Jesus is almost immediately fouled by Ritchie out on the City right. A free kick near the corner flag, a very dangerous position. In the dugouts, Rafa screams at his defenders with great feeling. 73 min: City are desperate for the goal that\u2019ll keep the pressure on Liverpool at the top of the table. With this in mind, Jesus replaces Sane. 72 min: So to reiterate: it was Perez, not Schar, who got booked earlier. Best to make that clear because he\u2019s in the book now, the result of scything through David Silva. 71 min: Aguero chases Silva\u2019s pass down the inside-left channel but slips as he tries to move up through the gears. He screams in frustration. 69 min: Rondon, working hard at both ends, heads Sane\u2019s corner clear of danger. The atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park is bubbling now. 68 min: City have responded as you\u2019d imagine, pressing Newcastle back into their final third. Danilo whacks a cross into the mixer from the left, but Lascelles hooks clear from a packed box. Then Danilo comes again, and wins a corner off Yedlin. From which ... Ritchie crosses from the left. It\u2019s not much of a ball in, and it\u2019s headed clear by Fernandinho. But Hayden returns it immediately, and it drops to Rondon on the penalty spot. The big striker hooks brilliantly into the top left, Ederson flat footed, and Newcastle are level! 65 min: Perhaps wisely, City hook De Bruyne before he can get into more bother. Bernardo Silva comes on in his wake. 63 min: And now it\u2019s the already booked Perez\u2019s turn to escape further censure, as he first fouls De Bruyne, then whacks the ball away in disgust. The referee once again makes do with a word. Each player gets another chance. 61 min: De Bruyne comes in late on Ritchie, chasing a Fernandinho pass he\u2019s never going to get. He clatters into his man, having already been booked. He could easily be walking - it was a garden variety foul, but you\u2019ve seen folk booked for those. However the referee is perhaps mindful that the first yellow was a bit harsh, so gives him the benefit of the doubt. 60 min: Walker very nearly tears clear down the right but there\u2019s too much energy in the pass he\u2019s chasing, and that\u2019s a goal kick. 58 min: City continue to probe and press. A sharp pass from De Bruyne on the right finds Silva in the City area. Silva bashes a shot goalwards, and Dubravka does extremely well to parry. The ball breaks to Sane, to the left, but he can\u2019t get a shot away. Where\u2019s their second goal? It\u2019s been coming a long time. 56 min: Ah hold on, scrub that. The yellow\u2019s for Perez, who kicked the ball away after Schar committed the foul. Not a particularly obvious delivery of the card. Throw in the whistle business in the first half, and this referee needs to work on his theatrical flourishes. 54 min: Schar is booked for a clip on Silva\u2019s ankle. Clumsy rather than vicious. 53 min: City have come out with a view of putting this game quickly to bed. De Bruyne scoops a pass down the middle. It\u2019ll surely release Sterling! But Dubravka races from his area to improvise a spectacular clearing header. 52 min: Rondon tries to bustle his way through a couple of challenges down the inside-left channel. Not quite, but Newcastle\u2019s number nine is putting in a shift tonight. 50 min: Yedlin, deep on the right, launches a long diagonal pass down the middle of the park. For a second, it looks as though Atsu might latch onto it and race clear on goal, but the bounce isn\u2019t his friend and Ederson is able to step in and see off the danger. 49 min: Silva slips Sane into space down the left. Sane flashes a stunning ball through the six-yard box. Dubravka is out of position and out of the game, but Sterling can\u2019t connect, coming in at the far post. That was very close. 47 min: Sterling suddenly bursts down the right and whips a glorious cross into the area. Aguero was uncharacteristically on the back foot, and Lascelles is able to flick a header clear under no pressure. 46 min: City hog the ball in the opening exchanges of the second period. No super-fast goal this time, though. The home fans are nevertheless pretty subdued right now. A training-session feel right now. And we\u2019re off again! City get the ball rolling for the second half; there have been no changes at the break. Half-time reading. And some better news for beleaguered Toon fans ... There\u2019s just time for a scramble in the City area, instigated by Ritchie\u2019s poor cross from the left. Atsu can\u2019t control the ball from a shot, and there goes the half-time whistle. Newcastle will be relatively happy with 44 minutes and 36 seconds of that; just a shame about the first 24 seconds. Having said that, City haven\u2019t brought their A-game tonight, and could feasibly be three goals to the good. It\u2019s perfectly poised for the second half! 44 min: Space for Danilo down the left. He dinks a cross into the mixer. Dubravka flaps under pressure from Sane. Schar heads straight to Silva, who stoops and tries to guide a header into the unguarded net. But his effort is blocked by Schar, the Newcastle defender continuing his heroics. So close to a second goal that would surely have settled this match before the break! 42 min: City have played 320 passes so far to Newcastle\u2019s 77. That\u2019s pretty much as expected; the champions are in full control, despite being far from their very best. 41 min: Perez looks to have fully recovered. He goes tearing down the right, after a long pass that would have caught the out-of-position Ederson out. But thankfully for City, Laporte is on hand to step in between Perez and his keeper, intercept and calmly play away from danger. 39 min: Longstaff is robbed on the halfway line by De Bruyne, who feeds Aguero down the right and gets the ball back on the overlap. De Bruyne looks to cross for Aguero, who is free having peeled off into the box. But yet again Lascelles is on point, and his sliding tackle puts an end to City\u2019s move. 38 min: City ping it around the back with Perez down injured in the midfield. They think about launching an attack, but slow the game down to walking pace, allowing Perez to recover and get back up. A lovely sporting moment. 36 min: Sterling dribbles into the Newcastle box down the inside-right channel. He nearly fashions space for a shot, but again Lascelles is Newcastle\u2019s hero, sliding in to block for a corner that\u2019s wasted. 35 min: A lull. The crowd give it plenty about Mike Ashley. 34 min: Sterling is booked for a grab at Longstaff\u2019s shoulder, as the young man looks to break into some space in the middle of the park. 33 min: Sane turns on the jets, and for a second it looks as though he\u2019s going to sprint clear down the inside-left channel. But Lascelles sticks to him like glue, and does just enough to bundle him off the ball as the pair enter the Newcastle box, allowing Dubravka to gather. 32 min: Aguero continues to be a menace. First he has a shot from distance that rolls into Dubravka\u2019s arms. Then he nearly sets Sterling away down the right, but loses his balance while making the pass, which flies out of play. He\u2019s been magnificent so far, like that\u2019s breaking news. 30 min: Rondon is sent into a little space down the right, but he doesn\u2019t back himself in a footrace with Laporte, and he\u2019s got no pals up with him. He ends up being shepherded away from danger with ease. 29 min: ... Danilo, bombing in from the left, shins a shot many yards over the bar. 28 min: Up the other end, Sterling makes a nuisance of himself down the right to win another City corner. From which ... 26 min: A free kick for Newcastle out on the left, Sterling having shoved Ritchie in the back. Ritchie takes, and curls a nice one into the area. The ball breaks to Yedlin, on the edge of the area. His first-time volley is sliced high into the stand. 25 min: So it seems the referee clearly showed De Bruyne his whistle before that quick free kick that led to the non-goal. Just so you know. 23 min: Newcastle launch a rare sortie upfield. Rondon takes down a long ball on the edge of the City box, cushioning it for Atsu, whose first-time shot loops up off Stones and out for a corner. The set piece is no good, but that\u2019ll give Newcastle a little succour. They need it, as they\u2019ve been up against the ropes. 21 min: Aguero has another go, down the left this time. Nearly bursts through; not quite. He looks very lively indeed. 19 min: Aguero scuttles in from the right and very nearly powers his way through to goal. But Lejeune stands firm. Newcastle clear. City still look aggrieved to a man, and you can\u2019t really blame them. 18 min: De Bruyne takes it again, then. He hits it long, towards the far post, where Silva tries to force home but fails. Newcastle have got away with one there. 17 min: City are beyond livid, and not least because De Bruyne has been booked for disobeying the ref\u2019s instruction! That\u2019s added insult to injury. The free kick was so clever, and Aguero\u2019s finish so crisp. But City are punished, rather than rewarded, for their brilliance. 16 min: Aguero\u2019s goal has now been timed at 24 seconds, which makes it the fastest Premier League strike of the season. And for a second, it looks as though he\u2019s got another. Ritchie fouls Sterling out on the right. De Bruyne takes the free kick, curling it low down the inside-right channel, where Aguero has sprung clear of the Newcastle back line. Aguero whips the ball into the top right. Goal! But it isn\u2019t, because the ref had told De Bruyne to wait for the whistle, so they\u2019ll have to take the free kick again. 15 min: That\u2019s given Newcastle a little hope, and now Ritchie has a smash at goal from 25 yards. The shot\u2019s deflected harmlessly into the air and easily dealt with by the City defence. 13 min: And so having said that, Silva heads dangerously back towards Walker, who is robbed by Perez. Perez tears down the inside-right channel into space, enters the area, and fizzes a low shot across Ederson and wide of the left-hand post. Not sure the City keeper would have got that, had it been on target. 12 min: De Bruyne curls the set piece over everybody in the Newcastle area. The ball missed Laporte\u2019s noggin by inches. Newcastle are clinging on a bit here. 11 min: Schar bundles into the back of Aguero, out on the City left. A free kick in a very dangerous position. 9 min: Another corner for City, this time won by Sterling out on the right. This one\u2019s hit straight over the Newcastle area and causes no bother. A couple of wasted corners that prove this City team aren\u2019t perfect superhumans. Might prove. 7 min: Speaking of vision, that really was a sensational piece of improvisation by David Silva for the goal. He contorted his body while falling to guide a header back across goal towards Aguero. You could say it was lucky, maybe, if you were being uncharitable, but let\u2019s remember what Gary Player used to say about that. 6 min: Longstaff tries to get Newcastle going by spraying a pass down the right for Yedlin to chase. There\u2019s too much juice on the ball, but top marks for vision and ambition. 4 min: City win a corner down the left, and perhaps they feel sorry for Newcastle, because they needlessly over-elaborate and waste the set piece they\u2019ve earned. What a start, though! City are already breathing down Liverpool\u2019s neck at the top. 2 min: On the touchline, Rafa is incandescent, perhaps thinking Dubravka was fouled by Sane. Or maybe he thought Aguero was offside in the middle. But the goal stands, and rightly so. Newcastle launch it long at kick-off. City come straight back at them through Sterling down the right. Sterling stops on the edge of the box, and loops a cross to the far post. Dubravka is on walkabout. Silva slips while waiting for the cross, but gets a head on it anyway, knocking it back into the centre for Aguero, who can\u2019t miss from six yards! Before the match starts, there\u2019s a moment of silent reflection for Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, both lost off Guernsey last week. Perfectly observed. And then we\u2019re off. Newcastle get the ball rolling. Meanwhile in the stands, the Toon faithful wave cards in protest against Rio Ferdinand owner Mike Ashley. The teams are out! And both are looking very pretty in their first-choice duds. Newcastle wear those world-famous black-and-white stripes, while City sport their internationally renowned sky blue. It\u2019s a cracking atmosphere on a very bracing evening, and we\u2019ll be off just after local hero Mark Knopfler does his thing. And now Rafa talks! \u201cAlways the most difficult game is the next one. This is the next one, against a very good team. So we have to do everything right if we are to get something. And we are capable to do it. The reality is, when you see the stats, normally they have possession, so you have to get the ball from them. You have to defend, and when you get the ball do a good counter-attack. You have to defend with everyone, but you also have to attack with everyone.\u201d Bang bang. Here\u2019s a young man hoping his heroes shoot down Pep Guardiola this evening. The pair enjoy a daft laugh and that, with the lad at one point shrugging his shoulders, the internationally recognised sign for \u201cCome on, you don\u2019t really need the three points like we do, do you?\u201d Pep later speaks to BT Sport, and he\u2019s asked why he\u2019s made his five changes tonight. \u201cWhen you play one game a week, you can be stable. But we have not had one long week since November. Everybody\u2019s involved, and they know it, because the next game I am going to change players as well. If we achieve the title, then good, but if we don\u2019t, bad luck. But everybody is going to be important. We need the right mentality to win the games.\u201d Meanwhile there\u2019s some major breaking transfer news involving the Toon. A string of words rarely seen together during the Mike Ashley era there. Newcastle have agreed a deal for attacking midfielder Miguel Almir\u00f3n of Atlanta United and Paraguay ... and it looks likely to break the club-record transfer fee that\u2019s stood since they paid Airdrie \u00a36,500 for Hughie Gallacher in 1925 Real Madrid \u00a316.8m for Michael Owen in 2005. Newcastle won their last home Premier League fixture 3-0, so see no need to ring the changes. Rafa names the same team sent out to beat Cardiff ten days ago. For the record, it\u2019s seven changes to the team that lost here to Watford in the FA Cup at the weekend: out go Freddie Woodman, Ciaran Clark, Javi Manquillo, Jacob Murphy, Kenedy, Federico Fernandez and Joselu; in come Martin Dubravka, Fabian Schar, Florian Lejeune, Ayoze Perez, Christian Atsu, DeAndre Yedlin and Salomon Rondon. Manchester City make five changes to the side that thrashed Burnley in the FA Cup. Aymeric Laporte, David Silva, Raheem Sterling, Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane replace Nicolas Otamendi, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Yedlin, Schar, Lascelles, Lejeune, Ritchie, Perez, Hayden, Longstaff, Atsu, Rondon. Subs: Clark, Murphy, Kenedy, Fernandez, Manquillo, Roberts, Woodman. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Laporte, Danilo, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Silva, Sterling, Aguero, Sane. Subs: Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Mahrez, Otamendi, Gabriel Jesus, Foden, Muric. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire). Manchester City have scored 28 goals in their last six matches, you\u2019ll have heard that stat by now. They\u2019ve won eight games on the bounce, some reaction to those back-to-back defeats against Crystal Palace and Leicester City in December, a run that includes a title-race-reanimating victory over Liverpool. They\u2019ve only conceded one goal since the turn of the year. But here\u2019s the most relevant statistic of all: they\u2019ve emerged victorious from 16 of their last 18 matches against Newcastle United. This one looks like a shoo-in for the reigning champions. Yet in football, there\u2019s always hope for everyone. Newcastle may only have won two of their last 13 games, a sequence that\u2019s seen them plummet towards the bottom of the Premier League and say farewell to the FA Cup, all dreams of a first trophy in half a century extinguished. And those rare wins were only over fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town and Cardiff City. But they won their last league match at St James\u2019 Park, that spirit-replenishing 3-0 against the Bluebirds. Salomon Rondon, their vital number nine, is rested and refreshed. And they gave a pretty good account of themselves at the Etihad back in September, City requiring a Kyle Walker piledriver to squeak a win over lively opponents. It should also go without saying: on their day, any side drilled by Rafa Benitez can be a match for anyone. So yes, there is a little hope for the Toon tonight. Just not a lot: they\u2019ve lost all eight of their games against the top six this season, and are accordingly priced tonight at 16-1 for the win. City are hot favourites on a freezing night in the north-east. It\u2019s cold ... but it\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm.",

      "bodyText": "A mother died when she fell down the stairs of a New York City subway station while carrying her one-year-old baby in a stroller. Malaysia Goodson, 22, was found unresponsive on the platform at the 7th Ave station in Manhattan around 8pm on Monday, New York police said. The resident of Stamford, Connecticut, was taken to Mt Sinai West hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her daughter was not seriously hurt. She was found conscious and treated at the station, according to the NYPD. The tragedy was a nightmare scenario for many parents in New York, who are forced to carry strollers up and down subway stairs or rely on strangers for help. Only about a quarter of the city\u2019s 472 stations have elevators, making the rest inaccessible to people in wheelchairs and difficult to navigate for parents and older people. In a statement, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman, Shams Tarek, said: \u201cThis is an absolutely heartbreaking incident. While the ultimate cause of the event is being investigated by the MTA, medical examiner and the NYPD, we know how important it is to improve accessibility in our system.\u201d The city comptroller, Scott Stringer, said: \u201cAs a parent one of my biggest fears was navigating my kids\u2019 double stroller through our broken subway system. And it isn\u2019t uncommon because only 24% of stations have elevators. It\u2019s completely unacceptable. My heart goes out to [Goodson\u2019s] family.\u201d An audit by Stringer\u2019s office found that 80% of subway elevators and escalators did not get proper maintenance. Disability advocates have sued the Metropolitan Transit Authority, charging that they have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to install elevators and failed to maintain the ones that exist, leading to about 25 elevator outages a day. Goodson had come into the city to go shopping, her brother Dieshe Goodson told News 12 Connecticut. \u201cShe had a lot of bags and the baby in the stroller,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was on my way to the hospital last night, I was praying that it wasn\u2019t her the whole time. Please don\u2019t be my sister.\u201d The New York medical examiner was investigating to determine the cause of death, which happened at the station on the B, D and E lines. \u201cThis is a heartbreaking tragedy that never should have happened,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. \u201cThe subway system is not accessible for everyone and that\u2019s an environment the MTA should not allow.\u201d The president of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, a Briton, has pledged to improve accessibility as part of an ambitious plan to overhaul the ageing and delay-plagued subway system, aiming to create at least 50 accessible stations over five years, so that no rider is more than two stops away from one. But the system is in dire financial straits and the Fast Forward plan has not been funded. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has drawn criticism for a plan to renovate three dozen stations without adding elevators.",

      "bodyText": "Apple reported its first decline in revenues and profits in over a decade on Tuesday. Weak iPhone sales and a downturn in China reduced the tech company\u2019s revenue by 4.5% to $84.3bn in the three months ending 29 December compared with the same period last year. Profits fell slightly to $19.97bn. Revenues from China were $13.17bn during the quarter, a drop of nearly $5bn from a year ago. The results came three weeks after Apple shocked investors with its first profits warning since 2002. It has been a trying month for Apple. On 3 January Apple cut its sales forecasts for the key end of year period citing the \u201cmagnitude\u201d of the economic slowdown in China. It was the first profits warning Apple has made since it launched the iPhone, a product that propelled the company into the top tier of tech companies and briefly made it the most valuable company in history. The warning wiped $55bn (\u00a344bn) off the company\u2019s value, led to its shares being briefly suspended and rattled investors worldwide as analysts began to worry about how other companies might be hit by China\u2019s slowing growth. Apple\u2019s share price has since recovered but remains $266bn less than the record-breaking $1tn the company was valued at in August, the first company ever to be valued that high. The results also come a day after Apple scrambled to fix a glitch with iPhone\u2019s FaceTime, a video chat application, that allowed users to listen in on the people they were calling when they did not pick up the call. The company was forced to disable its Group FaceTime feature after it was revealed the bug allowed people to listen to the people they were calling before they answered their phone. Apple\u2019s share price rose over 6% in after hours trading following the release of its latest financials. The numbers were broadly in line with analysts\u2019 expectations and iPhone revenues were higher than expected. Leading Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that the worst may be over for Apple. The TF International Securities analyst expects shipments of iPhones to beat market expectations in the next quarter.",

Brighton welcome back Mat Ryan in goal, he hasn\u2019t featured since Boxing Day owing to his Asian Cup commitments with Australia. </p> <p>Interesting that Idrissa Gana Gueye is not in the squad for Everton at Huddersfield, the Senegalese handed in a transfer request earlier this week in an attempt to force through a move to PSG.

Tonight is the first Cardiff City match since the disappearance of Emiliano Sala, their Argentinian striker who boarded a flight from Nantes to Cardiff last Monday, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/28/neil-warnock-considered-retiring-cardiff-emiliano-sala-disappearance\">is still yet to be found</a>, along with the pilot David Ibbotson.</p> <p>Neil Warnock suggested yesterday that he had considered retiring and also suggested that the XI he selects for the trip to Arsenal will not be based upon his strongest side, but the one most mentally prepared to play a game of football. Some of the Cardiff players have received counselling. </p> <p>Sala\u2019s family have declined an invitation to attend the match at the Emirates, but they have asked that neither of the teams wear black armbands, with Emiliano of course still missing. The travelling Cardiff fans have prepared a banner for tonight, which reads. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We never saw you play and never saw you score.</p> <p>But Emiliano our beautiful bluebird we will love you forever more. </p> </blockquote> <p>As for Arsenal, they have also gone the extra mile, covering the away end in yellow placards and \u2013 without Cardiff being aware \u2013 including Sala\u2019s name on the back of the match programme, a gesture with which the Welsh club are thought to have deeply appreciated. A complementary daffodil is also being handed out to both home and away fans to show their support. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a301dcde76f6e5fd4ad0e44dddc1e59a7badf3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a301dcde76f6e5fd4ad0e44dddc1e59a7badf3d/0_0_2431_1458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The name of Emiliano Sala printed among the rest of the Cardiff City squad on the back of the Arsenal matchday programme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The name of Emiliano Sala printed among the rest of the Cardiff City squad on the back of the Arsenal matchday programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c31fb2b9d8792d665efe752a800e790c2e12ed9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c31fb2b9d8792d665efe752a800e790c2e12ed9e/0_108_4090_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting staff place yellow cards on the Cardiff supporters\u2019 seats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visiting staff place yellow cards on the Cardiff supporters\u2019 seats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fosker/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"297287ab0f9924f65be5505f2568f92094552c4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/297287ab0f9924f65be5505f2568f92094552c4a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardiff City fan sporting a daffodil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardiff City fan sporting a daffodil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4491dca62e73128bbbf2a8f02ea464217f4fc2d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4491dca62e73128bbbf2a8f02ea464217f4fc2d7/0_121_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cardiff city fan sporting a daffodil in support of missing Cardiff player Emiliano Sala.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cardiff city fan adds a daffodil to a flag in support of their missing player Emiliano Sala.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More emotional scenes up at Old Trafford tonight, with Manchester United honouring the 61st anniversary of the Munich disaster.

      "bodyText": "Big results near the top and bottom of the Premier League, with Manchester City suffering a potentially fatal defeat, Newcastle five points clear of the drop zone, and Fulham coming back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 against Brighton. Liverpool can pull seven points clear at the top with a win over Leicester tomorrow \u2013 they are now 4/11 to win the title. It would take an almighty slip to blow this one. Thanks for joining me this evening, for your emails, for your tweets. Get all your Premier League reports and analysis here, and tune into the Guardian tomorrow for more. See ya! Some other results to tell you about: Bolton scored a 92nd-minute equaliser to deny Reading a huge win at the foot of the Championship. The other game in the second tier was just strange. The scores were level at 1-1 between Swansea and Birmingham when the Blues went down to 10 men. Swansea then scored after the hour mark, but two goals in five minutes (against the run of play) saw Birmingham into a 3-2 lead before Oli McBurnie scored his 15th goal of the season in injury time to level the scores once more at 3-3. A massive 3-2 win for Luton against Portsmouth as first met second in League One. Another ding-dong battle in which Pompey twice pegged Luton back before George Moncur, son of John, scored the winner. Read David Hytner\u2019s match report. Read Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report. Read Louise Taylor\u2019s match report. Read Paul Wilson\u2019s match report. Read Ben Fisher\u2019s match report. Read Amy Lawrence\u2019s match report. Manchester City have been beaten at Newcastle. Join Scott Murray for the latest reaction. Liverpool can go seven points clear with a win tomorrow at home to Leicester. What a game. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s winning run is over but he\u2019s still unbeaten. I can\u2019t work out if that\u2019s a good or bad result for either Manchester United or Burnley. 90+4 min: Solskj\u00e6r looks remarkably calm on the sidelines, as the home crowd roar Manchester United forward again. Let\u2019s just say Sean Dyche doesn\u2019t look as serene. A late, late equaliser! Young crosses to the back post, United have men over. Heaton makes a remarkable save from Sanchez\u2019s header, but Lindelof is there to turn the ball in from a tight angle. Heaton did actually get a hand to the rebound but it squirmed into the side-netting. Old Trafford erupts and Manchester United again sprint back to the half-way line. They want a winner! 90+1 min: Burnley are absolutely camped on the edge of their own are. Pogba works some space with a bit of skill away from Cork and fires a powerful strike at goal. Heaton makes a good save, palming it away. As another cross comes in, Heaton gets up well to catch it cleanly. Great goalkeeping. 90 min: Five minutes added on at Old Trafford. Fergie Time. The Frenchman sticks it right into the top left corner. Cracking penalty. Pogba grabs the ball and sprints back to the half-way line. Can Burnley hold on? 86 min: A clear tug from Hendrick on Lingard. Pogba steps up with that unmistakeable run-up \u2026 Arsenal 2-1 Cardiff Fulham 4-2 Brighton Huddersfield 0-1 Everton Wolves 3-0 West Ham Some big goals in the second half, there. Wood glances home a brilliant header from Westwood\u2019s cross. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s winning run looks set to come to an end! Manchester City are losing at Newcastle. Huge goal in the title race. Get the latest with Scott Murray. Mendez gets one back, but it look like it\u2019s going to be too late for the Welsh side. And that\u2019s that. This has been an absolutely terrible performance from West Ham, I think they\u2019ve had two shots all game. Jiminez finishes off a wonderful counter-attacking move from Wolves after Obiang has hit pocket picked in the centre circle. Wolves are two on one going forward, Jota squares it to Jiminez and the Mexican dinks it over Fabianski. 85 min: Fulham hit the bar again! Cairney turns inside and curls a brilliant effort on the top of the bar. Ryan was motionless. 83 min: Sublime save from Pickford, who dives to his right to palm away Kachunga\u2019s header. \u201cEngland No1\u201d chant the travelling Everton fans. Huddersfield still 1-0 down against the 10 men but pressing for an equaliser. Some pretty poor defending from Cardiff as Lacazette waltzes into the box, gets a low shot off. Etheridge gets a foot to it, but can\u2019t stop it from squeezing inside the post. That should be the game for Arsenal! Four goals for Fulham in this second half. What a comeback! Cairney hits the bar, the ball falls to Babel, who can\u2019t get it under control, but Vietto stabs it in to give Fulham some breathing space. Surely even they can\u2019t blow this lead from here. Another set piece, another goal for Wolves. It\u2019s nothing less than they deserve. West Ham have been torrid, and Hammers co-chairman David Sullivan looks absolutely miserable in the stands. 77 min: Arnautovic is subbed off injured, so Fabianski is going to have to soldier on in goal for West Ham. Two-nil down at half-time, Fulham now lead! What a game. It\u2019s Mitrovic again, nodding a Bryan cross past Ryan. 60 min: Solskj\u00e6r has hooked Pereira for Lingard as Manchester United try to get back into the game. The Brazilian looks absolutely crestfallen as he plods towards the bench. Burnley still 1-0 up at Old Trafford. 70 min: Jota is absolutely furious that Wolves haven\u2019t been awarded a penalty for a tackle by Zabaleta. It\u2019s a close call. Zabaleta certainly made contact but then won the ball. If that was lucky for West Ham, Arnautovic has an ankle problem and Fabianski has also gone down in a heap after a 50/50 challenge with Doherty. The Hammers have already made two changes. 67 min: Digne has only just come on for Baines, remember. The former Barcelona is sent off for bringing down Diakhaby as he ran through one-on-one. Huddersfield still 1-0 down but right back in this. This goal is all Andreas Pereira\u2019s fault. The Brazilian loses the ball on the edge of his own area. Burnley swarm on him with a high press, Cork nicks the ball, feeds Barnes and the forward makes no mistake, smashing the ball high into the roof of the match. Kolasinac goes down in the area under the challenge of Manga and Aubameyang makes no mistake from 12 yards. A big goal for Arsenal, who have looked very pedestrian this evening. Fulham are level! A remarkable turnaround at Craven Cottage! It\u2019s a bouncing ball in Brighton\u2019s box, nobody takes the initiative, including Ryan in goal, and Mitrovic simply rises above three Brighton players and nods the ball into the net. Calamitous defending. You\u2019d back Fulham to win it from here. 56 min: Saiss is the latest to go close for Wolves! West Ham are really hanging on, they have offered nothing going forward, and Fabianski does really well to get down to his right to deny Wolves\u2019 Moroccan midfielder. 54 min: Fulham are really going for it now. They are leaving gaps at the back, and are open to the counter-attack, but have thrown bodies forward, and brought Vietto on from the bench. A few changes to tell you about. Alex Iwobi has come on for Arsenal, replacing Elneny, who was fairly dreadful in the first half. Meanwhile, at Huddersfield, Aaron Mooy has come on for the home side. Huge cheers for the Australian, who is back after the Asian Cup. He\u2019s been sorely missed. Leighton Baines has gone off injured for Everton, with Digne coming on. Fulham are back in it! Chambers gets his first goal for Fulham, volleying a sensational shot into the top corner. That has really livened up the crowd, and two minutes later Mitrovic is denied an equaliser by a brilliant Duffy challenge. The 7.45pm games are back underway for the second half. Half-time at Old Trafford: Manchester United 0-0 Burnley. Staying on the continent, new \u00a331m Krzysztof Piatek has scored two on his Milan debut against Napoli in the Coppa Italia. Wowee. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m watching Monaco v Guincamp, but fortunately K\u00e1ri Tulinius is, and he\u2019s emailed in. \u201cI switched over to the French league cup semifinal between Guincamp and Monaco as it started and haven\u2019t been disappointed. So far, with thirty minutes played the following has happened, William Vainqueur was shown a straight red for a horrendous tackle on his Monaco debut, Rony Lopes scored a bicycle kick for Monaco, there was a hailstorm, and Golovin added another for Monaco, his first for the club.\u201d Half-time at Swansea, who are drawing 1-1 with 10-man Birmingham, while it\u2019s goalless between probably the league\u2019s poorest two teams: Bolton and Reading. That last one is a 8pm KO. 38 min: Manchester United are starting to turn the screw now. Paul Pogba has the ball in the Burnley net after flicking a cross past Heaton, but he is correctly flagged offside. Burnley are slightly hanging on here, but credit to Tarkowski and Mee at the heart of their defence, they have both been excellent. 35 min: Great save from Tom Heaton to deny Lukaku! The Belgian was actually penalised for a foul before shooting, but the Burnley keeper wasn\u2019t to know that, and he got down superbly well to palm Lukaku\u2019s effort over the bar. Heaton has made a real difference for Burnley\u2019s defensive organisation since replacing Joe Hart between the sticks. Here\u2019s today\u2019s Fiver, featuring Alvaro Morata, David Squires and a headbutt (not between Morata and Squires). Arsenal 0-0 Cardiff Fulham 0-2 Brighton Huddersfield 0-1 Everton Wolves 0-0 West Ham It\u2019s also Manchester United 0-0 Burnley. That one has about 12 minutes left, it being an 8pm kick-off. 43 min: Arsenal have had the lions share of possession but it\u2019s Cardiff that have had the better chances. Bobby Reid has been particularly wasteful, despite some good link up play from the former Bristol City man. Ozil has been very quiet. 41 min: Brighton hit the bar. So nearly a third for the visitors, with Propper smashing the ball against the crossbar from range. The Dutchman hasn\u2019t scored in 61 games for the Seagulls. 24 min: Manchester United not looking particularly inspired against Burnley, who look fairly comfortable at Old Trafford. Solskj\u00e6r out. 37 min: Fulham so nearly get themselves into the game, but a miraculous goal-line clearance from Duffy maintain\u2019s Brighton\u2019s 2-0 lead. Babel delivers a worldie cross to the back post, where Schurrle is unmarked, and the German volleys a first-time shot towards the far corner, but Duffy somehow diverts the ball over his own bar. 35 min: Wolves should be about 3-0 up at home to West Ham, but somehow it\u2019s still goalless. Jonny planted a header from a glorious Jiminez cross inches wide of Fabianski\u2019s left-hand post a few minutes ago, and then the home side see a goal chalked off for offside. Jiminez flicked an effort onto the bar, and Dendoncker\u2019s header on the follow up is ruled out. West Ham on the ropes. 32 min: I don\u2019t think Jordan Pickford has touched the ball for Everton at Huddersfield. It\u2019s hard to see how they are going to get back into this. Still 1-0 down. 28 min: It\u2019s snowing at both the games in London. The fans at Arsenal v Cardiff and Fulham v Brighton are getting absolutely drenched. 16 min: Phil Jones gets Man Utd out of jail, cleaning up a defensive mix-up and making a good tackle on Ashley Barnes, who looked like he was going to sweep Burnley into a lead at Old Trafford. 26 min: Wolves have been denied a clear penalty at Molineux. Doherty felled by Masuaku. I genuinely have no idea how that hasn\u2019t been given. 24 min: \u201cIf Unai Emery starts his pressconferences \u2019Good morning\u2019/\u2018Good afternoon\u2019/\u2018Good evening\u2019, doesn\u2019t that make him Truman Burbank? And if so, are we all actors and extras in Seahaven? I\u2019m somewhat troubled by this. Regards, Johan in Sweden.\u201d 22 min: Dale Stephens is a lucky boy at Fulham. The Brighton man could have easily have seen red for a studs-up challenge on Schurrle, but Lee Probert just dishes out the yellow card. 9 min: Rashford misses a sitter for Manchester United! Lukaku does brilliantly well to hold the ball up on a classic United counter-attack, he draws two defenders and slips Rashford through on goal \u2026 the England man takes a touch and then toe-punts it 10 yards wide from the penalty spot. Should have scored! 18 min: Penalty shouts at both ends of the pitch at Arsenal v Cardiff. First Niasse goes down under a trip from Monreal and a shove from Kolasinac. It\u2019s a definite foul, but Mike Dean waves play on in his inimitable style. Next, Lacazette is tripped by Bamba. It looks innocuous but very clumsy form the Ivorian, who is lucky that Lacazette stays on his feet. Fulham look doomed don\u2019t they. March delivers a cross into the box, Fulham fail to clear before Propper loops a hopeful ball towards the back post, where Murray prods in from close range. Awful defending. The 8pm games have kicked off. Less than one minute played at Newcastle v Man City and Sergio Aguero has already scored. You can join Scott Murray here. 14 min: Gareth Southgate is at Molineux tonight for Wolves v West Ham. Wolves are looking like a threat on the counter-attack. Coady is down receiving some treatment, but looks like he\u2019s going to be OK to continue. 12 min: And just as I say that, Cardiff have a golden chance to take the lead. Bobby Reid, one of the players featuring in our Flop XI earlier today, squanders a chance. He\u2019s got just two goals in 19 appearances. 10 min: Cardiff are all over the place at the Emirates. They are trying to change their shape, with Gunnarsson furiously gesturing to Warnock on the sidelines. Nobody seems to know what is going on. After bottom club Huddersfield conceded early on, 19th-placed Fulham do the very same. Glenn Murray pouncing on an excellent cross from Montoya. The worst possible start for new Huddersfield manager Jan Siewert. Tom Davies crosses into the box, Richarlison is all alone six yards out. Lossl made a fine save but Richarlison was there to follow up. Not related to tonight\u2019s games, but this skill from Jadon Sancho is like something made up in a Nike advert. Woof. Lovely stuff. More team news for our 8pm kick-off. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r makes five changes from the FA Cup win over Arsenal. Tony Martial got a little knock in training yesterday so he doesn\u2019t make the squad. Manchester United: De Gea; Young, Lindelof, Jones, Shaw; Matic, Andreas Pereira, Pogba, Mata, Rashford, Lukaku. Subs: Romero, Dalot, Smalling, Fred, Herrera, Lingard, Alexis. Burnley: Heaton, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Barnes, Wood. Subs: Gudmundsson, Vokes, Gibson, Hart, Ward, Vydra, Benson. Referee: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire) I absolutely love the way that Unai Emery starts every press conference with \u2018Good morning\u2019/\u2018Good afternoon\u2019/\u2018Good evening\u2019. Some big inclusions to highlight. Mesut Ozil starts, and is Arsenal captain for the evening \u2013 a little bit by default, mind. Remember he was one of five players named by Emery at the start of the season that would take the armband this season and the others \u2013 Koscielny, Cech, Ramsey and Xhaka \u2013 are not in the starting XI. Ryan Babel makes his second start for Fulham, Ryan Sessegnon is left out with Aleksander Mitrovic is made captain for the Whites. Brighton welcome back Mat Ryan in goal, he hasn\u2019t featured since Boxing Day owing to his Asian Cup commitments with Australia. Interesting that Idrissa Gana Gueye is not in the squad for Everton at Huddersfield, the Senegalese handed in a transfer request earlier this week in an attempt to force through a move to PSG. With the French side signing Leandro Paredes for \u00a334m today, it will be interesting to see if they are still keen on Gueye. Another notable inclusion is Leighton Baines, who captains Everton tonight, the 34-year-old\u2019s first league start since August. Wolves are pretty much as expected, but West Ham name Marko Arnautovic up top. It will be intriguing to see how the Hammers bounce back from their FA Cup exit at AFC Wimbledon. Arsenal v Cardiff Arsenal: Leno, Lichtsteiner, Mustafi, Monreal, Kolasinac, Torreira, Elneny, Guendouzi, Ozil, Lacazette, Aubameyang. Subs: Cech, Ramsey, Iwobi, Jenkinson, Mavropanos, Xhaka, Nketiah. Cardiff: Etheridge, Peltier, Ecuele Manga, Bamba, Bennett, Gunnarsson, Paterson, Arter, Ralls, Reid, Niasse. Subs: Zohore, Smithies, Cunningham, Mendez-Laing, Harris, Healey, Hoilett.

Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire) Arsenal have also released a statement in which they confirmed both captains tonight will lay flowers before kick-off. Hello, and welcome to a bonus Tuesday edition of Football. Six Premier League games will take place tonight, five of which will be covered in this clockwatch \u2026 Arsenal v Cardiff (7.45pm GMT) Fulham v Brighton (7.45pm) Huddersfield v Everton (7.45pm) Wolves v West Ham (7.45pm) Manchester United v Burnley (8pm) \u2026 with Scott Murray overseeing Newcastle v Manchester City in this MBM. Some cracking games of football then, at both ends of the table, but two games in particular are taking on a greater significance. Tonight is the first Cardiff City match since the disappearance of Emiliano Sala, their Argentinian striker who boarded a flight from Nantes to Cardiff last Monday, and is still yet to be found, along with the pilot David Ibbotson. Neil Warnock suggested yesterday that he had considered retiring and also suggested that the XI he selects for the trip to Arsenal will not be based upon his strongest side, but the one most mentally prepared to play a game of football. Some of the Cardiff players have received counselling. Sala\u2019s family have declined an invitation to attend the match at the Emirates, but they have asked that neither of the teams wear black armbands, with Emiliano of course still missing. The travelling Cardiff fans have prepared a banner for tonight, which reads. We never saw you play and never saw you score. But Emiliano our beautiful bluebird we will love you forever more. As for Arsenal, they have also gone the extra mile, covering the away end in yellow placards and \u2013 without Cardiff being aware \u2013 including Sala\u2019s name on the back of the match programme, a gesture with which the Welsh club are thought to have deeply appreciated. A complementary daffodil is also being handed out to both home and away fans to show their support. More emotional scenes up at Old Trafford tonight, with Manchester United honouring the 61st anniversary of the Munich disaster. There will be a ceremony at the memorial outside the stadium and a wreath will be laid before kick-off, while a giant banner showing the Busby Babes side lining up for their final match before the tragedy will be passed across the Stretford End as tonight\u2019s teams take to the field. So, quite a night in store. Wrap up.",

Arnautovic headed down the tunnel, seconds before a busy Lukasz Fabianski collided with Matt Doherty, who caught the West Ham goalkeeper attempting to turn home Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s cross. Fabianski continued but Wolves, who thoroughly outclassed a listless West Ham, deservedly added to their tally, with Jim\u00e9nez striking home another Moutinho corner before his deft chip over Fabianski sealed victory four minutes from time. As West Ham restarted, the home faithful made it clear to the Wolves hierarchy they would also like Jim\u00e9nez, on loan from Benfica, to stick around. \u201cThese decisions will be made when they have to be made,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cRaul is doing a fantastic job, which goes beyond the goals he scores. The way he plays, his combinations, the way he works, he doesn\u2019t stop he is always giving us our first reaction to losing the ball. But he has to keep on going.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fourteen Labour MPs voted with Theresa May\u2019s government to prevent parliament from taking steps to prevent a no-deal Brexit by extending the article 50 negotiating period in order to agree an alternative deal with the EU. The former minister Caroline Flint and Laura Smith, the MP for Crewe and Nantwich, joined with the veteran Eurosceptics Kate Hoey, Graham Stringer and Dennis Skinner in voting down Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment by 321 votes to 298. Their votes helped cancel out those of 17 Conservative rebels who voted for Cooper\u2019s amendment, which Labour\u2019s frontbench had decided it would support earlier in the day to \u201creduce the threat of the chaos of a no deal\u201d. A sizeable Labour rebellion had been expected for several days, despite the efforts of Cooper to calm concerned MPs in her party by telling the Commons it only gave parliament the right to vote on whether to extend article 50 if time ran out. But she failed to persuade the doubters who defied the party whip, and whose numbers were noticeably larger than the half dozen or so Labour MPs who previously voted with the government before on key Brexit votes. Reacting to the result, Jeremy Corbyn chose to focus on the success of another no-deal amendment, in the name of the Conservative backbencher Dame Caroline Spelman, which was carried by 318 votes to 310. The Labour leader said he would meet May, having refused to do so for a fortnight, because \u201cparliament has voted to remove the immediate threat of crashing out without a deal on 29 March\u201d. The Spelman amendment, which was also supported by Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey, invited MPs to reject the UK leaving the EU without agreeing a deal, but is not legally binding on the government. The Cooper amendment was intended to create parliamentary time for MPs to legislate to prevent no deal. Other Labour MPs who voted with the government to vote down the Cooper amendment included Ian Austin, Sir Kevin Barron, Ronnie Campbell, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Roger Godsiff, Stephen Hepburn, John Mann and Gareth Snell. After the vote, Cooper said: \u201c[The] Commons has voted tonight against no deal, though there was not the support this evening for a legislative safeguard. I\u2019m still very worried that [the] PM does not have a workable plan to prevent a cliff edge at the end of March.\u201d Seven Labour MPs \u2013 all well established rebels against the party whip on Brexit \u2013 also voted in favour of Sir Graham Brady\u2019s amendment, which called on the government to find alternative arrangements to replace the Irish backstop. They were Austin, Barron, Fitzpatrick, Godsiff, Hoey, Mann and Stringer. Downing Street is expected to concentrate attention on the group of Labour MPs, because they may be needed to help May get any final Brexit deal approved, if she can woo them with extra undertakings on workers rights. May repeatedly signalled her intentions in the Commons debate, telling the Labour MP Melanie Onn: \u201cWe are looking at ways in which we can give that assurance in relation to workers\u2019 rights.\u201d Downing Street still wants the support of Labour members because few believe it will be possible to eliminate the Conservative rebels, even if May were to succeed in removing the Irish backstop in last-ditch negotiations with the EU. Labour had tried to ease the concerns of those worried about the Cooper amendment by saying it wanted to shorten the nine-month extension to the article 50 negotiating period to three months to avoid accusations it wanted to permanently delay Brexit. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Labour wanted ideally to reduce the extension period to \u201csomething around\u201d three months because the party was anxious \u201cnot to be seen in any way to be kicking the can down the road\u201d. The senior Labour MP said while the party wanted to be \u201cflexible about the timescale in which we can achieve an alternative [Brexit deal]\u201d, it wanted an extension to be as short as possible. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet met on Tuesday morning to discuss tactics before the Brexit debate in which MPs voted on a range of amendments selected by the Speaker at lunchtime. A party source said the Cooper bill \u201ccould give MPs a temporary window to agree a deal that can bring the country together\u201d. The backing of Labour\u2019s frontbench for Cooper\u2019s amendment had not been certain after Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minster, said on Monday voters in his constituency would regard support for the measure as a failure to respect the result of the 2016 referendum. Trickett said he felt \u201cit may look to people as if we\u2019re trying to somehow remove the earlier decision, which was to Brexit\u201d, by voting for an amendment intended to extend article 50.",

Within minutes of the Commons backing the prime minister\u2019s plan to replace the Irish backstop, a spokesman for the European council\u2019s president insisted Tusk would not permit any changes to the deal already agreed with Downing Street. Tusk, the EU\u2019s most senior official, instead urged the prime minister to explain her next steps, claiming the agreement negotiated over the last 20 months \u201cremains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union\u201d. The spokesman added: \u201cThe backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\u201d In an apparent sign that the EU now fears that the impasse in the Brexit talks is unlikely to be broken within the coming weeks, Tusk\u2019s spokesman said Brussels was open to a delay to Brexit beyond 29 March. An amendment backed by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper ordering the government to ask for an extension was defeated on Tuesday evening but the Commons is set to vote again in mid-February. \u201cShould there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU27 would stand ready to consider it and decide by unanimity\u201d, the spokesman said. \u201cThe EU27 will adopt this decision, taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension, as well as the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. We will also continue the EU\u2019s process of ratification of the agreement reached with the UK government. President Tusk will stay in close contact with EU27 leaders.\u201d Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, said in response to the result that the EU needed to \u201chold our nerve\u201d. MPs were corralled by the prime minister on Tuesday to back a proposal under which the Commons would commit to supporting the withdrawal agreement should the Irish backstop contained within it be replaced. But even as the prime minister had called on MPs to send a message to Brussels, Macron had insisted that such a rallying cry would be fruitless. Speaking in Cyprus, the French president said the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, \u201cis the best accord possible. It is not renegotiable\u201d. He added that a no-deal scenario was one that \u201cno one wants but we should all prepare for\u201d. During a phone call with the prime minister on Tuesday afternoon before the vote, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had already warned May that the EU would not budge on its refusal to renegotiate. Under the terms of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, the whole of the UK would stay in a customs union until an alternative arrangement, such as a comprehensive trade deal or technological solution, ensured the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Brexiters fear being stuck in a customs union would kill off their hopes of the UK furthering an independent trade policy. Tory MPs have variously made calls for the backstop to be removed from the Brexit deal or for a unilateral exit mechanism or time limit on such an arrangement to be inserted. May told MPs that supporting the Brady amendment would show the EU that there needed to be \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201clegally binding\u201d changes to the Irish backstop to reassure MPs the UK would not be trapped within it. She said this would involve opening up the withdrawal agreement rather than merely securing \u201can exchange of letters\u201d with the EU\u2019s leaders offering reassurances, a gambit that failed before the last vote on the deal, which was lost by a historic 230 votes. But EU officials and diplomats said the Brady amendment was too vague for the EU\u2019s heads of state of government to be confident that one particular course of action would receive the full support of parliament for a deal. The slim result in favour of the amendment \u2013 by 16 votes \u2013 underlined to the EU that there could be no certainty that changes to the backstop would result in the withdrawal agreement being passed by the Commons given the various shades of views on how radical the changes would need to be. A senior EU official outlined the limits to how far Brussels could go. \u201cWe will not reopen the withdrawal agreement\u201d, the official said. \u201cSo it may be about semantics of what \u2018reopening\u2019 means.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve disturbed several pristine peacocks hibernating in my log pile in this deep midwinter, but butterflies that endure winter in their adult form are a minority. We may see species including the brimstone, red admiral, small tortoiseshell and comma on a sunny winter\u2019s day. Most British butterflies tackle winter as caterpillars, superbly camouflaged on bare branches (purple emperor), encased in elegant hibernacula (winter quarters) of withered leaves (white admiral) or even submerged in bogs (swallowtail). The most adventurous of our 59 native species is currently found in the African tropics. The painted lady chooses migration over hibernation. Scientists last year proved this butterfly crosses 1,250 miles (2,000km) of Saharan desert during its annual life cycle, by analysing chemicals found in butterfly wings to discover where individuals grew up as caterpillars. Congolese painted ladies, the offspring of butterflies that flew south last autumn, are now heading north over the Sahara. The children of these Mediterranean spring arrivals will make their way on to Britain in May. In this way, the painted lady can travel 7,500 miles over several generations, perpetually globetrotting to avoid the extremes of hot summers and icy winters.",

      "body": "<p>What had been looking like the toughest selection of Eddie Jones\u2019s three-year England tenure has once again been hijacked by events. The unavailability of Ben Te\u2019o for the opening Six Nations Test has not merely blown a sizeable hole in the coach\u2019s midfield strategy but dispelled any notion that, at last, England have uncovered the secret of keeping their best players fit.</p> <p>With Brad Shields and Joe Cokanasiga also unavailable to feature, the first England team announcement of the calendar year on Thursday is no longer quite as hard to predict as it might have been. That said, Jones still has some major calls to make, not just in the context of the championship but the World Cup as well. While Manu Tuilagi may finally be back, does anyone know for certain what Jones\u2019s best combination look like?</p> <p>The time for fudging certain problems has long gone and, assuming England wish to go big in Japan, the Ireland game in Dublin on Saturday offers Jones one of his last serious opportunities to resolve them. Ireland have become formidable opponents at home and escaping Joe Schmidt\u2019s tactical vice on the opening Six Nations weekend would be the biggest achievement of Jones\u2019s rollercoaster tenure to date.</p> <p>So which way to proceed? In certain positions Jones\u2019s best men virtually pick themselves. Both Vunipolas and a refreshed Maro Itoje, for example, are fit and ready to add legitimate punch. With Sam Underhill injured, Tom Curry has to start on the openside. Ditto Jamie George at hooker with Dylan Hartley still nursing his grumbly knee. More tricky, in light of Te\u2019o\u2019s misfortune, is where to deploy Owen Farrell, who may have to wear his captain\u2019s armband on the sleeve of the No 12 jersey.</p> <p>George Ford is a more than capable fly-half but, with so much riding on the Dublin match, this was a game seemingly made for Farrell at 10. The spine of a team is always crucial, as Ireland have been demonstrating repeatedly. From Rory Best through James Ryan, Conor Murray, Johnny Sexton and Rob Kearney there were absolutely no weak links in 2018. George, Itoje and Billy Vunipola offer a similar sense of security and Jones would love this Six Nations to remove any lingering uncertainty about his best options in the equally pivotal positions of 9, 10 and 15.</p> <p>At scrum-half, for instance, Ben Youngs has not always looked himself at Leicester this season, for whatever reason. Danny Care and Richard Wigglesworth are not involved at all. Quite why Wasps\u2019 Dan Robson is still waiting to make his Test debut is a mystery but asking him to start this particular fixture, opposite the classy Murray, would be a seriously tall order. It makes more sense to ask Youngs to restate an unanswerable claim with Robson, for now, on the bench.</p> <p>Further down the backline, things start to become devilishly complicated. Much of it hinges on Jones\u2019s decision at full\u2011back. A recall for Mike Brown to help defuse Ireland\u2019s aerial threat appears increasingly on the cards but if Elliot Daly shifts to the wing that means omitting either the in-form Chris Ashton or Jack Nowell from the 23.</p> <p>Ultimately it boils down to precisely what Jones has in mind for Japan. Come the World Cup, Cokanasiga and Watson will also be in the back-three mix, with Jonathan Joseph also around to compete for the outside\u2011centre berth. If Jones still regards Daly as his World Cup full-back it hardly makes sense to reinstate Brown now. And is playing Daly on the wing ahead of Ashton and Nowell really the best use of the Wasps man\u2019s considerable talent?</p> <p>Given his side\u2019s distinctly moderate record in Dublin and with the try-scoring threat of Jacob Stockdale further complicating the equation, a starting back three of Nowell, Brown and May would be the most defensively solid option, with Ashton, Daly and Jonny May a more freewheeling alternative. A possible compromise would be Daly (whose long-range goalkicking would also be useful), Brown and May with Tuilagi and Slade forming a midfield duo that, but for injury, would have been trialled long ago. Could that combination unsettle Ireland? Given enough ball and some forward momentum, it just might.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a7d12480b902f23c69ba2752d923f2a7252fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a7d12480b902f23c69ba2752d923f2a7252fdd/0_169_4980_2989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maro Itoje (left) will be available for Saturday\u2019s showdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maro Itoje (left) will be available for Saturday\u2019s showdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be seen by some as a bit of a risk but Jones already knows what the Ford\u2011Farrell axis can offer and retaining Slade as an extra tactical kicking option against Ireland also makes sense.

That was referencing a 2010 statement from a UN official, who was discussing the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). An accompanying graphic used colours of the flag of the Republic of Congo to highlight its age of consent, 18. The graphic should have highlighted the age of consent in the DRC, which is 18 for males and 14 for females (Is the age of consent too low?, 16 January, page 4, G2). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: The Guardian view on Israel\u2019s democracy: killing with impunity, lying without consequence?

      "bodyText": "The twin criminal indictments against Huawei unveiled by US authorities on Monday are packed with emails and financial transactions allegedly showing how the Chinese technology giant carried out criminal conspiracies. But the finer points of the 23 charges are less important than the overall shot they deliver across China\u2019s bows. The US considers Huawei to be an arm of the Chinese state \u2013 and their devices to be potential spying equipment for Beijing. Charges that Huawei illegally violated US sanctions on Iran hold the most symbolic significance. They allowed Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, to stress the company\u2019s activities had been \u201cdetrimental to the security of the United States\u201d. But many US officials and analysts also see the prosecutions as proxies for America\u2019s response to other Chinese threats \u2013 against US cybersecurity and economic pre-eminence. As the race to dominate the world\u2019s next-generation 5G networks intensifies, the Trump administration is seeking to stop Huawei equipment making its way into the communications infrastructure \u2013 and to give its American competitors a leg-up. Earlier this month, Huawei\u2019s reclusive founder, Ren Zhengfei, broke years of silence to say the company has never engaged in espionage on behalf of Beijing. Eastern district of New York (Brooklyn) The 13 charges against Huawei in Brooklyn allege an elaborate fraud to get around US sanctions on Iran. The US says that in 2007, Huawei pretended to sell its Iran subsidiary, Skycom, but actually just transferred it to another branch of Huawei. Conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u2013 two counts IEEPA violations \u2013 two counts Money-laundering conspiracy Huawei is accused of running a scheme to violate American sanctions on Iran in two separate ways. Prosecutors say the company broke US sanctions by using American banks for operations in Iran without the special permission this would require. It also provided telecommunications services to Iran, the indictment says. In January 2013, Reuters reported Skycom sold embargoed Hewlett-Packard equipment to Iran\u2019s biggest phone company. Prosecutors say that by moving funds in and out of the US to carry out this sanctions-busting conspiracy, Huawei was also money laundering. Conspiracy to defraud the US It is a crime to use deception to intentionally impede the operations of a US government agency. Prosecutors allege that in addition to lying to their bankers in the US, senior Huawei executives lied to FBI investigators and Congress about the company\u2019s activities relating to Iran. This, the indictment says, amounted to a conspiracy to obstruct the operations of the US treasury\u2019s office of foreign assets control, which oversees economic sanctions against Iran. Conspiracy to commit bank fraud \u2013 two counts Bank fraud x two Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, are accused of devising a scheme to defraud two banks in the US \u2013 and carrying it out. Prosecutors said the firm promised not to use the banks to process transactions related to Iran, which would violate US sanctions. In fact, the indictment says, it ran more than $100m of Iranian-related transactions through one bank in 2010-14. Even after media reports said Huawei still owned Skycom, prosecutors say, Meng delivered a bogus PowerPoint presentation to one bank, claiming Skycom was merely a trading partner. After this bank ended their relationship in 2017, Huawei allegedly moved to another bank in the US by making similar false claims on Iran. Conspiracy to commit wire fraud Wire fraud Prosecutors allege Huawei and Meng used wire communications \u2013 telephone calls, emails and other electronic messages \u2013 as part of their fraud conspiracy. This is a crime in itself, as is conspiring to do it. Conspiracy to obstruct justice The US says that after discovering it was under criminal investigation in 2017, Huawei began destroying evidence, and moving witnesses with knowledge of the Iran scheme back to China. Western district of Washington (Seattle) The charges filed in Seattle focus on Huawei\u2019s alleged theft of robotic technology from T-Mobile, whose US headquarters is in the region. The indictment says Huawei aggressively tried to steal secrets, even setting up a bonus system rewarding employees who emailed them home to China. Theft of trade secrets conspiracy Attempted theft of trade secrets Huawei began supplying phones to T-Mobile in 2010 and agreed not to disclose confidential information that it learned, according to prosecutors. But from 2012, Huawei engineers allegedly began stealing information on Tappy, T-Mobile\u2019s robot for testing touchscreens. Prosecutors say Huawei needed a robot like Tappy because the phones it supplied to T-Mobile \u201cgenerally were not of high quality\u201d and kept breaking. T-Mobile declined to sell or license the Tappy system to Huawei, partly because Huawei also supplied competitors such as AT&amp;T. So Huawei dispatched an engineer from China, identified as FW, to Seattle. He allegedly accessed a T-Mobile laboratory, took measurements and photographs of Tappy, and sent them back to China. Another Huawei engineer, AX, later tried to steal one of Tappy\u2019s robotic arms but was caught, the indictment says. He claimed he \u201cfound it in his bag\u201d. Wire fraud \u2013 seven counts The indictment quotes extensively from emails between Huawei staff in the US and China. Chinese bosses repeatedly pressured those in the US to steal data on Tappy, prosecutors say. By devising the conspiracy over email, the company allegedly repeatedly committed wire fraud. Obstruction of justice After being caught stealing trade secrets, Huawei allegedly misled T-Mobile by carrying out a sham internal investigation and producing a 23-page report containing false information on what happened. The report falsely claimed that FW and AX were rogue employees acting without permission. The company is accused of obstructing justice by using this report to defend itself against a civil lawsuit that T-Mobile brought against it over the trade secrets theft.",

MPs were corralled by the prime minister on Tuesday to back a proposal under which the Commons would commit to supporting the withdrawal agreement should the Irish backstop contained within it be \u201creplaced\u201d. But as the prime minister called on MPs to send a message to Brussels, EU officials revealed that a statement was being prepared that would immediately close off the possibility of revising an agreement that had already been negotiated and agreed over the last 20 months.</p> <p><strong>Roger Stone, longtime adviser to Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/29/roger-stone-arraignment-trump-russia-mueller-investigation\">has pleaded not guilty</a></strong> to charges brought by the special counsel investigating Russian election interference.

The self-proclaimed dirty trickster had told the Guardian via text message before the hearing that he was feeling \u201cresilient\u201d. He declined to speak to reporters at the courthouse on Tuesday, but then spoke with the far-right American conspiracy theory and fake news website Infowars, calling his indictment a \u201clegal lynching\u201d.</p> <p><strong>The environmental laws that formally protect the endangered black-throated finch have also enabled the destruction of its natural habitat,</strong> leaving the species <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/30/adani-mine-environmental-laws-designed-to-protect-black-throated-finch-led-to-birds-decline\">at risk of extinction</a>, a new study says. Out of 775 projects overlapping the finch\u2019s habitat that were referred to the federal government for assessment under the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act since 2000, only one was refused because of an unacceptable impact on the finch. \u201cOften, extinctions happen because we just weren\u2019t watching.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 30 January. Top stories As Brexit is debated in the House of Commons, the EU is preparing to issue an immediate rebuff to Theresa May by publishing a statement rejecting any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement in the event of the so-called Brady amendment being passed by parliament. MPs were corralled by the prime minister on Tuesday to back a proposal under which the Commons would commit to supporting the withdrawal agreement should the Irish backstop contained within it be \u201creplaced\u201d. But as the prime minister called on MPs to send a message to Brussels, EU officials revealed that a statement was being prepared that would immediately close off the possibility of revising an agreement that had already been negotiated and agreed over the last 20 months. Roger Stone, longtime adviser to Donald Trump, has pleaded not guilty to charges brought by the special counsel investigating Russian election interference. Stone appeared at the US district court for the District of Columbia to face the charges in a seven-count indictment filed against him when he was arrested in Florida last Friday, related to lying to Congress, obstruction in the Russia investigation and witness tampering. The self-proclaimed dirty trickster had told the Guardian via text message before the hearing that he was feeling \u201cresilient\u201d. He declined to speak to reporters at the courthouse on Tuesday, but then spoke with the far-right American conspiracy theory and fake news website Infowars, calling his indictment a \u201clegal lynching\u201d. The environmental laws that formally protect the endangered black-throated finch have also enabled the destruction of its natural habitat, leaving the species at risk of extinction, a new study says. Out of 775 projects overlapping the finch\u2019s habitat that were referred to the federal government for assessment under the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act since 2000, only one was refused because of an unacceptable impact on the finch. \u201cOften, extinctions happen because we just weren\u2019t watching. This time, we have charted the steep decline of this Australian bird \u2013 but so far, we have permitted it to continue,\u201d said April Reside, the study\u2019s author. World China has condemned the US government\u2019s indictments against Huawei as \u201cunfair and immoral\u201d and urged Washington to stop its \u201cunreasonable suppression\u201d of the Chinese telecommunications company after it was charged with a series of crimes. Venezuelan attorney general Tarek Saab has asked the country\u2019s supreme court to open a preliminary investigation against Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-proclaimed president, and to freeze the opposition leader\u2019s accounts. Brazilian police have arrested five people in an investigation into the causes of the Brumadinho dam disaster. The dam break on Friday at an iron ore mining complex operated by the minerals firm Vale killed at least 65 people, and a further 279 are missing. A Christian farm labourer who spent eight years on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy has had her acquittal upheld by the the supreme court. Asia Bibi, who has been held at a secret location since her death sentence was overturned, is expected to be flown out of the country within hours. Two of her children are reportedly already in Canada, which has offered Bibi asylum. Apple is rushing to fix a glitch that allowed users to listen in on the people they were calling when they did not pick up the call. Under certain circumstances, the glitch also allowed callers to see video of the person they were calling before they picked up. Opinion and analysis In her final year as artistic director of Perth festival, Wendy Martin reflects on what makes the creative scene in the most remote capital in the world so unique. \u201cMany Perth artists attest to the creative freedom offered by a city unencumbered by the frictions, factions and orthodoxies laid down in the citadels of culture; a city on the \u2018periphery\u2019, with an outward focus,\u201d she writes. \u201cFor them, distance breeds adventurous curiosity.\u201d Oliver Yates wants to start a global campaign where citizens \u201ctake out\u201d environment ministers who fail to act on climate change. The former Macquarie banker, and head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who will confirm his intention to take on Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong as an independent publicly today, says that the challenges of climate change are now so serious that citizens globally need to \u201chold accountable environment ministers who have disregarded their responsibility\u201d. Yates further explains his reasons for running in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia: \u201cSeeing the now prime minister, Scott Morrison, wave around a lump of coal in parliament \u2026 made me angry. Environmentally it\u2019s like waving asbestos. The Liberal party\u2019s culture is sick. Ten years of negative policy actions have created a black hole around the leadership, surrounding them in impenetrable darkness.\u201d Sport The 2019 AFLW season begins this weekend with a move away from the traditional Friday night opener in Melbourne. The start to the competition\u2019s latest iteration will be a Saturday night double feature in Geelong and Adelaide \u2013 just one of a host of alterations the AFL has made to the women\u2019s competition for its third year. A 73-year-old French sailor has won an unusual, around-the-world yacht race after 212 days alone at sea without modern instruments, in what was his first sailing victory. Thinking time: Bleach is the new black Fitness influencers and fashion bloggers step aside: it\u2019s starting to look like bleach is the new black, writes Arwa Mahdawi. Marie Kondo, who shot to global fame in 2014 when her book The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up was published in English, is probably the biggest name on the clean scene.

In other words, when the world looks increasingly like trash, cleaning becomes a lot more comforting. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive at the centre of the US Department of Justice allegations, oversaw the setting up of Huawei in Australia. Warren Mundine has defended Kerri-Anne Kennerley\u2019s Australia Day comments, the Daily Telegraph writes, saying there are issues more pressing for Indigenous communities than changing the date. Last week\u2019s extreme weather saw Victoria and South Australia rack up a combined $1.1bn energy bill in less than 48 hours, the Australian reports. Coming up A parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security will hold a public hearing into citizenship powers. The NSW Environmental Defenders\u2019 Office and the Humane Society International will go to court to push for the removal of 173 shark cull drumlines installed in the Great Barrier Reef marine park.

      "bodyText": "Health officials have been forced into a U-turn over a decision to cancel blood donation sessions in Dover and Folkestone around Brexit day. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said earlier on Tuesday it was cancelling sessions for two weeks before and six weeks after the date the UK leaves the EU owing to fears of disruption on the roads in the event of no exit deal. But a Department of Health spokeswoman said: \u201cThe department does not agree with this course of action. We\u2019ve discussed this issue with NHSBT and confirmed blood donations will continue as normal. We\u2019re grateful to all lifesaving blood donors who make an important contribution.\u201d NHSBT\u2019s director of blood donation, Mike Stredder, had said of the cancellations: \u201cThis is because in the event of issues at Calais and other freight ports, Operation Stack may be put in place by Highways England and the Kent police. This could lead to significant traffic in Kent and may prevent donation teams from reaching venues in the area or a donation leaving.\u201d He said there would be no effect on the service\u2019s ability to supply hospitals locally as it would \u201ccompensate\u201d with supplies from elsewhere in the country. One member of the public said NHSBT had begun contacting volunteers to inform them of the cancellations. Marc Morris said his partner was told it was because of envisaged transport issues. Kent is expected to bear the brunt of disruption if there are delays on the Dover-Calais ferry route or Eurotunnel services from Folkestone. In December the council warned a no-deal Brexit could cause disruption across the county, with gridlock on the roads around Dover, rubbish not being collected, children unable to take exams and key workers unable to get to hospitals and schools. Stredder said the decision to suspend blood donation services would affect six sessions. \u201cOver the same period we will hold around 2,700 other sessions elsewhere in the country. We will also hold replacement sessions at alternative sessions to compensate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no effect on blood stocks or on our ability to supply hospitals.\u201d Before the Department of Health demanded the decision be reversed, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cYet again we learn of more disastrous consequences of Theresa May\u2019s hopeless mishandling of Brexit.

The consultancy firm KPMG, which is handling the auction on behalf of Sofa.com\u2019s owner, LGT European Capital, is expected to finalise a deal in the coming days, according to Sky News. It is unclear how much either Ashley or ScS were prepared to pay to buy Sofa.com. Furniture retailers have been struggling over the past 12 months as the continued uncertainty around Brexit erodes consumer confidence. Demand for big ticket purchases such as sofas has also been hit by a faltering housing market and a shift to renting rather than owning homes. The most recent set of accounts filed at Companies House show Sofa.com, which has a factory in Pozna\u0144, Poland, made a loss of nearly \u00a310m on sales of \u00a327.6m in the year to 28 February 2018. The company\u2019s product range spans sofas, armchairs and beds. Sports Direct snapped up the stricken House of Fraser chain for \u00a390m but is still finalising how many of its 59 stores will continue to trade. To date it has made deals on 37 stores, with Ashley also acquiring the landmark Frasers building in Glasgow for \u00a395m. LGT became the majority shareholder in Sofa.com last April, with the business previously having been owned by CBPE, a private equity firm.",

The legal action is being launched by Sarah Ewart, who embarked on a long, fraught journey in 2013 when a 19-week scan showed that the baby she was carrying had a fatal defect, revealing that the brain and skull had not developed properly. Doctors refused to perform an abortion, citing Northern Ireland\u2019s near-blanket ban on terminations. One consultant banged files on her desk and said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to prison for anyone.\u201d Ewart, then aged 23, borrowed money from a bank to travel to England for an abortion, a costly trip to a city she did not know. On her return she lobbied Northern Ireland\u2019s politicians to lift the ban, citing European human rights legislation. When that fell on deaf ears Ewart took her story to the media, fuelling a push for reform and a backlash from anti-abortion activists who targeted her and her family. On Wednesday, Ewart\u2019s five-year odyssey through the policies and passions of Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion ban will reach what may be its final leg. \u201cTime and time again I\u2019ve told my story to MPs, courtrooms and judges. Each time I relive the trauma,\u201d she said in a statement before the hearing. \u201cI hope this will be the last time I have to go to court and prove that women like me should be able to access abortion services at home, without being forced to travel. I hope this case can bring a ruling that helps end the suffering for us all.\u201d The UK\u2019s supreme court said last year that Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws breached human rights legislation. However, the ruling also stated that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which brought that case, did not have the power to bring forward proceedings because it was not a victim of an unlawful act. So Ewart has brought an individual case to the high court in hope of securing a formal declaration that Northern Ireland is violating the European Convention on Human Rights. She is due to give a statement outside the court framed by a banner reading \u201cNow #ItsTime for women of Northern Ireland\u201d, according to Amnesty International, which is supporting her case, along with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and other groups. \u201cIt\u2019s a damning indictment of the UK government\u2019s failure to prioritise women\u2019s rights and healthcare that Sarah and others are being forced through the ordeal of the courts to have their rights vindicated,\u201d said Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland campaign manager. \u201cThis is a huge moment. People everywhere will have their fingers crossed with hope that the Belfast court rules in favour of women\u2019s rights and reproductive freedom ... this must be our time for change.\u201d In a separate case a woman is facing prosecution for obtaining abortion pills for her pregnant underage daughter. The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) supports the abortion ban. Theresa May\u2019s government, which relies on DUP votes at Westminster, has not challenged the ban. However, MPs voted last year to force the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, to explain how officials can continue to enforce the ban. The Republic of Ireland\u2019s rollout of abortion services this month following a historic referendum has put additional pressure on Northern Ireland to relax its laws. \u201cIdeally, Sarah should not have had to take this individual case as the matter should have been resolved by the Westminster parliament,\u201d said Les Allamby, head of Northern Ireland\u2019s human rights commission. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable that women and girls continue to face being criminalised in what should be solely a healthcare matter.\u201d",

Interested parties have been asked to put forward first round bids by Friday but so far have only limited information about the recent trading performance at the company, which fell into administration this month. Sources told the Guardian that information sent to bidders by KPMG, which is acting as administrator, indicated only sales and profit data from after October 2018 or before September 2014 could be relied upon. Estimates by KPMG collated from Patisserie Valerie\u2019s electronic till system indicate that sales at established stores had fallen by 4% in the last two years and the 122 stores remaining open were on course to make a \u00a32m loss in the year to September 2019, according to the information sent to buyers. One source said potential buyers were \u201cflying blind\u201d on the details to some extent because of potential irregularities in the accounts. Patisserie Valerie has been in crisis since October, when the company said it had uncovered a \u00a340m black hole in its finances, which it blamed on \u201cpotentially fraudulent\u201d accounting irregularities. About 70 of the cafe group\u2019s nearly 200 outlets and concessions closed immediately, with the loss of about 900 jobs. More than 2,800 further jobs are at risk. A number of parties are said to be considering making some kind of offer for the cafe chain, apparently including Costa, the rival business bought by Coca-Cola last summer. Most parties that have expressed an interest are thought to want only a handful of sites. It has been reported that Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct is considering a bid, but it is understood no formal offer has been tabled. Potential bidders have not been given access to a report by forensic accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers who have examined Patisserie Valerie\u2019s books since October. KPMG is understood to be concerned about the risk of prejudicing an investigation currently being carried out by the Serious Fraud Office.",

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of \u201cpushing the cost of failure on to local people\u201d after ministers gave bankrupt, Tory-controlled Northamptonshire special dispensation to raise council tax above normal limits to help balance its books. The secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, James Brokenshire, announced on Tuesday that the stricken county council would be allowed to raise the council tax rate to 5% in 2019-20 to try and turn around its troubled finances. Although a number of other councils have also asked Brokenshire for dispensation to raise council tax beyond the current 2.99% limit, he said he had rejected their request to protect council taxpayers, in line with the Tory manifesto. The Northampton North Labour parliamentary candidate, Sally Keeble, accused the government of \u201cpushing the price of local Tory failure on to local people with an extra 2% council tax rise in Northants\u201d. Chris Stanbra, leader of the Liberal Democrats on the council, said: \u201cThe whole fiasco could now mean a substantial tax increase for local taxpayers. It gives lie to the line that Conservatives often use that they are good at managing our money.\u201d The council leader, Matt Golby, welcomed the offer and said the cabinet would decide whether to take up the flexibility early next month. Doing so could potentially raise \u00a35.78m. However, with the council pushing through drastic service cuts and job losses, and facing criticism over proposed library closures and failures in its child protection department, the potential increase may not go down well with local taxpayers. Councils normally must hold a referendum if they wish to raise council tax beyond the 2.99% limit. No local authority has taken up the option, despite many facing financial problems. Northamptonshire declared itself effectively bankrupt in February after it could not balance its books. It declared insolvency again in July after a review revealed it had understated the extent of its financial problems and faced a \u00a370m deficit. The council is to be scrapped after a scathing inspectors report last March revealed widespread governance and management failures. The report ruled out a government bailout on the grounds that this would be a \u201creward for failure\u201d. Ironically, one of the elements attributed to Northamptonshire\u2019s financial crisis was its decision not to put up council tax over several years earlier this decade, in line with the promptings of the then Tory communities secretary, Eric Pickles. Brokenshire told MPs in a statement he had decided to provide Northamptonshire with an additional 2% council tax flexibility to \u201cassist with the improvements to council governance and services after their serious issues\u201d. The move follows Brokenshire\u2019s decision in November to give Northamptonshire unprecedented permission to divert \u00a360m received from the sale of its HQ into funding day-to-day services, a move regarded by critics as being in effect a bailout.",

I\u2019m also addicted to Subway sandwiches and could eat one every night for dinner,\u201d he said, adding that he had cut down on red meat but still enjoyed a burger and eats steak \u201cvery seldom, but if served it I would eat it\u201d.",

The period drama Suffragette (2015) made me grind my teeth and the American epic The Patriot (2000) is a historical mess. But such films are not meant to be documentaries.

Suggesting that Queen Elizabeth I actually met Mary Queen of Scots may or may not be important, but inventing events that dishonour a whole nation for the sake of \u201cbums on seats\u201d is totally unacceptable. Three examples will suffice: the film The Patriot (2000) depicted the redcoats burning a church full of townsfolk during the American war of independence, an event for which there is no historical evidence, but which bears a close resemblance to the Nazi atrocity at Oradour-sur-Glane in June 1944; the film Saving Private Ryan (1998) excluded reference to other allied forces (British, Canadian etc) involved in the second world war, leaving millions of cinemagoers to believe that America liberated western Europe on its own; the film U-571 (2000) shows the US navy capturing the German navy\u2019s version of the Enigma machine in 1942, but it was the Royal Navy (HMS Bulldog) that captured it from U-boat U-110 in May 1941, ie before the United States had entered the war!<br><strong>Barry Mellor</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins\u2019 health warning about historically inspired movies leaves me wondering where he\u2019s been all his life. The Dam Busters (1955) was far from objective or accurate, but it introduced a whole generation to a story they might not otherwise have known. Ditto Zulu (1964), or how about Exodus (1960)? Since the invention of cinema, film-makers have been inspired by real events \u2013 just like poets.</p> <p>Tennyson\u2019s Charge of the Light Brigade (1854), published a mere six weeks after the event, means he probably didn\u2019t do a recce of the carnage or get round enough of the survivors to take a measured view \u2013 but without his stirring verse many of us would never have been inspired to discover more about that event. All history telling is partial; every account, someone\u2019s version of what happened.

Emilie Lamplough Trowbridge, Wiltshire \u2022 Simon Jenkins makes reference to several films that distort history for the benefit of \u201cratings-hungry producers\u201d. Suggesting that Queen Elizabeth I actually met Mary Queen of Scots may or may not be important, but inventing events that dishonour a whole nation for the sake of \u201cbums on seats\u201d is totally unacceptable. Three examples will suffice: the film The Patriot (2000) depicted the redcoats burning a church full of townsfolk during the American war of independence, an event for which there is no historical evidence, but which bears a close resemblance to the Nazi atrocity at Oradour-sur-Glane in June 1944; the film Saving Private Ryan (1998) excluded reference to other allied forces (British, Canadian etc) involved in the second world war, leaving millions of cinemagoers to believe that America liberated western Europe on its own; the film U-571 (2000) shows the US navy capturing the German navy\u2019s version of the Enigma machine in 1942, but it was the Royal Navy (HMS Bulldog) that captured it from U-boat U-110 in May 1941, ie before the United States had entered the war! Barry Mellor London \u2022 Simon Jenkins\u2019 health warning about historically inspired movies leaves me wondering where he\u2019s been all his life. The Dam Busters (1955) was far from objective or accurate, but it introduced a whole generation to a story they might not otherwise have known. Ditto Zulu (1964), or how about Exodus (1960)? Since the invention of cinema, film-makers have been inspired by real events \u2013 just like poets. Tennyson\u2019s Charge of the Light Brigade (1854), published a mere six weeks after the event, means he probably didn\u2019t do a recce of the carnage or get round enough of the survivors to take a measured view \u2013 but without his stirring verse many of us would never have been inspired to discover more about that event. All history telling is partial; every account, someone\u2019s version of what happened. But movies \u2013 like poems \u2013 are art, not journalism.

      "bodyText": "In May, the BBC intends to screen Eurovision 2019 from Israel. Eurovision may be light entertainment, but it is not exempt from human rights considerations \u2013 and we cannot ignore Israel\u2019s systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. The European Broadcasting Union chose Tel Aviv as the venue over occupied Jerusalem \u2013 but this does nothing to protect Palestinians from land theft, evictions, shootings, beatings and more by Israel\u2019s security forces. On 8 February, the BBC will screen You Decide, the show it says will \u201cdeliver the UK the artist it deserves to fly the flag out in Tel Aviv in May\u201d. For any artist of conscience, this would be a dubious honour. They and the BBC should consider that \u201cYou Decide\u201d is not a principle extended to the Palestinians, who cannot decide to remove Israel\u2019s military occupation and live free of apartheid. Even Palestinians with Israeli citizenship were told in the nation-state law passed last year that only Jews have the \u201cright to national self-determination\u201d. When discrimination and exclusion are so deeply embedded, Eurovision 2019\u2019s claim to celebrate diversity and inclusion must ring hollow. Much more in tune with \u201cinclusivity\u201d is the outpouring of support across Europe for the Palestinian call for artists and broadcasters not to go to Tel Aviv. The BBC is bound by its charter to \u201cchampion freedom of expression\u201d. It should act on its principles and press for Eurovision to be relocated to a country where crimes against that freedom are not being committed.

The proposal has sparked fears of a return to the days when some patients waited many hours in A&amp;E to start treatment.</p> <p>Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), said: \u201cIn our expert opinion scrapping the four-hour target will have a near-catastrophic impact on patient safety in many emergency departments that are already struggling to deliver safe patient care in a wider system that is failing badly.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: this is far from being in the best interests of patients and will only serve to bury problems in a health service that will be severely tested by yet another optimistic reconfiguration.\u201d</p> <p>His colleague Derek Prentice, chair of the college\u2019s lay group, went further, calling the plan an \u201cattack on the patient interest\u201d and accusing the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, of being \u201chellbent on undermining the benefits that the four-hour A&amp;E standard has delivered over many years\u201d. </p> <p>Prentice added: \u201cI would have thought that no one wants to go back to the days of endless hours of waiting in A&amp;E departments. The only ones who will benefit from this are ministers and NHS managers.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS constitution states that 95% of patients should be treated and then discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours. The NHS\u2019s inability to meet the target in recent years has caused serious discomfort for ministers.</p> <p>Stevens told MPs on Monday that the target will be \u201csignificantly altered\u201d. Under the new plan, people with more serious conditions such as sepsis or heart trouble will be treated faster but those with minor ailments may have to wait longer.</p> <p>Anna Crossley, the Royal College of Nursing professional lead for acute and emergency care, said: \u201cIt is imperative that hospitals have the staff and resources to give timely care within current guidelines. Tinkering with targets to make them easier is the wrong approach. Axing it or loosening it without evaluating alternatives puts patient safety at risk and sends a terrible signal that waiting times do not matter.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, NHS England is under pressure to explain which medical groups it has included in a review of its key clinical targets, which Theresa May ordered last year.</p> <p>NHS England\u2019s national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, who is leading the review, said it was working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Healthwatch England to examine \u201cwhat matters most to patients \u2026 and what they believe will help NHS staff provide the best quality care for patients\u201d.</p> <p>He said any changes would be trialled before being rolled out nationally. </p>",

Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), said: \u201cIn our expert opinion scrapping the four-hour target will have a near-catastrophic impact on patient safety in many emergency departments that are already struggling to deliver safe patient care in a wider system that is failing badly. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: this is far from being in the best interests of patients and will only serve to bury problems in a health service that will be severely tested by yet another optimistic reconfiguration.\u201d His colleague Derek Prentice, chair of the college\u2019s lay group, went further, calling the plan an \u201cattack on the patient interest\u201d and accusing the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, of being \u201chellbent on undermining the benefits that the four-hour A&amp;E standard has delivered over many years\u201d. Prentice added: \u201cI would have thought that no one wants to go back to the days of endless hours of waiting in A&amp;E departments. The only ones who will benefit from this are ministers and NHS managers.\u201d The NHS constitution states that 95% of patients should be treated and then discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours. The NHS\u2019s inability to meet the target in recent years has caused serious discomfort for ministers. Stevens told MPs on Monday that the target will be \u201csignificantly altered\u201d. Under the new plan, people with more serious conditions such as sepsis or heart trouble will be treated faster but those with minor ailments may have to wait longer. Anna Crossley, the Royal College of Nursing professional lead for acute and emergency care, said: \u201cIt is imperative that hospitals have the staff and resources to give timely care within current guidelines. Tinkering with targets to make them easier is the wrong approach. Axing it or loosening it without evaluating alternatives puts patient safety at risk and sends a terrible signal that waiting times do not matter.\u201d Separately, NHS England is under pressure to explain which medical groups it has included in a review of its key clinical targets, which Theresa May ordered last year. NHS England\u2019s national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, who is leading the review, said it was working with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Healthwatch England to examine \u201cwhat matters most to patients \u2026 and what they believe will help NHS staff provide the best quality care for patients\u201d. He said any changes would be trialled before being rolled out nationally.",

It will therefore be a boost to the quality of this National if the grey turns up, but all other entrants will be pushed down the weights, perhaps forcing riding plans to change. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of people looking for 10-stone jockeys,\u201d said Bromley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af2fb70b475eeb0ec37c705e38c1e15bb072bc7f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af2fb70b475eeb0ec37c705e38c1e15bb072bc7f/0_0_4867_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bristol De Mai goes down in the King George.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bristol De Mai goes down in the King George.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Cargill/racingfotos.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, the BHA has accepted it made a mistake in referring to the \u201cfree will\u201d of horses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/27/bha-bizarre-fine-on-henry-oliver-tony-mccoy-criticism-horse-racing\">in a press release on Sunday</a>, when it was trying to explain why a trainer had been fined for encouraging his horse to go forward at the start. \u201cThe term should not be taken as evidence of a new philosophical stance towards horses,\u201d a statement said.</p> \n<h2>Tuesday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>Lingfield\u2019s jumps card has been frozen off but we still have an interesting card at Newcastle, where <strong>Straidnahanna (2.30)</strong> is still available at 9-1 after seemingly attracting some support from 12s.

      "bodyText": "Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Donald Trump, on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to charges in the Russia investigation, then ran the gauntlet of protesters waving Russian flags and playing the Beatles\u2019 Back in the USSR. The Republican strategist and self-proclaimed dirty trickster is charged in a seven-count indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller with obstruction, lying to Congress and witness tampering. Wearing a blue suit and a deep blue tie, Stone walked through the public entrance into a courtroom at the US district court for the District of Columbia just after 10.50am and sat down with four lawyers at a table. He straightened his tie, touched up his hair with his right hand and adjusted his sleeve. US magistrate judge Deborah Robinson began proceedings, watched by a packed public gallery. Stone\u2019s lawyer Robert Buschel entered the not guilty plea on his client\u2019s behalf. A status hearing before US district judge Amy Berman Jackson was set for Friday at 1.30pm. Stone, 66, first appeared in court in Florida after a dramatic arrest last Friday and was released on $250,000 bond. On Tuesday, assistant US attorney Michael Marando told the judge: \u201cWe are requesting no change in conditions of release that were imposed by the court in Florida. We would like all the same conditions to apply that were set by the court down there.\u201d Robinson said: \u201cNow, Mr Stone.\u201d He replied: \u201cYes, your honour.\u201d A court official interjected: \u201cPlease stand up.\u201d Stone rose to his feet, looking calm and collected. The judge reiterated the conditions of his release, which prohibit him from contacting certain individuals or owning a passport, restrict his travel and require him to check in with the court by phone every week. Failure to attend court hearings could lead to additional incarceration or a fine, she warned. \u201cDo you understand, sir?\u201d Stone said steadily: \u201cYes, your honour.\u201d The political operative was then presented with his bond document, which he signed. Stone was then required to stand and swear on oath that he understood the bond conditions he must follow. \u201cI do,\u201d he said. The hearing wrapped up after less than 15 minutes. Stone stood and chatted with his lawyers and could be seen laughing. But the calm scene contrasted with the noisy melee that awaited outside court, where TV crews and demonstrators surged after Stone, who repeated his staple Richard-Nixon style victory sign before climbing inside a black SUV. Supporters shouted, \u201cWe love Roger!\u201d and held aloft signs such as, \u201cFree Stone, fire Mueller\u201d. Protesters yelled, \u201cLock him up!\u201d and \u201cFucking traitor!\u201d Russian flags were waved and loudspeaker boomed the Beatles song followed by the Russian national anthem, in this cold downtown Washington street. Marilyn Matrisciana, 71, held a placard with the message \u201cFree Stone. Jail Hillary\u201d \u2013 a reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton. She said: \u201cThe far left have gone so far to crush our president and I believe Roger Stone is one of the victims. I believe Roger Stone is innocent and was interrogated under pressure to say something.\u201d She dismissed the notion that Trump colluded with Russia as \u201ca set-up\u201d. But protester Bill Christeson believed Stone had a case to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to defend democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let the Putins of the world win.\u201d Christeson, 64, an activist, added \u201cHe\u2019s not a dirty trickster\u201d then raised a sign that said: \u201cDirty traitor\u201d. He flipped the sign around to show the words: \u201cYou helped Putin steal our democracy.\u201d Christeson said: \u201cHe should die in jail. He and Manafort. Trump should die in jail.\u201d He was confronted by Stone supporters outside court, he said. \u201cI said two words: Nixon. Putin.\u2019\u201d Stone, a friend of the president for four decades, is the sixth Trump aide charged in Mueller\u2019s investigation. The indictment alleges that he shared with Trump campaign staff advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plan to release senior Democrats\u2019 emails, which US intelligence says were stolen by Russians. A top Trump official was allegedly \u201cdirected\u201d to ask Stone about damaging information that WikiLeaks had on Clinton.",

With the shutdown now over and equity prices recovering, there is a good chance that confidence will rebound in February.</p> \n   <p>The decline was driven exclusively by a deterioration in the expectations index, which dropped to 87.3 from 97.9, with the present situation component little changed. The press release confirmed that the Federal government shutdown, which was still underway during the survey period, and the earlier weakness in equity markets were the main factors weighing on sentiment. With the shutdown now resolved, however, we don\u2019t expect it to have any lasting impact on the economy. Furthermore, the S&amp;P 500 has rebounded by more than 10% from its late-December lows. With labour market conditions still very strong, we wouldn\u2019t be surprise to see confidence pick up again over the next couple of months. The net share of respondents saying that jobs are plentiful, rather than hard to get, remained close to an 18-year high in January. On past form, that is consistent with the unemployment rate falling even lower over the coming months.</p> \n   <p>Confidence hasn\u2019t been a great guide to spending in recent years so, even if the decline in January is sustained, that wouldn\u2019t in itself mean that consumption growth will soon slow. But with the boost from last year\u2019s tax cuts now fading and the lagged impact of the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening still feeding through, the rapid pace of spending growth seen over the second half of 2018 is unlikely to be sustained.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5072e6e4b084eaaff7f87e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T15:42:04.235Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greece pulls off bond sale</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d56582f6ca95da91960bd0380edeb732c7fadac\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d56582f6ca95da91960bd0380edeb732c7fadac/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Over in Greece, the government has made a foray back into the financial markets by auctioning a new five-year bond, reports Helena Smith in Athens. </strong></p> \n  <p>The bond, the first since Athens exited its bailout programme last August, is critical to testing investor confidence at a time when tapping markets has proven to be more difficult than expected \u2013 partly because of market tumult prompted by Italy but mostly because of the country\u2019s debt-to GDP ratio, at 185% the highest in Europe. <br></p> \n  <p>Friday\u2019s landmark accord resolving the long-running name row with Macedonia has punched a hole in that uncertainty, analysts say, pushing up bond yields.</p> \n  <p>The sale was expected to raise between \u20ac2bn and \u20ac3bn, with a projected yield of 3.75% to 3.875%, sources say.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics points out that US consumer confidence has dropped to an 18-month low today. Here\u2019s his take: The fall in the Conference Board consumer confidence index to an 18-month low of 120.2 in January, from 126.6, appears to have been driven by a combination of the government shutdown and the earlier volatility in financial markets. With the shutdown now over and equity prices recovering, there is a good chance that confidence will rebound in February. The decline was driven exclusively by a deterioration in the expectations index, which dropped to 87.3 from 97.9, with the present situation component little changed. The press release confirmed that the Federal government shutdown, which was still underway during the survey period, and the earlier weakness in equity markets were the main factors weighing on sentiment. With the shutdown now resolved, however, we don\u2019t expect it to have any lasting impact on the economy. Furthermore, the S&amp;P 500 has rebounded by more than 10% from its late-December lows. With labour market conditions still very strong, we wouldn\u2019t be surprise to see confidence pick up again over the next couple of months. The net share of respondents saying that jobs are plentiful, rather than hard to get, remained close to an 18-year high in January. On past form, that is consistent with the unemployment rate falling even lower over the coming months. Confidence hasn\u2019t been a great guide to spending in recent years so, even if the decline in January is sustained, that wouldn\u2019t in itself mean that consumption growth will soon slow. But with the boost from last year\u2019s tax cuts now fading and the lagged impact of the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening still feeding through, the rapid pace of spending growth seen over the second half of 2018 is unlikely to be sustained. Over in Greece, the government has made a foray back into the financial markets by auctioning a new five-year bond, reports Helena Smith in Athens. The bond, the first since Athens exited its bailout programme last August, is critical to testing investor confidence at a time when tapping markets has proven to be more difficult than expected \u2013 partly because of market tumult prompted by Italy but mostly because of the country\u2019s debt-to GDP ratio, at 185% the highest in Europe. Friday\u2019s landmark accord resolving the long-running name row with Macedonia has punched a hole in that uncertainty, analysts say, pushing up bond yields. The sale was expected to raise between \u20ac2bn and \u20ac3bn, with a projected yield of 3.75% to 3.875%, sources say. The paper will mature in April 2024. And the sale appears to have gone better than expected -- Athens has raised \u20ac2.5bn, at a yield of just 3.6%. That could reassure investors that Greece can finance itself, rather than needing fresh financial help. Just in: The US government shutdown has had a chilling impact on consumer morale. The consumer confidence index, calculated by America\u2019s Conference Board, has slumped to just 120.2 this month -- down from 126.6 in December. Economist had expected a much smaller decline, to 124.9. That\u2019s a pretty clear sign that the month-long deadlock between the White House and Congress, which left hundreds of thousands of Federal workers unpaid, has hurt the economy. That\u2019s a bad sign for growth. The only hope is that confidence might pick up, now that Trump has blinked and agreed to reopen the government. Over in America, motorbike maker Harley Davidson has seen its profits wiped out by Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. Harley Davidson has reported that earnings per share plunged to $0.00 per share in the last quarter. Excluding restructuring costs, and the impact of tariffs, and earnings came in at $0.17 per share - analysts expected $0.29. In the U.S. motorcycle sales fell 10.1% to 20,849 from 23,195. Sales also fell in Europe and Asia-Pacific, helping to pull global sales down by 6.7% to 39,311 (from 42,142). Harley had previously warned that Europe\u2019s motorbike tariffs - imposed in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel - was hurting sales. Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust (the charity that runs National Debtline) is also concerned that people are being lured into IVAs. \u201cIt is a worry to see the number of people going insolvent at its highest level for seven years and this reflects the challenging times many people continue to face. \u201cWith this increase driven in large part by a rise in IVAs (Individual Voluntary Arrangements) our concern is that many people in debt are being led down a route that may not be suitable for their circumstances. The prevalence of online adverts that promote \u2018solutions\u2019 to debt involving insolvency procedures may well be a contributing factor to this. \u201cInsolvency options should not be undertaken lightly and it is crucial that people receive free, impartial debt advice before deciding the best course of action to take. \u201cI would encourage anyone worried about their finances to seek free and impartial debt advice from a charity-run service like National Debtline.\u201d Here\u2019s my colleague Phillip Inman on the jump in insolvencies: A jump in personal insolvencies in the fourth quarter of 2018 sent the total number of people going bust last year in England and Wales to the highest level since 2011. Individual insolvencies rocketed by 34.7% compared with the previous quarter to 34,108, taking the total number for the year up by just over 16% to 115,299, according to figures from the Insolvency Service. A rise in company insolvencies to 4,725 in the last quarter, spurred by the collapse of hundreds of construction and retail businesses, sent the number of company insolvencies last year to 17,439, the highest level since 2014.... More here: Here\u2019s another chart from the Insolvency Service, which show how personal insolvencies - as a share of the population - has been rising since 2015. As you can see, insolvencies are back at a 7-year high, and haven\u2019t returned to their pre-crisis levels. The Insolvency Service says: The individual insolvency rate is related to levels of household debt, and economic growth. The current individual insolvency rate remains elevated compared with rates of less than 10 per 10,000 adults before 2004. In the early-to-mid-2000s, there was a large expansion of credit which coincided with a large increase in the individual insolvency rate. A quick clarification. The number of personal insolvencies in the UK jumped to 115,299 people last year - not 115,229 as mentioned earlier [there was a small typo in the announcement, which I didn\u2019t spot...] Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, says Brexit uncertainty is one factors pushing companies into financial difficulties: \u201cThese latest figures show the huge strain that small businesses are currently facing with rising employment costs, unfair business rates as well as significant uncertainty as the UK exits the European Union. \u201cBoth the total number of new company insolvencies as well as underlying total insolvencies have reached their highest levels since 2014, which illustrates the great turbulence that small firms are now up against. \u201cIt\u2019s a great concern to see almost 1,000 self-employed individuals suffered from bankruptcies in Q3 of 2018. Heads-up. Chancellor Philip Hammond is planning to update us on the nation\u2019s finances on Wednesday 13th March. TUC official Alex Collinson fears that Britain is sinking into a debt crisis - and wants the government to act: Here\u2019s Noble Francis of the Construction Products Association on today\u2019s corporate insolvency stats: Today\u2019s insolvency figures cover three types of formal insolvency procedures, which people enter when they can\u2019t service their debts. Bankruptcy orders \u2013 a form of debt relief available for anyone who is unable to pay their debts. Assets owned will vest in a trustee in bankruptcy who will sell them and distribute the proceeds to creditors. Discharge from debts usually takes place 12 months after the bankruptcy order is granted. Debt relief orders (DROs) \u2013 a form of debt relief available to those who have a low income, low assets and less than \u00a320,000 of debt (\u00a315,000 before October 2015). There is no distribution to creditors, and discharge from debts takes place 12 months after the DRO is granted. DROs were introduced in April 2009 Individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) \u2013 a voluntary means of repaying creditors some or all of what they are owed. Once approved by 75% or more of creditors, the arrangement is binding on all. IVAs are supervised by licensed Insolvency Practitioners. The 16% jump in personal insolvencies in 2018 shows that more Britons are in financial distress. Stuart Frith, President of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, explains: Personal insolvency numbers have been rising steadily every year since 2015, and 2018 was no exception. As banks and other lenders have tightened their credit standards in response to the Bank of England\u2019s concerns around consumer over-indebtedness, many people have run out of road. In previous years, the \u2018helicopter money\u2019 provided by PPI refunds, along with generally less stringent lending requirements, helped to paper over the cracks that opened up as a result of a decade of persistently stagnant wage increases, but these avenues look to be closing themselves off. People are having to spend more of their income on housing and transportation, leaving less left over for savings and making budgets more vulnerable to shocks. Some savings\u2019 pots are perilously thin (or non-existent), Frith adds: \u201cSavings levels are painfully thin, exposing people to financial upsets. As an illustration of this, recent research from R3 and ComRes found that one in five British adults (20%) would find it somewhat difficult, very difficult or impossible to immediately pay an unexpected bill for an amount as little as \u00a320, without assistance from an external source. Karen Hendy, partner at City law firm RPC, fears more retailers will fall into insolvency in 2019. \u201cThe retail landscape could get worse before it gets better. A poorly handled Brexit may see even more high-profile casualties in the sector. Unfortunately, there seems to be very little good news on the horizon for retailers. The National Minimum Wage will rise another 4.9% in April, and Brexit is a drag on consumer confidence.\u201d Building companies and retailers suffered the brunt of the insolvencies across the UK last year, as this chart shows: The Insolvency Services adds: The underlying number of company insolvencies increased in 2018 to 16,090, the highest level since 2014 All types of company insolvency increased in 2018 compared with 2017 except administrative receivership The number of companies hitting financial trouble have also risen. Corporate insolvencies jumped by 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 4,725 companies. John Cullen, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears more businesses will enter insolvency this year. \u201cThe recent dip in consumer confidence is beginning to impact spending behaviour and this is having an effect across the economy. Retailers have been particularly badly affected and many are still saddled by historic rental agreements, which are undermining their profitability. Other sectors of the economy are also affected, among them the construction and hospitality &amp; leisure industries. \u201cDespite the low rate of unemployment, the current climate of Brexit uncertainty and political instability, is unsettling for consumers, and this is creating exceptionally challenging trading conditions for many businesses. \u201cCorporate insolvencies are likely to continue to rise in 2019.\u201d The number of UK personal insolvencies surged in the last three months. The Insolvency Service reports there were 34,108 individual insolvencies in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 34.8% on Q4. Again, a surge in individual voluntary arrangements was responsible - they jumped by 60% to a record level of 22,717. Boom! The number of UK individuals falling into insolvency has hit a seven-year high. In total, 115,299 people became insolvent after failing to repay their debts in 2018, up 16% year on year. That\u2019s the third annual increase in a row and the highest since 2011 (after the great recession). It\u2019s the latest sign that the cost of living squeeze is forcing some families to the brink. The increase was mainly driven by a record number of individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) - a formal agreement between debtor and creditor to repay part of an outstanding debt over a fixed schedule. The Insolvency Service says the number of IVAs jumped by almost 20% last year, meaning that roughly 1 in 400 adults was declared insolvent in 2018. Richard Haymes, Head of Financial Difficulties at TDX Group, fears people are signing up to IVAs too lightly. Research we\u2019ve conducted reveals major misperceptions around the consequences of personal insolvency. Nearly three in ten people don\u2019t realise that entering personal insolvency could affect their access to rental accommodation, over a quarter (26%) of people don\u2019t know it may affect their eligibility for a bank account, and nearly one in five (19%) Brits think it wouldn\u2019t influence their ability to access a mortgage. \u201cThe survey also shows people don\u2019t realise the impact on their access to other everyday services, for example three in five (60%) Brits believe there would be no issues in accessing utility services such as electricity, gas, or TV and broadband services. \u201cThere\u2019s wholesale confusion concerning the consequences of personal insolvency. Entering into an IVA is recorded on your credit report for six years and can make it hard for you to be approved for rental agreements, a mortgage or bank account, as well as other services like utilities. It\u2019s never a decision to be taken lightly. In the City, the FTSE 100 has jumped by almost 80 points this morning to 6825, recovering Monday\u2019s losses. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: The latest machinations in the House of Commons over Brexit will take place tonight. With sterling still volatile against this backdrop, the FTSE 100 was on the march, recovering some of the losses seen in recent days to trade more than 1% higher early on. \u201cThe index is being powered by heavyweight tobacco stocks British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands which have relatively little exposure to the UK\u2019s looming exit from the EU. Sterling is hovering around $1.316, as traders wait to see which - if any - Brexit amendments are passed tonight. Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown has suffered from the recent market volatility, and anxiety over Brexit. It\u2019s reported a 6% drop in assets under administration since 30 June 2018 to \u00a385.9 billion, and a 24% decline in net new business, even though its client base grew by 45,000 to 1,136,000 active clients. Hargreaves Lansdown grew into a FTSE 100-listed company by making it easy to invest in ISAs and trade shares through its Vantage service. CEO Chris Hill says the company is going through difficult times: \u201cThe diversified nature of Hargreaves Lansdown has enabled us to continue growing despite a period of geopolitical uncertainty, market volatility and weak investor confidence. Hill also warns that Brexit is deterring some clients from investing: Brexit is on the horizon, and until certainty is reached, it will continue to impact markets and consumer confidence. Financial decision making becomes trickier and clients can become reluctant to invest more in volatile markets and prefer to sit on the side-lines. Perhaps he should have a word with Peter Hargreaves, company co-founder, who was a big backer of the Leave campaign in 2016. Perhaps Royal Mail should take some delivery lessons from Domino\u2019s. The fast food company had its busiest week ever in the run-up to Christmas, shifting a record-breaking 535,000 pizza (!) on Friday 21st December alone. It also posted a 25% jump in sales on the night of the Strictly Come Dancing final (December 15th), as families shunned the cooker in favour of takeaways and tangos. David Wild, Domino\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the continued strong performance in the UK and Ireland, where we opened a further 59 stores. Many families decided to kick off the festive season with a Domino\u2019s, with the Friday before Christmas breaking all records as we sold more than 535,000 pizzas - equivalent to 12 every second. The UK delivered food market is \u201cvibrant\u201d, Domino\u2019s adds, predicting growth of 8% a year to 2022. But while the UK sizzles, Domino\u2019s expects to make a \u00a33-\u00a34m loss at its International operations, due to weather problems and \u201cbusiness integration challenges in Norway.\u201d That\u2019s knocked its shares down 5%. Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Royal Mail\u2019s letters business is contracting at a worrying rate: \u201cThe continuing collapse in letter volumes is the big news in these numbers. Royal Mail\u2019s gone out of its way to say that\u2019s down to wider uncertainty, and the introduction of new privacy laws under GDPR, rather an uptick in companies using email rather than paper. Whatever the cause, we suspect those mailings are gone for good. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says investors are unimpressed by Royal Mail\u2019s performance, adding: Management don\u2019t appear to have a coherent plan to deal with an ever rising cost base at a time when growth prospects remain cloudy. Ouch. Shares in Royal Mail have hit a record low after it delivered more bad news to shareholders. Royal Mail warned that its letters business is declining faster than expected, due to \u2018business uncertainty\u2019 and the move away from paper to electronic messages. Letter volumes have fallen 6% in the last nine months, wiping out the benefits of a 6% jump in parcels volumes. CEO Rico Back also blamed the UK\u2019s new data protection rules (GDPR) for the drop in letters: \u201cDue to our letters performance to date, we expect addressed letter volume declines, excluding elections, to be in the range of 7-8% for 2018-19. While the rate of e-substitution remains in line with our expectations, business uncertainty is impacting letter volumes. Royal Mail also trimmed its earnings targets for 2018-19. It now expects \u201cgroup operating profit before transformation costs\u201d of \u00a3500-530m, down from \u00a3500-\u00a3550m announced in last October\u2019s profits warning. This sent shares down 1% to 255p in early trading, an all-time low. The government sold Royal Mail off at 330p per share in 2013, and they hit 631p last May. When they\u2019re nervous, investors have a habit of piling into gold. So with geopolitical anxiety rising, bullion prices have just hit their highest level in seven months. One ounce of gold will now cost you $1,307, the highest level since May 2018. The criminal charges launched against Huawei could scupper this week\u2019s US-China trade talks, City analysts reckon. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Sentiment was already on shaky ground this week over concerns of global growth. The move by the US justice department accusing Huawei with bank fraud and conspiring to steal trade secrets from US firm T mobile Inc is not helping. The timing of the move is important. With trade due to start tomorrow, this is a fairly hostile message that the US is sending out. The overriding fear is that this move will negatively impact trade talks, making a deal even less likely. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADSS, adds: The lack of progress in the US-China trade talks and the potential extradition of Huawei\u2019s CFO from Canada to the US on criminal charges highlight a complex geopolitical landscape. At the same time, rumours that President Trump will not hesitate shutting down the US government again in February as he tries to get funding for his wall with Mexico create further challenges for the US economy, keeping equity traders on the side-lines. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade talks have taken a resounding knock, after American authorities hit technology firm Huawei with a string of criminal charges. The US Justice Department has charged Huawei of bank fraud, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to launder money related to allegations that it conspired to violate Iranian sanctions. Chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou has also been charged, and faces extradition to the US. Meng and Huawei are accused of using a subsidiary, Skycom Technologies, to do business with sanctioned Iran - a breach of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). US officials believe Huawei committed fraud by lying to banks, thus misrepresenting their relationship with Skycom. Huawei is also accused of stealing a robotic technology from the US carrier T-Mobile. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Huawei had made a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d to steal this smartphone-testing system. The company denies the charges, pointing that that it has already reached a civil settlement with T-Mobile over \u2018Tippy\u2019. FBI director Christopher Wray said the charges followed years of investigative work, and suggested that Huawei shouldn\u2019t be welcome in the US at all. Wray declared: \u201cThese cases make clear that, as a country, we must consider carefully the risk that companies like Huawei pose if we allow them into our telecommunications infrastructure. The FBI does not\u2014and will not\u2014tolerate businesses that violate our laws, obstruct our justice, and jeopardize our national security.\u201d China has swiftly hit back, calling the charges unfair and immoral. The move comes just days before a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He arrived in Washington for crucial trade talks. Unless an agreement is reached in the next month, Donald Trump will hike the tariff on thousands of Chinese products from 10% to 25%, potentially hurting trade and adding to the economic slowdown. Also coming up today The pound could be volatile tonight, as MPs vote on a series of Brexit amendments - including Graham Brady\u2019s plan to remove the Irish backstop, and Yvette Cooper\u2019s move to rule out No-Deal and force a delay to Brexit.

Hudson-Odoi had gone as far as to submit a written transfer request in person to the director Marina Granovskaia over the weekend in a bid to force through a move to Bayern, but has since been told he will not be sold in January.</p> \n  <p>Instead, the Premier League side will hope to use the next four months to convince the teenager that he will feature regularly for the first-team \u2013 he has yet to start a league game for the club \u2013 in the hope he eventually signs a new long-term deal. His current contract expires in 2020. Chelsea have the same attitude towards the likes of Loftus-Cheek and Ampadu, whose talent they hope to harness, and feared following up their initial interest in either Nicolo Barella at Cagliari or Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Leandro Paredes might have unsettled the youngsters. Paredes has since joined Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a345m.</p> \n  <p>There are big hopes, too, for Mount, whose performances on loan at Derby County in the Championship this season have been impressive and earned him a first call up to Gareth Southgate\u2019s full England squad in the autumn.

A deal will almost certainly get done with one of those three Championship clubs within the next 48 hours. Bournemouth are willing to let Mings go out on loan following the signing of Chris Mepham from Brentford, but the stumbling block at the moment is the Premier League club\u2019s financial demands. As things stand, Villa appear to be the slight favourites for Mings, who was Bournemouth\u2019s club-record signing when he joined from Ipswich Town in June 2015 for a fee in the region of \u00a39m. <strong>Derby County</strong> have also registered their interest but need to offload players before they can look at bringing anyone else in. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c503420e4b051f53796a4ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominicfifield\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T11:10:44.052Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Fulham</strong>\u2019s pursuit of defensive recruits may see them formalise their interest in Crystal Palace\u2019s under-used <strong>Scott Dann</strong> ahead of Thursday\u2019s transfer deadline. The centre-half, a mainstay of the Palace side since joining from Blackburn for around \u00a33.5m five years ago until suffering a serious knee injury in December 2017, was excellent alongside Martin Kelly in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round victory over Tottenham Hotspur. However, both defenders are behind James Tomkins and Mamadou Sakho when it comes to Premier League football at Selhurst Park.</p> \n  <p>While Dann will not actively agitate for a move, he is anxious for more regular game-time and that may make Fulham\u2019s interest appealing. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side already have two players on loan from rival top-flight clubs \u2013 Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Calum Chambers from Manchester United and Arsenal respectively \u2013 so would have to buy the 31-year-old outright, with Palace likely to seek in excess of \u00a310m for a player under contract until 2020 if they were to consider selling to a relegation rival. Dann earns around \u00a365,000-a-week.</p> \n  <p>Fulham had been expected to secure <strong>Gary Cahill </strong>from Chelsea, who were willing to loan their club captain out for the final six months of his contract before his departure on a free transfer in the summer as a recognition of his seven years\u2019 service to the club. However, the financial terms offered by the club currently 19th in the division were deemed unacceptable by the former England defender.</p> \n  <p>Palace have also looked at Cahill, who worked in the national set-up under Roy Hodgson, not least as a potential replacement for Dann, but would not be able to offer him guaranteed game-time given the impressive form of Tomkins and Sakho. Their interest situation could be revived in the summer, with Cahill likely now to see out the season on the fringes at Chelsea.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a87fe9dc2e2a454876abc7329ad6fcf6518c66cc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a87fe9dc2e2a454876abc7329ad6fcf6518c66cc/0_105_3812_2558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Palace\u2019s Scott Dann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal Palace\u2019s Scott Dann.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Impey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T11:17:10.631Z\">at 11.17am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c503270e4b024f0efeb0a43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-29T11:07:58.264Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Has Idrissa Gueye handed in a transfer request at Everton or not?</strong> The club have denied that he has but reports on Monday night suggested he\u2019d written to the powers that be begging them to let him leave after they knocked back a \u00a321.5m bid from <strong>PSG</strong>.

But if the once crafty winger and all-round nice guy who has been shuffled into the background under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r chooses to ignore the cash on offer it might attract a sneaky bid from an interested club. <strong>Juventus</strong> and <strong>Barcelona</strong> have reportedly been sniffing around.

Another midfielder who is reportedly the subject of interest from Premier League clubs including Leicester and Tottenham Hotspur, is Monaco\u2019s 21-year-old Belgium international <strong>Youri Tielelmans</strong>. His relationship with the returning<strong> </strong>Leonardo Jardim is frosty, by all accounts, and he wants out. A loan deal is most likely. And we\u2019ll keep an eye on <strong>Ivan Perisic </strong>too, who Inter say they haven\u2019t received an offer for despite strong interest from Arsenal, who may have to stump up \u00a335m for the forward.

      "bodyText": "On that bombshell, we\u2019re going to wrap up the blog. Here are the highlights from today. Arsenal have had a loan bid accepted for Barcelona\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez, but are still trying to secure an option for a permanent deal at the end of the season. Manchester United are in discussions with an unnamed Chinese club over the sale of Marouane Fellaini. Maurizio Sarri has received assurances from the Chelsea board that Callum Hudson-Odoi will not be sold. Mauricio Pochettino \u201cis not optimistic\u201d Spurs will sign anybody before Thursdays\u2019s deadline, despite their injury troubles. Newcastle are reportedly in talks to loan Benfica midfielder Andreas Samaris and Monaco left back Antonio Barreca. Leandro Paredes has been presented to the media following his \u00a334.7m move to PSG. There are apparently no service stations near Portsmouth. Thanks for reading. Tune in tomorrow for more transfer biz. See ya! Genoa have signed Hungarian midfielder Andras Schafer from MTK Budapest, having already signed Real Betis forward Antonio Sanabria, Chapecoense keeper Jandrei, Giuseppe Pezzella from Udinese and Stefano Sturaro on loan from Juventus. Absolute biz. Arsenal fans, where would you like to see Denis Su\u00e1rez fit into the side? He\u2019s a nice player, but not convinced his brings something different to your midfield. Looks likely to just be a short-term fix for Mkhitaryan. C\u00e9dric Soares signed for Inter on loan from Southampton on Saturday and has been speaking to the cameras for the first time. Reports are growing that Newcastle are in talks with Benfica over a loan move for midfielder Andreas Samaris and Monaco left back Antonio Barreca, who can\u2019t seem to get in a team that is 19th in Ligue 1. The Italian only joined Monaco in the summer and seems to Newcastle\u2019s preferred choice after a deal for Lazio Jordan Lukaku fell through due to a failed medical. Here is Callum Hudson Odoi visiting a cash and carry in Mitcham last night, nearby to where he grew up. He\u2019s put on the spot about staying at Chelsea by the owner. Looks uncomfortable. This is what it has come to. \u201cMichael, There are no service stations anywhere near Portsmouth. Dan Almond.\u201d The 17-year-old has signed a two-and-a-half year deal and will go straight into the under-23 side, although if this video is anything to go by, he won\u2019t be there too long. Fellaini, now Wagner. If you\u2019re 6ft4in and don\u2019t have an agent, please do get in touch. Some belated news from Argentina: Boca Juniors have signed Kevin Mac Allister, much to the delight of meme-lovers everywhere. Kevin apparently has ancestors from Fife, Scotland and is the son of former Boca player and Argentina international Carlos Mac Allister and brother of Brighton defender Alexis Mac Allister. Swansea City are expected to confirm Wilfried Bony\u2019s departure shortly. It is understood that a transfer has been agreed, believed to be with a club in the UAE. The news will be welcome at Swansea, given that Bony was earning \u00a3100,000 a week in the Championship. The Ivorian rejoined Swansea from Manchester City in August 2017 but scored only four goals in 26 appearances and his wages \u2013 there was no relegation clause in his contract \u2013 were a huge burden on the Welsh club. Never heard of them. \u201cFavourite of all time has to be Mike Duff, the D/M R/C from Cheltenham Town on CM01/02,\u201d emails Andrew Drinkwater. \u201cIn the game he would end up going to someone in Division One (as was) for 30k, going straight into the first team and turning into a dependable Premier League starter and international for years. He would usually end up retiring and going up back at Cheltenham as a manager. Clearly another example of how unrealistic and divorced from reality the game is.\u201d We have ourselves a joke! Duff is actually Cheltenham\u2019s current manager, with the club five points clear of the relegation zone in League Two and played (dependably) for Burnley in the Premier League and Northern Ireland. Martin Laurence has assembled a Premier League flop XI from the signings of last summer, with Leicester, Burnley and Fulham featuring prominently. Poch gets this afternoon\u2019s session on the transfer blog off to a flyer with the news that he is \u2018not optimistic at all\u2019 of Spurs making any January signings, despite their injury woes. Hello all. Nice to see John Fleck getting a mention, not just because he has been central to Sheffield United\u2019s promotion push, but also because he used to be one of the best wonderkids on Football Manager. As a 17-year-old, you could pick him for \u00a31m-\u00a32m from Rangers, back in 2009. Would always need a loan or two to reach his full potential, but was a class act. To save me from reporting on League One loan deals, who were your favourite FM/CM wonderkids? How are they getting on in 2019? Have you got any tip offs for me? Peter Crouch is in a service station just outside Portsmouth. That sort of thing. Hit me up: michael.butler@theguardian.com or tweet @michaelbutler18. Right, I\u2019m going to hand over to my colleague Michael Butler now. He\u2019ll guide you through the rest of the afternoon. I\u2019ll leave you with a tweet for Spurs fans to ponder: Bye. Sheffield United have turned down a \u00a34m offer from West Ham for terrier-like midfielder John Fleck, according to reports in the Sheffield Star. According to a Blades-supporting colleague of mine he\u2019s \u201cnot quite good enough for the Premier League\u201d so perhaps Declan Rice and Mark Noble ought not to fear losing their place in the team anytime soon. Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres has signed for Juventus on loan from Lazio for a loan fee of \u00a3520,000! He played over 50 games for Juve between 2012-2016 but what a strange career he has had. Have a look at his history. From August 2017 he\u2019s made one appearance at Southampton, then 14 at Hellas Verona and 10 games at Lazio. How has he made it back to Juve? Burnley\u2019s Ben Gibson is a target for Aston Villa but the centre-back would cost around \u00a315m and the Premier League club are reportedly reluctant to sell, having only signed him last summer. Gibson has made just one Premier League appearance after struggling to force his way back into the team following a hernia operation. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s story on Marouane Fellaini\u2019s potential move to China: And here\u2019s Barney Ronay on his \u201cgenuinely fascinating United career\u201d: J\u00fcrgen Klopp offered an optimistic update on Virgil van Dijk\u2019s fitness before the Leicester match tomorrow. The Liverpool centre-back has been ill since the club returned from a training camp in Dubai last week but was back on the pitch with the squad at Melwood on Tuesday. \u201cVirg was a little bit ill but he trained yesterday. He will train today and then we will see,\u201d said Klopp. Klopp has had a number of injury problems but most of the short-term problems have cleared up just in time. \u201cDejan (hamstring) is fine. Gini (Wijnaldum) trained, Fabinho will train today. Trent (Alexander-Arnold) getting closer and closer - looks all very positive \u2013 but will not be ready for tomorrow.\u201d Virg? And here\u2019s the story on Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s possible loan move to Arsenal. It\u2019s getting closer Gunners fans. Maurizio Sarri has received assurances from the Chelsea board that Callum Hudson-Odoi will not be sold in the summer transfer window, let alone ahead of Thursday\u2019s deadline, having already knocked back the player\u2019s transfer request this month. Hudson-Odoi had hoped to force through a move to Bayern Munich, who had tabled a number of bids up to \u00a335m for the 18-year-old\u2019s services, only to be informed by the Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia that his request had been rejected. The youth-team graduate played and scored against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday and is in the squad for tomorrow\u2019s Premier League game at AFC Bournemouth. Chelsea now have four months to persuade a player who has been with them since the age of seven and is contracted to 2020 to sign a new long-term deal at the club. \u201cI know the club told me that, in this window, he will remain with us for sure,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cVery probably also in the next. So we are really very happy with this. As I said, he is improving on the pitch and he is the future of our club and the future of English football. \u201cI am not frustrated (with the situation). On the pitch, he\u2019s doing very well: very well in training, very well in matches. So I\u2019m really very happy with him. I\u2019m not happy with the situation, of course, but I know very well that every big team here in England has the same problem. It\u2019s not easy to keep these young players. He is, of course, one of the best 18-year-olds in Europe, so it\u2019s very difficult. \u201cBut, as I said before, the club told me he is off the market. And, probably, he will be off the market in July, too. I don\u2019t know (if he\u2019ll be happy with that), but I can say what I see on the pitch. On the pitch at the moment, he\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Samuel Jones writes: \u201cMaybe this is my former Panini-loving self talking, but I\u2019d love to see more swap deals happening \u00e0 la Sanchez/Mkhitaryan. I\u2019m sure Arsenal fans would love an Ozil/Perisic trade right now.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Inter fans would Sam, but yes, you\u2019re right. More swaps please. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s lack of optimism about signings would suggest that perhaps Spurs are not serious contenders for the signature of Youri Tielemans. Leicester were reportedly in talks over a potential \u00a323m deal for the Monaco player. That means the Foxes could be back in the driving seat. Personally, I think he should sign for Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, whose fans should adopt a chant to this jaunty number: Mauricio Pochettino has been talking about his claim that silverware would serve only to \u201cbuild egos\u201d at Tottenham. He explains that \u201cegos\u201d is perhaps not as strong an expression in Spanish as it is in English. I know now that talk about ego is a negative expression in England, maybe in other countries we talk about it being more superficial. It\u2019s because in the past I\u2019ve been asked if winning a domestic cup will help the club to the next level. To win a Carabao Cup or FA Cup reach the next level, I cannot agree. Only I wanted to say how well we\u2019ve progressed in recent years. I want to win cups. I\u2019m not naive. It\u2019s tough for me because after three or four seasons we\u2019re always talking about the cups. I want to build my CV winning titles of course. I\u2019m the first who wants to win. I think in the last five years we\u2019ve played in four semi-finals and one final. If you ask me how to be in the next level it\u2019s improving our structure, the way we operate, the squad, the facilities. We tick almost all boxes. The fans that aren\u2019t happy, with perspective in the future they will appreciate everything everyone is doing for this football club. So, the question Spurs fans want answering is: are Spurs going to sign anyone then? You know how we work. The last minute everything can happen. You know about different players that maybe can leave the club, we\u2019ll have to see. I was very optimistic about some options to sign, but today \u2013 no. I am not optimistic. Plus \u00e7a change, Mauricio. Has Marouane Fellaini played his last game for Manchester United? The 31-year-old midfielder has been linked with a big-money move to the Chinese Super League despite Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r having said he expects all his players to remain in January. Fellaini is still recovering from a calf injury and is not expected to be involved in tonight\u2019s match at Burnley. Callum Hudson-Odoi has been told he will not be sold by Chelsea before Thursday\u2019s transfer deadline \u2013 or in the summer. The 18-year-old is out of contract in June 2020 and has been linked with a \u00a335m move to Bayern Munich. Chelsea on Monday reportedly turned down a transfer request from Hudson-Odoi, with head coach Maurizio Sarri reiterating to the club\u2019s stance on Tuesday. Asked about Callum Hudson-Odoi, Sarri said: As you know, I have not the power to sign new contracts here. On the pitch I am really very happy with him. I know the club told me that, in this window, he will remain with us for sure. Very probably also in the next. So we are really very happy with this. As I said, he is improving on the pitch and he is the future of our club and the future of English football. What does Sarri make of the Hudson-Odoi situation? Frustrated? Irritated? I am not frustrated. On the pitch, he\u2019s doing very well: very well in training, very well in matches. So I\u2019m really very happy with him. I\u2019m not happy with the situation, of course, but I know very well that every big team here in England has the same problem. It\u2019s not easy to keep these young players. He is, of course, one of the best 18-year-olds in Europe, so it\u2019s very difficult. But, as I said before, the club told me he is off the market, for sure. And, probably, he will be off the market in July, too. I don\u2019t know (if he\u2019ll be happy with that), but I can say what I see on the pitch. On the pitch at the moment, he\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Sarri is asked about Chelsea\u2019s forgotten man, Danny Drinkwater. Does he still train with the first team? Yes, of course. He is at the moment with us. As you know very well, because I told you my opinion about this player, he\u2019s a very good player. But I think he is more suitable for playing with two midfielders. He is not a central midfielder, he is not a centre-right in the midfield with three players. But he\u2019s a very good player in a 4-4-2. Can Sarri see him playing at Chelsea? Not at the moment, but I want to wait until the end of the market. Then I\u2019ll try with every player. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard is confident a deal to sign American midfielder Matt Polster from Chicago Fire will be completed before Thursday\u2019s transfer deadline. \u201cThat could be announced at any time,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cHe has travelled to France to get the work permit application complete. We are confident that one will happen.\u201d Gerrard confirmed that 21-year-old Jordan Rossiter is in talks with several clubs over a loan move. \u201cThere is a good, strong possibility he could go out on loan. He is speaking to a couple of different clubs and hopefully we can get him out, for the boy\u2019s sake, to go and play and get regular games. He has missed a lot of football so I\u2019m hoping to find the right solution for Jordan to get more game time. That could be announced in the coming days. I don\u2019t expect anyone else to go anywhere.\u201d You can keep up to speed with the latest deals and club-by-club guides for the top divisions in England, Spain, Italy, France and Germany with our snazzy transfer interactive. You\u2019ll have to scroll down to find the club-by-club guides but they are very useful. I\u2019ve just used it to discover that Marko Rog has joined Sevilla from Napoli. Rabbi Matondo looks highly likely to be the latest young British footballer to make the move to Bundesliga in order to play some regular football. The 18-year-old Wales international was in Dusseldorf on Monday evening and a deal of around \u00a311m is expected to be completed with Schalke in the next couple of days. Denis Su\u00e1rez is trying to force through a loan move to Arsenal. The 25-year-old midfielder has made only two La Liga appearances for the Spanish champions and is keen to play regular football again. Talks between Barcelona and Arsenal are at an advanced stage for a loan deal with an option to buy the player for \u20ac25m. \u00c1lvaro Morata has been talking to the press on his official unveiling at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. A video presentation features a picture of him as a child wearing an Atl\u00e9tico shirt and then the player speaks about how much he is looking forward to playing at the club he came through as a youngster. There was no need to convince me to come. Life takes many turns but I am here now and looking forward to training with my teammates, under Cholo\u2019s orders. I feel part of this club again. I do not feel like a new player, my teammates have written to me over these weeks when nothing was confirmed. That made me happy, and very proud too. On playing with Diego Costa: Diego is long-time team-mate with Spain, great player and a good friend. I have spoken with him when I have had difficult moments, him too. Why can we not play together? I am looking forward to seeing him at training, for sure he will have some jokes. Morata was not asked about Chelsea, though he was asked how he feels about facing his former clubs Real Madrid and Juventus in his first two home games. Diego is long-time teammate with Spain, great player and a good friend. I have spoken with him when I have had difficult moments, him too. Why can we not play together? I am looking forward to seeing him at training, for sure he will have some jokes.\u201d It\u2019s lunch time, so why not while away a few minutes with David Squires\u2019 cartoon, featuring Marko Arnautovic looking delighted to be staying at West Ham. Oh, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s always good. Wolves have been so impressed by on-loan Jonny Castro Otto, that they are prepared to part with a club record-equalling \u00a318m for the Spain full-back and are in talks with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid over making the deal permanent. The 24-year-old has never played for his parent club, having joined from Celta Vigo last summer for \u00a36.8m. Internazionale are not interested in signing Mesut \u00d6zil from Arsenal at the moment. The playmaker has been linked with a potential \u00a325m move to the Serie A club but if Arsenal are to see the player leave in this transfer window it will have to be to another suitor or they may have to pay \u00d6zil\u2019s wages in full to facilitate a possible loan move to Inter. The 30-year-old playmaker, who earns around \u00a3350,000 per week, has not been a regular in Unai Emery\u2019s Arsenal team and has appeared unsettled at times this season. Grant Leadbitter is heading back to his old stomping ground having left Middlesbrough and signed a two-and-a-half-year deal at Sunderland. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted to be back, I\u2019m buzzing. When you\u2019re a born-and-bred Sunderland fan and there\u2019s an opportunity to come back to the football club, well, I was never going to say no I can tell you that.\u201d There was interest in Leadbitter from Aston Villa and Blackburn but the chance to go home pulled on the old romantic\u2019s heartstrings. In five years\u2019 time I reckon Jordan Henderson will do the same. Leandro Paredes has been talking about his \u00a334.7m move to PSG: \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be joining Paris Saint-Germain. I now have this fantastic opportunity, not only to discover a new league, but... to wear one the most prestigious club jerseys in the world.\u201d And here\u2019s his masterclass in how to put on a football shirt: Stoke look set to follow up the signing of Danny Batth from Wolves by spending \u00a39m on Burnley\u2019s Sam Vokes. A fee has yet to be agreed but talks between the two clubs are ongoing and it is anticipated that Vokes, who turned 29 in October and has been in and out of the Burnley side this season, will complete a move to Stoke. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s desire to secure a replacement for the departed Cesc F\u00e0bregas may now go frustrated with Chelsea reluctant to recruit a midfielder this month for fear of unsettling the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mason Mount and Ethan Ampadu. Chelsea, who have seen Callum Hudson-Odoi pursued vigorously by Bayern Munich over the last month, want to offer their youth-team graduates encouragement that they can fulfil their senior ambitions at Stamford Bridge, not least with the prospect of a Fifa transfer ban hanging over the club. Hudson-Odoi had gone as far as to submit a written transfer request in person to the director Marina Granovskaia over the weekend in a bid to force through a move to Bayern, but has since been told he will not be sold in January. Instead, the Premier League side will hope to use the next four months to convince the teenager that he will feature regularly for the first-team \u2013 he has yet to start a league game for the club \u2013 in the hope he eventually signs a new long-term deal. His current contract expires in 2020. Chelsea have the same attitude towards the likes of Loftus-Cheek and Ampadu, whose talent they hope to harness, and feared following up their initial interest in either Nicolo Barella at Cagliari or Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Leandro Paredes might have unsettled the youngsters. Paredes has since joined Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a345m. There are big hopes, too, for Mount, whose performances on loan at Derby County in the Championship this season have been impressive and earned him a first call up to Gareth Southgate\u2019s full England squad in the autumn. The futures of Michy Batshuayi \u2013 who has returned from a loan spell at Valencia, but saw a move to AS Monaco fall through \u2013 Danny Drinkwater and Davide Zappacosta remain uncertain. Bournemouth\u2019s Tyrone Mings is a wanted man, with Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Nottingham Forest all trying to sign the 25-year-old on loan until the end of the season. A deal will almost certainly get done with one of those three Championship clubs within the next 48 hours. Bournemouth are willing to let Mings go out on loan following the signing of Chris Mepham from Brentford, but the stumbling block at the moment is the Premier League club\u2019s financial demands. As things stand, Villa appear to be the slight favourites for Mings, who was Bournemouth\u2019s club-record signing when he joined from Ipswich Town in June 2015 for a fee in the region of \u00a39m. Derby County have also registered their interest but need to offload players before they can look at bringing anyone else in. Fulham\u2019s pursuit of defensive recruits may see them formalise their interest in Crystal Palace\u2019s under-used Scott Dann ahead of Thursday\u2019s transfer deadline. The centre-half, a mainstay of the Palace side since joining from Blackburn for around \u00a33.5m five years ago until suffering a serious knee injury in December 2017, was excellent alongside Martin Kelly in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round victory over Tottenham Hotspur. However, both defenders are behind James Tomkins and Mamadou Sakho when it comes to Premier League football at Selhurst Park. While Dann will not actively agitate for a move, he is anxious for more regular game-time and that may make Fulham\u2019s interest appealing. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side already have two players on loan from rival top-flight clubs \u2013 Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Calum Chambers from Manchester United and Arsenal respectively \u2013 so would have to buy the 31-year-old outright, with Palace likely to seek in excess of \u00a310m for a player under contract until 2020 if they were to consider selling to a relegation rival. Dann earns around \u00a365,000-a-week. Fulham had been expected to secure Gary Cahill from Chelsea, who were willing to loan their club captain out for the final six months of his contract before his departure on a free transfer in the summer as a recognition of his seven years\u2019 service to the club. However, the financial terms offered by the club currently 19th in the division were deemed unacceptable by the former England defender. Palace have also looked at Cahill, who worked in the national set-up under Roy Hodgson, not least as a potential replacement for Dann, but would not be able to offer him guaranteed game-time given the impressive form of Tomkins and Sakho. Their interest situation could be revived in the summer, with Cahill likely now to see out the season on the fringes at Chelsea. Has Idrissa Gueye handed in a transfer request at Everton or not? The club have denied that he has but reports on Monday night suggested he\u2019d written to the powers that be begging them to let him leave after they knocked back a \u00a321.5m bid from PSG. He\u2019s certainly an important defensive presence in central midfield but Marco Silva still hasn\u2019t found the right formula so that his diligent work is rewarded. Tom Davies would certainly benefit if Gueye left \u2013 his progress has stalled this season after an impressive 18-month rise. Some worrying news for Liverpool fans now. Virgil Van Dijk still hasn\u2019t trained since returning from a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, where he picked up an illness. The commanding centre-back hasn\u2019t missed a Premier League game since last January but he\u2019s a serious doubt to face Leicester. Dejan Lovren is fit again, though, and may line up alongside Joel Matip if Van Dijk doesn\u2019t recover in time. Could Juan Mata be snapped up before the window shuts? It\u2019s understood that Manchester United have offered the 30-year-old a 12-month contract extension, thereby committing themselves to paying around \u00a3130,000 a week, or \u00a36.8m in total, just to avoid losing him on a free in the summer. But if the once crafty winger and all-round nice guy who has been shuffled into the background under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r chooses to ignore the cash on offer it might attract a sneaky bid from an interested club. Juventus and Barcelona have reportedly been sniffing around. Don\u2019t sound surprised. Bar\u00e7a signed Kevin-Prince Boateng, for heaven\u2019s sake! Some news from the Championship, where Stoke have completed the signing of Danny Batth from Wolves. The 28-year-old centre-back makes the short journey north after \u00a33m was exchanged between the clubs. Stoke manager Nathan Jones said: \u201cDanny is a dominant leader. He\u2019s got great pedigree having got promoted with Wolves last season. I think the environment needs freshening up with new signings and Danny will do just that.\u201d Meanwhile, Batth has revealed that Benik Afobe sweet-talked him into the move. \u201cI managed to get a few minutes with Benik on the phone. I\u2019ve played with him twice in different spells at Wolves \u2013 I know him really well and we\u2019ve kept in touch. He spoke volumes about the club and what the new manager is trying to do.\u201d Good morning readers! The clock keeps ticking down towards the transfer deadline at 11pm GMT on Thursday and clubs have so far been reluctant to do much business. PSG have been active this morning \u2013 the French champions have completed the transfer of Leandro Paredes from Zenit St Petersburg for \u00a334.7m. Chelsea had been linked with the 24-year-old midfielder as a replacement for Cesc F\u00e0bregas, but they will have to look elsewhere now and, as mentioned in The Rumour Mill, Barcelona\u2019s Ivan Rakitic is on their radar. Another midfielder who is reportedly the subject of interest from Premier League clubs including Leicester and Tottenham Hotspur, is Monaco\u2019s 21-year-old Belgium international Youri Tielelmans. His relationship with the returning Leonardo Jardim is frosty, by all accounts, and he wants out. A loan deal is most likely. And we\u2019ll keep an eye on Ivan Perisic too, who Inter say they haven\u2019t received an offer for despite strong interest from Arsenal, who may have to stump up \u00a335m for the forward. He\u2019s 30 this Saturday. That doesn\u2019t seem likely.",

Three years after the previous disaster, water from the affected Doce River is still legally unfit for human consumption in 90% of monitoring stations.</p> \n<p>A second and bigger impact is the amplification by previous manmade environmental problems. The torrent of water stirred up the heavy metals buried in the sediment on the bottom of the river. This is a huge problem in the state of Minas Gerais, which has a long history of poorly regulated resource extraction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is working on a series of reports on the ecological impact of the previous tailings dam collapse in Mariana.</p> \n<p>The immediate threat is to the 280km (174 miles) of Paraopeba River. Vale insists the problem will not spread to the S\u00e3o Francisco basin, but conservationists remain concerned. In this region, 64% of fish species are found nowhere else on Earth, according to the IUCN. Even before the contamination, 10% were already classified as vulnerable, including <em><a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/167679/6366763\">Simpsonichthys picturatus</a></em><a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/167679/6366763\"> </a>and<em> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/167744/6375829\">Brycon orthotaenia</a></em><a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/167744/6375829\">.</a> January is the end of the spawning season, which means the deluge affected fry and small fish in important species for fisheries, such as croakers, curimbat\u00e1s and surubins.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc90af90cd395af5d53924b1208d7ba7137f2b6e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc90af90cd395af5d53924b1208d7ba7137f2b6e/180_0_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jair Bolsonaro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, surveys the damage from the Vale mine collapse near the town of Brumadinho.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isac Nobrega/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The slurry is expected to reach the hydropower plant at Retiro Baixo by Thursday, where the authorities hope it can be controlled in the reservoir without spreading down to the estuary and into the ocean, as happened in the case of the Mariana disaster.

      "bodyText": "The Brazilian government has been urged to step up punishments for environmental crimes after the deadliest mining disaster in decades. The torrent of mud and iron ore tailings that engulfed the community of Brumadinho on Friday continues to inflict a toll on residents, river systems and freshwater species. Rescue teams had by Monday recovered 60 bodies near the site, which is operated by Vale, one of the world\u2019s biggest mining companies, but hundreds of people are still missing. Many were eating lunch or resting in a hotel when the tailings dam collapsed and swept them away in a tide of orange sludge. It is the second such calamity to strike a Vale facility in the state of Minas Gerais in less than four years. In 2015, 19 people were killed when a tailings dam burst at an iron ore mine in Mariana that the Brazilian company co-owned with the London-listed BHP Group. The amount of slurry this time is 75% lower, at 13 million cubic metres, but now, as then, the ecological damage is spreading far beyond the immediate area and could potentially persist for many years with grave consequences for local communities, wildlife and the national economy. Over the weekend, TV and social networks were filled with images of emergency workers in helicopters trying to pull people out of the mud. Now many posts have switched to the impact on fish, frogs and other freshwater species. \u201cRio Paraopeba has started to die,\u201d noted one grim tweet with a video clip of oxygen-deprived fish leaping out of the turbid water and flapping their last on the land. The level of toxicity in the tailings is not yet clear, but iron oxide can choke river sand and poison the surrounding vegetation. It can also compact the soil, preventing new growth of plants on land. Three years after the previous disaster, water from the affected Doce River is still legally unfit for human consumption in 90% of monitoring stations. A second and bigger impact is the amplification by previous manmade environmental problems. The torrent of water stirred up the heavy metals buried in the sediment on the bottom of the river. This is a huge problem in the state of Minas Gerais, which has a long history of poorly regulated resource extraction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is working on a series of reports on the ecological impact of the previous tailings dam collapse in Mariana. The immediate threat is to the 280km (174 miles) of Paraopeba River. Vale insists the problem will not spread to the S\u00e3o Francisco basin, but conservationists remain concerned. In this region, 64% of fish species are found nowhere else on Earth, according to the IUCN. Even before the contamination, 10% were already classified as vulnerable, including Simpsonichthys picturatus and Brycon orthotaenia. January is the end of the spawning season, which means the deluge affected fry and small fish in important species for fisheries, such as croakers, curimbat\u00e1s and surubins. The slurry is expected to reach the hydropower plant at Retiro Baixo by Thursday, where the authorities hope it can be controlled in the reservoir without spreading down to the estuary and into the ocean, as happened in the case of the Mariana disaster. Hydropower generation and water supplies are likely to be affected for years. The costs have yet to be calculated. After the previous calamity, Vale and Billiton paid $1bn into land and river recuperation efforts and more in an out-of-court settlement to affected communities. Fishing is still prohibited so stocks can recover and a dam remains disrupted. A separate lawsuit in now under way in UK courts. Campaigners say it is essential to tighten regulations and punish those involved. \u201cGood environmental regulation isn\u2019t about adding costs to development, it\u2019s about safeguarding people and avoiding massive clean-up costs like the ones we are now seeing,\u201d said Stewart Maginnis, the director of the nature-based solutions group in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

      "body": "<p>The Football Association has launched an investigation into claims Sol Campbell was subjected to homophobic abuse during Macclesfield\u2019s visit to Cheltenham on Saturday.</p> <p>It comes after several Cheltenham fans wrote about chants directed towards the away manager on social media after the match, which the home side won 3-2.</p> <p>One supporter tweeted that \u201cthe homophobic chants and references towards Sol Campbell were disgusting. Disappointed the stewards didn\u2019t seem to do anything\u201d. Another said: \u201cIt was horrendous. And not for the first time this season. Cheltenham need to nip it before it happens again.\u201d</p> <p>Cheltenham\u2019s fan-elected director Dave Beesley also confirmed to the Gloucester Live website he had received \u201ca few emails from fans\u201d complaining of homophobia at the game.</p> <p>Cheltenham could not be reached for comment. However in a statement on its website the club said it wanted to remind all supporters \u201cthat it is against the law to shout or chant abuse on the grounds of ability or disability; age; gender; gender reassignment; marital status or civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race, nationality or ethnicity; religion or belief; or sexual orientation.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Equality Act 2010 it is an offence to make reference to the above protected characteristics in abusive terms and doing so could lead to arrest and prosecution,\u201d it added.</p> <p>The club made no reference to the abuse allegedly directed towards Campbell. However it confirmed it was undertaking a thorough review of its operations.</p> <p>\u201cSupporters are urged to report any such abuse to the nearest steward as quickly as possible,\u201d they said. \u201cPlease assist us in making the Jonny-Rocks Stadium a place where everyone can watch football without having to endure discriminatory abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this season the Ebbsfleet goalkeeper Nathan Ashmore said he felt like walking off the pitch when his team lost 2-0 to Cheltenham owing to the level of abuse, adding: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009 a 42-year-old man and a 13-year-old boy were convicted of indecent chanting at Campbell, when he was playing for Portsmouth against Spurs, which included homophobic abuse such as \u201cCome on gay boy, that\u2019s my gay boy\u201d. Four others also pleaded guilty to abusing the defender. At their trial, video footage contained other abusive chants shouted by up to 2,500 fans, including: \u201cSol, Sol, wherever you may be, not long now until lunacy, we won\u2019t give a fuck if you are hanging from a tree,\u201d; \u201cSol\u2019s a wanker\u201d; and other abuse.</p> <p>Neither Campbell or Macclesfield has yet commented on the FA investigation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Football Association has launched an investigation into claims Sol Campbell was subjected to homophobic abuse during Macclesfield\u2019s visit to Cheltenham on Saturday. It comes after several Cheltenham fans wrote about chants directed towards the away manager on social media after the match, which the home side won 3-2. One supporter tweeted that \u201cthe homophobic chants and references towards Sol Campbell were disgusting. Disappointed the stewards didn\u2019t seem to do anything\u201d. Another said: \u201cIt was horrendous. And not for the first time this season. Cheltenham need to nip it before it happens again.\u201d Cheltenham\u2019s fan-elected director Dave Beesley also confirmed to the Gloucester Live website he had received \u201ca few emails from fans\u201d complaining of homophobia at the game. Cheltenham could not be reached for comment. However in a statement on its website the club said it wanted to remind all supporters \u201cthat it is against the law to shout or chant abuse on the grounds of ability or disability; age; gender; gender reassignment; marital status or civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race, nationality or ethnicity; religion or belief; or sexual orientation. \u201cUnder the Equality Act 2010 it is an offence to make reference to the above protected characteristics in abusive terms and doing so could lead to arrest and prosecution,\u201d it added. The club made no reference to the abuse allegedly directed towards Campbell. However it confirmed it was undertaking a thorough review of its operations. \u201cSupporters are urged to report any such abuse to the nearest steward as quickly as possible,\u201d they said. \u201cPlease assist us in making the Jonny-Rocks Stadium a place where everyone can watch football without having to endure discriminatory abuse.\u201d Earlier this season the Ebbsfleet goalkeeper Nathan Ashmore said he felt like walking off the pitch when his team lost 2-0 to Cheltenham owing to the level of abuse, adding: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy.\u201d In 2009 a 42-year-old man and a 13-year-old boy were convicted of indecent chanting at Campbell, when he was playing for Portsmouth against Spurs, which included homophobic abuse such as \u201cCome on gay boy, that\u2019s my gay boy\u201d. Four others also pleaded guilty to abusing the defender. At their trial, video footage contained other abusive chants shouted by up to 2,500 fans, including: \u201cSol, Sol, wherever you may be, not long now until lunacy, we won\u2019t give a fuck if you are hanging from a tree,\u201d; \u201cSol\u2019s a wanker\u201d; and other abuse. Neither Campbell or Macclesfield has yet commented on the FA investigation.",

It may well be the coach has little option but to revert to that arrangement, unless he chooses to play Slade and Tuilagi together for the first time.</p> \n<p>As well as Brad Shields and Joe Cokanasiga, both ruled out of contention by niggling injuries, Jones has released seven other players back to their clubs. The forwards Dan Cole, Jack Singleton, Ben Moon and Ben Earl and the backs Jonathan Joseph, Ollie Devoto and Ollie Thorley are all surplus to requirements, leaving 25 players vying to make England\u2019s matchday squad.</p> \n<p>England have also retained all four of their available locks, clearly mindful of the lineout threat posed by Ireland, with Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie in line to add extra energy off the bench.</p> \n<p>No one, however, is keener for Saturday to arrive than Tuilagi, who has made only two appearances off the bench since his last Test start in New Zealand in June 2014 after a grim succession of injuries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6d5344d3-42cf-498c-96ad-b8ecea2a9c6b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Simon Easterby insists Ireland have precious little interest in England\u2019s verbal assaults before their Six Nations opener in Dublin on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The England defence coach, John Mitchell, claimed Ireland will try \u201cto bore the shit out of us\u201d at the Aviva Stadium.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s Six Nations preparations have been dealt a significant blow by an injury to their powerful centre Ben Te\u2019o. The Worcester player had been expected to start against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday but has been ruled out with a side strain, forcing Eddie Jones to reshuffle his midfield plans. Following the injury, sustained during training in Portugal, it is now all but certain Manu Tuilagi will make his first Six Nations start in almost six years. Jones, however, must review his midfield options yet again and choose between moving his captain, Owen Farrell, to 12 or pairing Tuilagi with Exeter\u2019s Henry Slade. England\u2019s management tried to play down the implications of Te\u2019o\u2019s absence, pointing out George Ford and Farrell were the first choice 10-12 pairing for the first two years of Jones\u2019s tenure. It may well be the coach has little option but to revert to that arrangement, unless he chooses to play Slade and Tuilagi together for the first time. As well as Brad Shields and Joe Cokanasiga, both ruled out of contention by niggling injuries, Jones has released seven other players back to their clubs. The forwards Dan Cole, Jack Singleton, Ben Moon and Ben Earl and the backs Jonathan Joseph, Ollie Devoto and Ollie Thorley are all surplus to requirements, leaving 25 players vying to make England\u2019s matchday squad. England have also retained all four of their available locks, clearly mindful of the lineout threat posed by Ireland, with Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie in line to add extra energy off the bench. No one, however, is keener for Saturday to arrive than Tuilagi, who has made only two appearances off the bench since his last Test start in New Zealand in June 2014 after a grim succession of injuries. Now 27, there have been times when Tuilagi\u2019s long-awaited return to the England midfield seemed destined not to happen. This season he has managed to string together a series of games for Leicester and looks as excited at the prospect of his 28th cap as he was before his debut in 2011. \u201cManu\u2019s been looking brilliant,\u201d the England assistant coach, Neal Hatley, said. \u201cHe\u2019s trained exceptionally well in the midfield for us and he\u2019s in a really good space. He\u2019s a physical player and guys like playing alongside blokes like that. He definitely has a positive effect \u2026 he brings a different element to how the team feels and plays.\u201d Jones and his staff, even so, could have done without Te\u2019o being removed from the equation in the buildup to such a huge game. Ireland may not be too broken-hearted to see Farrell redeployed at inside-centre, although Hatley denies England\u2019s prospects have been fatally compromised. \u201cIt\u2019s not as big as you\u2019d think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Ben is the only player who has run at 12 for us.

      "bodyText": "Environmental laws that formally protect the endangered black-throated finch have also sanctioned the broadscale destruction of its natural habitat, leaving the species at risk of extinction, a new study says. The study, led by University of Queensland research fellow April Reside, and published on Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science and Policy, charts the exile of the black-throated finch from more than 80% of its former range. It reveals that 775 projects overlapping the finch\u2019s habitat were referred to the federal government for assessment under the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Act since 2000. Only one was refused because of an unacceptable impact on the finch. \u201cAll these projects proposed for the finch\u2019s habitat were assessed independently, so the cumulative impact is not properly considered. It\u2019s death by a thousand cuts,\u201d Reside said. \u201cOften, extinctions happen because we just weren\u2019t watching. This time, we have charted the steep decline of this Australian bird \u2013 but so far, we have permitted it to continue.\u201d The finch is listed as endangered under the provisions of the EPBC Act. But in almost 20 years since the act was introduced, the bird has retreated from its former range, which stretched from north Queensland to northern NSW. It remains on two primary sites. One site is near Townsville. The second is in the Galilee Basin, where five proposed coalmines have approval to further clear and degrade areas of high-quality finch habitat. Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine still requires Queensland government approval for a conservation management plan to protect the finch \u2013 one of the significant roadblocks preventing the company from starting construction work. Adani has claimed it is being treated unfairly in relation to the finch, that it has been subjected to reviews and required to satisfy conditions beyond those of other projects. This week Adani\u2019s Australian mining head, Lucas Dow, told the Courier-Mail that \u201cmining projects create security of habitat that otherwise would not exist\u201d. Adani plans to set aside 33,000 hectares of land as conservation offsets. The study questions the effectiveness of offsets, which have commonly been required in the past when a development or project is predicted to have a detrimental impact on finch habitat. It says existing offsets have been found to be \u201cof low habitat value\u201d. \u201cIn short, the offsets [proposed by Adani] appear unlikely to generate either the habitat improvement or the habitat protection benefits that were estimated, but even if they did, the net result of the approved losses and the offsets would be an enduring reduction in [black-throated finch] habitat. \u201cWe urge that mechanisms to protect habitat for threatened species, as well as plans for offsets where habitat loss does go ahead, should be focused on ecological outcomes that support species recovery.\u201d The study says the \u201cbest-known remaining habitat\u201d for the finch is at the Carmichael mine site, where Adani has approval to clear or degrade about 6,000ha of \u201ccritical habitat\u201d. \u201cWith so much of the habitat that once existed cleared or degraded, the remaining patches of habitat become increasingly important to the species\u2019 persistence,\u201d the study said. At least three vertebrate species have gone extinct in the past decade. \u201cAustralia and Queensland have laws to protect the environment, and together they are supposed to protect threatened species habitat,\u201d says Reside. \u201cBut they\u2019re failing to do just that. With large-scale habitat destruction still being approved by governments, the finch may be next.\u201d",

So says an advert on ITV and backed by the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets and Birds Eye, with endorsements from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/hughfearnleywhittingstall\" title=\"\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall </a>and Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>The 60-second advert is set up like an action film, in which a storm of vegetable baddies invade \u2013 torpedoing carrots, a car pelted by rogue brussels sprouts. The nation\u2019s children are then called upon to \u201cEat them to defeat them\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/veg-power-eat-defeat-them-adam-eve-ddb/1523961\" title=\"\">The campaign, by ad agency Adam &amp; EveDBB</a> (of John Lewis Christmas advert fame) has been given \u00a32m of airtime on ITV and will feature in cinemas and on billboards. But do we really want children to view vegetables as bad guys? Surely there are better ways to get reluctant children to eat their greens? Here\u2019s how.</p> <h2><strong>1. Be casual</strong><br></h2> <p>Never tell, encourage, pester or bribe your children to eat vegetables. If you do, you\u2019re simply inviting them into a power battle. You may get a mouthful of sweetcorn or a few pieces of carrot inside them, but it\u2019s a short-term fix. Instead, just put the vegetables on their plates and act as if you couldn\u2019t care less whether they eat them or not. When you make a child eat vegetables, they perceive you as the winner and them as the loser, so when they have the freedom to choose whether to eat them or not, they will generally choose to win by not eating them.</p> <h2><strong>2. Exposure is key</strong><br></h2> <p>Keep presenting a wide variety of vegetables boldly and proudly \u2013 whether they eat them or not. If vegetables always come in a squeezy pouch or hidden in a pasta sauce, you can\u2019t expect them to eat a plate of courgettes or swede when they come eye to eye with them in the flesh. Exposure to vegetables is a vital first step in making your child comfortable and familiar with them. You might have to offer them one particular vegetable many times before they are receptive to the idea of eating it. It\u2019s worth the effort.</p> <h2><strong>3. Keep their preferences as preferences. </strong><br></h2> <p>Just because you have noticed they prefer sweetcorn to peas, don\u2019t stop giving them peas. Otherwise, before you know it, those preferences will have solidified into likes and don\u2019t likes.</p> <h2><strong>4. Lessen the competition</strong><br></h2> <p>Present them a mini-starter of raw vegetables such as carrot, cucumber, olives, tomatoes and peppers in a ramekin or dipping-sauce bowl before dinner while they are still playing or watching TV. Not only is this when they are at their hungriest, the vegetables aren\u2019t competing on their plates with other foods they like more.</p> <p><em>Claire Potter is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/getting-the-little-blighters-to-eat.html\" title=\"\">Getting the Little Blighters to Eat: Change Your Children from Fussy Eaters Into Foodies</a></em></p>",

So says an advert on ITV and backed by the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets and Birds Eye, with endorsements from Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver. The 60-second advert is set up like an action film, in which a storm of vegetable baddies invade \u2013 torpedoing carrots, a car pelted by rogue brussels sprouts. The nation\u2019s children are then called upon to \u201cEat them to defeat them\u201d. The campaign, by ad agency Adam &amp; EveDBB (of John Lewis Christmas advert fame) has been given \u00a32m of airtime on ITV and will feature in cinemas and on billboards. But do we really want children to view vegetables as bad guys? Surely there are better ways to get reluctant children to eat their greens? Here\u2019s how. 1. Be casual Never tell, encourage, pester or bribe your children to eat vegetables. If you do, you\u2019re simply inviting them into a power battle. You may get a mouthful of sweetcorn or a few pieces of carrot inside them, but it\u2019s a short-term fix. Instead, just put the vegetables on their plates and act as if you couldn\u2019t care less whether they eat them or not. When you make a child eat vegetables, they perceive you as the winner and them as the loser, so when they have the freedom to choose whether to eat them or not, they will generally choose to win by not eating them. 2. Exposure is key Keep presenting a wide variety of vegetables boldly and proudly \u2013 whether they eat them or not. If vegetables always come in a squeezy pouch or hidden in a pasta sauce, you can\u2019t expect them to eat a plate of courgettes or swede when they come eye to eye with them in the flesh. Exposure to vegetables is a vital first step in making your child comfortable and familiar with them. You might have to offer them one particular vegetable many times before they are receptive to the idea of eating it. It\u2019s worth the effort. 3. Keep their preferences as preferences. Just because you have noticed they prefer sweetcorn to peas, don\u2019t stop giving them peas. Otherwise, before you know it, those preferences will have solidified into likes and don\u2019t likes. 4. Lessen the competition Present them a mini-starter of raw vegetables such as carrot, cucumber, olives, tomatoes and peppers in a ramekin or dipping-sauce bowl before dinner while they are still playing or watching TV. Not only is this when they are at their hungriest, the vegetables aren\u2019t competing on their plates with other foods they like more.

One member of the archbishops\u2019 council, the Rev Ian Paul, suggested church leaders were \u201callowing themselves to be hijacked by these very small special interest groups\u201d.</p> <p>Now 2,155 clergy and senior lay members of the church have demanded the guidance be revised, postponed or withdrawn, saying \u201cthe notion of gender transition is highly contested in wider society\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.responsetohob.co.uk\">Their letter</a> to bishops says: \u201cGender dysphoria is an emotionally painful experience that requires understanding, support and compassion.

These ideas continue to be widely contested, with well-intentioned and thoughtful people on all sides of the debate.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cThe many ordinary parents and teachers who now express concern about these new theories do not wish to cause harm to the tiny number of children afflicted by gender dysphoria; but neither do they want to harm the potentially large numbers of children by potentially imposing untried and untested ideas on young children.\u201d</p> <p>Paul, an evangelical member of the general synod, said the letter highlighted \u201creally important doctrinal, liturgy and pastoral issues that have not been adequately addressed\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe fact that so many, from a wide range of traditions in the church, have been prepared to put their heads above the parapet is an indication of the strength of concern expressed here.\u201d</p> <p>Another signatory, Edward Dowler, archdeacon of Hastings, who is from the Anglo-Catholic tradition, said church leaders \u201cmight have been more circumspect about appearing to lend their support to an increasingly high-profile ideological movement whose aims and methods sit uncomfortably with the Christian gospel and are now being increasingly questioned throughout western society\u201d.</p> <p>Members of the general synod last year urged the church to go further in welcoming transgender people.

The guidance was criticised by a group of bishops who described it as \u201ctheologically and pastorally questionable\u201d. One member of the archbishops\u2019 council, the Rev Ian Paul, suggested church leaders were \u201callowing themselves to be hijacked by these very small special interest groups\u201d. Now 2,155 clergy and senior lay members of the church have demanded the guidance be revised, postponed or withdrawn, saying \u201cthe notion of gender transition is highly contested in wider society\u201d. Their letter to bishops says: \u201cGender dysphoria is an emotionally painful experience that requires understanding, support and compassion. In recent years controversial new theories about the relationship between biological sex and the social meaning of gender have been linked to gender dysphoria. These ideas continue to be widely contested, with well-intentioned and thoughtful people on all sides of the debate.\u201d It adds: \u201cThe many ordinary parents and teachers who now express concern about these new theories do not wish to cause harm to the tiny number of children afflicted by gender dysphoria; but neither do they want to harm the potentially large numbers of children by potentially imposing untried and untested ideas on young children.\u201d Paul, an evangelical member of the general synod, said the letter highlighted \u201creally important doctrinal, liturgy and pastoral issues that have not been adequately addressed\u201d. He said: \u201cThe fact that so many, from a wide range of traditions in the church, have been prepared to put their heads above the parapet is an indication of the strength of concern expressed here.\u201d Another signatory, Edward Dowler, archdeacon of Hastings, who is from the Anglo-Catholic tradition, said church leaders \u201cmight have been more circumspect about appearing to lend their support to an increasingly high-profile ideological movement whose aims and methods sit uncomfortably with the Christian gospel and are now being increasingly questioned throughout western society\u201d. Members of the general synod last year urged the church to go further in welcoming transgender people. But some conservatives believe gender is assigned by God and cannot be changed. Tina Beardsley, a trans clergy member who was consulted on the guidelines, said it was important to be given official recognition by the church. \u201cThis guidance arose from a decision at the general synod which was passed by an overwhelming majority. The signatories to the letter can\u2019t accept this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThe advice is to use the affirmation of baptismal faith service to reaffirm someone\u2019s faith post-transition with the name they have adopted. That\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about. There is an anti-trans narrative in this letter which is unhealthy, stigmatising and fear-mongering.\u201d George Haggett, a trans pastoral assistant, said: \u201cMy main qualm is so much of this discussion is taking place above trans people\u2019s heads. The letter is not free from transphobia by any stretch of the imagination, and there is a nasty suggestion that trans people are causing harm to their families. This is not being done in good faith.\u201d The C of E says its guidance does not propose \u201ctransgender baptism services\u201d but that clergy could use existing liturgy for baptism \u201cin a creative and sensitive way\u201d to mark a person\u2019s gender transition. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe bishops will give the letter their serious consideration, especially in the context of the preparation of a major new set of teaching and learning resources on identity, relationships, marriage and sexuality, Living in Love and Faith, which will be published next year. The guidance is not a restatement or a new statement on matters relating to gender, nor does it change the C of E\u2019s teaching.\u201d",

Andy Street, who ran John Lewis before his election in 2017 as the mayor of the UK\u2019s second-biggest urban economy, said the current system of business rates on commercial properties was no longer representative of modern Britain. Speaking at a conference in London, he said: \u201c[It] does not reflect the retail market and indeed how other companies make profit. There does need to be a much more complete review of how profit is achieved in the business sector. \u201cBusiness rates fall disproportionately on the high street. Ever since I was MD of John Lewis, we have been lobbying for some further changes to business rates than have currently occurred.\u201d It comes amid growing pressure on the government to overhaul how UK business properties are taxed, as more retail activity shifts online with the growth of internet firms such as Amazon, which typically require less physical space to sell goods and employ fewer workers. Amazon recently confirmed it paid UK business rates of only \u00a363.4m, almost \u00a340m less than Next, despite the US company recording more than double the sales in the UK of the clothing and home retailer. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced measures at the budget in autumn to cut business rates for small firms, while also introducing a \u201cdigital services tax\u201d on internet retailers, saying they needed to \u201cpay their fair share\u201d in Britain. Street said the help for small firms announced in the budget were \u201ca good first start, but I wouldn\u2019t describe it as any more than that\u201d. Traditional retailers have lurched further into crisis after a difficult Christmas trading period, reflected in growing numbers of retail companies filing for insolvency. Official figures on Tuesday showed a rise in company insolvencies to 4,725 in the last quarter. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said business rates were an \u201cunfair\u201d tax on small companies and contributed to more companies going bust. \u201cAmid the ongoing uncertainty as to what the UK\u2019s relationship will look like with the EU after the 29 March 2019, SMEs are under the cosh more than ever and it\u2019s time that action was taken to prevent more businesses going insolvent in the future,\u201d he said. Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who has conducted two reviews of the UK high street, said the system of business rates \u201cshould be abolished, [as] it does not work\u201d. Speaking alongside Andy Street at the conference, held by the Key Cities group of 24 mid-sized towns and cities, he urged a sales tax to replace business rates in order to reflect the shifting way consumers buy products. \u201cAmazon is in the room, and it is an elephant,\u201d he said. Grimsey also said he thought that Marks &amp; Spencer clothes shops would disappear from the high street within five years, while supermarkets would need only half the space they have today by 2030. Other struggling retailers, such as Debenhams, would also cease to exist, he said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to shop in these places for household conveniences and things that they do not need to touch to buy,\u201d he added.

On Monday, a New York bankruptcy judge signed off on subpoenas submitted by the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy of the Bahamas music festival, which collapsed in chaos and discord before it had even got under way last April, requesting \u201cinformation regarding the [Fyre Media\u2019s] financial affairs from third parties\u201d. That is likely to include Jenner, who, as a leading fashion \u201cinfluencer\u201d was reportedly paid $250,000 for a single Instagram post announcing the launch of ticket sales and offering her followers a discount code, and model management firms IMG Models and DNA Model Management, which represent many of about 25 models who were paid to star in promotional video for what was billed as an exclusive weekend event with gourmet food, luxury accommodations and world-class concerts. Festival-goers, who had paid between $1,000 and $12,500 for a ticket, found little by way of entertainment or cavorting supermodels for company on the Exumas island that had reputedly been once owned by Colombian cocaine lord Pablo Escobar. As two documentaries released this month have graphically, and sometimes hilariously depicted, the festival\u2019s accommodations were rain-soaked refugee tents and the food little more than grim-looking cheese sandwiches. To make matters worse, festival goers had no means of getting home. In the fallout, festival organiser Billy McFarland pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges relating to the festival and in July pleaded guilty to various fraud charges stemming from a separate ticket selling operation, and sentenced to six years in federal prison. A separate civil lawsuit naming McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins, brought by festival goers Matthew Herlihy and Anthony Lauriello claims the two men \u201cknowingly lured attendees with false and fraudulent pretenses, in which the festival could not compare to\u201d. They claim the event bore no resemblance to the event conjured up by Fyre\u2019s \u201cglossy\u201d marketing and was instead an \u201cunplanned, unorganized, disaster-stricken area\u201d that organizers continued promoting until the day some of the 7,000 expected attendees began to arrive on the island. But any efforts to reclaim money from the women who signed on to promote the event may be hard-won. Despite a crackdown in 2017 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that warned celebrities and influencers must be clear about when their posts have been paid for, they cannot be held responsible for the product or event itself. The Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman released a statement saying investors and customers lost about $26m in the scam. At the hearing this week, Gregory Messer, the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy of Fyre Media, said the task of unpicking exactly what had gone wrong had been \u201cchallenging\u201d considering the lack of basic disclosures, bankruptcy schedules and a statement of financial affairs from the organisers. According to Women\u2019s Wear Daily, payments totaling more than $5.2m were paid out to multiple recipients, including $1.2m to IMG models and $275,000 to Jenner. Of the 24 people in question, Fyre Media paid each one no less than $90,000. Messer said the recipients are needed for questioning \u201cto gain a full understanding of the reasons for these transfers\u201d. But while the supermodels were warned away from the event as it began to collapse, some were quick to apologise \u2013 and to establish that they had nothing to do with the failure. Bella Hadid shared on Twitter, \u201ceven though this was not my project what so ever\u201d she \u201cinitially trusted this would be an amazing &amp; memorable experience for all of us\u201d.

      "bodyText": "This week started with me reporting a couple of things that many in Liverpool already know \u2013 that their city has been ravaged by the austerity agenda of the past nine years, and that the Conservatives don\u2019t care too much about them and their lives. Most people in this city know it \u2013 and most people are angry about it \u2013 but this week\u2019s report into local council funding cuts by the Centre for Cities thinktank brought into sharp focus just how unfair this all is. The stark statistics are there for all to see. Since the coalition government formed in 2010, the people of Liverpool have shouldered the burden of the equivalent of an \u00a3816 per head fall in day-to-day public spending. Compare that with Oxford, where the figure has actually gone up by \u00a3115 during the same period, and you start to understand why people around here feel they are on their own. And that feeling is plain to see in the cash-strapped corridors of hamstrung power at Liverpool city council. The city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, is a colourful and outspoken character who often divides opinion, but he has been consistent in calling out the unfairness of a funding formula that means his authority will lose a staggering \u00a3444m between 2010 and 2020 \u2013 that\u2019s 64% of the council\u2019s overall budget. There is an unfair criticism often levelled at Scousers that they are always complaining about how they are treated. But following the \u201cmanaged decline\u201d of the city during the Thatcher years, Liverpool is now facing a situation where government funding could essentially fall off a cliff altogether after 2020. Add to that the problems faced by thousands of people and families who have been switched over to the flawed universal credit system, and you have a perfect storm of residents in need and a local authority without the means to protect them. Walking around Liverpool, you will come across plenty of plaques and engravings that testify to the huge part that European Union funding has played in reconstructing this proud city after the destructive period of industrial decline during the 1980s. So you can see why a brutal Brexit is the last thing anyone around here wants. As Anderson will tell you, the perilous state of the city\u2019s finances means new and sometimes risky ideas have to be floated each day. His big policy is \u201cinvest to earn\u201d \u2013 with the council purchasing assets, making investments and attempting to instigate regeneration around the city in order to create cash to pump back into its diminishing coffers. Sometimes it works \u2013 council staff are now based in the beautiful Cunard building, one of Liverpool\u2019s \u201cthree graces\u201d, after the authority purchased and refurbished the building for \u00a315m. It is now worth double that, and bringing in several million pounds each year. But Anderson has also put forward other plans that have not been well received in the city and have damaged his own standing. These include a proposed deal with Redrow Homes to build executive homes in part of a much-loved park, which he hoped would have helped boost the council tax base on which he now so heavily relies. But after an ill-thought-out battle with local campaigners, the council was defeated by a hugely embarrassing high court ruling that hurt it and its under-pressure leader. Plenty will argue that the council should never have proposed such a scheme \u2013 and that\u2019s probably true \u2013 but the fact that it did is perhaps symptomatic of a public authority that doesn\u2019t know where its next pay cheque is coming from. So what can be done? Well, people around here are used to having to look after themselves: there are already a huge number of volunteer operations doing amazing work to try and fill in the gaps where the council can no longer afford to support vulnerable residents. There are too many to list, but one that neatly sums up the spirit of the city is the Fans Supporting Foodbanks organisation, which collects food for struggling families before Liverpool and Everton home matches, with consistently heartwarming results. But the generosity of the people of Liverpool \u2013 remarkable though it is \u2013 can only go so far. Which is why the council is urgently calling for a review \u2013 a royal commission to be precise \u2013 into exactly how the government decides where it issues its support. One would hope that a government whose own core spending power figures show that Liverpool council would have been \u00a372m better off by 2019/20, if it had incurred cuts in line with the national average for all councils, might acquiesce to this request, but no one around here will be holding their breath. Liverpool FC\u2019s famous anthem tells people here that they will never walk alone \u2013 but with a government seemingly indifferent to the suffering people in this city are facing on a daily basis, and the end of the lifeline of EU funding, it\u2019s not hard to see why Scousers believe they now have nowhere to turn. \u2022 Liam Thorp is political editor at the Liverpool Echo",

County lines involves gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool using children as young as 11 to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones. The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is now 2,000 \u2013 nearly three times the 720 previously established, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. In its annual assessment of the county lines trade, the NCA said the phone numbers were linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making \u00a3800,000 profits in a year. County lines offenders have been caught using mass marketing text messages to advertise drugs with promotions such as two-for-one deals and free samples, the report revealed. The majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted. Many victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them by showing off images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation. Vulnerable drug users are at continuing risk of serious violence, including loss of life, with a number of murders identified as having county lines links. Nikki Holland, the director of investigations and county lines lead at the NCA, told journalists at the agency\u2019s headquarters in south-west London that profits from the county lines trade nationwide were estimated at about \u00a3500m. Releasing the 2018 assessment, Holland said: \u201cTackling county lines is a national law enforcement priority. We know that criminal networks use high levels of violence, exploitation and abuse to ensure compliance from the vulnerable people they employ to do the day-to-day drug supply activity. \u201cEvery organised crime group trafficking drugs is a business which relies on cashflow.

This is not something law enforcement can tackle alone \u2013 the need to work together to disrupt this activity and safeguard vulnerable victims must be the priority for everyone.\u201d Holland said the increase in the phone numbers identified did not reflect a worsening of the problem, rather an increasing awareness among law enforcement of the scale. The greatest number of county lines originate from the Metropolitan police area at about 15%, followed by the West Midlands police area at 9% and Merseyside at 7%. About 21% of cases involve vulnerable adults trafficked or exploited into the county lines trade and 17% of cases involve \u201ccuckooing\u201d \u2013 when gangs set up dealing bases by taking over the homes of addicted or otherwise vulnerable people, including people with disabilities. Gangmasters target children with impoverished backgrounds, who have experienced family breakdown or intervention by social services or exclusion from school, the report said. The offenders also target drug addicts who allow the use of their property but often end up building up debt with the network, which they have to pay back through further offending. Adult victims often live with mental health conditions including depression and anxiety. Many victims are recruited in \u201cimporting\u201d towns \u2013 locations which are receiving drugs from major cities to sell on, the assessment said. There has been an increase in the use of short-term lets and guesthouses, including using the accommodation website Airbnb, the NCA revealed. Rail network hubs such as Birmingham New Street, Clapham Junction, Manchester Piccadilly, St Pancras International and Waterloo have been identified as key points of access by the NCA but other less obvious hubs are likely to be frequently used. The assessment comes at the end of a week of enforcement action across the country, which saw 600 arrests connected to county lines. More than 400 vulnerable adults and 600 children were referred to safeguarding following the coordinated activity, which included the execution of warrants at addresses, visits to vulnerable people including those at risk of cuckooing, and officer engagement with private hire companies. There were 40 referrals to the national referral mechanism (NRM), which assesses individuals as potential victims of human trafficking or modern slavery. More than 140 weapons were seized, including 12 firearms, swords, machetes, axes and knives, and cash totalling more than \u00a3200,000 and significant amounts of drugs were seized. The Met\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner Duncan Ball, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) lead for county lines, said: \u201cLast week\u2019s targeted work on county lines gangs shows how police forces across the UK are working together to dismantle these networks and protect the young and vulnerable people who are exploited by them.\u201d Meanwhile, two drug dealers were found guilty on Tuesday of murdering a man who had ordered drugs on a deal line branded \u201cRJ\u201d. Juned Ahmed, 18, and Ashraf Hussan, 20, stabbed Peter Anderson, 46, multiple times at just after 4pm on 25 July last year in Cambridge. It is not known whether the attack was a result of mistaken identity in relation to a robbery on Ahmed the day before, or \u201csimply because they didn\u2019t like the way he looked\u201d, but Anderson was left seriously injured.

The real \u201cobstacle to a solution\u201d was May and her government, Corbyn said. \u201cThey spent most of the last two years arguing amongst themselves rather than negotiating with the EU, and still they\u2019re arguing amongst themselves and failing to come up with a workable solution,\u201d the Labour leader said. \u201cTonight I hope this house does its job, and leads where this government has failed.\u201d Downing Street had previously insisted that reopening the 585-page withdrawal agreement was unacceptable to the EU27, and risked other governments trying to push for fresh concessions on other issues, such as fisheries or the status of Gibraltar. Earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the backbench European Research Group, and the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, had both demanded a clear statement from May that she was willing to reopen the fraught issue of the backstop. \u201cWe need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country,\u201d Johnson said. The prime minister is expected to hold calls with EU leaders later on Tuesday, to clear the way for another round of negotiations. Senior Conservatives anxious that the government is drifting towards a no-deal Brexit, including the business minister Richard Harrington, had demanded that May set a two-week deadline for securing a settlement.",

      "bodyText": "A Chinese-led consortium has discovered the UK\u2019s biggest gasfield in more than a decade, leading experts to say there is life yet in the country\u2019s offshore sector. Drilling found the equivalent of about 250m barrels of oil could be recovered from the Glengorm reservoir in the central North Sea, about 5% of the UK\u2019s annual gas demand. The find was hailed as significant by industry and the regulator of the region\u2019s last oil and gas reserves, where production has been declining since the turn of the century. But environmental groups said it was a disgrace that new oil and gas prospects were being found and developed, given their contribution to climate change. The Chinese firm CNOOC owns 50% of the Glengorm project, with a subsidiary of the Italian company Edison holding another 25% and the French oil firm Total owning the other 25%. The size of the find is the biggest since the Culzean find in 2008, and 11th largest of any kind in the UK in the past 30 years. Total, which made another large gas discovery last September in west Shetland, has been behind many of the basin\u2019s big discoveries in recent years. The company said it would use existing platforms and infrastructure nearby to extract the gas, and the Glengorm prospect demonstrated its \u201ccapacity to create value in a mature environment\u201d. Total tried to find gas in the area twice before, in 2017, but without success. Kevin Swann, a senior analyst with the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie, said the size of find was \u201cpretty significant\u201d and he believed the field could be producing gas within 4 to 5 years via the existing Elgin\u2013Franklin rigs.

But Swann said the scale of the reservoir meant it would be economically viable to extract. \u201cThe company needs to spend a lot more money on safety features and processing,\u201d he said. The Oil and Gas Authority, said the the discovery was \u201cvery exciting news\u201d. Andy Samuel, the chief executive of the regulator, said the UK continental shelf still held an estimated 10bn-20bn barrels of oil and gas, \u201cso there is every chance of yet more significant finds\u201d. The number of new wells being drilled has fallen in recent years; in 2018 it fell to a level last seen in 1965. However, the amount of oil and gas found has increased from 83m barrel of oil equivalent in 2014 to 175m in 2017. Experts said the industry was experiencing an uptick as it recovered from the 2014-2016 slump in oil prices. Two of the potential big new finds in 2019 are the Leon and Blackrock projects being drilled by the private equity-backed firm Siccar Point. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a rejuvenation.

Some of the genes identified are known to be expressed in the brain and retinal tissue in the eye, which plays an important part in coupling our internal circadian rhythm to external cues.

Actions of this sort undermine the positive transformation which is taking place with the organisation and we distance ourselves from the appalling act on a popular member of our local community. We send heartfelt condolences to the wider family circle.\u201d</p> <p>Police are reviewing security camera footage as part of the investigation into the murder, which has prompted an outcry against the UVF. Detectives appealed for witnesses and people with dashcam footage of the incident or aftermath to come forward.</p> <p>A member of Ogle\u2019s family recorded and posted online a graphic scene in the aftermath of the attack: he lay on the ground bleeding while a female voice cried out that UVF members had stabbed her father.</p> <p>Four people were arrested in connection with the attack. Two men aged 31 and 45 were released on bail on Monday. Two women aged 35 and 36 remain in custody.</p> <p>The Belfast Telegraph on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/any-positive-work-uvf-has-been-doing-is-wiped-out-by-ian-ogle-murder-by-gang-high-on-their-own-selfimportance-37758991.html\">reported that a long-running feud</a> erupted in pub brawls on Sunday, resulting in UVF members forming a \u201cpunishment squad\u201d to seek a relative of Ogle. The group, thought to number five men, could not find the target so instead attacked Ogle as he stood outside his front door.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been barbaric and the level of violence, the level that was used, was a disgrace,\u201d George Dorrian, a Democratic Unionist party councillor who knows the family, told the BBC. \u201cPeople just could not believe the sort of violence that was used upon this man.\u201d</p> <p>Ogle, known as \u201cBig O\u201d, was well known around Cluan Place and had acted as a spokesperson for the loyalist community, serving as a member of the Ulster People\u2019s Forum, which was set up during loyalist flag protests in 2012.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/6snc900?fbclid=IwAR09lO7cqC1y0w9DJJACcN58xGFYRJhhRqc3I6shpiIIAr6J8FoQcNMrekY\">GoFundMe page</a> to help his family cover funeral expenses had raised more than \u00a37,000. \u201cAlways had a cheeky grin and a kind word for everyone. This was murder by cowards too afraid to face him like the kind of man he was,\u201d said one dedication.</p> <p>Relatives, friends and supporters are due to hold a vigil on Wednesday evening. \u201cThis is a gathering/vigil of support for the entire Ogle family, to show our support as a community and send a clear message to these gangsters shaming East Belfast enough is enough,\u201d said a Facebook post advertising the event.</p> <p>The UVF was one of the deadliest paramilitary groups during the Troubles. It called a ceasefire in 1994 but has been linked to murders, organised crime and vigilante \u201cpunishment attacks\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Ulster Volunteer Force has condemned the murder of a Northern Ireland loyalist that has been blamed on members of the paramilitary group. The group issued a statement saying it was \u201cseeking answers\u201d to the fatal beating and apparent stabbing of Ian Ogle, a 45-year-old father of two, outside his home at Cluan Place in east Belfast on Sunday night. \u201cWhoever did it did not do it in the name of loyalism or the UVF. Actions of this sort undermine the positive transformation which is taking place with the organisation and we distance ourselves from the appalling act on a popular member of our local community. We send heartfelt condolences to the wider family circle.\u201d Police are reviewing security camera footage as part of the investigation into the murder, which has prompted an outcry against the UVF. Detectives appealed for witnesses and people with dashcam footage of the incident or aftermath to come forward. A member of Ogle\u2019s family recorded and posted online a graphic scene in the aftermath of the attack: he lay on the ground bleeding while a female voice cried out that UVF members had stabbed her father. Four people were arrested in connection with the attack. Two men aged 31 and 45 were released on bail on Monday. Two women aged 35 and 36 remain in custody. The Belfast Telegraph on Tuesday reported that a long-running feud erupted in pub brawls on Sunday, resulting in UVF members forming a \u201cpunishment squad\u201d to seek a relative of Ogle. The group, thought to number five men, could not find the target so instead attacked Ogle as he stood outside his front door. \u201cIt has been barbaric and the level of violence, the level that was used, was a disgrace,\u201d George Dorrian, a Democratic Unionist party councillor who knows the family, told the BBC. \u201cPeople just could not believe the sort of violence that was used upon this man.\u201d Ogle, known as \u201cBig O\u201d, was well known around Cluan Place and had acted as a spokesperson for the loyalist community, serving as a member of the Ulster People\u2019s Forum, which was set up during loyalist flag protests in 2012. By Tuesday afternoon, a GoFundMe page to help his family cover funeral expenses had raised more than \u00a37,000. \u201cAlways had a cheeky grin and a kind word for everyone. This was murder by cowards too afraid to face him like the kind of man he was,\u201d said one dedication. Relatives, friends and supporters are due to hold a vigil on Wednesday evening. \u201cThis is a gathering/vigil of support for the entire Ogle family, to show our support as a community and send a clear message to these gangsters shaming East Belfast enough is enough,\u201d said a Facebook post advertising the event. The UVF was one of the deadliest paramilitary groups during the Troubles. It called a ceasefire in 1994 but has been linked to murders, organised crime and vigilante \u201cpunishment attacks\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It may not be spring yet, but everybody\u2019s cleaning. Or, at the very least, they are talking about it. It has only been a month since <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80209379\" title=\"\">Tidying Up With Marie Kondo</a> launched on Netflix, but the series, starring the Japanese organisation expert, has already become something of a phenomenon.

It has also led to charity shops <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/cleaning/a26006575/british-heart-foundation-marie-kondo/\" title=\"\">reporting a Kondo-related surge in donations</a> as converts go on decluttering sprees.</p> <p>Kondo, who shot to global fame in 2014 when her book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/life-changing-magic-of-tidying-9780091955106.html\" title=\"\">The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a> was published in English, is probably the biggest name on the clean scene. However, she is far from the only person to have organised their way to celebrity. The past year or so has seen cleaning take on a new cultural cachet \u2013 particularly on Instagram. The social network is rife with hashtags such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cleaningobsessed/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#cleaningobsessed</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cleaningtime/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#cleaningtime</a> and people are amassing enormous followings with pictures of gleaming kitchen counters and sparkling floors.

So what is the attraction of all these tidy toilets and spotless sinks?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/stephanie-alice-baker#profile=research\" title=\"\">Dr Stephanie Baker</a>, a sociology lecturer at University of London and the author of a forthcoming book about digital lifestyle gurus, points out that we have been obsessed with domestic goddesses for centuries. The online influencers, she says, are simply the latest evolution of \u201cthe broader self-improvement movement, which had its origins in the 19th century and achieved tremendous growth in the late 20th with the rise of lifestyle media and make-over programmes\u201d.</p> <p>But why has cleaning taken off on Instagram, which is notorious for its highly filtered, aspirational content?</p> <p>Kate Joynes-Burgess, the managing director of BCW, a PR agency that works with digital influencers, suggests the public is tiring of photos of attractive people doing headstands on remote beaches, posing in fabulous outfits and socialising with photogenic friends. \u201cThe world of mega lifestyle influencers has been criticised as being on the cusp of an \u2018authenticity crisis\u2019 and potentially reaching a saturation point,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has seemingly made way for more niche-focused influencers and conversations to blossom.\u201d</p> <p>The Queen of Clean, who I am chatting to shortly before she sets off to do the school run, agrees that she and her peers represent a much-needed antidote to Instagram\u2019s curated perfection. \u201cWe\u2019re more relatable than a lot of the lifestyle bloggers out there,\u201d Crombie says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our mops up, hair sticking up \u2026 I look like a right rough tramp on Instagram, but I get people writing in to say it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ebd246aa7c6f0f4387ab3d283a4cc1507e4fd67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebd246aa7c6f0f4387ab3d283a4cc1507e4fd67/0_1_865_865/500.png\" alt=\"In image from Lynsey Crombie\u2019s Instagram\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In image from Lynsey Crombie\u2019s Instagram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: lynsey_queenofclean/instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Organised Mum has a similar view. Bray notes that when she first started out on Instagram, \u201cas a mum of three, a lot of the things I was seeing were out of reach\u201d. In 2016, her son dared her to start an Instagram page where she could show off her special cleaning method; she indulged him, but didn\u2019t think it would get much traction among all the carefully filtered pictures of avocado toast. But within 12 months she had 10,000 followers and, over the past few months, she has seen her following rocket to well over 100,000. It seems she struck a chord. After all, she says, \u201ceveryone has to maintain a home to some extent. Everyone has to do boring jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Like Bray, Crombie, who joined Instagram to keep an eye on her kids\u2019 online usage, started posting cleaning pictures without any expectations they would become so popular. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d she says. She is reluctant to discuss exactly how much money she is making (\u201cPeople can be very negative about these sorts of things\u201d), but notes she is earning more than she ever has before. Instagrammers can make money from affiliate marketing, paid reviews and sponsored posts, with brands paying anywhere from a few hundred pounds to hundreds of thousands to partner with people they deem influential.</p> <p>And no wonder: when Mrs Hinch extolled the virtues of a Minky M Cloth antibacterial cleaning pad last year, the item promptly sold out for weeks. The Minky website even <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mrs-hinchs-favourite-150-minky-13394267\" title=\"\">crashed because of the demand</a>. The company says it has seen a big uplift in its profile and sales thanks to the influencer, \u201cfor which we are extremely grateful\u201d.</p> <p>But not everyone is cheering the cleaning influencers\u2019 success. There have been arguments that they reinforce existing gender stereotypes: the best-known influencers are women, as is their audience. Perpetuating the idea that cleaning is women\u2019s work doesn\u2019t seem particularly helpful when you think that British women still do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/feb/17/dirty-secret-why-housework-gender-gap\" title=\"\">60% more housework than men</a>. Bray, for her part, says she is aware of the gender dynamics at play. \u201cI share content of my boys emptying the dishwasher,\u201d she points out. \u201cMy husband does his own ironing. I\u2019m vocal about the fact it\u2019s a team effort and I want my boys to pull their weight.\u201d Unfortunately, fewer than 10% of her followers are men, so her message about cleaning being a team effort is overwhelmingly being heard by women alone.</p> <p>Cleaning influencers may not be doing anything for the housework gender gap, but that isn\u2019t to say they are not empowering. There is a lot of research that shows messy spaces can lead to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truisms-wellness/201607/the-powerful-psychology-behind-cleanliness\" title=\"\">depression and fatigue</a>. Crombie is one of the most outspoken influencers when it comes to championing links between mental health and cleaning, and she speaks from personal experience. In 2003, seven months into her first marriage, its traumatic collapse sent her into premature labour; her twins were born at 28 weeks. Over the following years, she struggled to rebuild her life and found cleaning gave her structure as well as being cathartic. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t cleaned, I would have stayed in bed all day,\u201d she says, grimly. She expands upon this in her new book, <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/hq-cleans-insta-star-crombies-tidying-guide-935396\" title=\"\">How to Clean Your House \u2026 And Tidy Up Your Life</a><em>,</em> which will be published in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64d0aa35b9ead05bf0eed565e33fb1fa0232d1a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64d0aa35b9ead05bf0eed565e33fb1fa0232d1a7/0_516_7746_4648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Bray, the Organised Mum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gemma Bray, the Organised Mum: \u2018Everyone has to maintain a home.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crombie\u2019s experience, of course, is extreme. But the link between cleaning your house and tidying your life seems to explain a lot about the current cultural cachet around cleaning. In fact, says Baker, you could say that the \u201crise of cleaning influencers is fundamentally about order. It is about more than having a clean home; it is about creating a structured environment in which to flourish.\u201d She points out that cleaning metaphors are embedded in the \u201clanguage of lifestyle gurus and psychologists. Look at Jordan Peterson, whose phrase \u2018Clean up your room\u2019 recently became a meme in popular culture.\u201d (It\u2019s a shame more men aren\u2019t taking his directive literally.)</p> <p>A desire for order at a time of social unrest may also account, to some degree, for the popularity of Kondo. In her book Waste: Consuming Postwar Japan, Eiko Maruko Siniawer, a history professor at Williams College, Massachusetts, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-26/-tidying-up-with-marie-kondo-builds-on-japanese-tradition\" title=\"\">notes</a> that the rise of professional declutterers in Japan coincided with the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people in the country. This disaster, she says, may have prompted a reassessment of \u201cstuff\u201d and what it means to one\u2019s life.</p> <p>Bearing all this in mind, it is perhaps no surprise that the rise of cleaning influencers in the UK and US comes against the background of Brexit and Donald Trump. \u201cThe preoccupation with order and self-management flourishes during uncertain times as a self-improvement strategy,\u201d Baker claims. In other words, when the world looks increasingly like trash, cleaning becomes a lot more comforting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It may not be spring yet, but everybody\u2019s cleaning. Or, at the very least, they are talking about it. It has only been a month since Tidying Up With Marie Kondo launched on Netflix, but the series, starring the Japanese organisation expert, has already become something of a phenomenon. It has sparked joy among some, and arguments about how many books you should have in your home among others (Kondo, controversially, caps her collection at about 30). It has also led to charity shops reporting a Kondo-related surge in donations as converts go on decluttering sprees. Kondo, who shot to global fame in 2014 when her book The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up was published in English, is probably the biggest name on the clean scene. However, she is far from the only person to have organised their way to celebrity. The past year or so has seen cleaning take on a new cultural cachet \u2013 particularly on Instagram. The social network is rife with hashtags such as #cleaningobsessed or #cleaningtime and people are amassing enormous followings with pictures of gleaming kitchen counters and sparkling floors. Fitness influencers and fashion bloggers step aside: it\u2019s starting to look like bleach is the new black. Sophie Hinchcliffe, AKA Mrs Hinch, is one of the best known of these new Instagram \u201ccleanfluencers\u201d. The 28-year-old hairdresser from Essex has 1.7 million followers on the social network, where she shares pictures of her immaculate home as well as chatty videos of herself disinfecting her bins and scrubbing her sink. She has developed a whole branded vocabulary around tidying up \u2013 cleaning is \u201chinching\u201d; buying products is a \u201chinch haul\u201d; her followers are the #HinchArmy; and her enormous collection of cleaning paraphernalia is kept in a special wardrobe called Narnia. (CS Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.) Other prominent British cleanfluencers include Lynsey \u201cQueen of Clean\u201d Crombie, who has 104,000 followers, and Gemma Bray, \u201cthe Organised Mum\u201d, with 135,000. Across the Atlantic, Toronto-based Melissa Maker has more than a million subscribers to her YouTube channel, Clean My Space, where she posts videos such as Cleaning the Kitchen Sink! and 10 Things to Toss Today. In the US, Chicago-based Becky Rapinchuk has 275,000 followers on her Clean Mama Instagram page; a typical post shows a gleaming toilet with tips on how to speed-clean your bathroom. For the uninitiated, scrolling through pictures, or watching videos, of people doing chores may seem as exciting as, well, watching surfaces dry. So what is the attraction of all these tidy toilets and spotless sinks? Dr Stephanie Baker, a sociology lecturer at University of London and the author of a forthcoming book about digital lifestyle gurus, points out that we have been obsessed with domestic goddesses for centuries. The online influencers, she says, are simply the latest evolution of \u201cthe broader self-improvement movement, which had its origins in the 19th century and achieved tremendous growth in the late 20th with the rise of lifestyle media and make-over programmes\u201d. But why has cleaning taken off on Instagram, which is notorious for its highly filtered, aspirational content? Kate Joynes-Burgess, the managing director of BCW, a PR agency that works with digital influencers, suggests the public is tiring of photos of attractive people doing headstands on remote beaches, posing in fabulous outfits and socialising with photogenic friends. \u201cThe world of mega lifestyle influencers has been criticised as being on the cusp of an \u2018authenticity crisis\u2019 and potentially reaching a saturation point,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has seemingly made way for more niche-focused influencers and conversations to blossom.\u201d The Queen of Clean, who I am chatting to shortly before she sets off to do the school run, agrees that she and her peers represent a much-needed antidote to Instagram\u2019s curated perfection. \u201cWe\u2019re more relatable than a lot of the lifestyle bloggers out there,\u201d Crombie says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our mops up, hair sticking up \u2026 I look like a right rough tramp on Instagram, but I get people writing in to say it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d The Organised Mum has a similar view. Bray notes that when she first started out on Instagram, \u201cas a mum of three, a lot of the things I was seeing were out of reach\u201d. In 2016, her son dared her to start an Instagram page where she could show off her special cleaning method; she indulged him, but didn\u2019t think it would get much traction among all the carefully filtered pictures of avocado toast. But within 12 months she had 10,000 followers and, over the past few months, she has seen her following rocket to well over 100,000. It seems she struck a chord. After all, she says, \u201ceveryone has to maintain a home to some extent. Everyone has to do boring jobs.\u201d Like Bray, Crombie, who joined Instagram to keep an eye on her kids\u2019 online usage, started posting cleaning pictures without any expectations they would become so popular. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d she says. She is reluctant to discuss exactly how much money she is making (\u201cPeople can be very negative about these sorts of things\u201d), but notes she is earning more than she ever has before. Instagrammers can make money from affiliate marketing, paid reviews and sponsored posts, with brands paying anywhere from a few hundred pounds to hundreds of thousands to partner with people they deem influential. And no wonder: when Mrs Hinch extolled the virtues of a Minky M Cloth antibacterial cleaning pad last year, the item promptly sold out for weeks. The Minky website even crashed because of the demand. The company says it has seen a big uplift in its profile and sales thanks to the influencer, \u201cfor which we are extremely grateful\u201d. But not everyone is cheering the cleaning influencers\u2019 success. There have been arguments that they reinforce existing gender stereotypes: the best-known influencers are women, as is their audience. Perpetuating the idea that cleaning is women\u2019s work doesn\u2019t seem particularly helpful when you think that British women still do 60% more housework than men. Bray, for her part, says she is aware of the gender dynamics at play. \u201cI share content of my boys emptying the dishwasher,\u201d she points out. \u201cMy husband does his own ironing. I\u2019m vocal about the fact it\u2019s a team effort and I want my boys to pull their weight.\u201d Unfortunately, fewer than 10% of her followers are men, so her message about cleaning being a team effort is overwhelmingly being heard by women alone. Cleaning influencers may not be doing anything for the housework gender gap, but that isn\u2019t to say they are not empowering. There is a lot of research that shows messy spaces can lead to depression and fatigue. Crombie is one of the most outspoken influencers when it comes to championing links between mental health and cleaning, and she speaks from personal experience. In 2003, seven months into her first marriage, its traumatic collapse sent her into premature labour; her twins were born at 28 weeks. Over the following years, she struggled to rebuild her life and found cleaning gave her structure as well as being cathartic. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t cleaned, I would have stayed in bed all day,\u201d she says, grimly. She expands upon this in her new book, How to Clean Your House \u2026 And Tidy Up Your Life, which will be published in March. Crombie\u2019s experience, of course, is extreme. But the link between cleaning your house and tidying your life seems to explain a lot about the current cultural cachet around cleaning. In fact, says Baker, you could say that the \u201crise of cleaning influencers is fundamentally about order. It is about more than having a clean home; it is about creating a structured environment in which to flourish.\u201d She points out that cleaning metaphors are embedded in the \u201clanguage of lifestyle gurus and psychologists. Look at Jordan Peterson, whose phrase \u2018Clean up your room\u2019 recently became a meme in popular culture.\u201d (It\u2019s a shame more men aren\u2019t taking his directive literally.) A desire for order at a time of social unrest may also account, to some degree, for the popularity of Kondo. In her book Waste: Consuming Postwar Japan, Eiko Maruko Siniawer, a history professor at Williams College, Massachusetts, notes that the rise of professional declutterers in Japan coincided with the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people in the country. This disaster, she says, may have prompted a reassessment of \u201cstuff\u201d and what it means to one\u2019s life. Bearing all this in mind, it is perhaps no surprise that the rise of cleaning influencers in the UK and US comes against the background of Brexit and Donald Trump. \u201cThe preoccupation with order and self-management flourishes during uncertain times as a self-improvement strategy,\u201d Baker claims. In other words, when the world looks increasingly like trash, cleaning becomes a lot more comforting.",

      "bodyText": "A jukebox musical based on Swedish super-producer Max Martin\u2019s biggest hits will hit London\u2019s West End this autumn. Martin is one of the most successful pop producer-songwriters of all time, third only to Paul McCartney and John Lennon when it comes to racking up US No 1 hits. His three-decade career has seen him launch artists such as Robyn, Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, assist in Taylor Swift\u2019s pop reinvention and \u2013 less auspiciously \u2013 sustain noughties laggards such as Maroon 5. In &amp; Juliet, songs from his back catalogue will tell the story of half of Shakespeare\u2019s most famous couple, who is \u201cgetting over Romeo by escaping to Paris with Nurse and her best friends\u201d. The musical\u2019s website asks: \u201cWhat if Juliet\u2019s famous ending was really just her beginning? What if she decided to choose her own fate?\u201d Little else is known about the musical at this stage, but who ever let facts get in the way of good old-fashioned conjecture? We assembled four writers to script their version of Juliet\u2019s story from Martin\u2019s esteemed catalogue. It turns out to be easy to sketch a story of Starbucks star-crossed lovers from the lyrics of massive pop hits, quite possibly because Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy is the archetypal romance from which most pop hits descended in one way or another. Who knew! \u2018Did my heart love till now\u2019 Juliet is bored. Romeo keeps serenading her with Backstreet Boys\u2019 As Long As You Love Me. He thinks he\u2019s being romantic, rebuking the Montague/Capulet divisions by declaring, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are / Where you\u2019re from\u201d, but, frankly, it\u2019s making Juliet feel disposable. He also seems to be suggesting that he\u2019ll perish without her, slyly humming Maroon 5\u2019s One More Night (\u201cso I cross my heart and I hope to die\u201d). Time to call his bluff with a swift draught of sleeping potion as Kesha sings \u201cdrink that Kool Aid, follow my lead\u201d from Blow. The grinding EDM slows to operatic melodrama as Romeo enters, finds his apparently dead paramour and cocks the trigger as Kesha laments: \u201cThis place is about to blow.\u201d Yikes. Juliet awakens. \u201cI did something bad,\u201d she gasps to the crowd, feigning shock. She rips off her gown, the lights flash: \u201cSo why\u2019d it feel so good?\u201d she howls, heralding the first big set piece to Taylor Swift\u2019s marvellously vindictive Reputation banger. She hears a cook in the kitchen humming Katy Perry\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit and realises that she wants more: Paris, city of wanton decadence. There, Juliet dabbles in conventional society, but finds the menfolk just as self-obsessed as Romeo: a phalanx of bewigged fops serenades her at a ball with Backstreet Boys\u2019 Larger Than Life: \u201cEvery time we\u2019re down / You can make it right.\u201d This nonsense, encore? As she spots an unusually handsome lady courtesan, the opening notes of Demi Lovato\u2019s Cool for the Summer start tinkling on the harpsichord, signalling the majestic second set piece. Juliet and her androgynous copine run riot through Paris and watch the sun come up over the city from Montmartre. Lana Del Rey\u2019s Lust for Life plays; our young lovers lean on each other, laughing, as Del Rey gasps: \u201cThey say only the good die young / That just ain\u2019t right / \u2019Cause we\u2019re having too much fun.\u201d Retreating to a garret, they consummate their lust to Robyn\u2019s Show Me Love and vanish into Paris\u2019s secretive lesbian underworld. Cut to a wicked catacomb party. Swift\u2019s New Romantics plays as a chorus of beautiful androgynes explodes: \u201cHeartbreak is the national anthem!\u201d For 150 years, at least, until La Marseillaise takes over. Laura Snapes \u2018Don\u2019t waste your love on somebody who doesn\u2019t value it\u2019 Act 1 Opens with Juliet on the balcony of her shared-ownership flat in south London. She spies a coy, vaguely rebellious Romeo hiding near the bins and starts singing Ariana Grande\u2019s Into You under her breath. Act 2 After a night of what she will later learn was quite average sex, Juliet wakes up to Romeo brushing her cheek and singing Backstreet Boys\u2019 I Want It That Way. She thinks he\u2019s cute, they fall deeply in love, but future issues are confirmed by a show-stopping Glee-style mashup of Katy Perry\u2019s Teenage Dream and Taylor Swift\u2019s I Knew You Were Trouble. Act 3 Romeo dies after a missed WhatsApp message vis-a-vis a fake suicide attempt. Juliet mopes for a bit before performing a tear-drenched, piano-based ...Baby One More Time that morphs euphorically into a full ensemble Stronger. Act 4 This new-found confidence transforms into empowerment (a snatch of Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Since U Been Gone) and a drunk rendition of Grande\u2019s No Tears Left to Cry on a Eurostar to Paris. Juliet\u2019s friends take her clubbing \u2013 cue Perry\u2019s Bon App\u00e9tit minus Migos\u2019 verse (#woke) \u2013 and she vows to enjoy the single life (cut to a hungover, vomit-speckled I\u2019m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman). Act 5 Paris life suits Juliet. While working in a bakery, she spots a man who reminds her of Romeo, they start a relationship, but he can\u2019t handle her newfound independence (a snippet of Pink\u2019s So What). Ends with a rousing mashup of Swift\u2019s We Are Never Getting Back Together and the Veronicas\u2019 4ever. Michael Cragg \u2018These violent delights have violent ends\u2019 Juliet and Nurse hunt for shelter in the cobbled streets of turn-of-the-17th-century Paris, where they run into a group of beautiful, shadowy women. Entranced, Juliet begs to be allowed into this early modern #girlgang. During a haunting choral rendition of Katy Perry\u2019s Dark Horse (\u201cSo you wanna play with magic?\u201d), Juliet\u2019s new friends send her soaring into the air (\u201cThis love will make you levitate\u201d), revealing that they are witches. Juliet and Nurse pledge themselves to the dark arts. They are now Satan\u2019s children. All this time spent lurking in dingy dark alleys isn\u2019t great for Juliet\u2019s health, and she soon contracts bubonic plague. Nurse attempts to cure Juliet via the technique of bloodletting, which severely worsens her condition. (A mournfully acoustic Bad Blood sees Juliet whine on her deathbed: \u201cBand-Aids don\u2019t fix gross buboes\u201d and \u201cYou made a really deep cut.\u201d) She dies, beautifully. Luckily, Juliet\u2019s witchy friends step in to save the day, bringing her back from the dead \u2013 but in so doing, they spark one of the biggest witch-hunts the city has ever seen. Faced with being burned at the stake, Juliet\u2019s new coven must convert their captors to their cause (a seductive, climactic cover of Ariana Grande\u2019s God Is a Woman: \u201cTake my hand / Save your soul ... you\u2019ll believe God is a woman\u201d). At the musical\u2019s close, Juliet, Nurse and their sisterhood have seized Paris, thanks to the sacred power of darkness. Anna Leszkiewicz \u2018I defy you, stars\u2019 Juliet explodes on to the stage from a toaster lift in an explosion of glitter cannons, surrounded by Parisian drag queens in a thigh-slapping rendition of Ariana Grande\u2019s Greedy. Now a pansexual 18-year-old, she\u2019s searching for a star-crossed lover in Marais clubs with the same gusto that she once used to scale Romeo\u2019s balcony. Through the Gauloises fog, she locks eyes with a bequiffed painter named Camille, serenading her with a gender-flipped take on Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cJames Dean daydream look in your eye\u201d line from Style. But when it turns out that Camille is hatching a plan to break into the Louvre and replace the Mona Lisa with her latest creation \u2013 a delicate watercolour of Britney Spears \u2013 a heartbroken Juliet flees while belting out a heart-rending take on Spears\u2019s Criminal, accompanied by elegant pyrotechnics. Later, when Juliet meets an unassuming candlestick maker, guest star Miriam Margolyes (who played Juliet\u2019s nurse in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Romeo + Juliet) descends from the rafters rapping Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse in Grande\u2019s Side to Side. (Minaj\u2019s \u201cride dick bicycle\u201d line rings out as the lovers embrace.) Yet Juliet ultimately finds unlikely solace in a women\u2019s basketball club. \u201cMy loneliness ain\u2019t killing me no more,\u201d Juliet trills, while shooting hoops as the cast unite for the finale: an inspired mashup of Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Since U Been Gone and Five\u2019s Slam Dunk (Da Funk) on the banks of the Seine. Owen Myers &amp; Juliet premieres at Opera House, Manchester, on 10 September then transfers to Shaftesbury theatre, London, on 2 November.",

      "bodyText": "British nationals who have retired to EU countries including Spain and France will no longer have their healthcare covered by the NHS in the event of no Brexit deal, the government has said. The confirmation will come as a blow to around 190,000 British citizens retired in the EU in places such as the Spanish Costas, Provence in France and Tuscany in Italy. It could also add to the burden on the NHS if pensioners believe they have no option but to return to the UK for treatment. The government has previously admitted it is cheaper to pay Spain and France to look after British nationals than have them fly home. Currently pensioners can get treatment reimbursed by the NHS under an EU-wide set of reciprocal arrangements. \u201cIt is another example of how those advocating no deal are playing with the lives of British citizens living in other EU countries,\u201d said Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer and freedom of movement campaigner. \u201cMany of these politicians and pundits probably haven\u2019t bothered to find out how their policies would actually affect such people.\u201d Pensioners who have paid in to the national insurance system for the qualifying number of years benefit from the \u201cS1\u201d reciprocal healthcare rules if they retire in EU/EEA countries or Switzerland. An S1 certificate is available to anyone in receipt of a state pension, and to some workers who are sent overseas on a temporary basis by their UK employers. In a little-publicised no-deal technical notice published this week, the UK government said: \u201cAn S1 certificate helps you and your dependents access healthcare in the EU/EEA country where you live. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until 29 March 2019. After this date, the certificate may not be valid, depending on decisions by member states.\u201d Sue Wilson, who chairs the Bremain in Spain campaign group, said the change could be devastating. \u201cAll along we\u2019ve been told our healthcare is protected. This is a big shock to everyone and our members are really, really scared,\u201d she said. She called on the government to agree to ringfence their rights. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing about EU citizens in Britain getting settled status. Well, we have unsettled status,\u201d she said. The government\u2019s \u201coverseas healthcare\u201d phoneline has updated its recorded messages to include a no-deal warning, telling those who are considering moving to another country within the EEA or Switzerland that their S1 application will only be processed if they apply \u201cin the next four weeks\u201d. The campaign group British in Europe also said the loss could have a devastating effect on people with continuing healthcare needs. \u201cJust think of the impact of this on a 75-year-old in the middle of vital cancer treatment on 30 March,\u201d said Jeremy Morgan, a spokesman for health issues for the group. The Spanish and UK governments said they were confident a bilateral agreement would be in place despite the no-deal notice. The Department of Health said it was \u201cworking closely with countries, including Spain and France, to make sure patients can continue to access healthcare, whatever the outcome\u201d. The Spanish government\u2019s Brexit advice website outlines \u201ccontingency measures\u201d that would \u201cguarantee healthcare provision for British citizens in Spain\u201d in the event of no deal. The technical notice advises retirees to investigate taking up private healthcare in the country in which they now reside, something that is likely to be come as shock to some, especially in the Costa del Sol in Spain where many have retired in order to make ends meet. The government has suggested worried pensioners research the state healthcare system in the country where they now live and find out if they are eligible for treatment.There are 70,000 British pensioners in Spain, 44,000 in Ireland, 43,000 in France and 12,000 in Cyprus. A senior civil servant in the Department of Health told a select committee in 2017 that Spain charged an average of \u20ac3,500 per pensioner signed up to the S1, Ireland charged an average of \u20ac7,500 and the UK charged about \u20ac5,000. In total, the government paid out about \u00a3500m \u2013 or \u00a32,300 per pensioner \u2013 which he said was significantly lower than the cost of treating pensioners in the UK.",

James, 100, and Pearl, 88, live in their own home in south-east London, but rely on daily visits from care workers, a service that Robinson believes is vastly overstretched. Homecare staff visit the Robinsons three times a day, helping them get up and dressed, wash, take their medication and help them get ready for bed at the end of the day. In all, Robinson\u2019s parents receive 3.5 hours of care a day.

They are typically half an hour\u2019s journey apart, if travelling by public transport, or 15 minutes by car. As each of her visits is supposed to last 30 to 60 minutes, with the travel time on top, Sewell says she has to curtail some visits in order to get round to everyone to see all her clients.</p> <p>\u201cThere are times when they [care workers] might not make it because they are so busy,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cWhen they do get there they\u2019re in such a hurry that they can\u2019t complete the time they\u2019ve got allocated to spend with my parents, so they might cut things short.\u201d</p> <p>Like many care workers, Sewell is in a precarious financial situation. Although on the face of it, she earns a reasonable \u00a39.15 an hour for the time she spends with care users, she receives no holiday pay and is on a zero-hours contract. And because the company she works for doesn\u2019t pay her travel time, Sewell says in reality she takes home<strong> </strong>around \u00a37 an hour.</p> <p>Sewell\u2019s situation is all too common. New figures published this week show that more than half of councils do not insist that their homecare providers pay travel time. According to freedom of information requests by public sector union Unison, 54% of local authorities do not make it a contractual condition that the care agencies they commission pay their care workers for the time spent travelling between visits. That means many homecare staff end up earning less than the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\" title=\"\">\u00a37.83 an hour minimum wage</a> for over-25s, rebranded in 2015 as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Although the minimum hourly pay for over-25s will rise to \u00a38.21 from April 2019, it\u2019s still a lot less than the <a href=\"https://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-real-living-wage\" title=\"\">Living Wage Foundation\u2019s real living wage</a>, which is \u00a310.55 an hour in London and \u00a39 an hour for those working outside the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf06364660f542ef275f63170e01f2b7e1cde240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf06364660f542ef275f63170e01f2b7e1cde240/0_2_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man explaining medicine to older woman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many care workers find themselves in a precarious financial situation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Care Act 2014 requires councils to ensure care agencies pay staff the national living wage, including \u201cappropriate remuneration for any time spent travelling between appointments\u201d. But what constitutes an appropriate level of pay for travel is not stipulated. However, it is illegal for care workers\u2019 overall daily pay, including travel time, to amount to less than the minimum wage.</p> <p>\u201cMany companies do not abide by minimum wage laws, and even those paid extra by councils to remunerate care workers for travel time simply do not do so,\u201d says Matt Egan, a national officer for Unison. Even when local authorities do require providers to pay care staff for travel time, many do not check this is actually happening. \u201cSome councils are putting it in the contract and asking care providers whether they\u2019re complying with the requirement to pay care workers for their travel time without actually checking payslips or carrying out workforce surveys,\u201d says Egan.</p> <p>The findings underline previous research by the union last August<strong> </strong>which found that nearly <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/content/uploads/2019/01/Pressed-for-time-and-out-of-pocket-.docx\" title=\"\">two-thirds of care workers</a> are only paid for their contact time, not the time spent travelling between appointments. Even when councils do pay travel time, it is often not enough. Many pay for just 10 minutes\u2019 travel time, when, according to the UK Homecare Association, care workers spend 11.7 minutes per hour of their working day travelling. Homecare staff say that is a significant underestimate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/carer-30k-immigration-rule-decimate-sector-post-brexit\">I\u2019m a care worker.

Journeys by car or public transport take even longer. \u201cIn an ideal world the care calls would all be close together but they\u2019re not,\u201d she says. That means she and her colleagues end up being routinely late. Tameside council refused to comment on these specific claims, but did say it pays contractors for travel time. A spokesman says: \u201cOur care workers are allocated 10.8 minutes of travel time per hour. We use smaller teams working in smaller areas to cut down on travel time.\u201d The council also says that from April 2019, it will be paying providers \u00a317.20 per hour and will require providers to pay care staff at least \u00a39 per hour.

      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s former military chief Benny Gantz has officially launched his election campaign by promising to unseat the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he accused of running a \u201cregime\u201d that \u201cencourages incitement, subversion and hatred\u201d. \u201cWe all need a government that solves our real problems and is not preoccupied with itself,\u201d Gantz said during his maiden rally, scheduled for Israel\u2019s primetime television slot. \u201cI thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his service for 10 years. We will continue from here.\u201d Opinion polls suggest Gantz is Netanyahu\u2019s only credible challenger, despite having until now revealed almost none of his political beliefs. After he moved himself into politics in December, polls signalled that his new party, Israel Resilience, could win a critical number of seats in the 9 April general election. The retired general has already created a buzz among an electorate that analysts say often votes on personality rather than policy and has a strong penchant for military credentials. Israel Resilience released a jingle on Tuesday with the slogan \u201cthere is no more right and left, there is only Israel before everything\u201d, and Gantz is expected to seek alliances with both sides in a political system favouring coalition governments. Head of the army from 2011 to 2015, including during two wars in the Gaza Strip, Gantz has sought to appease Israel\u2019s militaristic rightwing.

A Palestinian film company based in Gaza later said the footage, originally filmed to document the damage caused by Israeli bombings, had been \u201cstolen\u201d by Gantz\u2019s team without permission. Army service is compulsory in Israel and the country has a tradition of senior military figures entering politics. Two chiefs of staff have become prime ministers: Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak. Gantz is seen as a serious contender to threaten Netanyahu\u2019s reputation as \u201cMr Security\u201d, a nickname the prime minister\u2019s supporters use. But Netanyahu\u2019s allies have written off Gantz as a \u201cleftist\u201d and will seek to highlight any signs of restraint from him on Israel\u2019s myriad security challenges. In another campaign video, Gantz says there is \u201cno shame in yearning for peace\u201d, although he adds that Israeli soldiers will probably be fighting for the next 50 years. The general-turned-politician promised that his government would strive to make deals. But he added that if peace did not happen, he would strengthen settlements in the occupied West Bank \u2013 regarded as illegal by the international community.

      "bodyText": "If there\u2019s anything more British than talking about the weather, it\u2019s obsessing about house prices. This is a country where it\u2019s taboo to ask someone their salary but perfectly acceptable to ask how much their house is worth (and look it up on Rightmove if they won\u2019t tell you). In recent years, it\u2019s been harder to avoid talking about house prices than ever because, in many places around the country, they\u2019re so out of control. According to the Office for National Statistics, the median price paid for a home leapt by 259% between 1997 and 2016, while earnings only rose by 68%. This has created the demographic known as Generation Rent \u2013 young adults who are stuck renting, locked out of homeownership and, as we\u2019re so often patronisingly told, are really into avocado-based brunches. In the 1990s someone aged between 25-34 had a two in three chance of owning their own home. By 2016, it was one in four. In a nutshell, your chances of buying a house of your own if you\u2019re a young person on a middle income have more than halved over the past two decades. This has forced ever greater numbers into the private rental sector where tenancies are too short and rents too high. The only thing more overpriced than buying a home right now is renting one. In more than half of the local authorities in England, housing charity Shelter says that rents are unaffordable for ordinary working families. It\u2019s now thought that more than a third of millennials will be renting forever, unable to save for a deposit to buy because so much of their earnings go straight into the pocket of a private landlord. They\u2019re trapped. So, it\u2019s not hard to see why some people are prepared to do anything if it means they can get off the private-renting hamster wheel, even if it means taking out a 100% mortgage. I have contemplated selling a kidney more than once. Capitalising on this crisis, Lloyds Bank has announced its \u201cLend A Hand\u201d deal for first-time buyers. It is a 100% mortgage which requires no deposit and means buyers can borrow up to \u00a3500,000 for a home. Sounds great, right? How kind of Lloyds to want to help and come to the rescue of Generation Rent like this. Nobody would blame you for jumping at it. Sadly, though, like other \u201cradical\u201d suggestions that have been put forward to help young people get on the housing ladder, such as Help to Buy, this merely reinforces the status quo. On closer inspection, 100% mortgages will only help those who can access another bank \u2013 the \u201cbank of mum and dad\u201d. In order to get Lloyds to lend you a hand, you need a family member who is able to put a sum equal to 10% of the value of the home you want to buy into a Lloyds savings account. Given that average house prices are about \u00a3200,000 across the country, we\u2019re not talking pocket change here. Young people whose parents own property are almost three times more likely to become homeowners by the age of 30. The bank of mum and dad has created a two-tier society \u2013 those with a family who can help and those without. Today, whether you can buy a house really depends on your family\u2019s wealth unless you earn an above-average salary. As David Cameron himself put it, help to buy was intended \u201cto get the market moving\u201d. With it, the government underwrote an out-of-control housing market (some argue, inflated it further) and lined the pockets of developers, helping those who were gifted deposits or earned enough to save. And 100% mortgages are no different. This is an attempt by banks to prop up unaffordable prices by asking first-time buyers to get into astronomical amounts of debt by buying homes they can\u2019t afford in order to boost the bank\u2019s own business. According to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the market has slowed down because of Brexit fears. It\u2019s at its weakest since 2012 because fewer people are buying. But it\u2019s not just Brexit holding people back. People aren\u2019t buying because they can\u2019t afford to \u2013 houses are too expensive after years and years of price inflation. And 100% mortgages will only reinforce the housing problems we already face. We are in the middle of a housing crisis because we allowed homes to cost more than the people who need them can afford to pay. The solution cannot be to preserve this ludicrous new normal with more of the same. We haven\u2019t seen 100% mortgages since the financial crisis of 2008. As they make a comeback we shouldn\u2019t forget it was subprime mortgages in the US which helped bring about that crisis. Instead of finding creative ways to encourage people into more debt to sustain the unsustainable, we need to have ambitious conversations about what is genuinely affordable housing and how we help those without wealthy parents to access it. Generation Rent is a misnomer. It implies young professionals from families who might be able to stretch themselves to help their kids, but renters are also low-income families, single-parent households and people without help. Who will guarantee their 100% mortgages? \u2022 Vicky Spratt is a freelance journalist, housing campaigner and author of Tenants: Stories of Britain\u2019s Housing Shame which is being published in 2020",

May is expected to urge MPs to support the Brady amendment, which \u201crequires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. Its chances of success are on a knife-edge because half a dozen or so Tory remainers are thought unlikely to support it, partly because they believe it would have no impact on the EU. Labour\u2019s frontbench will not support Brady but a handful of the party\u2019s backbenchers have indicated they would support it, including the pro-Brexit MPs John Mann and Jim Fitzpatrick.",

Gross after 10 days is a decent \u00a36.87m. For comparison, Split \u2013 which together with Shyamalan\u2019s Unbreakable provided a precursor to Glass \u2013 stood at \u00a36.03m at the same stage of its run. With cinemas clogged with Oscar bait, Glass stands out as the film offering multiplex audiences something more commercially accessible. It will finally face some competition this Friday with Escape Room, followed five days later by the James Cameron-produced Alita: Battle Angel. The awards battle The battle between films positioned for awards attention is getting increasingly intense. Friday saw the arrival of Adam McKay\u2019s Vice and the Nicole Kidman starrer Destroyer, both competing for screen space against Mary Queen of Scots, The Favourite, Stan &amp; Ollie, Beautiful Boy and Colette. Universal and Working Title should be happy to see Mary Queen of Scots hold its ground, declining a relatively slim 27%. Vice, landing one place below it, kicks off with \u00a31.33m including modest previews \u2013 almost identical to the \u00a31.3m (including negligible previews) launch for McKay\u2019s The Big Short three years ago. Stan &amp; Ollie, falling 41%, and The Favourite, down 28%, are likely to emerge as the two big winners of the season at the UK box office. Respective tallies so far are \u00a38.26m and \u00a313.1m. Destroyer landed down in 19th place, with a mediocre \u00a3106,000 from 113 cinemas. The tale of an undercover cop received some encouraging reviews, but there are too many titles competing in the prestige space, and the film is uncertainly positioned between drama and genre title. The losers: UK cinemas While a large number of titles are performing at a decent level \u2013 including new entrants such as Japanese anime Dragon Ball Super: Broly (\u00a3852,000 including \u00a3546,000 previews), Clint Eastwood\u2019s The Mule (\u00a3726,000) and family film A Dog\u2019s Way Home (\u00a3702,000) \u2013 film for film, the market is alarmingly behind the pace of a year ago. The final weekend of January 2018 saw Darkest Hour, Coco, Maze Runner: The Death Cure, The Greatest Showman and Early Man all achieve box office above \u00a32m. In 2019, no film grossed \u00a32m in the final weekend of January. Box office for the session overall is 36% below the same weekend a year ago, and this follows successive sessions when takings were 2% up, 20% down and 30% down on January 2018 equivalents. Indie cinemas are doing well, however, because the successful titles on release (such as Vice, Mary Queen of Scots and The Favourite) are especially suitable for those venues. The current dearth of commercially appealing alternatives is hurting the multiplexes.

Gross currently stands at \u00a31.49m, and a tally somewhere in the region of \u00a31.7m looks likely.

I understand it\u2019s an uphill battle \u2026 but we need to force this government and future governments into taking climate change seriously because they are beholden to inaction. \u201cI would like to see Liberals challenged on a seat-by-seat basis until they get the message.\u201d",

It is unclear if they are being paid for the works.</p> <p>The mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, of the populist Five Star Movement, and Francesco Basentini, the chief of the prison administration department, were present as the prisoners began fixing streets in Torre Spaccata, an area to the east of the city, on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>More prisoners will be brought in to mend roads, which are badly blighted by dangerous potholes and decaying surfaces, in other areas between now and the middle of February.</p> <p>Authorities initially proposed drafting in the army to do the job but the controversial suggestion was rejected by parliament while the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, said during his New Year speech that \u201cthe role of the armed forces must not be distorted to assigning them to tasks incompatible with their high specialisation\u201d.</p> <p>The prisoners chosen were considered to be low-risk and serving short sentences.</p> <p>The poor state of the streets was blamed for the death of a young motorcyclist last May.

Some deep holes on streets in the centre have been cordoned off for months without being fixed.</p> <p>The latest scheme follows a similar initiative last year in which prisoners were tasked with cleaning up parks and gardens across the capital. Raggi said such projects helped to rehabilitate inmates.</p> <p>The mayor, who has led Rome since June 2016, regularly comes under fire from residents for the state of the capital, with other problems including uncollected rubbish and an ailing transport system. Since the start of the year, three buses have spontaneously caught fire due to suspected poor maintenance.</p> <p>Thousands of Rome residents protested in October against what they called the city\u2019s decay.

      "bodyText": "A group of about 30 prisoners were among the first to start fixing Rome\u2019s pothole-strewn streets as part of an initiative that authorities in the Italian capital have labelled \u201cI redeem myself for Rome\u201d. The inmates, from Rebibbia, one of the biggest prisons in Italy, have been trained to lay asphalt and undertake other maintenance work by the motorway operator, Autostrade per l\u2019Italia. It is unclear if they are being paid for the works. The mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, of the populist Five Star Movement, and Francesco Basentini, the chief of the prison administration department, were present as the prisoners began fixing streets in Torre Spaccata, an area to the east of the city, on Tuesday morning. More prisoners will be brought in to mend roads, which are badly blighted by dangerous potholes and decaying surfaces, in other areas between now and the middle of February. Authorities initially proposed drafting in the army to do the job but the controversial suggestion was rejected by parliament while the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, said during his New Year speech that \u201cthe role of the armed forces must not be distorted to assigning them to tasks incompatible with their high specialisation\u201d. The prisoners chosen were considered to be low-risk and serving short sentences. The poor state of the streets was blamed for the death of a young motorcyclist last May. Soon after, residents began drawing circles around hazardous potholes with green and yellow spray paint in order to highlight their existence, but were told they could face fines for defacing the roads. Luca Bergamo, Rome\u2019s vice-mayor, said in October that 2,050 miles (3,300km) of roads in the capital had not been properly maintained for years, but that stifling bureaucracy made tender processes for works extremely lengthy. Some deep holes on streets in the centre have been cordoned off for months without being fixed. The latest scheme follows a similar initiative last year in which prisoners were tasked with cleaning up parks and gardens across the capital. Raggi said such projects helped to rehabilitate inmates. The mayor, who has led Rome since June 2016, regularly comes under fire from residents for the state of the capital, with other problems including uncollected rubbish and an ailing transport system. Since the start of the year, three buses have spontaneously caught fire due to suspected poor maintenance. Thousands of Rome residents protested in October against what they called the city\u2019s decay. The problems are continuously chronicled on social media, with people sharing images of piles of rubbish and graffiti.",

These unauthorized \u201cwildcat\u201d strikes won gains in teachers\u2019 salaries and funding for schools. (Not incidentally, they also galvanized thousands of teachers to run for office in the 2018 midterm elections.) These were especially powerful because they offered elected officials no union leader or chief organizer with whom to negotiate a deal, who would then sell it to rank-and-file workers. As with the air traffic controllers last week, officials had to back down because the people they were dealing with were all rank-and-file, and public pressure was mounting rapidly. Not all public workers can expect similar results by walking off their jobs. The walkout has to cause a major and visible disruption. (A work stoppage by FDA inspectors would hardly be noticed, at least until the public begins to worrying about toxic drugs and tainted meat.) And the public has to be supportive. By the fifth week of Trump\u2019s shutdown, polls showed the public highly sympathetic to federal workers who hadn\u2019t been paid. Likewise, most Americans have been on the side of teachers. National polls have shown the public largely in favor of higher teacher pay and supportive of teachers\u2019 right to strike. Finally, it\u2019s not a weapon that can be used often because it relies for its potency on public frustration and inconvenience. If walkouts by public employees in France and other nations are any guide, public patience eventually wears thin. But when elected officials in the United States abuse their power or take actions that unnecessarily harm the public, walkouts by public workers can function as an important constraint. In the age of Trump, we need all the constraints we can get.",

But plainly they have not. For every new-wave fishmonger or butcher that opens (Clifton Seafood Company at Bristol\u2019s Wapping Wharf; the wet fish counters at Nottingham\u2019s Cod\u2019s Scallops chip shops; The Butcher\u2019s Quarter in Manchester; London\u2019s Ginger Pigs), hundreds more have closed in recent decades. It is impractical for the vast majority of us to regularly use independent food shops. Similarly, while many of us may be eating less meat (a good news story), the vegetarians and vegans <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/vegans-uk/\">don\u2019t yet have the numbers</a> to explain why, suddenly, supermarket meat and dairy counters are surplus to requirements.</p> <p>Instead, I think, broadly, Britain is now food-literate but food-cynical \u2013 especially where supermarket fresh food counters are concerned. To varying degrees, we have bought Nigella\u2019s books, seen Tom Kerridge on TV and, if pushed, probably agree with whatever Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is banging on about this week. We know just enough, in fact, to see through the supermarkets\u2019 attempts to sell us an artisan food experience on their fresh food counters, without quite having the wherewithal to stop using supermarkets.</p> <p>There was a moment, circa 2006, when it felt like this might shift. Provenance, animal welfare and traditional food production were being more widely discussed. Food quality was rising up the agenda. On everything from free-range eggs to sustainable fish, victories were achieved that continue to play out. But then the 2008 financial crash happened, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/10/04/case-job-done-drastic-dave-tesco-not-quite/\">wages stagnated</a> \u2013 falling in real terms \u2013 household bills continued to rise and, suddenly, food (and particularly the weekly supermarket shop) became a resented drain on our collective resources as much as a source of pleasure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/28/tesco-cost-cutting-ceo-should-note-simpler-may-not-mean-better\">Tesco's cost-cutting CEO should note simpler may not mean better | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In those circumstances, who is going to pay slightly more at the fresh food counter? (Aldi and Lidl don\u2019t even have them). Particularly at a time when \u2013 as two years of testing supermarket own-brand products for the Guardian brought home to me \u2013 food quality in most supermarkets is, at best, wobbling precariously. Caught between rising raw material and production costs and an increasingly price-sensitive public, the supermarkets are bean-counting every last, well, bean. And we can taste it. We might still be buying \u201cposh\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/20/ice-cream-taste-test-vanilla-supermarket-haagen-dazs\">vanilla ice-cream flavoured with low-rent vanilla extract and powder</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/08/herb-wars-which-supermarket-wins-the-pesto-taste-test\">pesto bulked-out with bamboo fibres</a>, but, we are doing so begrudgingly. We are not being enticed to trade up to more expensive items on the fresh food counter. One Tesco executive suggested we lack the time to linger at them. Could we simply lack the appetite?</p> <p>Tesco\u2019s chief executive, David Lewis, should be pilloried for this decision. Those staff he is laying off helped deliver <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43722494\">\u00a31.3bn in pre-tax profits</a> to February 2018. But cutting those counters probably sums up exactly where mainstream food retail is right now. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/10/04/case-job-done-drastic-dave-tesco-not-quite/\">Drastic Dave</a>\u201d is getting real with the public. This is a \u201cchallenging\u201d market in which Tesco wants to make money and we all want value. As we stare down the barrel of Brexit, let\u2019s drop the pretence that anyone is shopping in UK supermarkets because it is a delicious experience. We expect them to deliver OK food, functional food and, most importantly, cheap food.</p> <p>This is grim news for those facing redundancy, but also for the overall direction of British food. Nonetheless, pulling those fresh food counters makes perfect sense.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Naylor is a freelance journalist based in Manchester, UK</p>",

It would be amazing, as a food writer, to report that this is because a newly food-conscious generation have risen up, marched out of the supermarket and into their local cheesemongers. But plainly they have not. For every new-wave fishmonger or butcher that opens (Clifton Seafood Company at Bristol\u2019s Wapping Wharf; the wet fish counters at Nottingham\u2019s Cod\u2019s Scallops chip shops; The Butcher\u2019s Quarter in Manchester; London\u2019s Ginger Pigs), hundreds more have closed in recent decades. It is impractical for the vast majority of us to regularly use independent food shops. Similarly, while many of us may be eating less meat (a good news story), the vegetarians and vegans don\u2019t yet have the numbers to explain why, suddenly, supermarket meat and dairy counters are surplus to requirements. Instead, I think, broadly, Britain is now food-literate but food-cynical \u2013 especially where supermarket fresh food counters are concerned. To varying degrees, we have bought Nigella\u2019s books, seen Tom Kerridge on TV and, if pushed, probably agree with whatever Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is banging on about this week. We know just enough, in fact, to see through the supermarkets\u2019 attempts to sell us an artisan food experience on their fresh food counters, without quite having the wherewithal to stop using supermarkets. There was a moment, circa 2006, when it felt like this might shift. Provenance, animal welfare and traditional food production were being more widely discussed. Food quality was rising up the agenda. On everything from free-range eggs to sustainable fish, victories were achieved that continue to play out. But then the 2008 financial crash happened, wages stagnated \u2013 falling in real terms \u2013 household bills continued to rise and, suddenly, food (and particularly the weekly supermarket shop) became a resented drain on our collective resources as much as a source of pleasure. In those circumstances, who is going to pay slightly more at the fresh food counter? (Aldi and Lidl don\u2019t even have them). Particularly at a time when \u2013 as two years of testing supermarket own-brand products for the Guardian brought home to me \u2013 food quality in most supermarkets is, at best, wobbling precariously. Caught between rising raw material and production costs and an increasingly price-sensitive public, the supermarkets are bean-counting every last, well, bean. And we can taste it. We might still be buying \u201cposh\u201d vanilla ice-cream flavoured with low-rent vanilla extract and powder or pesto bulked-out with bamboo fibres, but, we are doing so begrudgingly. We are not being enticed to trade up to more expensive items on the fresh food counter. One Tesco executive suggested we lack the time to linger at them. Could we simply lack the appetite? Tesco\u2019s chief executive, David Lewis, should be pilloried for this decision. Those staff he is laying off helped deliver \u00a31.3bn in pre-tax profits to February 2018. But cutting those counters probably sums up exactly where mainstream food retail is right now. \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d is getting real with the public. This is a \u201cchallenging\u201d market in which Tesco wants to make money and we all want value. As we stare down the barrel of Brexit, let\u2019s drop the pretence that anyone is shopping in UK supermarkets because it is a delicious experience. We expect them to deliver OK food, functional food and, most importantly, cheap food. This is grim news for those facing redundancy, but also for the overall direction of British food. Nonetheless, pulling those fresh food counters makes perfect sense. \u2022 Tony Naylor is a freelance journalist based in Manchester, UK",

Avoid excess fees The government is banning letting agent fees for renters signing new contracts from 1 June this year \u2013 but if you are signing or renewing a tenancy agreement between now and that date, you will still be liable for any fees. However, it is worth challenging fees in contracts between now and then and shopping around for an agent like OpenRent, which already does not charge tenants any fees. Be prepared to dispute deductions from the deposit if you feel charges are unfair. The burden of proof is on the landlord, and if they are unable to prove the damage was caused during the current tenancy they won\u2019t be able to claim against you. \u201cCompleting a detailed inventory is a good way to protect damage deposits from spurious claims,\u201d says Cooper Healey, manager at Manchester Student Homes. Save others from the experience At the end of the year, when others are looking around your home and you\u2019re making your exit plans, let them know if the property isn\u2019t up to scratch. As one fed up University of Liverpool student put it: \u201cI can\u2019t wait for people to come and view my uni house so I can tell them about the brown ceiling water, the mess, the mice, the slugs, the cold, the mould, the damp, the cold water, the sadness and the nine people living in one house.\u201d",

Top story: China blasts \u2018unfair and immoral\u2019 US charges against Huawei A hoped-for trade detente between the world\u2019s two largest economies has been set back after US authorities charged the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei with a string of criminal offences, which the China\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as being politically motivated, \u201cunfair and immoral\u201d. The US justice department has accused Huawei of conspiring to violate sanctions on Iran by conducting business with Tehran through a subsidiary. It also accused Huawei of stealing technology from the telecoms firm T-Mobile US. Trade talks. Chinese officials are due in Washington for trade talks later this week, with Donald Trump threatening to raise the tariff on thousands of Chinese products to 25%. White House strong-arms Maduro with oil sanctions The Trump administration has announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, as part of its efforts to help push out the country\u2019s leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who is facing the most serious challenge yet to his troubled six-year presidency.

New Zealand. Unlike most of the US\u2019s allies, New Zealand has declined to back Guaid\u00f3, with its foreign minister saying Venezuela must \u201cdecide its future through free and fair elections\u201d. Is Oleg Deripaska the missing link in the Trump-Russia investigation? A recent disclosure that Trump\u2019s campaign chairman and a key Russian business associate discussed a Ukraine peace plan in mid-2016 could signal more scrutiny of Oleg Deripaska, a powerful Russian oligarch, by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, former prosecutors and intelligence officials told the Guardian. Talks. The talks between Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, a veteran political consultant, and Konstantin Kilimnik, his longtime aide who allegedly had ties to Russian intelligence in 2016, occurred in New York on 2 August . The meeting came just days after Kilimnik met Deripaska, a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. Neither Kilimnik nor Deripaska responded to emails seeking comment. Nearing the end. The acting US attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, said on Monday that Mueller\u2019s investigation was \u201cclose to being completed\u201d. Brazil easing environmental rules despite mining disaster The new Brazilian government says it will continue dismantling the country\u2019s environmental licensing regulations, despite dire warnings from campaigners after the deadliest mining disaster in decades. At least 60 people have been found dead and hundreds are still missing after a dam collapse at a mining facility in Minas Gerais state last week, which deluged the community of Brumadinho with mud and iron ore. Same company. Last week\u2019s dam collapse was the second such disaster in less than four years at a facility run by the Brazilian mining multinational Vale. Dam safety. Less than one in five of Brazil\u2019s 24,092 dams come under the supervision of a 2010 dam safety law, according to Brazilian media, and just 3% inspected in 2017. Crib sheet Almost 1,000 hotel workers at the Sheraton Park and Hilton hotels in Anaheim, California, are preparing to strike over low pay and reduced health coverage, continuing a wave of industrial action by hospitality unions across the US. Donald Trump has accepted the house speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s invitation to deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday 5 February, a week later than originally planned, after it was delayed because of the partial government shutdown. Apple is scrambling to fix a bug in its FaceTime video-calling app, which allows users to listen in on whomever they are calling, even if that person does not pick up the call. The former superintendent of Joshua Tree national park has said it could take \u201c300 years\u201d for the park to recover from damage inflicted by vandals and other inconsiderate visitors during the 35-day government shutdown. Must-reads The unstoppable rise of alternative milks Ten years ago, the only widely available milk alternative was soya. Today, the plant-based milk business is worth $16bn, and half of all US shoppers buy plant milk. Is it just clever marketing, or a more conscious approach to consumption, asks Oliver Franklin-Wallis. Chris Christie\u2019s score-settling memoir, reviewed The former New Jersey governor expected to be a big part of the Trump administration until Jared Kushner forced him out. Or so Christie writes in his new memoir, Let Me Finish. It\u2019s a self-serving, fascinating and informative read, says reviewer Lloyd Green. How the far right set its sights on women From Marine Le Pen to Alice Weidel, a new generation of women are at the forefront of Europe\u2019s far-right politics.

Transport Focus, the passenger watchdog that conducts the biannual survey, said the results showed the need for fundamental change in rail services as overall satisfaction with journeys fell to 79%, meaning more than one in five passengers were not satisfied. In a year marked by cancellations and chaos after the introduction of new timetables, as well as numerous strikes, passenger satisfaction declined significantly on seven operators: Great Northern, Northern, TransPennine Express, Greater Anglia, Thameslink, ScotRail and London North Eastern Railway. Great Northern has now replaced Southern, its sister company in the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, as the train operator with the least satisfied customers. Scotrail recorded its lowest score since 2002, with just 79% satisfied, in a year marked by cancellations and the late delivery of new trains. Only two operators, Heathrow Express and Chiltern Railways, improved markedly on their autumn 2017 score in the national rail passenger survey, which records the satisfaction of more than 25,000 passengers with their latest journey.

Two factions have thrown their weight behind the unexpected new compromise plan, backed by several ministers, which would involve a redrafting of the backstop and an extension of the transition period until 2021. However, it is still unclear whether the prime minister is prepared to pursue the offer of compromise, while elements of the plan have been met with deep scepticism from some MPs and the EU. Here is a look at the details of the proposal: How did the compromise come about? The plan is based on a protocol drafted by the former Brexit minister Steve Baker but the initiative has been called the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d, after the housing minister Kit Malthouse, who entreated the two warring factions to attempt talks. MPs have been meeting in secret over the past few days to try to agree a plan both sides could support.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes, Marie goes three days without a meal. The 46-year-old used to get by with her disability living allowance, but as austerity hit and the Conservatives replaced it with personal independence payments (PIP), last year she lost the social security entirely.</p> <p>Her disabilities haven\u2019t magically disappeared. She walks with crutches due to degenerative joints, but can\u2019t get far. A series of unsuccessful operations mean her knees dislocate each week. Pain is constant, and she has severe depression too.</p> <p>Marie sits in thermals, a jumper and a dressing gown \u2013 she can\u2019t afford the heating. As the temperature drops, she tells me she\u2019ll soon wear a jacket inside, too. On the days she can\u2019t buy proper food, she survives on toast. She cuts her own hair now. This week, her sister had to buy her toilet roll.</p> <p>Ministers like to dub this \u201cwelfare reform\u201d but for Marie, it is profound anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m constantly worrying about money,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my very first thought after pain in the morning and my last at night.\u201d</p> <p>I thought of Marie as I watched Tory MP Heidi Allen and independent Frank Field embark on a nationwide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/24/ive-absolutely-had-enough-tory-mp-embarks-on-anti-austerity-tour\" title=\"\">\u201canti-austerity\u201d tour</a>, which started in Leicester last week. \u201cI have absolutely had enough,\u201d Allen said, her eyes reddening. \u201cUnless we blow the lid off it, my lot are not going to listen.\u201d Her intentions may be genuine \u2013 Allen was only elected in 2015 after the first wave of cuts came in \u2013 but this seeming surprise at the impact of austerity is, at best, naive and, at worse, negligent. The suffering Allen is crying about has not occurred by magic but is caused by policies she consistently voted for.</p> <p>Cut billions from disability, housing, in-work and child benefits, and deep poverty is the all-too-predictable consequence.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes, Marie goes three days without a meal. The 46-year-old used to get by with her disability living allowance, but as austerity hit and the Conservatives replaced it with personal independence payments (PIP), last year she lost the social security entirely. Her disabilities haven\u2019t magically disappeared. She walks with crutches due to degenerative joints, but can\u2019t get far. A series of unsuccessful operations mean her knees dislocate each week. Pain is constant, and she has severe depression too. Marie sits in thermals, a jumper and a dressing gown \u2013 she can\u2019t afford the heating. As the temperature drops, she tells me she\u2019ll soon wear a jacket inside, too. On the days she can\u2019t buy proper food, she survives on toast. She cuts her own hair now. This week, her sister had to buy her toilet roll. Ministers like to dub this \u201cwelfare reform\u201d but for Marie, it is profound anxiety. \u201cI\u2019m constantly worrying about money,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my very first thought after pain in the morning and my last at night.\u201d I thought of Marie as I watched Tory MP Heidi Allen and independent Frank Field embark on a nationwide \u201canti-austerity\u201d tour, which started in Leicester last week. \u201cI have absolutely had enough,\u201d Allen said, her eyes reddening. \u201cUnless we blow the lid off it, my lot are not going to listen.\u201d Her intentions may be genuine \u2013 Allen was only elected in 2015 after the first wave of cuts came in \u2013 but this seeming surprise at the impact of austerity is, at best, naive and, at worse, negligent. The suffering Allen is crying about has not occurred by magic but is caused by policies she consistently voted for. Cut billions from disability, housing, in-work and child benefits, and deep poverty is the all-too-predictable consequence. Take the disability benefit system. The result of austerity has been a benefit system stacked against the claimant, where disabled people are re-evaluated by outsourced staff with next to no medical training, frequently falsely turned down for benefits, and then forced to battle the lengthy appeals process to get them back. Others, like Marie, are simply left to live in destitution without them. This month it emerged that the rollout of PIP is costing the public purse \u00a34bn more than ministers estimated, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is the perversity of austerity: ministers have probably spent more trying to remove benefits from disabled people than it would have cost to give them the support they needed. With the Brexit crunch ahead, Britain is on the brink of significant change. But austerity surely requires just as much soul searching from the political class.

      "bodyText": "A plan from rival Conservative factions aimed at securing a breakthrough in the Brexit impasse has been greeted with immediate scepticism from EU officials, who said the proposals were not workable. Senior Tory Brexit supporters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker hatched the plan with leading remainers including Nicky Morgan and Stephen Hammond. The proposal involves paying the \u00a339bn EU divorce bill, redrafting the backstop arrangements over the Irish border and extending the implementation period until December 2021. The extra time would be used to try to agree a free-trade deal, while citizens\u2019 rights would be guaranteed. In that period, there would be no customs checks on the Irish border. The initiative has been called the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d after the housing minister Kit Malthouse, who entreated the two warring factions to attempt talks. EU officials dismissed the suggested compromise, which they said failed to offer Ireland any reassurance on the avoidance of a hard border. Brussels sources pointed out the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, had said technology to avoid a hard border does not exist. \u201cWhat a cunning plan,\u201d laughed one official. \u201cThis is just nonsense,\u201d echoed an EU diplomat. Brexit-backing MPs, including Rees-Mogg, were still seeking fresh reassurances from the prime minister before they vote for a government-backed amendment on the backstop on Tuesday evening, which could pave the way for the new plan to be put to Brussels.

Theresa May is expected to open the debate for the government, allowing her to set out her next steps for MPs. She faces conflicting pressures from rival wings of her party. As well as Rees-Mogg\u2019s demands for a pledge to rework the backstop, pro-soft Brexit ministers are demanding a clear commitment that she will hold another vote to allow MPs to reject no deal, if attempts at renegotiation fail. The business minister Richard Harrington told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday he and colleagues were demanding a promise from the prime minister that she would secure her plan B within a fortnight \u2013 or give them another chance to reject no deal. \u201cIf she is prepared to give that irrevocable undertaking \u2013 which means at the dispatch box or a similar instrument \u2013 many of us feel, \u2018Well, OK for the sake of everything, we will give her two weeks.\u2019 But that is it.\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the Eurosceptic former Conservative leader, told Today the plan represented \u201cthe best hope that we\u2019ve got\u201d and urged the government to get behind it.

She said that sex trafficking operations between Nigeria, Libya and Italy are highly organised and continue despite recent attempts to stem the flow of migration from north Africa to Europe. \u201cThere is an industry in the exploitation of girls from the age of 14 who have all become terrorised and controlled through the use of these juju ceremonies,\u201d she says. Yesterday, Sicilian prosecutors in Catania also arrested 19 Nigerians suspected of belonging to the Supreme Vikings Confraternity, an organised crime group operational across Sicily. The men are accused of drug smuggling and the rape and sexual assault of Nigerian women in Cara di Mineo, one of Italy\u2019s largest reception centres for refugees. Prosecutors told the Guardian that they were considering the possibility that the men arrested were raping women at the centre \u201cwith the aim of subjugating them and preparing them for prostitution\u2019\u2019. About 16,000 Nigerian women arrived in Italy from Libya between 2016-2017. According to the UN\u2019s International Office for Migration (IOM) more than 80% of them were victims of trafficking, destined for a life of forced prostitution on street corners and in brothels across Italy and Europe. In recent weeks hundreds of people have been removed from reception centres across Italy as part of the populist government\u2019s hardline immigration measures. The moves come as a part of a concerted push to implement the \u201cSalvini decree\u201d \u2013 named after Italy\u2019s interior minister Matteo Salvini. It abolishes humanitarian protection for those not eligible for refugee status, and was passed by the Italian government last year. As a result hundreds of asylum seekers are now at risk of homelessness. NGOs and aid agencies, including the Red Cross, have warned that victims of sex trafficking are among those evicted. \u201cIf this is true then the decree has been misinterpreted by local authorities,\u201d says Scaminaci. \u201cNigerian women victims of sex trafficking must always be granted a humanitarian permit or a refugee status because of the consequences they could face if deported back in Nigeria.\u201d Last December, Blessing, a 31-year-old Nigerian woman who was trafficked into prostitution in Italy, said she had been removed from a reception centre in Isola di Capo Rizzuto, in Calabria. \u201cWhen the police came to tell us that we couldn\u2019t stay there any more, I couldn\u2019t believe my ears,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took all of our belongings and escorted us out. There was a young girl in our group. This is outrageous. I have a legal permit to stay. And soon I may not have a roof over my head. I\u2019m really frightened.\u201d Father Enzo Volpe, a Salesian priest in Palermo who has been providing assistance to Nigerian women for seven years, says that the clearing of reception centres is likely to increase the risk of further trafficking and exploitation. \u201cLeaving these girls in the street, victims of sex trafficking, is not only inhumane, it also means facilitating the work of criminal organisations,\u201d he said. \u201cWith no protection, these girls risk becoming easy prey.\u201d",

If a small, independent publisher like Jacaranda can publish 20 black British writers in one year, then there is no reason why larger publishers cannot match that.\u201d Jacaranda\u2019s move comes soon after the independent publisher Knights Of\u2019s successful crowdfunding campaign to open pop-up children\u2019s bookshops around the UK that stock only diverse books, with the publisher raising almost \u00a350,000. \u201cWe are in a time where people are rallying behind diverse initiatives \u2026 these donations show that people are eager and supportive of publishing to become more diverse,\u201d said Abraha. \u201cWe hope that this will encourage unity and partnerships within the industry in favour of diverse writers and books.\u201d The #Twenty2020 list in full Fiction Deadly Sacrifice by Stella Ahmadu Of Mice and Men (working title) by DD Armstrong Bad Love by Maame Blue How to Make Sticky Finger Soup by Emmanuella Dekonor If I Don\u2019t Have You by Sareeta Domingo The Street Hawkers Apprentice by Kabir Kareem-Bello Love Again by Rasheda Ashanti Malcolm Under Solomon Skies by Berni Sorga-Millwood Black Star by Stephen Thompson Lote by Shola von Rheinhold Non-fiction Through the Leopards Gaze by Njambi McGrath The Space Between Black and White by Esuantsiwa Jane Goldsmith A Circle of Five by Harris Joshua Are We Home Yet? by Kate Massey Black History Walks by Tony Warner Poetry Locating Strong Woman by Tolu Agbelusi Jamakspeare by Brenda Garrick The First Collection by Sarah Lipton-Sidibeh Untitled by Hibaq Osman On Reflection by Adjoa Wiredu",

Scarves were long, bags were big and for the first time in four seasons, tailoring triumphed over tracksuits. Here are the other trends we can expect to see next autumn. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fdd7ddb1718e8ba5c097d9ae8fcd0ce6b961000c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdd7ddb1718e8ba5c097d9ae8fcd0ce6b961000c/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A model backstage ahead of the John Lawrence Sullivan show during London fashion week at Kachette.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model backstage ahead of the John Lawrence Sullivan show during London fashion week at Kachette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Whitby/BFC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leopard</h2> <ul> <li><p>John Lawrence Sullivan show during London fashion week at Kachette.</p></li> </ul> <p>Rare is the season in which leopard print is absent from womenswear \u2026 but menswear? It\u2019s hardly a perennial. Yet this season it was, appearing in all shades and motifs, brash and textured. At John Lawrence Sullivan, it appeared on coats and bomber jackets in clear 70s prints. At Marni, it ran the gamut \u2013 from creepers and fluffy coats, to hats and wide-legged trousers, lending the whole collection a cartoonish edge. Neil Barrett put it on collars and Sacai doubled it up, but few expected to see a mod-style leopard-print coat in a quiet shade of gold. Some labels can change their spots, it seems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"fc579a9486354515104c9252561819d7373339ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc579a9486354515104c9252561819d7373339ab/0_0_3086_4629/667.jpg\" alt=\"Leopard print on the Marni catwalk in Milan.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leopard print on the Marni catwalk in Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"58ba95fd45c78f288b4631e415fcda11f96f2dbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ba95fd45c78f288b4631e415fcda11f96f2dbb/0_0_2840_4256/667.jpg\" alt=\"Doubling up at Sacai in Paris.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doubling up at Sacai in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"787153729e3245bc083982e3b744f2ce426c3306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787153729e3245bc083982e3b744f2ce426c3306/361_17_3068_4600/667.jpg\" alt=\"An animal-print coat at the C\u00e9line ready to wear show in Paris.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An animal-print coat at the C\u00e9line ready-to-wear show in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"a79bf2662af9d84d58f56d48f285fe63d688acff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a79bf2662af9d84d58f56d48f285fe63d688acff/0_0_1333_1999/667.jpg\" alt=\"Leopard print collars at the Neil Barrett show at Milan.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leopard-print collars at the Neil Barrett show at Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Take a walk on the wild side: Marni, Sacai, Neil Barrett and C\u00e9line.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"42f80c6a4b76482bc115ba58ebe58099f4fdfe98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42f80c6a4b76482bc115ba58ebe58099f4fdfe98/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black tailoring at Dries van Noten in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black tailoring at Dries van Noten in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Bord/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The black suit</h2> <ul> <li><p>Dries van Noten in Paris</p></li> </ul> <p>This season, the death knell rang out for sportswear.

Working with a \u201csurvivalist\u201d theme, Korean designer Juun.J created silver foil totes which packed down small \u2013 this in stark contrast to Xander Zhou whose huge one shouldered bags resembled angel\u2019s wings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"cefc9d65f2f0c83d7914144b7966cddfc15e2356\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cefc9d65f2f0c83d7914144b7966cddfc15e2356/54_88_2798_4057/690.jpg\" alt=\"Xander Zhou\u2019s giant bags in London.\" width=\"690\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xander Zhou\u2019s giant bags in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d22655bdda08eb9de199bb3b6ecbbf3623617076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d22655bdda08eb9de199bb3b6ecbbf3623617076/15_43_2337_3389/690.jpg\" alt=\"Silver bags at Juun.J Menswear, Paris.\" width=\"690\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silver bags at Juun.J Menswear, Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter White/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Xander Zhou and Juun.J.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d02a4dc1376e44ad3b8bf4b36e9912b5bc20ed43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d02a4dc1376e44ad3b8bf4b36e9912b5bc20ed43/0_19_2000_2616/765.jpg\" alt=\"A model backstage at Loewe with a pink drawstring bag.\" width=\"765\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model backstage at Loewe with a pink drawstring bag.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LOEWE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"e80257a99871ca125fa027e82bd2c1bfb59a001d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80257a99871ca125fa027e82bd2c1bfb59a001d/0_145_3075_4023/764.jpg\" alt=\"A rucksack by Louis Vuitton on the catwalk.\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rucksack by Louis Vuitton on the catwalk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Armando Grillo/Luis Vuitton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Pink drawstring at Loewe, and rucksack at Louis Vuitton.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e94f0955c00ffd992e34291e720a9ba88a1b3d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e94f0955c00ffd992e34291e720a9ba88a1b3d6/0_0_5366_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bag on the catwalk at Herm\u00e8s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bag on the catwalk at Herm\u00e8s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Maitre/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>An oversized take on the Birkin shape at Herm\u00e8s.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d1fa6b33ed00caae3fd3c786d6a4dedf3d307bea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1fa6b33ed00caae3fd3c786d6a4dedf3d307bea/0_0_4320_2855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Long scarves at the Acne Studios show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Long scarves at the Acne Studios show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Scarves</h2> <ul> <li><p>Acne Studios, Paris</p></li> </ul> <p>Designers took their cue from Mr Tickle this season with scarves of all textures, shapes and colours trailing down the catwalks.

      "bodyText": "The autumn/winter 2019 menswear shows were full of comebacks and firsts. Milan hosted blockbuster shows from Prada, Versace and even Dolce &amp; Gabbana, treading carefully after last year\u2019s China racism row. Paris was packed and cold, but saw universally successful debuts from Hedi Slimane at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy. Craig Green returned to the London schedule alongside Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, who had a plaid party in a warehouse, and A-Cold-Wall*, which put a doberman on the catwalk. Scarves were long, bags were big and for the first time in four seasons, tailoring triumphed over tracksuits. Here are the other trends we can expect to see next autumn. Leopard John Lawrence Sullivan show during London fashion week at Kachette. Rare is the season in which leopard print is absent from womenswear \u2026 but menswear? It\u2019s hardly a perennial. Yet this season it was, appearing in all shades and motifs, brash and textured. At John Lawrence Sullivan, it appeared on coats and bomber jackets in clear 70s prints. At Marni, it ran the gamut \u2013 from creepers and fluffy coats, to hats and wide-legged trousers, lending the whole collection a cartoonish edge. Neil Barrett put it on collars and Sacai doubled it up, but few expected to see a mod-style leopard-print coat in a quiet shade of gold. Some labels can change their spots, it seems. Take a walk on the wild side: Marni, Sacai, Neil Barrett and C\u00e9line. The black suit Dries van Noten in Paris This season, the death knell rang out for sportswear. Well, not quite, but the suit gave it a run for its money. Black versions that were edgy and funereal at the same time led the charge. In Paris, they were elegant, crisp and flowing at Dries van Noten, relaxed and casual at Valentino, and serious and winter-proof at Dunhill. At Dior, they came red-carpet ready with a detachable sash. Men in black: Stella McCartney and Prada. Over in Milan, Prada and Fendi showed versions with a high-octane glamour and feminine undertone \u2013 think shine and a slim cut that was pleasing to watch on the catwalk. Stella McCartney went for a back-to-school version. At Berluti, Kris Van Assche closed the show with a his-and-hers version \u2013 because how many trends overlap genders quite so keenly? Dunhill in Paris Black is back: Fendi and Valentino. Pink Craig Green during London fashion week men. The autumn catwalks were a riot of colour this season, yet one shade ruled them all. Surprisingly, for a world that has been saturated by millennial pink and all the cultural and gender baggage that comes with it, here it was used with nuance, clashing with green or layered up at Ami and Acne Studios (the same Acne Studios that put it on a bag and launched a thousand copycats). At Loewe, Anderson turned it into a suit over comically oversized shirting, a fun combination which clashed magically with the mustard carpet. In the pink: Marni and Loewe Craig Green and Marni went for head to toe, playing with textures and fabrics \u2013 high shine or knitted, this was a \u201cchoose your weapon\u201d moment. At Raf Simons, in his first show since news of his departure from Calvin Klein, the takeaway moment was a voluminous pink trenchcoat \u2013 no belt \u2013 styled in a loose, carefree way. \u201cI want to do something abstract and beautiful and elegant and proud and sophisticated, but without losing the edge of what the brand stands for: the young generation,\u201d he told Vogue. Touche. Pink overcoat at Raf Simons show in Paris. Everything\u2019s rosy: Ami Paris and Acne Studios. Leather Berluti at Palais Garnier, Paris As ever, leather was a recurring theme at the shows this year, though few things will top the Instagram picture of Frank Ocean in a pair of leather Loewe chaps backstage. That said, Isabel Marant\u2019s flying jackets with billowing arms were wearable and a tour de force, while Givenchy\u2019s ultra-tight leather trench (belted, this time) was a lesson in elegance. Jil Sander\u2019s loose-fitting, grey leather shirt and leather trouser combination was aimed at the brave. Ditto Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, who went vintage with his jackets, and Berluti which opened the show at the Palais Garnier opera house with a tan brushed leather suit. Hell for leather: Isabel Marant, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Givenchy and Jil Sander. Puffer coats Iceberg show in London. This season, men\u2019s fashion continues to work in tandem with the weather, with puffer jackets designed to withstand the polar vortex. A bona fide trend since Balenciaga put them on the 2017 catwalk, they came athleisure-friendly at Iceberg under James Long in London, patched like a Mondrian at Fendi in Milan or low-denier and commuter-friendly at British label, Cottweiler. Pump up the volume: Fendi, Cottweiler. If oversized, primary-coloured puffer jackets have dominated high and low fashion for the past two years, Rick Owens\u2019 longline versions were a u-turn moment, coming fitted in metallic and monochrome shades. Marni\u2019s Francesco Risso introduced the hybrid coat/robe as outerwear this season, but it was his layered puffers in iced lemon which stole the show. Unless you count Cardi B\u2019s on/off boyfriend, Offset, modelling a duvet coat in lilac with a built-in bumbag worn cross-body on the Off White catwalk, accessorised by the scent of vaping. Puff daddies: Rick Owens, and below: Marni, Off-White. Big bags Dior in Paris. Bags\u2019 shapes wax and wane in fashion. But in menswear this season, they were enormous. In Paris, Herm\u00e8s showed a men\u2019s version of its cult Birkin bag in deep red, but elsewhere they tended towards sportier shapes. At Louis Vuitton, designer Virgil Abloh created a giant rucksack in grey felt with a subtle monogram, while Loewe created a drawstring bag in pastel leather. Working with a \u201csurvivalist\u201d theme, Korean designer Juun.J created silver foil totes which packed down small \u2013 this in stark contrast to Xander Zhou whose huge one shouldered bags resembled angel\u2019s wings.

      "body": "<p>Until 29 January 2017, random motorists on the busy Chemin Sainte-Foy would sometimes pull over to the Quebec City Grand Mosque to withdraw some money.</p> <p>Converted from a Desjardins Bank, it still looks like one, with its rows of rectangular glass panes and a barricaded drive-through. Its only crescent and minaret are in graphic form on a small plastic sign, blocked from the road by trees.</p> <p>Its ordinariness must have surprised those who had only heard about the mosque on <em>radio-poubelles, </em>or \u201ctrash radio\u201d, Quebec\u2019s uniquely corrosive brand of conservative talk radio. Even after a rightwing radical, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonette, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/26/quebec-mosque-attack-survivor-one-year-later-aymen-derbali\">opened fire on men and children</a> inside \u2013 killing six, injuring 19 and traumatizing many of its 500 weekly worshippers \u2013 radio hosts continued vilifying the mosque, falsely claiming women were forced to enter it from between dumpsters \u201clike cattle\u201d.</p> <p>For a place burdened with so much tragedy, the mosque remains remarkably nondescript. Its plainness is further exaggerated by a French colonial cathedral directly across the street. Itself a beleaguered place of worship, several fires since the 18th century have reduced the historic site to an ornate stone facade.</p> <p>But soon, the cathedral could have a twin. Pending city government approval, the Grand Mosque will undergo a dramatic transformation more befitting of its name. The renovation reimagines the rectangular red building into a contemporary edifice with classical Islamic features: arches, arabesque designs, and a minaret inspired by the cathedral\u2019s partial bell tower. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2343966c204864e2fdd5155934c75a66ba7a78b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2343966c204864e2fdd5155934c75a66ba7a78b4/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Infrastructure improvements of the Grand Mosque that will be rehabilitated with greater security.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infrastructure improvements of the Grand Mosque that will be rehabilitated with greater security.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Chiche/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not all Quebec City Muslims favour the design.</p> <p>One group feels that they should do something beautiful to present the mosque as part of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture, like the old church, as a sign that they don\u2019t have anything to hide, said Zied Kallel, who leads the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec\u2019s strategic committee.</p> <p>Another section of the community, including Kallel, worries the architecture \u2013 especially the minaret \u2013 could provoke further attacks and undermine recent security measures.</p> <p>A third group disagrees with those very safety measures, especially automatically locking doors, preferring the mosque be open 24 hours a day, in the spirit of those in much of the Muslim world.</p> <p>But unlike those mosques, the Grand Mosque is central to the immigrant Muslim community. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center runs a Sunday school, Arabic class, nursery and family activities inside. \u201cRunning them has been hard because families are afraid of going there,\u201d said Amira \u202aBoulmerka, the director of the Islamic School of Quebec. Several families stopped coming to the mosque, while others have left Quebec entirely. \u201cIt should be accessible 24 hours,\u201d said \u202aBoulmerka, \u201cbut in light of the upheavals and major issues of the world, I don\u2019t think mosques should be permanently open \u2013 and they can\u2019t be without surveillance.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Balancing security with openness</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c18d3a804f1604ba713bb249dd1b1dc0ef4a54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c18d3a804f1604ba713bb249dd1b1dc0ef4a54/14_0_3044_1828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Islamic Center of America Mosque in Dearborn, Michigan, is one of the largest and most iconic mosques in the US \u2013 and a frequent target of threats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Islamic Center of America Mosque in Dearborn, Michigan, is one of the largest and most iconic mosques in the US \u2013 and a frequent target of threats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mosques all across North America are struggling to balance security with openness. \u201cPsychologically, when people have to go through too many filters to attend [worship], they start becoming anxious about the facility itself,\u201d said Kassem Allie, executive administrator of the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan.</p> <p>As one of the US\u2019s largest and most iconic mosques, it is a frequent target of threats, harassment and anti-Muslim protests. After a pastor infamous for burning Qur\u2019ans vowed to do the same at the Michigan mosque, in 2011, they started hiring on-site personnel. Depending on the day \u2013 or headlines of the day \u2013 it\u2019s protected by as many as three patrolmen. \u201cWe can put a barbed-wire fence, put up metal detectors, x-ray machines, but the end result is that nobody would want to come,\u201d said Allie.</p> <p>The Islamic Society of Greater Houston never locked doors at its 20 mosques until a recent rash of arsons and vandalism at Texas mosques. Now they\u2019re locked up after Isha\u2019a, the last of five daily prayers. They also hired a sheriff\u2019s department and security firm to audit and help implement recommendations for each temple. Others around the country report installing emergency exits, elaborate camera systems, bulletproof glass and coded keypads.</p> <p>Costs run as high as $200,000. In Canada, the federal government covers half the expense. The program has formally existed since 2012, but most past recipients were Jewish groups. After the armed assault on the Grand Mosque, an unprecedented number of organizations applied for the funding. Now as many as two-thirds of recipients are Muslim groups.</p> <p>The Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec had long invested in security enhancements before Bissonnette\u2019s killing spree. Indeed, multi-camera footage was key evidence during at his trial. \u201cAccess was programmed according to the times of the day \u2013 10 minutes before prayer, and 10 minutes after,\u201d explained Aymen Derbali, whose only memory of trying to stop Bissonnette was from the video. Isha\u2019a prayer had already finished when the assailant entered the door and started shooting. Had Bissonnette come a few minutes later, Derbali might be able to walk today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92a4dd03e424d5f7a809f34f8d0b7c523e92fa79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92a4dd03e424d5f7a809f34f8d0b7c523e92fa79/0_0_5890_3932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aymen Derbali, 41, a victim of the Quebec City mosque attack, undergoes rehabilitation exercises.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aymen Derbali, 41, a victim of the Quebec City mosque attack, undergoes rehabilitation exercises.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Chiche/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The centre now requires worshippers to apply for individual access cards and prohibits children from opening doors to outside. One survivor of the tragedy monitors the camera feeds live from his apartment a block away.</p> <p>More enhancements are expected with the reconstruction, but safety is only part of the goal. The main purpose was expansion. Though the renderings were only presented to worshippers last year, they were drawn up by a Muslim architect from the mosque and a local firm two years before the tragedy. They never expected to have the funds to execute the million-dollar project so soon, but an outpouring of charitable donations could make it possible this year.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad to say, but we are famous because of what happened,\u201d said Kallel. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t with the money, it\u2019s with the planning.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1990s, fundraising for the mosque\u2019s first iteration took three years to reach its $120,000 goal. The community was a few hundred Muslims then, most of them North African immigrants who had come to study. As they earned middle-class careers and the community outgrew the space, it took another three years to raise the down payment on the former bank in 2008.

      "bodyText": "Until 29 January 2017, random motorists on the busy Chemin Sainte-Foy would sometimes pull over to the Quebec City Grand Mosque to withdraw some money. Converted from a Desjardins Bank, it still looks like one, with its rows of rectangular glass panes and a barricaded drive-through. Its only crescent and minaret are in graphic form on a small plastic sign, blocked from the road by trees. Its ordinariness must have surprised those who had only heard about the mosque on radio-poubelles, or \u201ctrash radio\u201d, Quebec\u2019s uniquely corrosive brand of conservative talk radio. Even after a rightwing radical, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonette, opened fire on men and children inside \u2013 killing six, injuring 19 and traumatizing many of its 500 weekly worshippers \u2013 radio hosts continued vilifying the mosque, falsely claiming women were forced to enter it from between dumpsters \u201clike cattle\u201d. For a place burdened with so much tragedy, the mosque remains remarkably nondescript. Its plainness is further exaggerated by a French colonial cathedral directly across the street. Itself a beleaguered place of worship, several fires since the 18th century have reduced the historic site to an ornate stone facade. But soon, the cathedral could have a twin. Pending city government approval, the Grand Mosque will undergo a dramatic transformation more befitting of its name. The renovation reimagines the rectangular red building into a contemporary edifice with classical Islamic features: arches, arabesque designs, and a minaret inspired by the cathedral\u2019s partial bell tower. But not all Quebec City Muslims favour the design. One group feels that they should do something beautiful to present the mosque as part of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture, like the old church, as a sign that they don\u2019t have anything to hide, said Zied Kallel, who leads the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec\u2019s strategic committee. Another section of the community, including Kallel, worries the architecture \u2013 especially the minaret \u2013 could provoke further attacks and undermine recent security measures. A third group disagrees with those very safety measures, especially automatically locking doors, preferring the mosque be open 24 hours a day, in the spirit of those in much of the Muslim world. But unlike those mosques, the Grand Mosque is central to the immigrant Muslim community. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center runs a Sunday school, Arabic class, nursery and family activities inside. \u201cRunning them has been hard because families are afraid of going there,\u201d said Amira \u202aBoulmerka, the director of the Islamic School of Quebec. Several families stopped coming to the mosque, while others have left Quebec entirely. \u201cIt should be accessible 24 hours,\u201d said \u202aBoulmerka, \u201cbut in light of the upheavals and major issues of the world, I don\u2019t think mosques should be permanently open \u2013 and they can\u2019t be without surveillance.\u201d Balancing security with openness Mosques all across North America are struggling to balance security with openness. \u201cPsychologically, when people have to go through too many filters to attend [worship], they start becoming anxious about the facility itself,\u201d said Kassem Allie, executive administrator of the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan. As one of the US\u2019s largest and most iconic mosques, it is a frequent target of threats, harassment and anti-Muslim protests. After a pastor infamous for burning Qur\u2019ans vowed to do the same at the Michigan mosque, in 2011, they started hiring on-site personnel. Depending on the day \u2013 or headlines of the day \u2013 it\u2019s protected by as many as three patrolmen. \u201cWe can put a barbed-wire fence, put up metal detectors, x-ray machines, but the end result is that nobody would want to come,\u201d said Allie. The Islamic Society of Greater Houston never locked doors at its 20 mosques until a recent rash of arsons and vandalism at Texas mosques. Now they\u2019re locked up after Isha\u2019a, the last of five daily prayers. They also hired a sheriff\u2019s department and security firm to audit and help implement recommendations for each temple. Others around the country report installing emergency exits, elaborate camera systems, bulletproof glass and coded keypads. Costs run as high as $200,000. In Canada, the federal government covers half the expense. The program has formally existed since 2012, but most past recipients were Jewish groups. After the armed assault on the Grand Mosque, an unprecedented number of organizations applied for the funding. Now as many as two-thirds of recipients are Muslim groups. The Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec had long invested in security enhancements before Bissonnette\u2019s killing spree. Indeed, multi-camera footage was key evidence during at his trial. \u201cAccess was programmed according to the times of the day \u2013 10 minutes before prayer, and 10 minutes after,\u201d explained Aymen Derbali, whose only memory of trying to stop Bissonnette was from the video. Isha\u2019a prayer had already finished when the assailant entered the door and started shooting. Had Bissonnette come a few minutes later, Derbali might be able to walk today. The centre now requires worshippers to apply for individual access cards and prohibits children from opening doors to outside. One survivor of the tragedy monitors the camera feeds live from his apartment a block away. More enhancements are expected with the reconstruction, but safety is only part of the goal. The main purpose was expansion. Though the renderings were only presented to worshippers last year, they were drawn up by a Muslim architect from the mosque and a local firm two years before the tragedy. They never expected to have the funds to execute the million-dollar project so soon, but an outpouring of charitable donations could make it possible this year. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to say, but we are famous because of what happened,\u201d said Kallel. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t with the money, it\u2019s with the planning.\u201d In the 1990s, fundraising for the mosque\u2019s first iteration took three years to reach its $120,000 goal. The community was a few hundred Muslims then, most of them North African immigrants who had come to study. As they earned middle-class careers and the community outgrew the space, it took another three years to raise the down payment on the former bank in 2008. But the Grand Mosque has struggled to keep up with the city\u2019s growing Muslim population, including many refugees, now estimated at 15,000. \u201cIt just gets so full, it\u2019s so tiny, and I don\u2019t like the fact that women are upstairs following the imam on a TV,\u201d said Kallel\u2019s wife, who asked to go by \u201cYasmin\u201d, fearing harassment. \u201cI wish we could have a real mosque inside, so when you go to pray you really feel like going to pray.\u201d She has, however, some reservations about the impressive new plans. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hide, but I wouldn\u2019t want to attract attention either.\u201d The Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec president, Boufeldja Benabdallah, said they hoped to \u201cembellish the image of Islam in Quebec and definitely mark our presence with a real Great Mosque of Quebec that will enter [local] Muslim history\u201d. The minaret, with steel spires fashioned after the neighbouring cathedral tower, was conceived as a harmonious gesture between faiths. For supporters of the aesthetic redesign, the architecture has become even more important since the tragedy. \u201cMaybe it will be more beautiful and attractive for people who want to learn about Islam,\u201d said Derbali. \u201cThe first message we have to give to the population is we are not afraid.\u201d Maybe so, but Quebec is a particularly hostile environment for Muslims. Anti-Muslim hate crimes in Quebec City doubled in the year since the attack. Two of the 42 reported cases involved excrement being thrown at the mosque and the past president\u2019s car being set on fire. In October 2017, Quebec\u2019s Liberal government passed a bill banning women in niqabs from receiving public services as basic as transit, while a newly elected rightwing party plans to expand those laws to prohibit civil servants from wearing any religious symbol at work. Given the environment, some worshippers would prefer the mosque to relocate entirely. But for Derbali, praying at the same mosque, albeit now from a wheelchair, has been therapeutic. When he finally returned for Friday prayers, seven months later, he struggled to retain his composure. \u201cI had some tears in my eyes, because I got a flashback of what happened and remembered the murders of all the brothers, and the ones who were injured,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in order to pass through this tragedy, I have to face it another time.\u201d To mitigate post-traumatic triggers, the prayer hall was repainted on the recommendations of trauma scene specialists, who also recommended replacing the carpet.

It was similar at a rally last year of Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy.</p> <p>In France, large numbers of women have taken to the streets as part of the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\" title=\"\">gilets jaunes</a></em> (yellow vest) anti-government movement, which has attracted people from across the political spectrum from left to far-right, some of whom vote Le Pen, and whose slogans often echo the disillusioned anti-elitism of populism.</p> <p>\u201cThere is evidence the gender gap is shrinking in some countries, although it clearly hasn\u2019t disappeared everywhere,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.uva.nl/en/profile/h/a/e.harteveld/e.harteveld.html\" title=\"\">Eelco Harteveld</a> of the University of Amsterdam.</p> <p>This raises the question: what do women see in nationalist populism that was once so dominated by patriarchal ideology? What motivates women to elect, support and even stand for parties and movements that shrink away from modern-day feminism?</p> <p>Conversations with dozens of European women \u2013 voters, MPs and academics \u2013 suggest several elements at play.</p> <p>Many working-class women feel just as \u201cleft behind\u201d as their male counterparts. The key predictor of a radical-right vote is the level of a person\u2019s education. Harteveld says that although the precarious manual jobs often associated with far-right voters are still largely male preserves, there is also precarious work in the service sector \u2013 where women are more numerous. Political scientists in France have pointed to <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35303003.pdf\" title=\"\">the disillusionment of retail staff and supermarket cashiers as a case in point</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe elite in power hasn\u2019t got a clue what life is like for real people, they\u2019re totally cut off,\u201d says Catherine, a cashier at a budget supermarket north-east of Paris, who has demonstrated with the gilets jaunes. Now in her mid-30s, she has been working on supermarket tills since she left school, and votes for Le Pen.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make ends meet on low salaries. I\u2019m overdrawn before the end of each month, living on credit, barely able to afford the petrol to get to work or drive my three children where they need to go. We\u2019ve never tried Le Pen in power, so why not give her a chance?\u201d she says.</p> <p>In Italy, the far right has been particularly adept at winning over women who used to vote for the left. \u201cThe left represented by the Democratic party in recent years betrayed leftwing voters and leftwing ideals,\u201d says Gianna Gambaccini, a neurologist who became a council member for Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right Northern League in Pisa last June.</p> <p>But not every female populist sympathiser is from marginalised corners of society. Probably the most important factor in rightwing populism among women is the same as it is for men: attitudes to immigration and Islam. \u201cTop of the list is always a person\u2019s view of immigration,\u201d Harteveld says.</p> <p>Rightwing populist parties are specifically targeting women with a controversial and contested message that immigration, particularly from Muslim countries, brings with it misogynistic cultures that threaten women\u2019s freedom in Europe \u2013 from catcalling women in short skirts to sexual assault. As Le Pen put it: \u201cI am scared that the migrant crisis signals the beginning of the end of women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>A spate of sexual assaults blamed on groups of immigrant men in Cologne and Hamburg on New Year\u2019s Eve at the end of 2015 provided ammunition for the far right to argue that immigrants were a physical threat, even though government studies have found that the vast majority of attacks on German women \u2013 including domestic violence \u2013 are perpetrated by German men. </p> <p>\u201cI believe we are the only party in Germany who is really fighting for women\u2019s rights, because we point out we\u2019re in danger of losing the freedoms and rights of women for which we\u2019ve fought for centuries,\u201d says the AfD MP Nicole H\u00f6chst.</p> <p>H\u00f6chst says she is equally concerned for Muslim women living in Germany, many of whom strive to be educated and find a place in German society, \u201conly to find that in the summer holidays they\u2019re going to be married off to a husband they\u2019ve never met in the country their families originated from\u201d.</p> <p>Ebba Hermansson, 22, the youngest MP in the Swedish parliament, is gender-equality spokeswoman for the anti-immigration, nationalist Sweden Democrats. She says the issue of keeping women \u201csafe from sexual violence\u201d is one of her main concerns. \u201cIf you come from a country where women are not worth as much as men, or women don\u2019t have the right to live their lives as they want, when you come [to Sweden] there\u2019s a shock,\u201d she says. The party\u2019s political opponents have criticised any conflation of crime statistics with immigration.</p> <p>Leaders such as Le Pen are playing a double game. They reject the term \u201cfeminism\u201d because they see it as an instrument of the left, and recoil from equality issues such as gender quotas in politics. Yet they co-opt the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201dwhen it suits, chiefly as a pretext to attack what they claim is mass immigration by socially conservative men. Every woman must be protected in their right \u201cto wear shorts or a miniskirt\u201d, Le Pen has argued.</p> <p>\u201cThese are strong women leaders, but they step back from feminism,\u201d says <a href=\"http://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/susi-meret(0d74f099-e2d5-4174-b23d-be056ba9ebc6).html\" title=\"\">Susi Meret</a> of Denmark\u2019s Aalborg University. One young Italian mayor, Susanna Ceccardi of the male-dominated Northern League, even insists on being called \u201c<em>sindaco</em>\u201d, the masculine word for \u201cmayor\u201d, as opposed to \u201c<em>sindaca</em>\u201d.</p> <p>These parties believe that \u201cleftwing feminism turns a blind eye to the consequences of immigration,\u201d says Ann-Cathrine Jungar, from Sweden\u2019s S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University.</p> <p>Yet radical-right politicians in Europe know that the stigma and toxic image of a party affects whether female voters choose it. Some have sought to modernise or soften their image in response. Le Pen, who promotes herself as a twice-divorced single mother, has sought to tone down her party\u2019s anti-abortion stance, move away from the traditional view of women as childbearers and homemakers, and appeal to gay voters.

      "bodyText": "It was a chastening lesson for any woman tempted to join the cut and thrust of rightwing populism. After Corinna Miazga was elected to the German parliament in 2017 for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party, a male colleague suggested she would be better suited to being a pole dancer than an MP. Miazga did not let it rest, getting her own back by telling a party conference of the lewd intervention by fellow MP Petr Bystron. \u201cAn \u2018Argh\u2019 went up in the audience,\u201d she recalls. \u201cNo one could quite believe I\u2019d dared to reveal this. Many people in the AfD were subsequently angry at me. They said: \u2018We know you\u2019re cross, but by bringing this into the public arena, you\u2019ll encourage people to say we have a male-female problem in the party.\u2019\u201d A surge in rightwing populism across Europe over the past 20 years has been largely male-dominated \u2013 sometimes characterised as angry white men voting for angry white men. But this is changing. Angry white women are emerging as an important constituency, too. At least half a dozen women lead rightwing, populist European parties, such as Alice Weidel, of the AfD, and Giorgia Meloni, of the Brothers of Italy. They follow the leads set by Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (formerly Front National) and, before her, Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard, co-founder of the rampantly anti-immigration Danish People\u2019s party, and Norway\u2019s finance minister, Siv Jensen, leader of the country\u2019s similarly anti-immigration Progress party. A new generation of women aged 20 to 50 are in parliament or local government in countries including Germany, France and Italy, following electoral breakthroughs by rightwing populists. Women are taking to the streets, too. Far-right protests in the UK still tend to be overwhelmingly male, but in continental Europe this is changing. At protest marches in the eastern German city of Chemnitz last year (following gatherings prompted by the stabbing of a local man, allegedly by two immigrants), the neo-Nazi Pegida group had plenty of women in the rank and file. It was similar at a rally last year of Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy. In France, large numbers of women have taken to the streets as part of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) anti-government movement, which has attracted people from across the political spectrum from left to far-right, some of whom vote Le Pen, and whose slogans often echo the disillusioned anti-elitism of populism. \u201cThere is evidence the gender gap is shrinking in some countries, although it clearly hasn\u2019t disappeared everywhere,\u201d says Eelco Harteveld of the University of Amsterdam. This raises the question: what do women see in nationalist populism that was once so dominated by patriarchal ideology? What motivates women to elect, support and even stand for parties and movements that shrink away from modern-day feminism? Conversations with dozens of European women \u2013 voters, MPs and academics \u2013 suggest several elements at play. Many working-class women feel just as \u201cleft behind\u201d as their male counterparts. The key predictor of a radical-right vote is the level of a person\u2019s education. Harteveld says that although the precarious manual jobs often associated with far-right voters are still largely male preserves, there is also precarious work in the service sector \u2013 where women are more numerous. Political scientists in France have pointed to the disillusionment of retail staff and supermarket cashiers as a case in point. \u201cThe elite in power hasn\u2019t got a clue what life is like for real people, they\u2019re totally cut off,\u201d says Catherine, a cashier at a budget supermarket north-east of Paris, who has demonstrated with the gilets jaunes. Now in her mid-30s, she has been working on supermarket tills since she left school, and votes for Le Pen. \u201cWe can\u2019t make ends meet on low salaries. I\u2019m overdrawn before the end of each month, living on credit, barely able to afford the petrol to get to work or drive my three children where they need to go. We\u2019ve never tried Le Pen in power, so why not give her a chance?\u201d she says. In Italy, the far right has been particularly adept at winning over women who used to vote for the left. \u201cThe left represented by the Democratic party in recent years betrayed leftwing voters and leftwing ideals,\u201d says Gianna Gambaccini, a neurologist who became a council member for Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right Northern League in Pisa last June. But not every female populist sympathiser is from marginalised corners of society. Probably the most important factor in rightwing populism among women is the same as it is for men: attitudes to immigration and Islam. \u201cTop of the list is always a person\u2019s view of immigration,\u201d Harteveld says. Rightwing populist parties are specifically targeting women with a controversial and contested message that immigration, particularly from Muslim countries, brings with it misogynistic cultures that threaten women\u2019s freedom in Europe \u2013 from catcalling women in short skirts to sexual assault. As Le Pen put it: \u201cI am scared that the migrant crisis signals the beginning of the end of women\u2019s rights.\u201d A spate of sexual assaults blamed on groups of immigrant men in Cologne and Hamburg on New Year\u2019s Eve at the end of 2015 provided ammunition for the far right to argue that immigrants were a physical threat, even though government studies have found that the vast majority of attacks on German women \u2013 including domestic violence \u2013 are perpetrated by German men. \u201cI believe we are the only party in Germany who is really fighting for women\u2019s rights, because we point out we\u2019re in danger of losing the freedoms and rights of women for which we\u2019ve fought for centuries,\u201d says the AfD MP Nicole H\u00f6chst. H\u00f6chst says she is equally concerned for Muslim women living in Germany, many of whom strive to be educated and find a place in German society, \u201conly to find that in the summer holidays they\u2019re going to be married off to a husband they\u2019ve never met in the country their families originated from\u201d. Ebba Hermansson, 22, the youngest MP in the Swedish parliament, is gender-equality spokeswoman for the anti-immigration, nationalist Sweden Democrats. She says the issue of keeping women \u201csafe from sexual violence\u201d is one of her main concerns. \u201cIf you come from a country where women are not worth as much as men, or women don\u2019t have the right to live their lives as they want, when you come [to Sweden] there\u2019s a shock,\u201d she says. The party\u2019s political opponents have criticised any conflation of crime statistics with immigration. Leaders such as Le Pen are playing a double game. They reject the term \u201cfeminism\u201d because they see it as an instrument of the left, and recoil from equality issues such as gender quotas in politics. Yet they co-opt the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201dwhen it suits, chiefly as a pretext to attack what they claim is mass immigration by socially conservative men. Every woman must be protected in their right \u201cto wear shorts or a miniskirt\u201d, Le Pen has argued. \u201cThese are strong women leaders, but they step back from feminism,\u201d says Susi Meret of Denmark\u2019s Aalborg University. One young Italian mayor, Susanna Ceccardi of the male-dominated Northern League, even insists on being called \u201csindaco\u201d, the masculine word for \u201cmayor\u201d, as opposed to \u201csindaca\u201d. These parties believe that \u201cleftwing feminism turns a blind eye to the consequences of immigration,\u201d says Ann-Cathrine Jungar, from Sweden\u2019s S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University. Yet radical-right politicians in Europe know that the stigma and toxic image of a party affects whether female voters choose it. Some have sought to modernise or soften their image in response. Le Pen, who promotes herself as a twice-divorced single mother, has sought to tone down her party\u2019s anti-abortion stance, move away from the traditional view of women as childbearers and homemakers, and appeal to gay voters. Jensen, who has warned about the \u201csneaking Islamisation\u201d of Norwegian society, last year controversially won a \u201cgay best friend\u201d award given out by LGBT activists. The AfD likes to popularise an idealised vision of the nuclear family, with father at work and mother raising children. Miazga speaks of a nostalgia for the deutschmark, for economic stability, social order and the \u201ctraditional family\u201d. \u201cI value the traditional family, a sensible time when children were cared for,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish \u2013 and maybe this is a funny, romantic feeling \u2013 that we could get back to the Germany of the 1990s.\u201d Yet the party\u2019s promotion of the nuclear family is often at odds with the reality of leading women in the AfD. Weidel, for example, is a gay woman bringing up two children with her partner. With just four months to go until European elections that will pick a parliament to sit until 2024, the female vote will be crucial to the success of rightwing populists seeking to build on the 50-odd MEPs they have in the 751-seat chamber. Le Pen\u2019s party, currently polling level with Emmanuel Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche, hopes to harness the fury unleashed by the gilets jaunes movement \u2013 and court the high number of working-class women who have taken to the streets. These include single mothers and working mothers on low incomes. In Italy, Meloni, has already been savvier at appealing to other women. \u201cShe attracts more women as she seems to be the only one making the battle for women,\u201d says Letizia Giorgianni, who voted for the party last year.

      "bodyText": "The BBC weather presenter Dianne Oxberry died from ovarian cancer, her husband has said, as he launched a charity to help combat the \u201cappalling disease\u201d. Oxberry, one of the BBC\u2019s longest-serving weather presenters, died suddenly on 10 January. She was 51 and was last seen on-air in mid-December. Her husband, Ian Hindle, said he was launching a charity in her memory following her \u201cvery short battle\u201d with ovarian cancer. \u201cThe tragic impact was felt not only by her family and friends, but also by the wider public, whose lives she touched across more than 20 years\u2019 TV and radio presenting,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Hindle, who has two children with Oxberry, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u00a31,000 to help get the charity off the ground. By Tuesday morning, twice that amount had been raised by 70 donors. \u201cThe money raised will be used to help families and individuals who have, or are suffering from, this aggressive disease,\u201d he said. \u201cThe aim is also to raise awareness about ovarian cancer and its after-effects, particularly where families have suffered sudden loss \u2026 which can often be the case with this appalling disease.\u201d Ovarian cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women, particularly affecting those aged over 50. Clinicians say the earlier ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the chance of a cure, but often it is not recognised until it has already spread and a cure is not possible. Overall, about half of women with ovarian cancer will live for at least five years after diagnosis, and about one in three will live for at least 10 years, according to Cancer Research UK. Oxberry was one of the most recognisable television presenters in north-west England, having fronted the weather on BBC North West Tonight for 24 years and presented the current affairs programme Inside Out for the region. Colleagues only found out in the new year that she was ill and said they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d to hear of her death.

These figures have been trotted out in the past year by everyone from <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_is_the_world_getting_better_or_worse_a_look_at_the_numbers/footnotes\" title=\"\">Steven Pinker</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/2017-progress-illiteracy-poverty.html\" title=\"\">Nick Kristof</a> and much of the rest of the Davos set to argue that the global extension of free-market capitalism has been great for everyone.

First of all, real data on poverty has only been collected since 1981. Anything before that is extremely sketchy, and to go back as far as 1820 is meaningless. Roser draws on a dataset that was never intended to describe poverty, but rather inequality in the distribution of world GDP \u2013 and that for only a limited range of countries. There is no actual research to bolster the claims about long-term poverty. It\u2019s not science; it\u2019s social media.</p> <p>What Roser\u2019s numbers actually reveal is that the world went from a situation where most of humanity had no need of money at all to one where today most of humanity struggles to survive on extremely small amounts of money. The graph casts this as a decline in poverty, but in reality what was going on was a process of dispossession that bulldozed people into the capitalist labour system, during the enclosure movements in Europe and the colonisation of the global south.</p> <p>Prior to colonisation, most people lived in subsistence economies where they enjoyed access to abundant commons \u2013 land, water, forests, livestock and robust systems of sharing and reciprocity. They had little if any money, but then they didn\u2019t need it in order to live well \u2013 so it makes little sense to claim that they were poor. This way of life was violently destroyed by colonisers who forced people off the land and into European-owned mines, factories and plantations, where they were paid paltry wages for work they never wanted to do in the first place.</p> <p>In other words, Roser\u2019s graph illustrates a story of coerced proletarianisation. It is not at all clear that this represents an improvement in people\u2019s lives, as in most cases we know that the new income people earned from wages didn\u2019t come anywhere close to compensating for their loss of land and resources, which were of course gobbled up by colonisers. Gates\u2019s favourite infographic takes the violence of colonisation and repackages it as a happy story of progress.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not all that\u2019s wrong here. The trend that the graph depicts is based on a poverty line of $1.90 (\u00a31.44) per day, which is the equivalent of what $1.90 could buy in the US in 2011. It\u2019s obscenely low by any standard, and we now have piles of evidence that people living just above this line have terrible levels of malnutrition and mortality. Earning $2 per day doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re somehow suddenly free of extreme poverty. Not by a long shot.</p> <p>Scholars have been calling for a <a href=\"http://wer.worldeconomicsassociation.org/papers/incrementum-ad-absurdum-global-growth-inequality-and-poverty-eradication-in-a-carbon-constrained-world/\" title=\"\">more reasonable poverty line</a> for many years.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older I\u2019ve really got to understand how powerful one voice can be, my voice can be, or the team\u2019s voice can be. So to hold that back or not to use that just seems selfish in a way.\u201d If that is the case, Megan Rapinoe is anything but selfish. A World Cup winner and Olympic champion with the US women\u2019s national team, Rapinoe could easily be satisfied with her lot. But just enjoying the spoils of her success is not enough. Rapinoe has been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights groups since coming out before the 2012 Olympics. She set out to raise $100,000 for those affected by the Carr fire that ripped through her home county, Shasta, last summer, destroying 1,604 buildings as it became the sixth most destructive fire in California history. And, on 4 September, 2016, before kick-off against Chicago Red Stars, the Seattle Reign midfielder went down on one knee during the playing of the national anthem in solidarity with the protest of the San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick. \u201cI think I want the same for myself,\u201d says the 33-year-old, who 11 days later knelt again before USA played Thailand. \u201cBeing a white, female, gay athlete. Obviously not everybody is that but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want the support for everyone in all of the things I\u2019m fighting for. \u201cWe understand that athletes are idolised and glorified in our culture and it was about using that platform to just support and give support to what he was saying. It became a very racialised issue, a black versus white thing, but it\u2019s not. \u201cWe all should be supporting what he\u2019s saying. The statistics don\u2019t lie \u2013 people of colour in prison, people of colour that are disproportionately arrested, monitored by police, police brutality against people of colour. \u201cIt\u2019s not really an issue of whether police brutality exists or not, or whether racism is still an issue or not. It very much is and I think it\u2019s foolish to say it\u2019s not. \u201cThe more we reckon with that quickly, recognise that these things are happening and believe the people that are standing up and telling their stories, then the quicker we can find solutions and start to make progress in breaking down those barriers that are so harmful to so many people.\u201d Did she ever fear for her career? Kaepernick has not thrown a football professionally since his release by the 49ers and has a case pending alleging NFL bosses have colluded to keep him out of the game for his stance. \u201cYeah, I mean as soon as I kneeled they made a rule that you had to stand,\u201d says the creative midfielder nicknamed Rapinho or Rapinodinho. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened if I had continued to kneel, maybe the same thing that happened to Colin. I kind of feel like that\u2019s sort of what they were after. They made it very clear that they were not going to respect my free speech or my decision to peacefully protest in that way and made it very clear that it was unacceptable and that I should be privileged or feel privileged to play for the country. I personally thought it was a very patriotic thing that Colin started.\u201d Despite growing up in the small conservative northern Californian town of Redding, Rapinoe\u2019s social conscience was a natural progression of values ingrained from an early age. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I grew up in a super liberal household or anything,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you never know where people come from, or what their situation is. So you shouldn\u2019t judge people. Give them the benefit of the doubt and be willing to extend yourself and stand up for people who maybe can\u2019t stand up for themselves and just stand up for the right thing. It was never explicitly spoken about in our household but that was just how we were raised.\u201d Rapinoe was a natural fit for Juan Mata\u2019s Common Goal.

Those guys are really sliding around, killing themselves for four hours. Who knows if this joint would hold up?\u201d</p> <p>Yet while playing singles is far more taxing on the body, Jason Brockwell, an orthopaedic surgeon familiar with the operation Murray has undergone, believes the three-time grand slam winner could be back within 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cI do hope Andy returns to competition,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cHe could be back within a year \u2013 and, with strong, flexible, painless hips.

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray will not know for several months whether he can return to the upper echelons of tennis after undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in what amounts to a final roll of the dice to save his career. The 31-year-old has refused to put a time frame on his return to the sport, but his hopes of playing in this year\u2019s Wimbledon in July appear remote. Murray\u2019s circle of confidantes has shrunk to his immediate family, and he again bypassed the media to announce the news on Instagram. \u201cI now have a metal hip,\u201d he wrote, following the operation that involved removing the damaged bone and cartilage within his right hip socket and replacing it with a metal shell. \u201cFeeling a bit battered and bruised just now but hopefully that will be the end of my hip pain.\u201d Earlier this month Murray had strongly hinted that retirement was imminent because of constant problems from a \u201cseverely damaged\u201d right hip which had failed to respond to a previous operation. However, it is understood that the Scot was persuaded to take one last shot at saving his career by his performance in an epic five-set defeat to the Roberto Bautista Agut at the Australian Open \u2013 which showed that he was still capable of mixing it with the top players \u2013 as well as a conversations with the grand slam winning doubles champion Bob Bryan, who returned to tennis five months after a similar hip operation. Bryan said that he had warned Murray that there were no guarantees he would return to the top. \u201cI\u2019m really the only guy to be playing on tour with a metal hip so he\u2019s been watching me like a hawk, asking me how I\u2019m feeling after matches, after practices, where I\u2019m at,\u201d the American revealed. \u201cBut I never once told him this is the way to go, because I do see that singles is a different monster. Those guys are really sliding around, killing themselves for four hours. Who knows if this joint would hold up?\u201d Yet while playing singles is far more taxing on the body, Jason Brockwell, an orthopaedic surgeon familiar with the operation Murray has undergone, believes the three-time grand slam winner could be back within 12 months. \u201cI do hope Andy returns to competition,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cHe could be back within a year \u2013 and, with strong, flexible, painless hips. There is no reason why he shouldn\u2019t be competitive.\u201d Brockwell said that the hip resurfacing, which was known as the \u2018Birmingham method\u2019 after being developed in Britain\u2019s second city by the surgeon Derek McMinn, had been developed as an alternative to hip replacement surgery and was primarily intended for men under the age of 55 with osteoarthritis. \u201cFortunately, not too many young people develop arthritis of their hips \u2013 but, when they do \u2013 the commonest cause is sport, followed by injury,\u201d Stockwell added. Murray now faces months of rehabilitation and uncertainty and there is no guarantee that he will ever play competitively again. Earlier this month he insisted that he wanted to play at Wimbledon this summer, but that seems highly unlikely. His body needs time to rest and recover before being rebuilt to grand slam level. Nevertheless, the fire will not go out easily. He has consulted widely, and has agonised over the decision at length. He has primarily undergone the surgery to improve his quality of life by ending the pain he feels on a daily basis. But he also holds out faint hopes of returning to tennis, perhaps at the US Open in August or in Melbourne next January. Yet even if his team can get him back on the court in something resembling his old self, he will be 32 and mere competitiveness at a base level is unlikely to satisfy someone who has been world No 1 and was mixing it with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic until he began to suffer from serious hip problems in July 2017. If Murray watched the Australian Open final, he will have witnessed Djokovic\u2019s straight-sets humiliation of Nadal with a mixture of awe and regret. His struggles with those players, as well as against Federer, look to be in the distant past. Yet Murray has always been a fighter, so it is no surprise that he desperately wants to be back on the biggest stages of the sport he loves. But, as he ventures on yet another comeback trail, he knows better than most that the gap between wanting and doing can be light years apart.

      "body": "<p>Domino\u2019s sold more than 535,000 pizzas in the UK on the Friday before Christmas \u2013 equivalent to 12 a second over a 12-hour trading day \u2013 but a weaker international performance has forced the company to slice its profit guidance.</p> <p>The strong run-up to Christmas helped group sales to rise by 5.5% year on year to \u00a3339.5m in the 13 weeks to 30 December, it said in a trading update published on Tuesday. Sales growth was driven by its Republic of Ireland operations, where like-for-like sales rose by 7.5%.</p> <p>Domino\u2019s particularly benefited from days when Britons had reason for a big night in. It credited the final of the BBC\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday 15<sup> </sup>December for a new online record, with sales up by a quarter compared to the same day the year before.</p> <p>The overall sales record came on the Friday before Christmas, 21 December, the day traditionally known as \u201cMad Friday\u201d or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(partying)\">\u201cBlack Eye Friday\u201d</a> for revellers getting into the festive party spirit. Though the record Domino\u2019s sales that day suggests people may be staying home more now.</p> <p>However, the FTSE 250-listed company\u2019s efforts to expand to new markets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/dominos-pizza-delivers-profits-rise\">after fast UK growth</a> stumbled during the quarter. International sales fell by 2% year on year to \u00a326.6m.</p> <p>David Wild, the Domino\u2019s Pizza Group chief executive officer, said the international operation had experienced growing pains this year.</p> <p>The company suffered \u201cbusiness integration challenges\u201d in Norway in particular, he said.

      "bodyText": "Domino\u2019s sold more than 535,000 pizzas in the UK on the Friday before Christmas \u2013 equivalent to 12 a second over a 12-hour trading day \u2013 but a weaker international performance has forced the company to slice its profit guidance. The strong run-up to Christmas helped group sales to rise by 5.5% year on year to \u00a3339.5m in the 13 weeks to 30 December, it said in a trading update published on Tuesday. Sales growth was driven by its Republic of Ireland operations, where like-for-like sales rose by 7.5%. Domino\u2019s particularly benefited from days when Britons had reason for a big night in. It credited the final of the BBC\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday 15 December for a new online record, with sales up by a quarter compared to the same day the year before. The overall sales record came on the Friday before Christmas, 21 December, the day traditionally known as \u201cMad Friday\u201d or \u201cBlack Eye Friday\u201d for revellers getting into the festive party spirit. Though the record Domino\u2019s sales that day suggests people may be staying home more now. However, the FTSE 250-listed company\u2019s efforts to expand to new markets after fast UK growth stumbled during the quarter. International sales fell by 2% year on year to \u00a326.6m. David Wild, the Domino\u2019s Pizza Group chief executive officer, said the international operation had experienced growing pains this year. The company suffered \u201cbusiness integration challenges\u201d in Norway in particular, he said. Sales also fell in Switzerland and Iceland. The weaker international performance prompted Domino\u2019s to guide that its full-year underlying profit before tax will be at the lower end of analysts\u2019 expectations of between \u00a393.9m and \u00a398.2m. The company also said that investment in central functions would dent short-term profitability. Shares in Domino\u2019s fell by almost 7% on Tuesday to 255p. The company\u2019s shares were worth more than 380p as recently as June, before the international struggles dented summer profits. Domino\u2019s, originally an American brand, opened its first UK outlet in 1985, before the British and Irish franchise was bought out in 1993. The company sold almost 90m pizzas last year in the UK, but its addition of 59 stores during the year to the more than 1,200 it already ran was significantly below its plans at the start of the year. On Tuesday Domino\u2019s reaffirmed its long-term target of 1,600 stores in the UK, but did not give guidance on how many it expects to add in the coming year, prompting some concerns among City analysts. Domino\u2019s also continues to face pressure from franchisees for an increased share of profits, which some investors believe could weigh on future growth in the UK. Competition is increasing rapidly in food delivery, with Domino\u2019s facing pressure from companies such as Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, all of which enable rival pizza restaurants to offer home delivery. However, Domino\u2019s is betting that its brand and record of profitability will enable it to fend off some of its newer competitors, many of which are still loss-making. Wild said: \u201cThe UK delivered food market is vibrant and we estimate that it will grow at a compound rate of 8% a year to 2022. We aim to maintain our share of this market.\u201d",

Al-Araibi, an Australian resident, has been detained in Thailand, where he had gone on honeymoon, for more than two months while Bahrain seeks his extradition. He was arrested in Bangkok in November on a red notice wrongly issued to Bahrain by Interpol in contravention of its own refugee protection policies. He faces a 10-year prison sentence in Bahrain for a vandalism conviction that has been widely discredited. His wife, who does not want to be named, spent the first 10 days of his detention sharing a cell with him but has since had to return to Australia. In a letter to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, al-Araibi\u2019s wife pleaded with him to put pressure on the Thai authorities to release him. \u201cTime is running out, and I am pleading desperately to you as a humanitarian, and someone who would not hesitate to stand with justice, please please help my husband,\u201d she wrote, citing Canada\u2019s swift offer of resettlement to the Saudi refugee Rahaf al-Qunun. \u201cHis refugee status relates to his persecution in Bahrain.

However, football bodies have been criticised for being slow to join the efforts, in particular the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and its Bahraini royal president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa. On Tuesday, 63 days after al-Araibi was first arrested and three days after the AFC suddenly announced that al-Khalifa had been recused from regional responsibilities 18 months ago, it pleaded directly with the Thai prime minister for his release. The request for \u201cimmediate intervention\u201d from the AFC vice president to allow al-Araibi\u2019s return to Australia came after Bahrain lodged its extradition papers, setting a Thai court process in motion. On Tuesday, Morrison\u2019s office confirmed he wrote to Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayuth Chan-o-cha, last week, to emphasise al-Araibi\u2019s refugee status in Australia, and said that returning him to Bahrain would infringe on his human rights under international law. There remain multiple questions about the role of Australian authorities in al-Araibi\u2019s detention, including how the issuing of a red notice against someone to whom Australia had given refugee status went unnoticed. The Australian federal police is also facing questions after notifying Thailand of al-Araibi\u2019s travel plans. Al-Araibi has said he specifically asked Australian authorities if he was safe to travel to Thailand and was told he was. On Monday, Bahrain\u2019s interior minister, Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, defended his government\u2019s pursuit of al-Araibi, saying concerns he would face torture and unjust imprisonment if he was returned were \u201cfalse reports\u201d. \u201cThe external interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThose raising unfounded doubts about the integrity and independence of the kingdom\u2019s judicial system are not only interfering but also attempting to influence the course of justice.\u201d In response, human rights groups have pointed to multiple investigations and reports on the torture and mistreatment of prisoners and targeting of opposition figures by the Bahraini justice system.",

The Tasmania Fire Service confirmed on Tuesday that three homes had been destroyed on Frypan and Bermuda roads in Glen Huon, in southern Tasmania, as a result of either ember attacks or direct combustion from radiant heat. The fire service warned that high winds could mean more impact to properties in the Castle Forbes Bay area later in the day. High winds and temperatures and a lack of rain meant that crews were likely to be battling the multiple fires across the state\u2019s south and central plateau throughout the week. On Tuesday afternoon, 12 warnings were in place in areas including Judbury, Franklin, Glen Huon and Geeveston, which were among several townships being affected by a fire in Riveaux Road. In the central plateau, the Great Pine Tier fire led to emergency warnings for Jean Banks Road between Waddamana and Hermitage, and for the eastern side of the Highland Lakes Road between Interlaken Road and Weasel Plains Road. Total fire bans remained in place across much of the state and the fire service warned it was expecting little relief. While a cooler change was expected on Thursday, it was forecast to bring little rain and a wind change that could push the fire fronts into other areas. \u201cWe were hopeful that this cold front that was coming through on Thursday was going to bring with it a little bit of rain so we could rest crews,\u201d said the TFS district officer Andrew McGuiness. \u201cBut unfortunately that\u2019s just likely to change the wind direction and turn the northerly flank into a fire front, so that\u2019s going to cause us more concern.\u201d Chris Arnol, the TFS\u2019s chief officer, said the owners of the three properties that were lost had been notified and their decision to leave early had \u201cundoubtedly\u201d saved their lives. \u201cWe are grateful they are safe, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to us,\u201d he said. \u201cBy all reports, their properties would have been undefendable.

Firefighters confirmed they were able to save the visitor centre at the site, but some smaller infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed. The Parks and Wildlife Service said closures were in place at Mt Field national park, Hastings thermal pools and Freycinet national park. The service said several fires were posing an immediate threat to high-value world heritage areas, particularly alpine areas in the Mt Field national park and Mount Bobs in the Southwest national park. Researchers working on conservation of the state\u2019s critically endangered swift parrot community said they also feared for valuable nesting habitat in the southern forests. \u201cThis is burning that area that has already been deforested for logging,\u201d said Dejan Stojanovic, a post-doctoral researcher with the Australian National University who is based in Tasmania. \u201cWe\u2019ve got as little as one third of the historic swift parrot habitat remaining there.

Although the rise is from a relatively low base, last year there were more than 400,000 Telugu speakers in the US. This increase has much to do with Hyderabad and its links to the tech industry, Prasad Kunisetty, founder of the US-based nonprofit Telugu People Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45902204\">told the BBC in an interview</a> last year.</p> \n<p>And as Hyderabad\u2019s IT dominance increases, so too does the number of Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil-speaking workers heading overseas to work for major companies \u2013 and their enthusiasm for cinema does not alter with distance. \u201cToday, every filmmaker\u2019s target is diaspora in the US, UK and Europe besides Africa and the Gulf,\u201d explains Murthy.

      "bodyText": "It is rush hour on Monday morning in Hyderabad, but the city\u2019s usual deafening soundtrack of revving engines and blaring horns is absent. The only noise comes from a woman gently sweeping the veranda of one of the large, pastel-coloured mansions nearby. The silence is even more disconcerting when you see the airport near the end of the street, and, just beyond that, a railway station. New York\u2019s Statue of Liberty is a short walk away, as is the splendour of the ancient city of Mahishmati. In fact, Mahishmati is the first place here where I encounter any real noise \u2013 the blue special effects screens around the fibreglass throne area are rather flimsy, and a buzz from power tools carries from the adjoining parking lot, where workers are building a pirate ship. We are in Ramoji Film City, the largest film studio in the world and the beating heart of Tollywood, India\u2019s Telugu-language film industry. And although Ramoji is technically part of Hyderabad, in reality \u2013 with its (real) hotels, workshops, soundstages, gardens, post office, banks and restaurants \u2013 it is a metropolis in and of itself. It is not Hyderabad\u2019s only \u201ccity within a city\u201d. To many outside India, the southern Indian metropolis is best known for Hitech City \u2013 the country\u2019s own purpose-built Silicon Valley. Nearby is Genome Valley, which boasts manufacturing and R&amp;D arms of some of the biotech sector\u2019s biggest names. Hyderabad owes much of its rapid growth to the jobs created for these companies, both directly and from the construction boom resulting from the need for offices, homes and infrastructure to accommodate the influx of labour. Its expansion has seen it swallow up its twin city of Secunderabad to become one sprawling metropolis. Sets at Ramoji Film City including a pirate ship being constructed for a forthcoming feature. Photographs: Ravi Giragani/the Guardian The latest UN projections forecast that Hyderabad will reach megacity status \u2013 having a population over 10 million \u2013 by 2020, with 14.1 million residents by 2035. But when you are caught in the inevitable snarl of the city\u2019s legendarily bad traffic and surrounded on all sides by construction projects, it is hard not to agree with locals who say that, thanks to unofficial migrant workers, the 10 million population point has long since been passed. * * * India has the largest film industry in the world, producing 1,903 films in 2016 compared with 200 made in Britain and 798 made in the US.

The announcement, dismissed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) as financially irresponsible, is the first major shot in an election battle likely to be replete with populist giveaways to voters. \u201cWe have decided that every poor person in India would be guaranteed a minimum income after the Congress forms the government in 2019,\u201d the Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi, told a farmers\u2019 rally in the central state of Chhattisgarh on Monday. \u201cNo one will go hungry in India, no one will remain poor,\u201d he said. Congress won Chhattisgarh\u2019s statehouse and two others in local elections in December thanks largely to anger among farmers at the persistent low prices being fetched by crops. More than 49% of Indians are employed in agriculture and their distress could be a decisive factor when people begin voting in April. Congress\u2019s former finance minister P Chidambaram said more details of what he called \u201ca turning point in the lives of the poor\u201d would be revealed in the party\u2019s manifesto. It is unclear whether the minimum income guarantee, likely to take the form of a direct cash transfer, would replace subsidies on food, petrol and fertilisers valued at 2.64tn rupees (\u00a328bn) for all Indians in the 2018-19 budget. Chidambaram tweeted that a UBI had been discussed extensively and that \u201cthe time has come to adapt the principle to our situation and our needs and implement the same for the poor\u201d. Praveen Chakravarty, from the Congress\u2019s data analytics department, said late on Monday the income given to each household would vary depending on their earnings. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a progressive scheme where there will be a certain threshold for minimum income that would be decided and fixed and those that fall below that threshold at varying degrees will be compensated with income transfers to ensure there is a basic minimum income support for every poor household in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not be the same amount for everybody, it will depend on how poor each household is.\u201d In principle, a UBI involves paying all citizens an unconditional monthly sum regardless of whether they work and how much they earn, and which they can use as they wish. It is intended to replace all existing social benefits. Its proponents on the left argue that it has the potential to eliminate poverty, while those on the right believe it can streamline the welfare system. Both also hope it could insulate workers against the threat of the mass automation of jobs. The idea has gained momentum in recent years and has been trialled on a small scale in places including Finland, Italy, Canada and the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The government of Sikkim, another Indian state, promised to implement a UBI within three years if re-elected. The Congress plan appears to be closer to a social security scheme than a traditional UBI. A BJP spokesman said the idea was unaffordable. \u201cWhere will the money come from? He\u2019s promising the moon to fool the people,\u201d Gopal Krishna Agarwal told Reuters. Agarwal said the government had examined a UBI in 2014 but concluded that eliminating all subsidies would provide only enough funds to pay 6,000 rupees per family per month, less than what is required to feed them. The BJP hands down its last budget before the election on Friday and is expected to use the opportunity to try to assuage farmers as well as its traditional small-business base. India\u2019s former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian in 2016 floated the idea of granting 1,500 rupees every month for poor households.

However, the child clinical psychologist Naira Wilson says Star of the Week awards provide valuable acknowledgment or recognition. \u201cSometimes acknowledgment feels good, particularly if it is lacking at home.\u201d She emphasises that this should be purely about the individual, not about comparison with others: \u201cHaving the public acknowledgment is demonstrating you\u2019re important, but not that you\u2019re better than someone else.\u201d Kohn, though, remains sceptical: \u201cReferring to a reward by a euphemism such as \u2018recognition\u2019 or \u2018celebration\u2019 doesn\u2019t make it any less damaging,\u201d he says. The children at St Aloysius are enthusiastic about their Virtues awards: \u201cIt makes me feel proud,\u201d says one. \u201cIt makes you realise teachers really notice everybody,\u201d says another. Nevertheless, one pupil says certificates should not be necessary. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go round saying, hey, did you know I was being loving and compassionate.\u201d Another says: \u201cThey\u2019re just paper.\u201d But if you are going to award certificates, the key thing, says Pearce, is to make sure they are inclusive: \u201cYou can find something in every child to recognise.\u201d",

She appears to care for little but satisfying the hunger and compulsions that she barely understands; not her son, not her gastroenterologist husband, not her colleagues nor friends. By way of complicating the scenario, Slimani sketches a variety of possibilities as to the cause of her behaviour: a childhood trip to Paris with her mother, who abandoned her in a hotel room while meeting a man who wasn\u2019t her husband; the uncaring teenage boyfriend with whom she lost her virginity in a damp garage, after which she felt \u201csimultaneously dirty and proud, humiliated and victorious\u201d; the fug and claustrophobia of the provincial family flat in which she grew up.</p> <p>That Ad\u00e8le\u2019s husband is a doctor is suggestive of the world of <em>Madame Bovary</em>, with which the novel appears to be in dialogue.

As in both of those books, there is a comeuppance, a reckoning that implies the lack of value accorded to female lives and sexuality, and the irrepressible urge to control them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/04/leila-slimani-afua-hirsch-lullaby-british-interview\">Le\u00efla Slimani and Afua Hirsch: \u2018People have a cliched way of looking at race\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The wider world hovers at the edges: Ad\u00e8le\u2019s brief enthusiasm for her work leads to an immersion in the revolutions of north Africa, before journalism too becomes part of \u201cthe whole idiotic charade\u201d; towards the end of the novel comes a reference to her Algerian father\u2019s sense of dislocation from his roots and her mother\u2019s indifference to it.</p> <p>But there is nothing that might add up to a thesis; explicit in so many ways, Slimani\u2019s writing, here and in <em>Lullaby</em>, is coy about any greater ambitions it might have. Instead, it reads as if more interested in exploring the possibilities of extremes and reclaiming their potential as literary devices beyond that of mere shock-creation. What is the very worst thing that can happen when you ask someone to look after your children? What if you immured yourself in an utterly respectable life and then tried to fuck your way out of it?</p> <p><em>Ad\u00e8le</em> is a tough read, but a bracing one; little concerned with reader-pleasing narrative treats, but provocatively enigmatic. Appearing to adopt the conventions of realism \u2013 despite being sparely written, it is filled with physical detail, from an encounter in a freezing back alley to the \u201cimmense black-and-white photograph of derelict Cuban theatre\u201d that decorates a fancy Parisian apartment \u2013 it eventually becomes increasingly dream-like, the compulsions of its characters (and not merely Ad\u00e8le) revealed as the manifestation of suppressed desires and dysfunction.

As in both of those books, there is a comeuppance, a reckoning that implies the lack of value accorded to female lives and sexuality, and the irrepressible urge to control them. The wider world hovers at the edges: Ad\u00e8le\u2019s brief enthusiasm for her work leads to an immersion in the revolutions of north Africa, before journalism too becomes part of \u201cthe whole idiotic charade\u201d; towards the end of the novel comes a reference to her Algerian father\u2019s sense of dislocation from his roots and her mother\u2019s indifference to it. But there is nothing that might add up to a thesis; explicit in so many ways, Slimani\u2019s writing, here and in Lullaby, is coy about any greater ambitions it might have. Instead, it reads as if more interested in exploring the possibilities of extremes and reclaiming their potential as literary devices beyond that of mere shock-creation. What is the very worst thing that can happen when you ask someone to look after your children? What if you immured yourself in an utterly respectable life and then tried to fuck your way out of it? Ad\u00e8le is a tough read, but a bracing one; little concerned with reader-pleasing narrative treats, but provocatively enigmatic. Appearing to adopt the conventions of realism \u2013 despite being sparely written, it is filled with physical detail, from an encounter in a freezing back alley to the \u201cimmense black-and-white photograph of derelict Cuban theatre\u201d that decorates a fancy Parisian apartment \u2013 it eventually becomes increasingly dream-like, the compulsions of its characters (and not merely Ad\u00e8le) revealed as the manifestation of suppressed desires and dysfunction. And it is not a dream from which it seems immediately possible to waken. \u2022 Ad\u00e8le by Le\u00efla Slimani, translated by Sam Taylor, is published by Faber (\u00a312.99).

Billed as the virtual counterpart to the Champions League, the eChampions League is \u201ca natural extension of the Uefa Champions League into competitive gaming,\u201d says Epstein, and \u201ccould lead to the coexistence of virtual and real competitions. Competitive gaming is not intended to be a substitute for real football, but instead, to complement it.\u201d</p> <p>Argentina\u2019s most-capped player, Javier Mascherano, is a fan: \u201cOnce my football playing career enters its last stages, I\u2019m interested in opening up to new fields of business, and esports is an excellent vehicle to connect with new generations.\u201d He currently wears the No 14 shirt for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/10/chris-coleman-appointed-manager-of-chinese-club-hebei-china-fortune\">Hebei China Fortune</a>, but after retiring from international football last year, his football playing career is drawing to a close. Now, his competitive nature has found an outlet: by partnering with Argentinean agency eSports Planet, he wants to make Latin America \u2013 currently an underrepresented force on the global esports circuit \u2013 a serious player.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to dismiss footballers moving into esports as a cash grab or vessel for self-promotion, but for Mascherano and Fuchs, it\u2019s a little bit deeper. Like millions of teenagers, Fuchs was a Fifa obsessive. \u201cAs a boy, you look up to big stars in the Bundesliga and Premier League, so it was great to have the chance to play them in your own living room,\u201d he recounts.</p> <p>Gaming obsessives and professional sports players aren\u2019t the chalk and cheese they once were. A great many professional footballers play video games; indeed, almost everyone under 30 does. Just look at \u00d6zil, once Germany\u2019s most expensive player, who pocketed a cool \u20ac50m with a 2013 transfer to Arsenal. Today, amid transfer whispers, you can find him on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/mesutozil\">Twitch</a> and fronting his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/M10Esports\">M10 Esports</a> team. </p> <p>Fuchs says: \u201cWhen I got to know my players in person I realised how professional and competitive they are, just the way I am with everything I do. They reflect my nature \u2026 [NoFuchsGiven] feels like a real, physical football team, where you support and learn from each other.

So, for a generation raised online, perhaps esports is a natural substitute. \u201cFootball didn\u2019t start in the same dimensions as it is now,\u201d says Fuchs. \u201cIt\u2019s still growing, even if it is the most popular sport in the world.\u201d</p>",

A few months later, though, fans were glued to screens once again, witnessing a Saudi player do the unthinkable and lift the trophy. This time they were watching a YouTube stream, and their star player was a gamer named \u201cMSdossary\u201d. Beating 20 million other players of Fifa 18, Electronic Arts\u2019 wildly popular officially licensed football video game, Mossad \u201cMSDossary\u201d Aldossary was crowned the Fifa eWorld Cup champion, winning $250,000 (around \u00a3190,000) for his efforts. He has become the player to watch, an armchair Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 and as football stars from Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil to Dutch veteran Ruud Gullit begin investing in esports, he is drawing a lot of attention. Leicester City defender Christian Fuchs has become the first Premier League footballer to form his own nine-player Fifa team: NoFuchsGiven. \u201cThe appeal of esports is a part of everyday life now. Fortnite and Fifa are spoken about in the same way as we talk about football and rugby. [Fortnite streamer] Ninja is as big a star as Messi and Ronaldo, so I\u2019ve realised how professional and competitive [professional gamers] are, just like I am with everything I do.\u201d Fuchs isn\u2019t the only athlete who sees opportunity in esports. Projected to be worth $1.4bn by 2020, virtual sports mirror the lucrative world of professional sports. Gullit is using his managerial prowess on the pitch to scout the next wave off it with the Team Gullit esports academy, while retired Real Madrid defender \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa has gone from lifting the World Cup in 2010 to partnering with League of Legends team Origen in 2018. And kicking off in 2019 is the Uefa eChampions League, the brainchild of Uefa marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein. Billed as the virtual counterpart to the Champions League, the eChampions League is \u201ca natural extension of the Uefa Champions League into competitive gaming,\u201d says Epstein, and \u201ccould lead to the coexistence of virtual and real competitions. Competitive gaming is not intended to be a substitute for real football, but instead, to complement it.\u201d Argentina\u2019s most-capped player, Javier Mascherano, is a fan: \u201cOnce my football playing career enters its last stages, I\u2019m interested in opening up to new fields of business, and esports is an excellent vehicle to connect with new generations.\u201d He currently wears the No 14 shirt for Hebei China Fortune, but after retiring from international football last year, his football playing career is drawing to a close. Now, his competitive nature has found an outlet: by partnering with Argentinean agency eSports Planet, he wants to make Latin America \u2013 currently an underrepresented force on the global esports circuit \u2013 a serious player. It\u2019s easy to dismiss footballers moving into esports as a cash grab or vessel for self-promotion, but for Mascherano and Fuchs, it\u2019s a little bit deeper. Like millions of teenagers, Fuchs was a Fifa obsessive. \u201cAs a boy, you look up to big stars in the Bundesliga and Premier League, so it was great to have the chance to play them in your own living room,\u201d he recounts. Gaming obsessives and professional sports players aren\u2019t the chalk and cheese they once were. A great many professional footballers play video games; indeed, almost everyone under 30 does. Just look at \u00d6zil, once Germany\u2019s most expensive player, who pocketed a cool \u20ac50m with a 2013 transfer to Arsenal. Today, amid transfer whispers, you can find him on Twitch and fronting his M10 Esports team. Fuchs says: \u201cWhen I got to know my players in person I realised how professional and competitive they are, just the way I am with everything I do. They reflect my nature \u2026 [NoFuchsGiven] feels like a real, physical football team, where you support and learn from each other. People dream of becoming a footballer but they may not have made it, and this is another way into a business where you can become a top star.\u201d The obstacles standing between young people and a professional football career are indeed manifold: injuries, missed opportunities or the overwhelming pressure of being a youth protege derail promising football careers daily. \u201cEsports allows people with physical impairments to play professionally,\u201d adds Mascherano. \u201cIt\u2019s no better or worse, but a new and different way to enjoy the game.\u201d Expensive TV subscriptions even make watching pro football impossible for skint teenagers. So, for a generation raised online, perhaps esports is a natural substitute. \u201cFootball didn\u2019t start in the same dimensions as it is now,\u201d says Fuchs. \u201cIt\u2019s still growing, even if it is the most popular sport in the world.\u201d",

Thank you.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p>It\u2019s all getting a bit complicated and time is nearly up. So, where are we at? A couple of weeks after Theresa May\u2019s deal was crushed by MPs, the prime minister brings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/27/remain-leave-delay-brexit-ambush-may-battle-westminster\">Brexit back to parliament this week</a> with a simple motion on the government\u2019s next steps.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/27/what-is-the-next-commons-brexit-debate-about\">amendments are what you need to watch</a>. They come in three varieties: the first, tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, aims to avoid no deal by allowing MPs to vote for an article 50 extension if the withdrawal agreement is not passed by 26 February.</p> <p>The problem with this is not just whether it gets a majority, but whether it works: without some degree of certainty on what version of Brexit the UK actually wants, the EU might not be willing to grant an extension to article 50.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment aims to create at least a level of certainty by calling for six weekly votes on various ways out of the current Brexit impasse, potentially allowing a parliamentary majority to coalesce around one option.</p> <p>And the third <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexit-backstop-amendment-would-give-may-enormous-firepower\">amendment of note, from Conservative Graham Brady</a>, backs the prime minister\u2019s deal but demands \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop \u2013 loathed by large numbers of Brexit hardliners, who want it torn out of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.</p> <p>Although Brady\u2019s is the approach May has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-will-commit-to-insisting-eu-replace-backstop-say-leading-tory-brexiters-politics-live?page=with:block-5c4f3cd0e4b0a585f6e882b5#block-5c4f3cd0e4b0a585f6e882b5\">told MPs she favours (and the government will whip behind it)</a>, it raises further problems in that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/27/blow-theresa-may-ireland-stresses-will-not-yield-brexit-backstop\">both Ireland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/23/michel-barnier-warns-against-time-limited-irish-backstop\">the EU have always insisted</a> the agreement and backstop \u2013 shaped, remember, by the UK \u2013 cannot be renegotiated, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexiter-mps-back-away-from-anti-backstop-brexit-amendment\">the Brexiters will vote against it</a>.</p> <p>The European commission president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/26/juncker-may-backstop-eu-customs-union\">Jean-Claude Juncker, told May</a> the EU27 would revisit the backstop only if May opted for a permanent customs union. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/risk-of-no-deal-brexit-very-high-says-key-eu-negotiator-sabine-weyand\">Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator,</a> said negotiations were now over and for May to come back asking for changes would be like the UK \u201csnatching defeat from the jaws of victory\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce warned of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/26/brexit-british-firms-mass-exodus-no-deal\">a mass exodus by UK companies</a> in the event of a no deal; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/24/airbus-brands-uk-government-handling-of-brexit-a-disgrace\">Airbus said it would pull out of the UK</a> altogether; the chief execs of Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose warned of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/28/no-deal-brexit-price-rises-retailers-sainsburys-asda-ms-coop\">significant disruption to food supplies</a>; and a survey showed Brexit was making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/meaner-and-angrier-brexit-exposes-growing-fractures-in-uk-society\">Britons meaner, angrier and more disunited</a>.</p> <h2>What next?</h2> <p>In a nutshell, nobody knows. Whatever happens to the amendments this week (and we don\u2019t yet know which ones the Speaker, John Bercow, will select), the government is expected to bring the withdrawal agreement back to the Commons on 13 February. Its fate is unknowable. Some feel it is now inevitable that Brexit will have to be delayed beyond 29 March; others that the longer this drags on, the more likely Brexit hardliners are to cave in and vote for May\u2019s deal as the only sure way of securing any kind of Brexit at all.

Producing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please support us. Thank you. Top stories It\u2019s all getting a bit complicated and time is nearly up. So, where are we at? A couple of weeks after Theresa May\u2019s deal was crushed by MPs, the prime minister brings Brexit back to parliament this week with a simple motion on the government\u2019s next steps. The amendments are what you need to watch. They come in three varieties: the first, tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, aims to avoid no deal by allowing MPs to vote for an article 50 extension if the withdrawal agreement is not passed by 26 February. The problem with this is not just whether it gets a majority, but whether it works: without some degree of certainty on what version of Brexit the UK actually wants, the EU might not be willing to grant an extension to article 50. Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment aims to create at least a level of certainty by calling for six weekly votes on various ways out of the current Brexit impasse, potentially allowing a parliamentary majority to coalesce around one option. And the third amendment of note, from Conservative Graham Brady, backs the prime minister\u2019s deal but demands \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop \u2013 loathed by large numbers of Brexit hardliners, who want it torn out of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Although Brady\u2019s is the approach May has told MPs she favours (and the government will whip behind it), it raises further problems in that both Ireland and the EU have always insisted the agreement and backstop \u2013 shaped, remember, by the UK \u2013 cannot be renegotiated, and the Brexiters will vote against it. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told May the EU27 would revisit the backstop only if May opted for a permanent customs union. Sabine Weyand, the EU\u2019s deputy chief negotiator, said negotiations were now over and for May to come back asking for changes would be like the UK \u201csnatching defeat from the jaws of victory\u201d. Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce warned of a mass exodus by UK companies in the event of a no deal; Airbus said it would pull out of the UK altogether; the chief execs of Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose warned of significant disruption to food supplies; and a survey showed Brexit was making Britons meaner, angrier and more disunited. What next? In a nutshell, nobody knows. Whatever happens to the amendments this week (and we don\u2019t yet know which ones the Speaker, John Bercow, will select), the government is expected to bring the withdrawal agreement back to the Commons on 13 February. Its fate is unknowable. Some feel it is now inevitable that Brexit will have to be delayed beyond 29 March; others that the longer this drags on, the more likely Brexit hardliners are to cave in and vote for May\u2019s deal as the only sure way of securing any kind of Brexit at all. Weyand reckons the risk of no deal is now \u201cvery high\u201d. Best of the rest Northern Ireland business leaders press MPs to back Brexit deal.

The deaths have come to light in a memo, seen by the Guardian, that the South East Coast ambulance service (Secamb) sent to its crews last week. Its personnel looked after both patients before they collapsed. The memo was sent last Tuesday, 22 January. It says: \u201cIn the last week we have had two incidents where patients have died in hospital corridors.\u201d Full details have not yet emerged, but it is known that the deaths occurred in the week beginning 14 January at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent, and East Surrey hospital in Redhill. Inquiries by the Guardian have established that while the patient at the Margate hospital did die in a corridor, the patient at East Surrey hospital \u2013 an elderly woman \u2013 became seriously ill in a corridor near A&amp;E and died in the unit\u2019s resuscitation area despite efforts by medical staff to save her. The Secamb circular tells crews to ensure they fill in \u201cdelayed handover forms\u201d as soon as they have been waiting 15 minutes to hand a patient over to A&amp;E staff. It says this is necessary because \u201cthese forms are documented evidence that you are monitoring your patient and if anything does happen, it may highlight any early deterioration occurring\u201d. It adds: \u201cIncidents like this are classed as serious incidents and are investigated by both the hospital and Secamb, so we need to ensure that we are doing our bit and that it is not our fault.\u201d Figures show that of the 4,795 patients who have arrived by ambulance at the hospitals run by the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS trust, including East Surrey, so far this winter, 974, or one in five, have had to wait at least half an hour with paramedics until they could start their A&amp;E care, and 225 had a delay of more than hour. The trust has had very few empty beds recently, reaching 98.5% occupancy at one point this month, well above the 85% limit that the NHS considers safe. At East Kent Hospitals University NHS foundation trust, including the hospital in Margate, 1,141 out of 9,535 ambulance arrivals, or one in eight, have had to wait at least 30 minutes. Across England between 3 December and 20 January, a total of 75,419 patients had to spend at least 30 minutes being looked after by ambulance personnel either in a corridor near an A&amp;E unit or in the crew\u2019s vehicle outside because the A&amp;E was too busy to accept them, NHS figures show. Each handover delay represents a breach of NHS rules, which require ambulance-borne patients to be put into the care of A&amp;E staff within 15 minutes of arrival in order to ensure their safety. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: \u201cThese reports of deaths occurring in hospital corridors are tragic cases and represent the risks ever present in our chronically overstretched A&amp;E departments and hospitals. \u201cMy fear is that these sad cases are not isolated and that patients are suffering discomfort, loss of dignity and poorer care than would be ideal due to this now seemingly ever-present overcrowding.\u201d Secamb\u2019s memo tells crews what to do if a patient\u2019s condition starts to worsen. \u201cIf there is no monitoring machine in the corridor, please use your Lifepak [defibrillator].

The timing of the talks between Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, a veteran political consultant, and Konstantin Kilimnik, his longtime aide who allegedly had ties to Russian intelligence in 2016, occurred in New York on 2 August. The meeting came just days after Kilimnik met in Moscow with Oleg Deripaska, a powerful oligarch and close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Deripaska had been a major client of Manafort but had sued him over a failed business deal in Ukraine and was seeking to recoup almost $25m.

Kilimnik, who worked for a decade with Manafort when he was a political consultant making tens of millions representing Deripaska and pro-Moscow Ukrainian political parties, emailed Manafort in late July that he had just spent hours with the man \u201cwho gave you your biggest jar of black caviar several years ago\u201d, referring to Deripaska. Kilimnik\u2019s email to Manafort said that Deripaska asked him to convey \u201cseveral important messages from him to you\u201d. Mueller\u2019s new mid-January court filing was the first evidence that Manafort and Kilimnik had talked about Ukraine peace plans. The filing also stated they discussed such proposals on \u201cmore than one occasion\u201d. The ex-officials say the Mueller filing may signal a growing interest in Deripaska\u2019s involvement with Manafort and Kilimnik. \u201cThis raises the question as to whether Mueller has an ongoing interest in Deripaska in his investigation,\u201d said Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in money laundering enforcement. Some pro-Moscow peace plans for Ukraine have been \u201cproxies\u201d for ending the painful sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 after it invaded eastern Ukraine and Crimea, a major Kremlin goal, Zeldin noted. Similarly, Nick Akerman, a former assistant Watergate prosecutor, said: \u201cIt seems quite likely that Mueller would be focused on Deripaska too as he examines Manafort and Kilimnik.\u201d Intelligence veterans say Kremlin linkages could have been at play in the back-to-back talks in Moscow and New York. \u201cDeripaska is a key lieutenant and a significant oligarch in Putin\u2019s oligarch system,\u201d said Steven Hall, a retired CIA chief of Russia operations. \u201cDeripaska would get his marching orders from the Kremlin about what Russia wanted, including lifting of sanctions and a resolution of the situation in Ukraine that favored Russia,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt seems likely the chain of communication would have been Putin to Deripaska to Kilimnik to Manafort.\u201d \u201cThe Manafort connection to Deripaska is essential,\u201d Hall added. \u201cI think people really need to focus on the Manafort-Deripaska relationship.

A Manafort spokesperson declined comment. Neither Kilimnik nor Deripaska responded to emails seeking comment. During the 2016 election season when the FBI began looking into Russian meddling Deripaska was at least briefly turned to for help. In September 2016 during a Deripaska trip to New York, FBI agents paid a surprise visit on the oligarch in an unsuccessful effort to get him to cooperate in their inquiries into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections, the New York Times reported. Soon after Trump hired Manafort \u2013 originally to help secure the delegates to grab the GOP presidential nomination \u2013 the latter emailed Kilimnik to ensure that Deripaska was in the loop about Manafort\u2019s role with the campaign. In emails first reported by the Washington Post, Manafort proposed giving Deripaska \u201cprivate briefings\u201d on the Trump campaign, and told Kilimnik to pass the idea on to the oligarch, apparently an effort to win his favor and settle the lawsuit that Deripaska had brought against him. Manafort, Kilimnik and Deripaska have said no formal proposal was ever made and nothing came of the idea.

If Fiona Onasanya, elected on a Labour ticket to represent Peterborough, receives a custodial sentence of more than a year, she will automatically be forced to step down. With expectations high that she will receive a substantial term, Labour and the Conservative party are campaigning hard in the Cambridgeshire city that she won by just 607 votes in 2017. Both parties are aware that a snap byelection could be the first opportunity for voters to use the ballot box to give their verdict on Brexit negotiations since Theresa May came back from Brussels with her deal. Disowned by Labour and Jeremy Corbyn, Onasanya has said she will appeal against her conviction and fight to remain as an MP, but this will not prevent her from being sentenced on Tuesday.

Onasanya was convicted at a retrial of colluding with her brother, Festus, after her car was clocked travelling at 41mph in a 30mph zone in the village of Thorney near Peterborough in July 2017. After being found guilty, she sent a message to other Labour MPs likening her predicament to that of biblical figures including Jesus and asking them to pray for her. She has rarely been seen in the city since the verdict, but she did vote against the EU withdrawal bill and will not be able to vote on Tuesday night if she receives a prison sentence. She is still writing a column in the Peterborough Telegraph \u2013 on Sunday, she wrote about tuition fees \u2013 but does not mention her conviction or her sentencing. Neither Onasanya nor her legal team have responded to requests for comment. Immigration remains a major issue in Peterborough, where the population has increased from 157,000 to 200,000 since 2001. One local politician privately acknowledged that a minority of voters were unhappy with the number of recent arrivals from countries including Poland, Portugal, Lithuania, Albania and Afghanistan. \u201cWithout extra resources, there\u2019s too much strain on local services,\u201d he said. The Conservative-led council has received a major funding cut from central government.",

      "bodyText": "A lack of accurate data about the subjects teachers are qualified for is contributing to a shortage of maths and science teachers in New South Wales, a new report has found. On Tuesday the NSW auditor general published a review of the supply of secondary science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 or Stem \u2013 teachers in the state. It found the effectiveness of attempts to plug shortages in Stem teachers was being fundamentally limited by a lack of data about the demand for teachers, and also criticised \u201cunderperforming\u201d scholarship programs. About 40% of teachers in Stem-related disciplines are more than 50 years old, and both federal and state governments have sought to address what is seen as a looming shortage. Last year former education minister Simon Birmingham suggested the government could possibly try to \u201cinfluence\u201d the number of teaching students considering specialising in maths and science subjects by tying it to enrolment funding. But the auditor\u2019s report found the effectiveness of measures in NSW was limited because the department was \u201cnot accurately tracking the supply and demand for secondary teachers by discipline due to incomplete data\u201d. According to the auditor\u2019s report, the education department does not collate data about the extent of \u201cout-of-field teaching\u201d, where teachers run classes outside of their area of expertise, meaning it does not have a full understanding of teacher demand. \u201cMonitoring the level of out-of-field teaching by permanent or temporary teachers would provide the department with a more reliable understanding of the disciplines and locations of current demand,\u201d the report stated. It also found that one-fifth of early career teachers reported teaching out-of-field for at least five hours per fortnight. \u201cHalf of these teachers indicated that they do not receive any additional support from their school to teach out of their approved area,\u201d it stated. \u201cResearch suggests that students taught by out-of-field teachers have lower levels of engagement, and this can compromise student learning outcomes. \u201cSeveral principals we interviewed voiced their concerns over the quality of teachers\u2019 content knowledge when conducting classes outside of their discipline.\u201d After an internal review in 2017, the department developed a new program that \u201caims to understand the current, and forecast the future, supply and demand for teachers, by subject and location\u201d. However, the auditor found the new system still had limitations: for example, it assumed teachers conduct a full-time load in each subject they are approved to teach, meaning it overestimates teacher availability. The report also found high dropout rates in scholarship programs designed to attract Stem teachers. An internal department review from 2017 found scholarship programs \u201cwere not targeting workforce need, and that there were no key performance indicators to determine the overall effectiveness of these strategies\u201d. \u201cIn addition, the review found that only 79% of available scholarship placements are allocated each year, and 31% of scholarship recipients withdraw prior to completing their required service period,\u201d the report stated. Similarly, the success of the programs \u201cwas not being effectively monitored so it was difficult to assess if the programs are helping to address areas of shortage\u201d.",

The PM has urged Conservative MPs to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexiter-mps-back-away-from-anti-backstop-brexit-amendment\">replacing the Irish border backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d</a> via an amendment tabled by Tory chair Graham Brady. The aim is to get opponents to pass May\u2019s amended bill, in the hope the European Union will reciprocate with concessions on the backstop. Brussels has continued to insist negotiations cannot be reopened.</p> <p>Overnight a surprise initiative dubbed the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d emerged. It involves drafting a new backstop that would be acceptable indefinitely, while incentivising the EU and UK to move beyond it and reach a new future relationship. In a message to Tory MPs, the remainer Nicky Morgan said: \u201cIt ensures there is no need for a hard border with Ireland.\u201d The hardline Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg was said to have backed the idea.</p> <p>Here is a list of Tuesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/amendments-to-may-statement-brexit-bill\">proposed amendments</a> \u2013&nbsp;notable among them, options to extend article 50, establish a citizens\u2019 assembly, or hold a second referendum. There are divisions within Labour over whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/labour-in-embarrassing-u-turn-over-immigration-bill-vote\">Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment to rule out a no-deal Brexit</a> should be supported, or whether the party\u2019s pro-Brexit constituents would see it as a rebuff to their wishes. Labour has also performed a late U-turn over the immigration bill \u2013 after instructing its MPs to abstain, the party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/labour-in-embarrassing-u-turn-over-immigration-bill-vote\">came in for intense criticism</a> and eventually allowed MPs the option of voting against it.</p> <p>In London\u2019s \u201cSilicon Roundabout\u201d tech district, John Harris finds that the implications of Brexit are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/29/the-brexit-threat-hanging-over-startups-in-the-uk-tech-sector\">emptying the ranks of talented and much-needed European staff</a>. And Polly Toynbee writes that P&amp;O dropping the British flag because of Brexit shows the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/britannia-rules-waves-brexit-floundering\">decline of a rich seafaring tradition</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Huawei\u2019s woes worsen \u2013 </strong>A Chinese telecommunications company has been charged overnight by the US with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/28/huawei-china-telecoms-charged-us-trade-secrets-fraud\">stealing trade secrets, laundering money, obstructing justice and evading sanctions on Iran</a>. The FBI says Huawei offered bonuses for employees to steal information from other companies. Among such instances, investigators say, engineers from Huawei copied and stole parts from a robot called \u201cTappy\u201d used by T-Mobile to make smartphones. The company has denied the charges, which Beijing has called \u201cimmoral\u201d. Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei finance chief, remains under Canadian house arrest on a US extradition warrant.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Screen dims young minds \u2013 </strong>Frequent use of screens by children aged two to five has been linked to developmental delays by researchers in Canada. The more time children were reported to be spending in front of screens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/28/study-links-high-levels-of-screen-time-to-slower-child-development\">the worse they did on development tests</a>. The researchers say parents should be cautious about time spent with devices \u2013 on average, the 2,400 children they studied spent about 17 hours a week in front of screens at two years old, increasing to almost 25 hours a week at three years, before falling to 11 hours a week at five. Meanwhile the electronic bullying of young people has grown significantly worse in recent years, according to the UK\u2019s media watchdog. Ofcom says 9% of 12- to 15-year-olds report being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/29/young-people-suffer-big-rise-in-online-bullying-watchdog-warns\">bullied via text messages and apps</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Pressure piled on Maduro \u2013 </strong>The US government has announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, as the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/trump-venezuela-sanctions-oil-pdvsa-maduro-guaido\">tries to force out President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro</a>. After the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president, New Zealand has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/venezuela-crisis-new-zealand-guaido-interim-president\">refused to join close allies</a> like the US, Australia, the UK and Canada in giving him its backing. \u201cIt is not New Zealand\u2019s practice to make statements of recognition of governments,\u201d said Winston Peters, the NZ foreign affairs minister.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Rat plague haunts man \u2013 </strong>A former inmate of Wormwood Scrubs is bringing a claim for post-traumatic stress disorder, saying he was left mentally scarred by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/29/former-prisoner-sues-ministry-of-justice-over-ptsd-from-rats\">rats swarming around the jail, running over him in bed and eating his cellmate\u2019s smoky bacon crisps</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Brady amendment\u2019 or \u2018Malthouse compromise\u2019? Good morning, I\u2019m Warren Murray and here is today\u2019s order of business. A flurry of amendments to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill will come before the House of Commons today. The PM has urged Conservative MPs to support replacing the Irish border backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d via an amendment tabled by Tory chair Graham Brady. The aim is to get opponents to pass May\u2019s amended bill, in the hope the European Union will reciprocate with concessions on the backstop. Brussels has continued to insist negotiations cannot be reopened. Overnight a surprise initiative dubbed the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d emerged. It involves drafting a new backstop that would be acceptable indefinitely, while incentivising the EU and UK to move beyond it and reach a new future relationship. In a message to Tory MPs, the remainer Nicky Morgan said: \u201cIt ensures there is no need for a hard border with Ireland.\u201d The hardline Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg was said to have backed the idea. Here is a list of Tuesday\u2019s proposed amendments \u2013 notable among them, options to extend article 50, establish a citizens\u2019 assembly, or hold a second referendum. There are divisions within Labour over whether Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment to rule out a no-deal Brexit should be supported, or whether the party\u2019s pro-Brexit constituents would see it as a rebuff to their wishes. Labour has also performed a late U-turn over the immigration bill \u2013 after instructing its MPs to abstain, the party came in for intense criticism and eventually allowed MPs the option of voting against it. In London\u2019s \u201cSilicon Roundabout\u201d tech district, John Harris finds that the implications of Brexit are emptying the ranks of talented and much-needed European staff. And Polly Toynbee writes that P&amp;O dropping the British flag because of Brexit shows the decline of a rich seafaring tradition. * * * Huawei\u2019s woes worsen \u2013 A Chinese telecommunications company has been charged overnight by the US with stealing trade secrets, laundering money, obstructing justice and evading sanctions on Iran. The FBI says Huawei offered bonuses for employees to steal information from other companies. Among such instances, investigators say, engineers from Huawei copied and stole parts from a robot called \u201cTappy\u201d used by T-Mobile to make smartphones. The company has denied the charges, which Beijing has called \u201cimmoral\u201d. Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei finance chief, remains under Canadian house arrest on a US extradition warrant. * * * Screen dims young minds \u2013 Frequent use of screens by children aged two to five has been linked to developmental delays by researchers in Canada. The more time children were reported to be spending in front of screens, the worse they did on development tests. The researchers say parents should be cautious about time spent with devices \u2013 on average, the 2,400 children they studied spent about 17 hours a week in front of screens at two years old, increasing to almost 25 hours a week at three years, before falling to 11 hours a week at five. Meanwhile the electronic bullying of young people has grown significantly worse in recent years, according to the UK\u2019s media watchdog. Ofcom says 9% of 12- to 15-year-olds report being bullied via text messages and apps. * * * Pressure piled on Maduro \u2013 The US government has announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, as the Trump administration tries to force out President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. After the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president, New Zealand has refused to join close allies like the US, Australia, the UK and Canada in giving him its backing. \u201cIt is not New Zealand\u2019s practice to make statements of recognition of governments,\u201d said Winston Peters, the NZ foreign affairs minister. * * * Rat plague haunts man \u2013 A former inmate of Wormwood Scrubs is bringing a claim for post-traumatic stress disorder, saying he was left mentally scarred by rats swarming around the jail, running over him in bed and eating his cellmate\u2019s smoky bacon crisps. In 2015, officers from HM Inspectorate of Prisons officers found rats \u201cevery day and night we visited the prison and a large rats\u2019 nest was very obvious in the grounds\u201d. The ex-prisoner, 71, says being almost always locked in his cell had meant there was no escape from the scurrying tormentors. His lawyer, Jane Ryan at Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, is suing the Ministry of Justice on his behalf. \u201cLiving conditions in prisons should be humane for the benefit of staff and prisoners,\u201d said Ryan. * * * No end to waste \u2013 About 1.2bn ends of bread loaves that could be eaten are being binned, according to a campaign to plough them back into meals. The North London Waste Authority has got together with chefs to come up with ways to save a crust, like the panzanella salad recipe that you can find at the bottom of our story. Better get stockpiling for 29 March \u2026 Today in Focus podcast: Bercow\u2019s Brexit Today is the day that backbench MPs in parliament could wrestle control of the Brexit process away from the government. Overseeing proceedings is the all-powerful Speaker, John Bercow. But is he pushing an agenda from the traditionally neutral chair? Plus, in opinion: Jonathan Freedland on the Brexit-backing elite and how they will avoid the worst consequences of leaving the EU.

Evan Quartermain, head of programs at Humane Society International \u2013 which has been pushing for increased protections for native flying fox species \u2013 said deaths of animals in Victoria were \u201cdisturbing\u201d. \u201cThat thousands of grey-headed flying foxes are dying so horrifically at the southernmost point of their range is extremely disturbing, especially so soon after spectacled flying foxes met the same fate in Cairns late last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that nowhere is safe from the heat for Australia\u2019s bats. Their habitat has been destroyed to the point that they simply can\u2019t find appropriate shelter when temperatures rise. \u201cThis agony is the result of years of government ignorance and inaction, and it\u2019s beyond unacceptable that the flying foxes are without a recovery plan nearly 20 years after they were recognised as a threatened species.\u201d",

Like most tell-alls, Let Me Finish is an exercise in score-settling, albeit one written from the realm of a dystopic presidency.</p> <p>But what sets Let Me Finish apart is that it is authored by an elected official whom Trump offered several cabinet-levels positions \u2013 just not the ones Christie coveted, like attorney general. Christie was frequently, but not always, in the room where it happened. And so, Let Me Finish is a self-serving, fascinating and informative read.</p> <p>From the get-go Kushner is the bane of Christie\u2019s political existence. In his opening pages, Christie recalls how Steve Bannon came to fire him as the head of the transition, and in the process Christie extracted a confession that Bannon was only doing Kushner\u2019s bidding.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For the second anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration, Christie drops a dollop of revenge, chilled to malevolent perfection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s been taking an ax to your head with the boss ever since I got here,\u201d said Bannon.</p> <p>Long story short, Christie, a former federal prosecutor under George W Bush, sent Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, to prison more than a decade ago for a 14-month stint. Coincidentally, that saga also involves witness tampering, tax evasion, a prostitute, a camera and a brother-in-law, all of which Kushner thought was a \u201cfamily matter that should have been kept away from federal authorities\u201d, relegated instead to the province of rabbis and beth dins.</p> <p>Kushner repeatedly stuck a dagger in Christie\u2019s ambitions and Let Me Finish is Christie\u2019s revenge. With the assistance of <a href=\"http://henican.com/\">Ellis Henican</a>, a veteran of Newsday and talk radio, Christie paints a portrait of Kushner as callow, smarmy, entitled and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/jared-kushner-immigration-reform.html\">way over his skis</a>. Kushner <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/master-negotiator-or-nonentity-kushner-thrusts-himself-into-middle-of-shutdown-debate/2019/01/23/a8b5bf42-1e69-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f65cc8f6f5a9\">appears lacking in judgment</a> even as he is cosseted by his family\u2019s wealth and shielded by his father-in-law\u2019s title. Said differently, if Kushner were not married to the boss\u2019s daughter, he would not be anywhere near the Oval Office or still in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/officials-rejected-jared-kushner-top-secret-security-clearance-were-overruled-n962221\">possession of a security clearance</a>.</p> <p>Christie lays at Kushner\u2019s feet blame for the hiring and firing of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, and the firing of the FBI director James Comey, and thereby Trump\u2019s ensuing legal woes. In Christie\u2019s telling, he advised Trump to either fire Comey at the outset or be prepared to keep him. That did not happen.</p> <p>Instead, Robert Mueller tortures Trump by day and Comey\u2019s ghost torments him by night. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s White House tenure has been reduced to a mom and pop family business, complete with two sets of gilded books and a full-time special counsel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While Christie pours his bile on those who surround Trump, he seeks to leave the president unscathed and mostly succeeds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kushner is not the only person with a bullseye on his back. Christie dings a whole cast of characters. He chivies Jeff Sessions, blasts Paul Manafort and brings the hammer down on Gen Flynn, whom he labels as a \u201cRussian lackey and future federal felon\u201d \u2026 a train wreck from beginning to end \u2026 a slow-motion car crash\u201d.</p> <p>Yet while Christie pours his bile on those who surround Trump, he seeks to leave the president unscathed and mostly succeeds. Critical of the initial iteration of the administration\u2019s travel ban, Christie blames Trump\u2019s aides and his absence from transition. In other words, had Christie been allowed to stay, Trump would have hit the ground running. Perhaps, and then only to a point. Trump is chaos incarnate.</p> <p>Let Me Finish also recalls how Christie, then federal prosecutor for New Jersey, first met Trump. It was a match initiated by Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a judge on the US court of appeals for the third circuit, which encompasses New Jersey, home of Trump\u2019s bankrupt casinos.</p> <p>\u201cChris \u2026 would you be willing to have dinner with my little brother?\u201d Barry asked.</p> <p>\u201cJudge \u2026 I\u2019ll have dinner with your brother,\u201d Christie replied.

Describing his appearance on Trump\u2019s shortlist of vice-presidential picks, Christie lets it be known he had also been considered as a running mate by Mitt Romney in 2012. Nowhere does Christie mention that his earlier vice-presidential gambit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/11/04/what-mitt-romney-learned-about-chris-christie-in-2012-and-why-it-matters-for-2016/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.2cd7aa7afc05\">ran aground</a> after he was unable to quell the reservations held by Romney\u2019s vetting team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/16/chris-christie-book-trump-fired\">'You didn't get fired\u2019: Christie offers new evidence Trump avoids confrontation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Likewise, Christie writes of how Steven A Cohen \u2013 an inspiration for the cable television series Billions \u2013 was his strongest backer in 2016. But Let Me Finish fails to refer to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/business/dealbook/sec-and-steven-cohen-reach-settlement-in-insider-trading-case.html\">Cohen\u2019s hedge fund, SAC</a>, being convicted of insider trading or Cohen himself being disciplined by the SEC.</p> <p>Throughout, Christie conveys a misplaced sense of being put upon. Unfortunately, victimhood does not suit him, not after Bridgegate or <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/time_picks_infamous_beachgate_photo_for_top_10_lis.html\">Beachgate</a>, the time Christie and family hung out on a closed beach during a state government shutdown.</p> <p>In the end, Let Me Finish is a tale of Christie\u2019s willingness to dance with the devil and turn a blind eye when needed. He never convincingly explains why he thought Kushner would let bygones be bygones, or why he concluded that Trump was constitutionally capable of faithfully discharging the obligations of office.</p> <p>Claiming \u201cthe president was ill served by poor advice\u201d and observing that he is surrounded by \u201camateurs , grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons\u201d rings tinny. It elides how Trump got to where he got and why Christie felt compelled be part of the circus he now seems to abhor. This is what sour grapes sounds like.</p>",

He then left the New Jersey governor\u2019s mansion with a 14% approval rating. Let Me Finish, his bombshell of a book, could just as easily have been titled Everybody Hates Chris. In time for the second anniversary of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Christie drops a dollop of revenge, chilled to malevolent perfection, Jared Kushner his primary target. Like most tell-alls, Let Me Finish is an exercise in score-settling, albeit one written from the realm of a dystopic presidency. But what sets Let Me Finish apart is that it is authored by an elected official whom Trump offered several cabinet-levels positions \u2013 just not the ones Christie coveted, like attorney general. Christie was frequently, but not always, in the room where it happened. And so, Let Me Finish is a self-serving, fascinating and informative read. From the get-go Kushner is the bane of Christie\u2019s political existence. In his opening pages, Christie recalls how Steve Bannon came to fire him as the head of the transition, and in the process Christie extracted a confession that Bannon was only doing Kushner\u2019s bidding. \u201cThe kid\u2019s been taking an ax to your head with the boss ever since I got here,\u201d said Bannon. Long story short, Christie, a former federal prosecutor under George W Bush, sent Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, to prison more than a decade ago for a 14-month stint. Coincidentally, that saga also involves witness tampering, tax evasion, a prostitute, a camera and a brother-in-law, all of which Kushner thought was a \u201cfamily matter that should have been kept away from federal authorities\u201d, relegated instead to the province of rabbis and beth dins. Kushner repeatedly stuck a dagger in Christie\u2019s ambitions and Let Me Finish is Christie\u2019s revenge. With the assistance of Ellis Henican, a veteran of Newsday and talk radio, Christie paints a portrait of Kushner as callow, smarmy, entitled and way over his skis. Kushner appears lacking in judgment even as he is cosseted by his family\u2019s wealth and shielded by his father-in-law\u2019s title. Said differently, if Kushner were not married to the boss\u2019s daughter, he would not be anywhere near the Oval Office or still in possession of a security clearance. Christie lays at Kushner\u2019s feet blame for the hiring and firing of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, and the firing of the FBI director James Comey, and thereby Trump\u2019s ensuing legal woes. In Christie\u2019s telling, he advised Trump to either fire Comey at the outset or be prepared to keep him. That did not happen. Instead, Robert Mueller tortures Trump by day and Comey\u2019s ghost torments him by night. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s White House tenure has been reduced to a mom and pop family business, complete with two sets of gilded books and a full-time special counsel. Kushner is not the only person with a bullseye on his back. Christie dings a whole cast of characters. He chivies Jeff Sessions, blasts Paul Manafort and brings the hammer down on Gen Flynn, whom he labels as a \u201cRussian lackey and future federal felon\u201d \u2026 a train wreck from beginning to end \u2026 a slow-motion car crash\u201d. Yet while Christie pours his bile on those who surround Trump, he seeks to leave the president unscathed and mostly succeeds. Critical of the initial iteration of the administration\u2019s travel ban, Christie blames Trump\u2019s aides and his absence from transition. In other words, had Christie been allowed to stay, Trump would have hit the ground running. Perhaps, and then only to a point. Trump is chaos incarnate. Let Me Finish also recalls how Christie, then federal prosecutor for New Jersey, first met Trump. It was a match initiated by Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a judge on the US court of appeals for the third circuit, which encompasses New Jersey, home of Trump\u2019s bankrupt casinos. \u201cChris \u2026 would you be willing to have dinner with my little brother?\u201d Barry asked. \u201cJudge \u2026 I\u2019ll have dinner with your brother,\u201d Christie replied. A relationship was born. As to be expected, Christie omits inconvenient details. Describing his appearance on Trump\u2019s shortlist of vice-presidential picks, Christie lets it be known he had also been considered as a running mate by Mitt Romney in 2012. Nowhere does Christie mention that his earlier vice-presidential gambit ran aground after he was unable to quell the reservations held by Romney\u2019s vetting team. Likewise, Christie writes of how Steven A Cohen \u2013 an inspiration for the cable television series Billions \u2013 was his strongest backer in 2016. But Let Me Finish fails to refer to Cohen\u2019s hedge fund, SAC, being convicted of insider trading or Cohen himself being disciplined by the SEC. Throughout, Christie conveys a misplaced sense of being put upon. Unfortunately, victimhood does not suit him, not after Bridgegate or Beachgate, the time Christie and family hung out on a closed beach during a state government shutdown. In the end, Let Me Finish is a tale of Christie\u2019s willingness to dance with the devil and turn a blind eye when needed. He never convincingly explains why he thought Kushner would let bygones be bygones, or why he concluded that Trump was constitutionally capable of faithfully discharging the obligations of office. Claiming \u201cthe president was ill served by poor advice\u201d and observing that he is surrounded by \u201camateurs , grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons\u201d rings tinny. It elides how Trump got to where he got and why Christie felt compelled be part of the circus he now seems to abhor. This is what sour grapes sounds like.",

We clicked and joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/17/so-solid-crew-how-we-made-21-seconds-interview\">So Solid Crew</a>, who at that time were 30 strong. When we all piled into a tiny room, it was crazy \u2013 but when Neutrino and I signed our own record deal, we became a separate entity.</p> <p>Bound 4 Da Reload (Casualty) was the first track we made. DJ magazine were advertising a day at a recording studio for \u00a399. My brother brought the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels soundtrack to the studio, and one of the skits between the songs seemed to fit with a sample of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/731673.stm\">the theme from the BBC series Casualty</a>, which sounded edgy. So I used both in the track.</p> <p>When you\u2019re 17, you don\u2019t worry if using something like a TV theme in a track is cool. We didn\u2019t know anything about clearing samples, but later we started worrying that someone would come after us. I phoned the reception desk at the BBC \u2013 \u201cExcuse me, my band have sampled your Casualty tune\u201d \u2013 but they didn\u2019t take me seriously. When we got signed, the record label cleared the sample.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ-27rdwJPs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AZ-27rdwJPs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We initially made Reload as a dub plate for the pirate radio show, but my brother\u2019s \u00a32,000 redundancy money paid for the first 1,000 white-label singles. We sold 20,000 from the back of <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peugeot_305.JPG\">a Peugeot 305</a>. My brother ran up thousands of pounds in parking tickets: we\u2019d park outside a shop, run in and do a sale-or-return deal, but it got quite expensive. The car\u2019s exhaust fell off and the heater was stuck on \u2013 it was so hot inside that the glue on my new trainers melted.</p> <p>Initially, we had no commercial radio play. Some stations refused to play the single because they thought \u201creload\u201d was about guns. But the pirates played it, then Kiss FM did, and it took off, which seemed to shock the mainstream stations. When they did the chart rundown on Capital, there was a three-second pause after they played the record. Then they just went: \u201cEr, that was this week\u2019s No 1.\u201d</p> <h2>Mark Oseitutu, AKA Neutrino, MC</h2> <p>When Oxide first played me the beginnings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/31/oxide-neutrino-bound-4-da-reload\">Bound 4 Da Reload</a>, it was mainly the beat and the Casualty theme. He wanted me to add some lyrics. \u201cBound for da reload\u201d was something I said on pirate radio, meaning: \u201cDJ, reload the track.\u201d</p> <p>It was my first time in the studio, and I asked the engineer for the same mic I had used at the pirate station. He said: \u201cYou can\u2019t use one of those in a recording studio!\u201d I did the whole song in one take \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise you could do it over and over again \u2013 but it captured a certain nervous energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f48aaa7c9e0bd5545c57e653f4557546e9dd6d4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f48aaa7c9e0bd5545c57e653f4557546e9dd6d4c/0_0_3072_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxide and Neutrino in Austin, Texas, in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oxide &amp; Neutrino in Austin, Texas, in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They called us \u201cUK garage\u201d but today, Reload sounds like the start of what was becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grime\">grime</a>. Pirate radio was massive then. People recorded our sets on cassette tapes, which made their way to cities around the country. We went from the underground to Top of the Pops very quickly. I remember going to buy trainers, and so many people were screaming at me they had to close the shop. I thought: \u201cWhy are people screaming at me?\u201d and remembered: \u201cOh, yeah, we\u2019re No 1.\u201d</p> <p>When there was a rise in gun crime, garage music became the scapegoat, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/09/uk-drill-music-london-wave-violent-crime\">what is happening now with drill</a>. We went from being on Top of the Pops to not being able to play anywhere, and no one would work with us. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1309355.stm\">Then I was shot in Mayfair</a>. Someone tried to mug me, I wrestled with them and heard a bang. I felt a warm sensation in my leg. Luckily it was a flesh wound, but to add insult to injury, I was arrested because the gun magazine had dropped in the car when the guy put the firearm through the window. I said: \u201cIt\u2019s not mine, I\u2019ve just been shot!\u201d It was a weird time \u2013 especially because Reload had the Casualty sample and police sirens on it.</p> <p>We\u2019re both parents now, and they know Bound 4 Da Reload on the school run.

      "bodyText": "Alex Rivers, AKA Oxide, DJ I met Neutrino at the pirate radio station Supreme FM, where we were doing DJ sets. We clicked and joined So Solid Crew, who at that time were 30 strong. When we all piled into a tiny room, it was crazy \u2013 but when Neutrino and I signed our own record deal, we became a separate entity. Bound 4 Da Reload (Casualty) was the first track we made. DJ magazine were advertising a day at a recording studio for \u00a399. My brother brought the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels soundtrack to the studio, and one of the skits between the songs seemed to fit with a sample of the theme from the BBC series Casualty, which sounded edgy. So I used both in the track. When you\u2019re 17, you don\u2019t worry if using something like a TV theme in a track is cool. We didn\u2019t know anything about clearing samples, but later we started worrying that someone would come after us. I phoned the reception desk at the BBC \u2013 \u201cExcuse me, my band have sampled your Casualty tune\u201d \u2013 but they didn\u2019t take me seriously. When we got signed, the record label cleared the sample. We initially made Reload as a dub plate for the pirate radio show, but my brother\u2019s \u00a32,000 redundancy money paid for the first 1,000 white-label singles. We sold 20,000 from the back of a Peugeot 305. My brother ran up thousands of pounds in parking tickets: we\u2019d park outside a shop, run in and do a sale-or-return deal, but it got quite expensive. The car\u2019s exhaust fell off and the heater was stuck on \u2013 it was so hot inside that the glue on my new trainers melted. Initially, we had no commercial radio play. Some stations refused to play the single because they thought \u201creload\u201d was about guns. But the pirates played it, then Kiss FM did, and it took off, which seemed to shock the mainstream stations. When they did the chart rundown on Capital, there was a three-second pause after they played the record. Then they just went: \u201cEr, that was this week\u2019s No 1.\u201d Mark Oseitutu, AKA Neutrino, MC When Oxide first played me the beginnings of Bound 4 Da Reload, it was mainly the beat and the Casualty theme. He wanted me to add some lyrics. \u201cBound for da reload\u201d was something I said on pirate radio, meaning: \u201cDJ, reload the track.\u201d It was my first time in the studio, and I asked the engineer for the same mic I had used at the pirate station. He said: \u201cYou can\u2019t use one of those in a recording studio!\u201d I did the whole song in one take \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise you could do it over and over again \u2013 but it captured a certain nervous energy. They called us \u201cUK garage\u201d but today, Reload sounds like the start of what was becoming grime. Pirate radio was massive then. People recorded our sets on cassette tapes, which made their way to cities around the country. We went from the underground to Top of the Pops very quickly. I remember going to buy trainers, and so many people were screaming at me they had to close the shop. I thought: \u201cWhy are people screaming at me?\u201d and remembered: \u201cOh, yeah, we\u2019re No 1.\u201d When there was a rise in gun crime, garage music became the scapegoat, like what is happening now with drill. We went from being on Top of the Pops to not being able to play anywhere, and no one would work with us. Then I was shot in Mayfair. Someone tried to mug me, I wrestled with them and heard a bang. I felt a warm sensation in my leg. Luckily it was a flesh wound, but to add insult to injury, I was arrested because the gun magazine had dropped in the car when the guy put the firearm through the window. I said: \u201cIt\u2019s not mine, I\u2019ve just been shot!\u201d It was a weird time \u2013 especially because Reload had the Casualty sample and police sirens on it. We\u2019re both parents now, and they know Bound 4 Da Reload on the school run. There\u2019s usually one person who\u2019ll ask: \u201cCan you DJ at our daughter\u2019s birthday party?\u201d I go, \u201cI\u2019m not the DJ. I\u2019m the MC!\u201d \u2022 Oxide &amp; Neutrino\u2019s new single, Dilemma 2.0, is out now.",

Coffee shops put out signs, turning customers away. Twitter and Instagram brimmed with outrage. The truly desperate searched from Williamsburg to Harlem, but it seemed undeniable: New York was out of oat milk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/11/white-gold-the-unstoppable-rise-of-alternative-milks-podcast\">White gold: the unstoppable rise of alternative milks \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t just New York, in fact. The entire US was suffering from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/aug/15/holy-cow-can-brooklyn-survive-its-oat-milk-shortage\" title=\"\">a shortage of Oatly</a>, a Swedish plant milk whose rapid rise from obscure digestive health brand to the dairy alternative of choice had caught even Oatly by surprise. Since its US launch in 2016, Oatly had gone from supplying a handful of upscale New York coffee shops to more than 3,000 cafes and grocery stores nationwide. The company had <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/foodnews/oatly-is-increasing-production-by-1025-25-so-there-will-never-be-an-oat-milk-shortage-again/ar-BBNtCOE\" title=\"\">ramped up production by 1,250%</a>, but when I spoke to CEO Toni Petersson in late summer, they were still struggling to meet demand. \u201cHow do we supply when the growth is this crazy?\u201d Petersson said.</p> <p>Fortunately, when it comes to milk, in 2019 there is no shortage of alternative alternatives. Visit your local supermarket and you will find a refrigerated aisle overflowing with choice: almond milk, hazelnut milk, peanut, tiger nut, walnut, cashew \u2013 and that\u2019s just the nuts. Coconut, hemp, spelt, quinoa, pea \u2013 you name it, somewhere a health-food startup is milking it. London tube stations are filled with ads for new plant milks \u2013 or rather, \u201cmylks\u201d (EU law prevents dairy alternatives from using the word milk if it isn\u2019t produced by a lactating mammal). Cookbooks dedicate entire chapters to blending and straining your own. Sainsbury\u2019s now stocks around 70 different options. There are the wellness punks (Rebel Kitchen, Rude Health), the dairy puns (Malk, Milkadamia, Mooala) and the nourishers (LoveRaw, Good Karma, Plenish). \u201cPeople are just looking at every nut that exists and seeing if they can squash it into a milk,\u201d said Glynis Murray, one of the owners of Good, which squashes hemp seeds into oil and milk.</p> <p>It seems unthinkable now, but as recently as 2008, alternatives to cow\u2019s milk largely meant soya (invariably Alpro in the UK, Silk in the US). For anything else, you\u2019d need to scour health-food shops for drab, clinical-looking, long-life cartons of rice milk buried in the back with the other digestive aids. \u201cIt was the deathly aisle,\u201d said John Schoolcraft, Oatly\u2019s global creative director. \u201cIt was just for people who were lactose intolerant [or] had an allergy to milk; vegans, vegetarians \u2013 people who, at that time, were on the fringe of society.\u201d</p> <p>Plant milks are no longer fringe. Just over one in 10 of Pret a Manger\u2019s hot drinks in the UK are ordered with dairy alternative milks (organic soya milk or organic rice-coconut milk). According to research firm Mintel, UK plant milk sales have <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/non-dairy-milk-alternatives-oatly-soy-oat-rice-vegan\" title=\"\">grown by 30%</a> since 2015, buoyed by a surge in vegan and vegetarian diets. In the US, nearly half of all shoppers now add a plant milk to their baskets. Globally, the industry is estimated to be worth $16bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile, reduced demand for cow\u2019s milk and falling prices led to the closure of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36764592\" title=\"\">1,000 dairy farms in the UK</a> between 2013 and 2016. Milk\u2019s reputation as a healthy food is under threat from anxieties about bovine antibiotics, animal cruelty and the industry\u2019s environmental impact, as well as increased diagnosis of lactose intolerance. Teenagers now consider cow\u2019s milk less healthy than plant milk alternatives, a development the former chairman of Dairy UK, David Dobbin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/30/dairy-scary-public-farming-calves-pens-alternatives\" title=\"\">called \u201ca demographic time bomb\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cConsumers are really not sure about the dairy industry,\u201d Caroline Roux, a dairy analyst at Mintel, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not convinced these products are good for them any more.\u201d</p> <p>But the plant milk boom is, as one entrepreneur told me, \u201cway bigger than just switching your milk\u201d. To converts, almond and oat milk are the next wave in a fundamental shift towards a more conscious, sustainable way of living. To critics, they\u2019re little more than cleverly marketed nut juice with additives \u2013 a symptom of everything that\u2019s wrong with modern food culture. And so a strange battle has emerged, between an industry trying to replace something it says we don\u2019t need in the first place, and dairy, a business that for a century sold itself as the foundation of a healthy diet, while ignoring the fact that most of the world does just fine without it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>We are all born milk drinkers. Babies\u2019 guts produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, the sugar in breastmilk (and cow\u2019s milk), into the simpler sugars glucose and galactose. But for the majority of humans, production of the enzyme lactase plummets after weaning. \u201cFrom a human perspective \u2013 no, to go further than that, from a mammalian perspective \u2013 the norm is to be able to tolerate your mother\u2019s breast milk, and then as you get past infancy, to stop producing lactase and become lactose intolerant,\u201d said Adam Fox, a consultant paediatric allergist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s hospitals, and one of the UK\u2019s leading food allergy experts. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got a small group of humans that have a mutation which means they maintain production of lactase into adulthood. Northern Europeans, the Masai [in east Africa], some Arab groups as well. But that\u2019s the exception, not the rule.\u201d</p> <p>That schism between milk-drinkers and the rest \u2013 actually a series of independent genetic mutations \u2013 appears to have occurred about 10,000 years ago, around the time humans were domesticating farm animals. It is the reason that in countries such as the UK, Sweden and Ireland, more than 90% of adults can drink milk without suffering any ill effects, but<strong> </strong>worldwide, more than two-thirds of all adults are considered lactose intolerant. For lactose-intolerant people, a glass of milk can induce bloating, stomach pains and diarrhoea. (Lactose intolerance should not be \u2013 though often is \u2013 confused with cow\u2019s milk allergy, an immune response to the proteins in cow\u2019s milk that affects around 1% of UK adults.)</p> <p>Even in northern Europe, milk as we know it is a recent phenomenon. Fresh milk, left unrefrigerated, spoils quickly and can harbour a variety of deadly pathogens, including E Coli and tuberculosis. For most of history it was either consumed within moments of milking, or processed as cheese or yoghurt. Few drunk milk in its liquid form. \u201cThe Romans considered it a sign of barbarism,\u201d said Mark Kurlansky, author of Milk! A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. \u201cThe only people who drank milk were people on farms, because they were the only ones who could get it fresh enough.\u201d (Even then, cow\u2019s milk was considered inferior to alternatives such as goat or donkey.) In the 19th century, \u201cswill milk\u201d \u2013 so called because cows were fed the filthy runoff from inner-city breweries, turning their milk blue \u2013 was linked with thousands of infant deaths. Only in the early 20th century, with the introduction of mandatory pasteurisation \u2013 in which milk is heated to kill off any bacteria before bottling \u2013 did milk become safe enough for most people to drink regularly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"034c86ed364454c728d9bc97e0ece0ebca6cd2cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034c86ed364454c728d9bc97e0ece0ebca6cd2cd/3_0_5409_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cows being machine-milked in France in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cows being machine-milked in France in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the first world war that ultimately aligned political forces behind the dairy business. In Britain, rationing meant food was limited, and child malnutrition was rife. The emerging field of nutritional science identified milk \u2013 with its high protein content and newly discovered \u201cvital amines\u201d, or vitamins \u2013 as a potential solution. Thanks to government price controls, milk was one thing not in short supply. Soon, \u201cconsumers everywhere witnessed a snowfall of propaganda documenting the miracles worked by milk\u201d, writes Deborah Valenze in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/30/milk-local-global-history-review\" title=\"\">Milk: A Local and Global History</a>. Milk became the original superfood: a boundless source of calcium, protein and vitamins. In 1946, Clement Attlee and Harry S Truman\u2019s governments both passed measures to ensure milk was available free with school meals. Industry alliances like the UK\u2019s Milk Marketing Board embarked on campaigns to enhance milk\u2019s image. More recently, in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/got-milk-ads_n_4847121.html?guccounter=1\" title=\"\">Got Milk? campaign</a> showed celebrities from Beyonc\u00e9 to Kermit the Frog with milk moustaches. The message was clear: if you wanted your children to grow up big and strong, they needed to be drinking milk.</p> <p>Today, dairy is a vast and highly regulated behemoth, worth more than $400bn, produced by a global herd of more than 274 million cows. Politicians mess with milk at their peril (when Margaret Thatcher, as education secretary, in 1971 took the draconian step of cutting free school milk for the over-sevens, she was branded \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/15/margaret-thatcher-education-legacy-gove\" title=\"\">milk snatcher</a>\u201d). And yet, for many consumers, the allure of milk is on the wane. In 1975, the average American <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683339929/nobody-is-moving-our-cheese-american-surplus-reaches-record-high\" title=\"\">consumed 247 pounds</a> (around 130 litres) of milk per year; in 2017, it was just 149 pounds (66 litres).<strong> </strong>In the US, milk sales have <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/us-non-dairy-milk-sales-grow-61-over-the-last-five-years\" title=\"\">fallen 15% since 2012</a>.</p> <p>Milk\u2019s \u201cshare of throat\u201d \u2013 an industry term for the proportion of total liquid we consume in a day \u2013 has been eroded by a steady flow of soft drinks, juices and smoothies, even bottled water. But none of these presented an existential threat. Blanket marketing established the connection between milk and wholesomeness and good nutrition. Now new forms of persuasion, more targeted and pervasive, have stripped away that healthy sheen from dairy.</p> <p>The internet has given animal rights activists new reach. Search for \u201cdairy\u201d on YouTube and you will be assaulted by videos with titles like Dairy Is Scary (5m views), which depicts in graphic detail the suffering of dairy cows. Netflix, too, has provided previously untapped audiences for documentaries like Cowspiracy and What the Health. Besides the ill-treatment of animals, evidence has mounted that the dairy industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story\" title=\"\">catastrophic for the environment</a>. Animal agriculture contributes more greenhouse gases than aviation, shipping and road vehicles combined. One recent study led by Oxford University claimed that observing a vegetarian or vegan diet is the single <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\" title=\"\">most effective way</a> to reduce your own environmental footprint.</p> <p>Plant milks received a boost from their association with clean eating, a craze that has also had the effect of linking dairy with negative health issues. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating\" title=\"\">Clean eating</a>, advocated by a fresh-skinned, glossy crop of wellness bloggers and Instagram celebrities, argued for the elimination of any foods deemed overly processed, allergenic, or otherwise \u201cunnatural\u201d: gluten, caffeine, meat and dairy. Its proponents blamed lactose intolerance as the cause of a range of ailments, including acne, eczema, lethargy, joint pain and a variety of digestive issues. And, as the clean eaters warned their readers off dairy, they sent them into the willing arms of plant milk startups. A steady supply of attractive millennial influencers filled their Instagram feeds with appetising shots of peanut-milk Thai curries and gluten-free beetroot bread. (According to industry analysts, one of the keys to the plant-based trend is that it looks appetising on Instagram.) The clean eaters did what years of vegan campaigning never could. Suddenly, giving up milk wasn\u2019t just a health issue. It was part of living your best and most beautiful life.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The notion of milking plants is not new. In China, soya milk has been made since at least the 14th century, most commonly as a step in making tofu. The earliest written mention of almond milk appears in a Baghdadi cookbook from 1226, the Kitab al-Tabikh. \u201cIf you look at Medieval recipes, they will often give you a choice between milk or almond milk,\u201d said Mark Kurlansky (whose best-seller Cod: A Biography, launched an entire genre of food microhistories).</p> <p>In the west, until recently, almond and soya milk remained relatively unknown, except by vegetarians and the odd eccentric (Henry Ford, of the car company, was an <a href=\"http://www.soyinfocenter.com/HSS/henry_ford_and_employees.php\" title=\"\">early soya evangelist</a>). In 1956, the Plantmilk Society was established in London by Leslie Cross, then vice-president of the British Vegan Society, a nascent group of animal rights activists. Cross, who particularly objected to the cruelty of the dairy industry, set about trying to find a dairy replacement using crops that could be grown in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cThe big issue originally was: how do you get a protein in a liquid that can emulate dairy milk?\u201d said Adrian Ling, whose father, Arthur, was chair of the new organisation. Photos from the time show the smiling pioneers in white lab coats examining many glasses of questionable opaque liquids. \u201cThey did a lot of work on cabbage,\u201d Ling said. Eventually, they settled on the soya bean. \u201cIt was a very small market \u2013 a few hundred people,\u201d said Ling. \u201cThey lost a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>In 1981, a young Belgian food tech named Philippe Vandemoortele decided to use a new packing technology, the sterile Tetra Brik, to sell soya milk. \u201cI started in a garage with pots and pans, a grinder. I was young, and very naive,\u201d Vandemoortele, now 73, told me. He called his soya milk Alpro. Reviews were mixed. The local supermarket refused to stock it. \u201cThe buyer tasted my product, and he said: \u2018Whoa. It\u2019s awful!\u2019\u201d But Vandemoortele persisted. Today Alpro is owned by Danone, and in 2017 had a turnover in <a href=\"https://www.insidermedia.com/insider/midlands/alpro-sales-jump-towards-200m\" title=\"\">excess of \u00a3183m</a>.</p> <p>Soya\u2019s real break came in the late 90s, when a Colorado soya company called WhiteWave made what seems like a confoundingly obvious discovery: if they moved the product to the refrigerated aisle alongside the dairy milk, more people bought it. WhiteWave\u2019s new refrigerated soya drink, which it called Silk, was a sensation. At the same time, Silk, Alpro and others jumped on emerging evidence about the link between high cholesterol and heart disease to market themselves as a healthy alternative. All of a sudden, soya was for everyone.</p> <p>Soya\u2019s rapid growth was short-lived, in large part due to the fact that it doesn\u2019t taste very good. Even modern soya milks, which add sugar, thickeners and other additives to imitate dairy milk, have a beany taste and odour. In the early 2000s, soya had its own health scare. Soya contains phytoestrogens, oestrogen-like compounds that can mimic the hormone\u2019s effects in humans, a discovery that led to fears about it disrupting hormones and \u201cfeminising\u201d men. Clinical studies have consistently shown those fears are overstated. Even so, neo-Nazis continue to <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/how-the-alt-right-uses-milk-to-promote-white-supremacy-94854\" title=\"\">push the theory</a> that soya milk is a liberal conspiracy to emasculate men, and drink cow\u2019s milk at rallies to demonstrate \u201cdigestive superiority\u201d.</p> <p>In 2008, the Blue Diamond Growers, a large cooperative of almond farmers in California, sensed an opportunity. Its milk, Almond Breeze, had long lagged behind Silk, by then America\u2019s leading soya brand. \u201cWe knew if we were wanting to compete with them, we would need to be in the refrigerated case,\u201d Al Greenlee, Blue Diamond\u2019s director of marketing, told me. Supermarkets maintain a tight grip on shelf space, charging high fees to stock a new product. Lucrative, high-traffic displays like the refrigerated case are fiercely competitive. The owners of Silk at that time \u2013 the dairy giant Dean Foods \u2013 had leveraged its industry clout to get Silk positioned alongside milk. \u201cSo we followed a similar path, and established a partnership with the second largest dairy in the country\u201d. Blue Diamond started in Florida, targeting neighbourhoods with large Hispanic populations, who have a higher genetic incidence of lactose intolerance.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the California almond industry embarked on a vast marketing spree, funding \u2013 and publicising \u2013 new research into the health benefits of almonds. The effect was immediate. Glossy magazines proclaimed almonds a \u201csuperfood\u201d. Almond Breeze was so successful that within two years Silk launched its own almond milk to try and keep up. By 2013, almond had overtaken soya as the best-selling plant milk in the US.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In today\u2019s crowded market, newcomers require something special to stand out. An Australian milk called Nutty Bruce boasts of \u201cactivated almonds\u201d, which is a nod to the current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/28/charcoal-black-food-beauty-fad-instagram-health-claims\" title=\"\">craze for charcoal</a> (superheated and then oxidised, \u201cactivated\u201d charcoal is marketed as a detoxifier), but at closer inspection just means the almonds are soaked in water for slightly longer than usual. A San Francisco startup called Ripple claims to have developed a hi-tech process to isolate the protein in yellow peas without any of the associated flavours or colourings. Cheryl Mitchell, the chief scientist of the New York-based producer Elmhurst Milked, told me excitedly about her patented extraction process, which uses \u201chigh-pressure water and a sloughing action\u201d to break down nuts and pulses while keeping the proteins intact.</p> <p>Mitchell comes from an esteemed line of food technologists: her father, Bill, invented Cool Whip imitation cream, the Pop Rocks popping candy and Tang fruit-flavoured drink. In the 1980s, she helped develop Rice Dream. Elmhurst was a dairy for 90 years; at its peak, it supplied public schools and Starbucks branches across Manhattan. But in 2016, its owners sold off the cattle and switched to plant milk. It now sells 11 varieties. \u201cWait till they see the corn milk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s yellow, but it has more antioxidants than blueberries!\u201d</p> <p>It seems every ingredient has its acolytes. \u201cWe are here to spread a philosophy about a way of being, one which is much more harmonious and symbiotic with nature,\u201d Tamara Arbib, the founder of London-based coconut drinks company Rebel Kitchen, told me. Rebel Kitchen\u2019s Mylk, launched in 2014, is a blend of coconut, rice and cashew. \u201cI\u2019m a massive fan of eating right for your blood type,\u201d Arbib said. \u201cA lot of blood types do better without dairy.\u201d</p> <p>In July, I went to see one of the UK\u2019s most prominent plant milk startups, Rude Health, in London. Launched by Camilla and Nick Barnard in 2005, Rude Health started out selling muesli, but quickly grew into a small health food empire. It was the tail end of a heatwave, at brunch time, and the Rude Health Cafe hummed with healthy looking professionals sipping cashew lattes. Nick, who has sharp features, grey hair, and wore an open-collared white shirt, ordered a kombucha. \u201cI\u2019m having dairy,\u201d Camilla said, conspiratorially.</p> <p>Rude Health had attracted negative press in 2017, after some vegans became incensed at a company blogpost promoting sustainable dairy. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t crossed our minds that to be for dairy free, we were expected to be against dairy,\u201d Camilla said. \u201cWe were just chugging along, thinking we were for good quality.\u201d The episode had made them reconsider their marketing strategy, to clarify that they\u2019re not an exclusively vegan brand. \u201cWhy does everything have to be the magic pill, or the devil? Why do you have to be for or against?\u201d</p> <p>Rude Health got into plant milks in 2013, selling three flavours: oat, brown rice and almond. Today, it sells 10, including Tiger Nut, Cashew and Hazelnut &amp; Cacao. We walked over to the company\u2019s offices nearby for a tasting session. Rival products and plant-based cookbooks lined the shelves. Nick poured shots of various shades of beige into small glasses. Many plant milk brands add calcium carbonate \u2013 chalk \u2013 to make the liquid whiter and more opaque (the calcium content is a happy bonus) but the colouring in these plant milks, Camilla assured me, was natural. We tried a few. The coconut was sweet, like a Bounty dissolved in water. The hazelnut was pleasingly thick, if slightly overwhelming. \u201cTondo Gentile,\u201d Nick said, approvingly. \u201cA gourmet hazelnut.\u201d</p> <p>The almond tasted thin by comparison. The brand\u2019s regular Almond Drink contains brown rice, \u201ccold-pressed\u201d sunflower oil and sea salt, but Rude Health also offers Ultimate Almond \u2013 just nuts and water \u2013 intended for purists. \u201cThere is a hardcore market,\u201d Camilla said.</p> <p>Today, almond makes up <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/us-non-dairy-milk-sales-grow-61-over-the-last-five-years\" title=\"\">around two thirds</a> of all plant milks sold, but it is suffering its own reputational crisis. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/oct/21/almond-milk-quite-good-for-you-very-bad-for-the-planet\" title=\"\">One issue is environmental</a>: it takes 4.5 litres of water to grow a single almond (technically not a nut, but a seed). In California, which grows eight in 10 of the world\u2019s almond crop, almond growing consumes an estimated 10% of the entire water supply \u2013 a controversial issue in a state often afflicted by drought.</p> <p>Consumers have also caught on that the actual almond content of most almond milks is minuscule. Both Silk and Alpro contain just 2% almonds. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a water-based emulsion that you\u2019re adding oils, a lot of sugar and gums to, and then just adding a couple of nuts on top,\u201d Elmhurst\u2019s Cheryl Mitchell said. \u201cAs a business model, it\u2019s great \u2013 any time you can sell water, right? That\u2019s essentially what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The industry insiders I spoke to agreed that almond\u2019s moment is over. Right now the real growth is in coconut, and in oat.</p> <p>In 2012, when Petersson took over as CEO of Oatly, almost nobody had heard of oat milk outside Sweden. The company was founded in 1994 by Rickard \u00d6ste, a researcher at the university of Lund. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good crop. You can grow oats everywhere,\u201d said Petersson. \u201cIt has carbs, it has fat, it has protein and it has fibre.\u201d Compared to oat milk, he said, almond is just \u201cflavoured plant juice\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68918b9b679db835ad5d762b0585edfd6c011fa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68918b9b679db835ad5d762b0585edfd6c011fa3/0_136_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Welcome to the cult\u2019 \u2026 an Oatly marketing image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Welcome to the cult\u2019 \u2026 an Oatly marketing campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oatly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Petersson, who is 50, with dark hair and slim features, set about reinventing oat milk\u2019s image. He hired John Schoolcraft, a marketing and advertising executive who had been running his own company, to help him. The concept, Schoolcraft said, was simple: \u201cIf you\u2019re not lactose intolerant, why would you notice our product?\u201d The pair redesigned its packaging, ditching its previous generic, 1990s aesthetic for a brash, millennial-friendly redesign: Oatly was restyled as Oat-ly! and the side of each carton displayed one of more than 80 messages written by Oatly staff, which congratulated readers on being part of the \u201cpost-milk generation\u201d and, only semi-ironically, joining \u201cthe cult\u201d.</p> <p>Oatly\u2019s real masterstroke was the creation of its Barista Edition. Most plant milks split in hot drinks \u2013 one reason that so many manufacturers use acidity regulators and other additives \u2013 and don\u2019t foam like cow\u2019s milk (the problem is the plant proteins). There, Oatly has an advantage: it foams, and the taste of oat is mostly masked by the coffee. Petersson and Schoolcraft ignored supermarkets and targeted coffee bars in the hip neighbourhoods of Brooklyn in New York and Shoreditch in London. \u201cThe volume comes from retail, but the demand is created in coffee shops,\u201d Petersson explained. \u201cThat\u2019s where you try our product and experience oat for the first time, in an environment that you like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt blew my hair back,\u201d said Stuart Forsyth, a former barista and the co-founder of vegan coffee brand Minor Figures. \u201cOatly made oats sexy.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Oatly\u2019s growth hasn\u2019t been without controversy. In 2015, the Swedish milk industry sued it, claiming its ad slogan \u201cLike milk, but made for humans\u201d unfairly denigrated cow\u2019s milk. Oatly lost, but Petersson and Schoolcraft continue to use the slogan outside Sweden. \u201cThe line implies what everyone already knows. Milk is produced by cows for the benefit of baby cows,\u201d said Schoolcraft.</p> <p>Whether or not plant milks really are a healthy substitute for cow\u2019s milk is a matter of fierce debate, and not an inconsequential one. In June 2017, a Belgian couple <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40274493\" title=\"\">were convicted</a> of unintentionally causing the death of their seven-month-old baby, after feeding him oat and quinoa milks instead of infant formula. The parents, who ran a health-food shop, believed the child was lactose intolerant and sought the advice of homeopaths rather than seeking medical attention.</p> <p>Much of the debate revolves around whether or not plant milks should be fortified with additional vitamins to better imitate cow\u2019s milk. Oatly fortifies its product according to WHO guidelines. Rude Health doesn\u2019t. \u201cThe minute you start fortifying, you\u2019re pretending it\u2019s milk,\u201d Camilla Barnard told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. It feels dishonest.\u201d Because the Soil Association refuses organic certification to fortified products, many new plant milks choose the \u201cpurity\u201d (and associated high price) of organic over the use of additional nutrients. Califia Farms\u2019 unsweetened almond milk boasts \u201c50% more calcium than milk\u201d on its bottle \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t contain Vitamin D, B12, Riboflavin or any of the other nutrients found in milk or other fortified plant milks.</p> <p>\u201cA consumer has to read the label and understand the variation that exists in these milks, because they range tremendously,\u201d said Dennis Savaiano, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University who has studied milk for more than 30 years.</p> <p>What most plant milks are desperate to tell you is what they don\u2019t have in them. Dairy-free; sugar-free; soya-free; gluten-free; GMO-free; bisphenol A-free \u2013 in some cases, the \u201cfree from\u201d declarations are actually longer than the ingredients list. Califia Farms boasts its products are carrageenan-free, despite the widely used stabiliser being approved as safe by the European commission, the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. It\u2019s the inevitable culmination of today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/11/why-we-fell-for-clean-eating\" title=\"\">anxious eating culture</a>: we\u2019ve gone from buying foods on the merits of their ingredients, to buying them on the basis of what\u2019s left out.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at our category, it\u2019s a little bit messed up, you know?\u201d Petersson conceded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the definition of an oat milk? Think of the comparison between oat milk and soya milk and almond or rice \u2013 are those all plant-based milks, or not? Nobody really knows.\u201d</p> <p>To protect against such uncertainty \u2013 and protect the dairy industry from the upstarts \u2013 a US senator from Wisconsin sponsored a bill in 2017 called the Dairy Pride (Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk and Cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday) Act, which would ban plant drinks from impersonating dairy.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is necessarily drinking milk for the nutritional benefits of it,\u201d said Tamara Arbib of Rebel Kitchen. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re having it because you want something creamy in your drinks.\u201d It is true that our postwar worries about child malnutrition have been replaced with fears about childhood obesity. And the two-thirds of the world that can\u2019t drink milk aren\u2019t suffering from osteoporosis or rickets; in fact, China and Japan have lower rates of these conditions than Europe.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of scientists think this thing about how children have to drink cow\u2019s milk is bogus. This idea that it makes you big and strong is clearly bogus,\u201d Mark Kurlansky, the food historian, told me. \u201cOn the other hand, this idea that \u2018milk is bad for you so I\u2019m going to have almond milk or soya milk or something\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s bogus, too. Because it\u2019s a totally different food.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Every nutritionist I spoke to emphasised that milk is no less healthy than it\u2019s ever been; in fact, it\u2019s never been safer. \u201cFrom a scientific perspective, the data that suggests milk is a bad food just doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Savaiano. \u201cIt has a lot of nutrients in it. It\u2019s a great source of calcium, it\u2019s a great source of protein, it\u2019s a good source of riboflavin and potassium. So you can\u2019t make the argument it\u2019s not a nutritious food.\u201d Nor could any health professional I spoke to point to any data showing a confirmed rise in diagnosed lactose intolerance, though most agreed that cases of self-diagnosis are rising.</p> <p>But the plant milk boom is not really about nutrition. Nor is it the first wave of a shift towards ethical, plant-based living \u2013 much as we need it. \u201cThose other things might be on people\u2019s lists, but they\u2019re secondary selling characteristics,\u201d explained Julian Mellentin, director of New Nutrition Business, a food industry analyst firm that has tracked plant milk\u2019s rise. He pointed out that 90% of plant milk buyers still purchase other dairy products, like cheese and ice cream, both of which are still growing. The forces driving us towards plant milk are really something bigger: a manifestation of a collective anxiety that something is wrong with our bodies. That we aren\u2019t as healthy and happy as we could be \u2013 or perhaps, should be \u2013 and something, or someone, must be to blame.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people discovering dairy intolerances and gluten intolerances and that kind of stuff, but actually I think what you\u2019re looking at is much more intolerance to the life we\u2019ve been living,\u201d said Arbib.</p> <p>Our growing suspicion of milk is perhaps a symptom of a lost faith: in Big Agriculture, in nutritional science. \u201cPeople have learned that dietary advice changes,\u201d Mellentin said. First saturated fat was killing us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin\" title=\"\">now sugar</a> is the number one enemy. Eggs and nuts were sources of bad cholesterol, now they\u2019re superfoods. \u201cSo, understandably, people have become sceptical,\u201d Mellentin went on. \u201cWhy listen to an expert when they change their mind all the time?\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that that is how science works. Science changes, so who\u2019s to say that your blood type doesn\u2019t affect your dairy tolerance, or that carrageenan wasn\u2019t the reason for some unspecified malaise? Just because our newfound lactose anxiety isn\u2019t necessarily medically diagnosable, Mellentin said, that doesn\u2019t mean it should be written off. \u201cIt\u2019s not to do with allergies. It\u2019s to do with how people feel, and making themselves feel better,\u201d he said. How can you argue with that?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/04/protein-mania-the-rich-worlds-new-diet-obsession\">Protein mania: the rich world\u2019s new diet obsession</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, Oatly has begun eyeing plant milk\u2019s next target: China. It launched in the country in 2016, after receiving an undisclosed investment from a Chinese conglomerate. Sales have been promising. Demand for milk in China is growing, and Chinese businesses are investing heavily in plant milk and lactose-free alternatives. To Oatly, conquering China is more than business, it\u2019s an ethical obligation. \u201cThe worst thing that could happen [environmentally] is if the Chinese people started to drink dairy milk, because there wouldn\u2019t be enough cows in the world to support that,\u201d said Toni Petersson, the CEO. The company\u2019s latest challenge is competition: Quaker has announced plans for a line of oat drinks, and in January Silk launched its own oat brand, Oat Yeah. \u201cWe think oats can become its own category,\u201d Petersson said.</p> <p>Other plant milk entrepreneurs were more cautious. Everyone knows how quickly health-food hype \u2013 juice cleanses, coconut oil \u2013 can die off.

      "bodyText": "In the spring of 2018, New York was gripped by a sudden, very particular and, for some, calamitous food shortage. Gaps appeared on grocery shelves. Coffee shops put out signs, turning customers away. Twitter and Instagram brimmed with outrage. The truly desperate searched from Williamsburg to Harlem, but it seemed undeniable: New York was out of oat milk. It wasn\u2019t just New York, in fact. The entire US was suffering from a shortage of Oatly, a Swedish plant milk whose rapid rise from obscure digestive health brand to the dairy alternative of choice had caught even Oatly by surprise. Since its US launch in 2016, Oatly had gone from supplying a handful of upscale New York coffee shops to more than 3,000 cafes and grocery stores nationwide. The company had ramped up production by 1,250%, but when I spoke to CEO Toni Petersson in late summer, they were still struggling to meet demand. \u201cHow do we supply when the growth is this crazy?\u201d Petersson said. Fortunately, when it comes to milk, in 2019 there is no shortage of alternative alternatives. Visit your local supermarket and you will find a refrigerated aisle overflowing with choice: almond milk, hazelnut milk, peanut, tiger nut, walnut, cashew \u2013 and that\u2019s just the nuts. Coconut, hemp, spelt, quinoa, pea \u2013 you name it, somewhere a health-food startup is milking it. London tube stations are filled with ads for new plant milks \u2013 or rather, \u201cmylks\u201d (EU law prevents dairy alternatives from using the word milk if it isn\u2019t produced by a lactating mammal). Cookbooks dedicate entire chapters to blending and straining your own. Sainsbury\u2019s now stocks around 70 different options. There are the wellness punks (Rebel Kitchen, Rude Health), the dairy puns (Malk, Milkadamia, Mooala) and the nourishers (LoveRaw, Good Karma, Plenish). \u201cPeople are just looking at every nut that exists and seeing if they can squash it into a milk,\u201d said Glynis Murray, one of the owners of Good, which squashes hemp seeds into oil and milk. It seems unthinkable now, but as recently as 2008, alternatives to cow\u2019s milk largely meant soya (invariably Alpro in the UK, Silk in the US). For anything else, you\u2019d need to scour health-food shops for drab, clinical-looking, long-life cartons of rice milk buried in the back with the other digestive aids. \u201cIt was the deathly aisle,\u201d said John Schoolcraft, Oatly\u2019s global creative director. \u201cIt was just for people who were lactose intolerant [or] had an allergy to milk; vegans, vegetarians \u2013 people who, at that time, were on the fringe of society.\u201d Plant milks are no longer fringe. Just over one in 10 of Pret a Manger\u2019s hot drinks in the UK are ordered with dairy alternative milks (organic soya milk or organic rice-coconut milk). According to research firm Mintel, UK plant milk sales have grown by 30% since 2015, buoyed by a surge in vegan and vegetarian diets. In the US, nearly half of all shoppers now add a plant milk to their baskets. Globally, the industry is estimated to be worth $16bn. Meanwhile, reduced demand for cow\u2019s milk and falling prices led to the closure of 1,000 dairy farms in the UK between 2013 and 2016. Milk\u2019s reputation as a healthy food is under threat from anxieties about bovine antibiotics, animal cruelty and the industry\u2019s environmental impact, as well as increased diagnosis of lactose intolerance. Teenagers now consider cow\u2019s milk less healthy than plant milk alternatives, a development the former chairman of Dairy UK, David Dobbin, called \u201ca demographic time bomb\u201d. \u201cConsumers are really not sure about the dairy industry,\u201d Caroline Roux, a dairy analyst at Mintel, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not convinced these products are good for them any more.\u201d But the plant milk boom is, as one entrepreneur told me, \u201cway bigger than just switching your milk\u201d. To converts, almond and oat milk are the next wave in a fundamental shift towards a more conscious, sustainable way of living. To critics, they\u2019re little more than cleverly marketed nut juice with additives \u2013 a symptom of everything that\u2019s wrong with modern food culture. And so a strange battle has emerged, between an industry trying to replace something it says we don\u2019t need in the first place, and dairy, a business that for a century sold itself as the foundation of a healthy diet, while ignoring the fact that most of the world does just fine without it. * * * We are all born milk drinkers. Babies\u2019 guts produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, the sugar in breastmilk (and cow\u2019s milk), into the simpler sugars glucose and galactose. But for the majority of humans, production of the enzyme lactase plummets after weaning. \u201cFrom a human perspective \u2013 no, to go further than that, from a mammalian perspective \u2013 the norm is to be able to tolerate your mother\u2019s breast milk, and then as you get past infancy, to stop producing lactase and become lactose intolerant,\u201d said Adam Fox, a consultant paediatric allergist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s hospitals, and one of the UK\u2019s leading food allergy experts. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got a small group of humans that have a mutation which means they maintain production of lactase into adulthood. Northern Europeans, the Masai [in east Africa], some Arab groups as well. But that\u2019s the exception, not the rule.\u201d That schism between milk-drinkers and the rest \u2013 actually a series of independent genetic mutations \u2013 appears to have occurred about 10,000 years ago, around the time humans were domesticating farm animals. It is the reason that in countries such as the UK, Sweden and Ireland, more than 90% of adults can drink milk without suffering any ill effects, but worldwide, more than two-thirds of all adults are considered lactose intolerant. For lactose-intolerant people, a glass of milk can induce bloating, stomach pains and diarrhoea. (Lactose intolerance should not be \u2013 though often is \u2013 confused with cow\u2019s milk allergy, an immune response to the proteins in cow\u2019s milk that affects around 1% of UK adults.) Even in northern Europe, milk as we know it is a recent phenomenon. Fresh milk, left unrefrigerated, spoils quickly and can harbour a variety of deadly pathogens, including E Coli and tuberculosis. For most of history it was either consumed within moments of milking, or processed as cheese or yoghurt. Few drunk milk in its liquid form. \u201cThe Romans considered it a sign of barbarism,\u201d said Mark Kurlansky, author of Milk! A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. \u201cThe only people who drank milk were people on farms, because they were the only ones who could get it fresh enough.\u201d (Even then, cow\u2019s milk was considered inferior to alternatives such as goat or donkey.) In the 19th century, \u201cswill milk\u201d \u2013 so called because cows were fed the filthy runoff from inner-city breweries, turning their milk blue \u2013 was linked with thousands of infant deaths. Only in the early 20th century, with the introduction of mandatory pasteurisation \u2013 in which milk is heated to kill off any bacteria before bottling \u2013 did milk become safe enough for most people to drink regularly. It was the first world war that ultimately aligned political forces behind the dairy business. In Britain, rationing meant food was limited, and child malnutrition was rife. The emerging field of nutritional science identified milk \u2013 with its high protein content and newly discovered \u201cvital amines\u201d, or vitamins \u2013 as a potential solution. Thanks to government price controls, milk was one thing not in short supply. Soon, \u201cconsumers everywhere witnessed a snowfall of propaganda documenting the miracles worked by milk\u201d, writes Deborah Valenze in Milk: A Local and Global History. Milk became the original superfood: a boundless source of calcium, protein and vitamins. In 1946, Clement Attlee and Harry S Truman\u2019s governments both passed measures to ensure milk was available free with school meals. Industry alliances like the UK\u2019s Milk Marketing Board embarked on campaigns to enhance milk\u2019s image. More recently, in the US, the Got Milk? campaign showed celebrities from Beyonc\u00e9 to Kermit the Frog with milk moustaches. The message was clear: if you wanted your children to grow up big and strong, they needed to be drinking milk. Today, dairy is a vast and highly regulated behemoth, worth more than $400bn, produced by a global herd of more than 274 million cows. Politicians mess with milk at their peril (when Margaret Thatcher, as education secretary, in 1971 took the draconian step of cutting free school milk for the over-sevens, she was branded \u201cmilk snatcher\u201d). And yet, for many consumers, the allure of milk is on the wane. In 1975, the average American consumed 247 pounds (around 130 litres) of milk per year; in 2017, it was just 149 pounds (66 litres). In the US, milk sales have fallen 15% since 2012. Milk\u2019s \u201cshare of throat\u201d \u2013 an industry term for the proportion of total liquid we consume in a day \u2013 has been eroded by a steady flow of soft drinks, juices and smoothies, even bottled water. But none of these presented an existential threat. Blanket marketing established the connection between milk and wholesomeness and good nutrition. Now new forms of persuasion, more targeted and pervasive, have stripped away that healthy sheen from dairy. The internet has given animal rights activists new reach. Search for \u201cdairy\u201d on YouTube and you will be assaulted by videos with titles like Dairy Is Scary (5m views), which depicts in graphic detail the suffering of dairy cows. Netflix, too, has provided previously untapped audiences for documentaries like Cowspiracy and What the Health. Besides the ill-treatment of animals, evidence has mounted that the dairy industry is catastrophic for the environment. Animal agriculture contributes more greenhouse gases than aviation, shipping and road vehicles combined. One recent study led by Oxford University claimed that observing a vegetarian or vegan diet is the single most effective way to reduce your own environmental footprint. Plant milks received a boost from their association with clean eating, a craze that has also had the effect of linking dairy with negative health issues. Clean eating, advocated by a fresh-skinned, glossy crop of wellness bloggers and Instagram celebrities, argued for the elimination of any foods deemed overly processed, allergenic, or otherwise \u201cunnatural\u201d: gluten, caffeine, meat and dairy. Its proponents blamed lactose intolerance as the cause of a range of ailments, including acne, eczema, lethargy, joint pain and a variety of digestive issues. And, as the clean eaters warned their readers off dairy, they sent them into the willing arms of plant milk startups. A steady supply of attractive millennial influencers filled their Instagram feeds with appetising shots of peanut-milk Thai curries and gluten-free beetroot bread. (According to industry analysts, one of the keys to the plant-based trend is that it looks appetising on Instagram.) The clean eaters did what years of vegan campaigning never could. Suddenly, giving up milk wasn\u2019t just a health issue. It was part of living your best and most beautiful life. * * * The notion of milking plants is not new. In China, soya milk has been made since at least the 14th century, most commonly as a step in making tofu. The earliest written mention of almond milk appears in a Baghdadi cookbook from 1226, the Kitab al-Tabikh. \u201cIf you look at Medieval recipes, they will often give you a choice between milk or almond milk,\u201d said Mark Kurlansky (whose best-seller Cod: A Biography, launched an entire genre of food microhistories). In the west, until recently, almond and soya milk remained relatively unknown, except by vegetarians and the odd eccentric (Henry Ford, of the car company, was an early soya evangelist). In 1956, the Plantmilk Society was established in London by Leslie Cross, then vice-president of the British Vegan Society, a nascent group of animal rights activists. Cross, who particularly objected to the cruelty of the dairy industry, set about trying to find a dairy replacement using crops that could be grown in Britain. \u201cThe big issue originally was: how do you get a protein in a liquid that can emulate dairy milk?\u201d said Adrian Ling, whose father, Arthur, was chair of the new organisation. Photos from the time show the smiling pioneers in white lab coats examining many glasses of questionable opaque liquids. \u201cThey did a lot of work on cabbage,\u201d Ling said. Eventually, they settled on the soya bean. \u201cIt was a very small market \u2013 a few hundred people,\u201d said Ling. \u201cThey lost a lot of money.\u201d In 1981, a young Belgian food tech named Philippe Vandemoortele decided to use a new packing technology, the sterile Tetra Brik, to sell soya milk. \u201cI started in a garage with pots and pans, a grinder. I was young, and very naive,\u201d Vandemoortele, now 73, told me. He called his soya milk Alpro. Reviews were mixed. The local supermarket refused to stock it. \u201cThe buyer tasted my product, and he said: \u2018Whoa. It\u2019s awful!\u2019\u201d But Vandemoortele persisted. Today Alpro is owned by Danone, and in 2017 had a turnover in excess of \u00a3183m. Soya\u2019s real break came in the late 90s, when a Colorado soya company called WhiteWave made what seems like a confoundingly obvious discovery: if they moved the product to the refrigerated aisle alongside the dairy milk, more people bought it. WhiteWave\u2019s new refrigerated soya drink, which it called Silk, was a sensation. At the same time, Silk, Alpro and others jumped on emerging evidence about the link between high cholesterol and heart disease to market themselves as a healthy alternative. All of a sudden, soya was for everyone. Soya\u2019s rapid growth was short-lived, in large part due to the fact that it doesn\u2019t taste very good. Even modern soya milks, which add sugar, thickeners and other additives to imitate dairy milk, have a beany taste and odour. In the early 2000s, soya had its own health scare. Soya contains phytoestrogens, oestrogen-like compounds that can mimic the hormone\u2019s effects in humans, a discovery that led to fears about it disrupting hormones and \u201cfeminising\u201d men. Clinical studies have consistently shown those fears are overstated. Even so, neo-Nazis continue to push the theory that soya milk is a liberal conspiracy to emasculate men, and drink cow\u2019s milk at rallies to demonstrate \u201cdigestive superiority\u201d. In 2008, the Blue Diamond Growers, a large cooperative of almond farmers in California, sensed an opportunity. Its milk, Almond Breeze, had long lagged behind Silk, by then America\u2019s leading soya brand. \u201cWe knew if we were wanting to compete with them, we would need to be in the refrigerated case,\u201d Al Greenlee, Blue Diamond\u2019s director of marketing, told me. Supermarkets maintain a tight grip on shelf space, charging high fees to stock a new product. Lucrative, high-traffic displays like the refrigerated case are fiercely competitive. The owners of Silk at that time \u2013 the dairy giant Dean Foods \u2013 had leveraged its industry clout to get Silk positioned alongside milk. \u201cSo we followed a similar path, and established a partnership with the second largest dairy in the country\u201d. Blue Diamond started in Florida, targeting neighbourhoods with large Hispanic populations, who have a higher genetic incidence of lactose intolerance. Meanwhile, the California almond industry embarked on a vast marketing spree, funding \u2013 and publicising \u2013 new research into the health benefits of almonds. The effect was immediate. Glossy magazines proclaimed almonds a \u201csuperfood\u201d. Almond Breeze was so successful that within two years Silk launched its own almond milk to try and keep up. By 2013, almond had overtaken soya as the best-selling plant milk in the US. * * * In today\u2019s crowded market, newcomers require something special to stand out. An Australian milk called Nutty Bruce boasts of \u201cactivated almonds\u201d, which is a nod to the current craze for charcoal (superheated and then oxidised, \u201cactivated\u201d charcoal is marketed as a detoxifier), but at closer inspection just means the almonds are soaked in water for slightly longer than usual. A San Francisco startup called Ripple claims to have developed a hi-tech process to isolate the protein in yellow peas without any of the associated flavours or colourings. Cheryl Mitchell, the chief scientist of the New York-based producer Elmhurst Milked, told me excitedly about her patented extraction process, which uses \u201chigh-pressure water and a sloughing action\u201d to break down nuts and pulses while keeping the proteins intact. Mitchell comes from an esteemed line of food technologists: her father, Bill, invented Cool Whip imitation cream, the Pop Rocks popping candy and Tang fruit-flavoured drink. In the 1980s, she helped develop Rice Dream. Elmhurst was a dairy for 90 years; at its peak, it supplied public schools and Starbucks branches across Manhattan. But in 2016, its owners sold off the cattle and switched to plant milk. It now sells 11 varieties. \u201cWait till they see the corn milk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s yellow, but it has more antioxidants than blueberries!\u201d It seems every ingredient has its acolytes. \u201cWe are here to spread a philosophy about a way of being, one which is much more harmonious and symbiotic with nature,\u201d Tamara Arbib, the founder of London-based coconut drinks company Rebel Kitchen, told me. Rebel Kitchen\u2019s Mylk, launched in 2014, is a blend of coconut, rice and cashew. \u201cI\u2019m a massive fan of eating right for your blood type,\u201d Arbib said. \u201cA lot of blood types do better without dairy.\u201d In July, I went to see one of the UK\u2019s most prominent plant milk startups, Rude Health, in London. Launched by Camilla and Nick Barnard in 2005, Rude Health started out selling muesli, but quickly grew into a small health food empire. It was the tail end of a heatwave, at brunch time, and the Rude Health Cafe hummed with healthy looking professionals sipping cashew lattes. Nick, who has sharp features, grey hair, and wore an open-collared white shirt, ordered a kombucha. \u201cI\u2019m having dairy,\u201d Camilla said, conspiratorially. Rude Health had attracted negative press in 2017, after some vegans became incensed at a company blogpost promoting sustainable dairy. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t crossed our minds that to be for dairy free, we were expected to be against dairy,\u201d Camilla said. \u201cWe were just chugging along, thinking we were for good quality.\u201d The episode had made them reconsider their marketing strategy, to clarify that they\u2019re not an exclusively vegan brand. \u201cWhy does everything have to be the magic pill, or the devil? Why do you have to be for or against?\u201d Rude Health got into plant milks in 2013, selling three flavours: oat, brown rice and almond. Today, it sells 10, including Tiger Nut, Cashew and Hazelnut &amp; Cacao. We walked over to the company\u2019s offices nearby for a tasting session. Rival products and plant-based cookbooks lined the shelves. Nick poured shots of various shades of beige into small glasses. Many plant milk brands add calcium carbonate \u2013 chalk \u2013 to make the liquid whiter and more opaque (the calcium content is a happy bonus) but the colouring in these plant milks, Camilla assured me, was natural. We tried a few. The coconut was sweet, like a Bounty dissolved in water. The hazelnut was pleasingly thick, if slightly overwhelming. \u201cTondo Gentile,\u201d Nick said, approvingly. \u201cA gourmet hazelnut.\u201d The almond tasted thin by comparison. The brand\u2019s regular Almond Drink contains brown rice, \u201ccold-pressed\u201d sunflower oil and sea salt, but Rude Health also offers Ultimate Almond \u2013 just nuts and water \u2013 intended for purists. \u201cThere is a hardcore market,\u201d Camilla said. Today, almond makes up around two thirds of all plant milks sold, but it is suffering its own reputational crisis. One issue is environmental: it takes 4.5 litres of water to grow a single almond (technically not a nut, but a seed). In California, which grows eight in 10 of the world\u2019s almond crop, almond growing consumes an estimated 10% of the entire water supply \u2013 a controversial issue in a state often afflicted by drought. Consumers have also caught on that the actual almond content of most almond milks is minuscule. Both Silk and Alpro contain just 2% almonds. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a water-based emulsion that you\u2019re adding oils, a lot of sugar and gums to, and then just adding a couple of nuts on top,\u201d Elmhurst\u2019s Cheryl Mitchell said. \u201cAs a business model, it\u2019s great \u2013 any time you can sell water, right? That\u2019s essentially what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The industry insiders I spoke to agreed that almond\u2019s moment is over. Right now the real growth is in coconut, and in oat. In 2012, when Petersson took over as CEO of Oatly, almost nobody had heard of oat milk outside Sweden. The company was founded in 1994 by Rickard \u00d6ste, a researcher at the university of Lund. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good crop. You can grow oats everywhere,\u201d said Petersson. \u201cIt has carbs, it has fat, it has protein and it has fibre.\u201d Compared to oat milk, he said, almond is just \u201cflavoured plant juice\u201d. Petersson, who is 50, with dark hair and slim features, set about reinventing oat milk\u2019s image. He hired John Schoolcraft, a marketing and advertising executive who had been running his own company, to help him. The concept, Schoolcraft said, was simple: \u201cIf you\u2019re not lactose intolerant, why would you notice our product?\u201d The pair redesigned its packaging, ditching its previous generic, 1990s aesthetic for a brash, millennial-friendly redesign: Oatly was restyled as Oat-ly! and the side of each carton displayed one of more than 80 messages written by Oatly staff, which congratulated readers on being part of the \u201cpost-milk generation\u201d and, only semi-ironically, joining \u201cthe cult\u201d. Oatly\u2019s real masterstroke was the creation of its Barista Edition. Most plant milks split in hot drinks \u2013 one reason that so many manufacturers use acidity regulators and other additives \u2013 and don\u2019t foam like cow\u2019s milk (the problem is the plant proteins). There, Oatly has an advantage: it foams, and the taste of oat is mostly masked by the coffee. Petersson and Schoolcraft ignored supermarkets and targeted coffee bars in the hip neighbourhoods of Brooklyn in New York and Shoreditch in London. \u201cThe volume comes from retail, but the demand is created in coffee shops,\u201d Petersson explained. \u201cThat\u2019s where you try our product and experience oat for the first time, in an environment that you like.\u201d \u201cIt blew my hair back,\u201d said Stuart Forsyth, a former barista and the co-founder of vegan coffee brand Minor Figures. \u201cOatly made oats sexy.\u201d * * * Oatly\u2019s growth hasn\u2019t been without controversy. In 2015, the Swedish milk industry sued it, claiming its ad slogan \u201cLike milk, but made for humans\u201d unfairly denigrated cow\u2019s milk. Oatly lost, but Petersson and Schoolcraft continue to use the slogan outside Sweden. \u201cThe line implies what everyone already knows. Milk is produced by cows for the benefit of baby cows,\u201d said Schoolcraft. Whether or not plant milks really are a healthy substitute for cow\u2019s milk is a matter of fierce debate, and not an inconsequential one. In June 2017, a Belgian couple were convicted of unintentionally causing the death of their seven-month-old baby, after feeding him oat and quinoa milks instead of infant formula. The parents, who ran a health-food shop, believed the child was lactose intolerant and sought the advice of homeopaths rather than seeking medical attention. Much of the debate revolves around whether or not plant milks should be fortified with additional vitamins to better imitate cow\u2019s milk. Oatly fortifies its product according to WHO guidelines. Rude Health doesn\u2019t. \u201cThe minute you start fortifying, you\u2019re pretending it\u2019s milk,\u201d Camilla Barnard told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. It feels dishonest.\u201d Because the Soil Association refuses organic certification to fortified products, many new plant milks choose the \u201cpurity\u201d (and associated high price) of organic over the use of additional nutrients. Califia Farms\u2019 unsweetened almond milk boasts \u201c50% more calcium than milk\u201d on its bottle \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t contain Vitamin D, B12, Riboflavin or any of the other nutrients found in milk or other fortified plant milks. \u201cA consumer has to read the label and understand the variation that exists in these milks, because they range tremendously,\u201d said Dennis Savaiano, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University who has studied milk for more than 30 years. What most plant milks are desperate to tell you is what they don\u2019t have in them. Dairy-free; sugar-free; soya-free; gluten-free; GMO-free; bisphenol A-free \u2013 in some cases, the \u201cfree from\u201d declarations are actually longer than the ingredients list. Califia Farms boasts its products are carrageenan-free, despite the widely used stabiliser being approved as safe by the European commission, the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. It\u2019s the inevitable culmination of today\u2019s anxious eating culture: we\u2019ve gone from buying foods on the merits of their ingredients, to buying them on the basis of what\u2019s left out. \u201cIf you look at our category, it\u2019s a little bit messed up, you know?\u201d Petersson conceded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the definition of an oat milk? Think of the comparison between oat milk and soya milk and almond or rice \u2013 are those all plant-based milks, or not? Nobody really knows.\u201d To protect against such uncertainty \u2013 and protect the dairy industry from the upstarts \u2013 a US senator from Wisconsin sponsored a bill in 2017 called the Dairy Pride (Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk and Cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday) Act, which would ban plant drinks from impersonating dairy. \u201cNo one is necessarily drinking milk for the nutritional benefits of it,\u201d said Tamara Arbib of Rebel Kitchen. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019re having it because you want something creamy in your drinks.\u201d It is true that our postwar worries about child malnutrition have been replaced with fears about childhood obesity. And the two-thirds of the world that can\u2019t drink milk aren\u2019t suffering from osteoporosis or rickets; in fact, China and Japan have lower rates of these conditions than Europe. \u201cA lot of scientists think this thing about how children have to drink cow\u2019s milk is bogus. This idea that it makes you big and strong is clearly bogus,\u201d Mark Kurlansky, the food historian, told me. \u201cOn the other hand, this idea that \u2018milk is bad for you so I\u2019m going to have almond milk or soya milk or something\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s bogus, too. Because it\u2019s a totally different food.\u201d * * * Every nutritionist I spoke to emphasised that milk is no less healthy than it\u2019s ever been; in fact, it\u2019s never been safer. \u201cFrom a scientific perspective, the data that suggests milk is a bad food just doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Savaiano. \u201cIt has a lot of nutrients in it. It\u2019s a great source of calcium, it\u2019s a great source of protein, it\u2019s a good source of riboflavin and potassium. So you can\u2019t make the argument it\u2019s not a nutritious food.\u201d Nor could any health professional I spoke to point to any data showing a confirmed rise in diagnosed lactose intolerance, though most agreed that cases of self-diagnosis are rising. But the plant milk boom is not really about nutrition. Nor is it the first wave of a shift towards ethical, plant-based living \u2013 much as we need it. \u201cThose other things might be on people\u2019s lists, but they\u2019re secondary selling characteristics,\u201d explained Julian Mellentin, director of New Nutrition Business, a food industry analyst firm that has tracked plant milk\u2019s rise. He pointed out that 90% of plant milk buyers still purchase other dairy products, like cheese and ice cream, both of which are still growing. The forces driving us towards plant milk are really something bigger: a manifestation of a collective anxiety that something is wrong with our bodies. That we aren\u2019t as healthy and happy as we could be \u2013 or perhaps, should be \u2013 and something, or someone, must be to blame. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people discovering dairy intolerances and gluten intolerances and that kind of stuff, but actually I think what you\u2019re looking at is much more intolerance to the life we\u2019ve been living,\u201d said Arbib. Our growing suspicion of milk is perhaps a symptom of a lost faith: in Big Agriculture, in nutritional science. \u201cPeople have learned that dietary advice changes,\u201d Mellentin said. First saturated fat was killing us, now sugar is the number one enemy. Eggs and nuts were sources of bad cholesterol, now they\u2019re superfoods. \u201cSo, understandably, people have become sceptical,\u201d Mellentin went on. \u201cWhy listen to an expert when they change their mind all the time?\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter that that is how science works. Science changes, so who\u2019s to say that your blood type doesn\u2019t affect your dairy tolerance, or that carrageenan wasn\u2019t the reason for some unspecified malaise? Just because our newfound lactose anxiety isn\u2019t necessarily medically diagnosable, Mellentin said, that doesn\u2019t mean it should be written off. \u201cIt\u2019s not to do with allergies. It\u2019s to do with how people feel, and making themselves feel better,\u201d he said. How can you argue with that? Recently, Oatly has begun eyeing plant milk\u2019s next target: China. It launched in the country in 2016, after receiving an undisclosed investment from a Chinese conglomerate. Sales have been promising. Demand for milk in China is growing, and Chinese businesses are investing heavily in plant milk and lactose-free alternatives. To Oatly, conquering China is more than business, it\u2019s an ethical obligation. \u201cThe worst thing that could happen [environmentally] is if the Chinese people started to drink dairy milk, because there wouldn\u2019t be enough cows in the world to support that,\u201d said Toni Petersson, the CEO. The company\u2019s latest challenge is competition: Quaker has announced plans for a line of oat drinks, and in January Silk launched its own oat brand, Oat Yeah. \u201cWe think oats can become its own category,\u201d Petersson said. Other plant milk entrepreneurs were more cautious. Everyone knows how quickly health-food hype \u2013 juice cleanses, coconut oil \u2013 can die off. Meanwhile, kombucha is gaining ground as the gut-friendly food cure of the moment. Mellentin was blunt: \u201cPeak plant milk is about three to five years away, at most.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 January 2019.

      "bodyText": "The art of the street demo has a long and venerable tradition in France, but the era of the colour wars may be only just beginning. What started with guerrilla blockades of roundabouts by the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) in opposition to French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s new fuel tax has led to weekly marches in Paris and across France, some ending in violent stand-offs between protesters and the police. On Saturday, for \u201cAct XI\u201d (the rather portentous title given to the 11th protest) the yellow vests numbered 69,000 across France and 4,500 in Paris. Although down from the previous week, with 84,000 nationwide, the figures were higher than in December. The next day, it was the turn of the foulards rouges, or red scarves. Their \u201cRepublican march for the liberties\u201d drew about 10,000 people on to the Parisian streets. The choice of red had nothing to do with the French left. Many scarf-wearers complained that the activities of the gilets jaunes prevented them from enjoying a Saturday outside or doing their shopping. Their chants were pro-police and pro-Macron. When the gilets jaunes were outnumbered on the streets of the capital by an unofficial \u201cleave us in peace\u201d brigade, it was a sign that the movement which started with roundabouts was at a crossroads. What were they for, what should their tactics be, and how could they keep up the levels of popular support that placed Macron so firmly on the back foot? A crunch moment is coming. Last week, controversially, a branch of the gilets jaunes announced it would run for the European elections under the label \u201ccitizen-led rally\u201d. A list of 79 candidates will be published by mid-February. The age and professions of the 10 known candidates vary widely. They are small business owners, drivers, stay-at-home parents and civil servants. They range from 29 to 53 years old. For now they have no clear programme, but the mood music is more of the left than the right. Le Pen-style anti-immigration rhetoric is not part of their anti-elite pitch. \u201cThe citizen social movement born on 17 November shows the necessity to turn anger into a humane political project that will bring answers to the French people,\u201d read one statement. \u201cWe, French citizens, do not want to endure the decisions of European institutions and diktats of technocrats and financial castes, who have forgotten the human factor, solidarity and the planet.\u201d Top of the candidates\u2019 list is Ingrid Levavasseur, a nursing assistant and single mother from Normandy. Levavasseur became a well-known gilets jaunes spokesperson after a TV show in which she detailed her everyday financial difficulties and found she had touched a chord: \u201cI thought I was an isolated case, but I see how everyone suffers. The nurses, the sick, the unemployed, the hauliers \u2026\u201d She is not the only one to be enthusiastic about entering politics: Jacline Mouraud, whose Facebook video condemning the fuel tax went viral in November, is launching a party too. It won\u2019t run for the European elections, but she has hopes for the 2020 local elections. But the would-be political wing is viewed with contempt by the gilets jaunes radicals, who remain devotees of a more grassroots democratic style combined with new types of protest designed to capture the imagination, such as the first \u201cyellow night\u201d at the weekend (a sit-in on Paris\u2019s Place de la Republique). As the various factions contend, the danger is that the organised chaos of the early protests becomes just, well, chaos. Since the new year, the gilets jaunes have developed wildly divergent strategies. Some weekly marches are declared while others happen on the spot.

      "body": "<p>Noemie Lopian, a 52-year-old <a href=\"https://www.holocaustmatters.org\" title=\"\">Holocaust educator</a>, grew up in Munich and Manchester hardly speaking about the Holocaust, even though both of her parents were in it. Her French mother, <a href=\"https://www.hmd.org.uk/resource/renee-bornstein/\" title=\"\">Renee</a>, was questioned at gunpoint by the Gestapo at the age of 10 and imprisoned in the Prison du Pax in Annemasse, on the border between France and Switzerland. She was saved by the town\u2019s lord mayor, <a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/deffaugt.html\" title=\"\">Jean Deffaugt</a>, who persuaded the Gestapo to release the youngest children into his care, and the resistance fighter <a href=\"http://www.projetaladin.org/holocaust/en/poetry-corner/i-shall-betray-tomorrow-marianne-cohn.html\" title=\"\">Marianne Cohn</a>, who rescued at least 200 Jewish children during the war by smuggling them out of France\u2019s occupied zone.</p> <p>Lopian\u2019s Polish father, Dr Ernst Israel Bornstein, was arrested at 18 and moved between seven concentration camps during the war, enduring a number of long death marches. He was liberated near Munich by American soldiers on 30 April 1945.</p> <p>Derek Niemann, 57, lives in Bedfordshire and is a writer, teacher and contributor to the Guardian\u2019s country diary. Niemann knew nothing about his connection to the Holocaust until he was 49, when he found out, to his shock, that his paternal grandfather, Karl Niemann, was a Nazi war criminal.</p> <p>Last weekend, on Holocaust Memorial Day, it emerged that one in 20 Britons believe the Holocaust never happened, and one 12 think its scale has been exaggerated. Niemann and Bornstein now travel the country together and give talks about their different experiences, in the hope it will stem the tide of Holocaust denialism, and to educate people about antisemitism.</p> <p><strong>Derek, what did you grow up knowing about your grandfather?</strong><br><strong>Derek:</strong> He died the year before I was born, but my father had always said his father was a lowly official in a bank; a pen pusher. Then, my dad\u2019s sister died and it was like something opened up in him. I learned that my father had spent the entire war in Berlin, and the family had escaped into the Alps at the end of the war. The next breakthrough came when I was going to Berlin, and I found out the address of where my father had grown up. From that, I learned that my grandfather was in the SS and was convicted of crimes against humanity and the use of slave labour. I immediately started burrowing in Holocaust and SS archives. I learned that he\u2019d joined the Nazi party pretty early on, and, when he lost his job, he was recruited to the SS. At first, he was an auditor, and he worked his way up to become a business owner using the slave labour of concentration camps. He was going round to the camps and making sure they had supplies to keep working. I think he was a mediocrity who suddenly had a uniform and a chauffeur, and he thought he had to be loyal to the people who raised him up. The nonentities got to the top then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4272808b7995f97490e70ce3bfd0de602130d9d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4272808b7995f97490e70ce3bfd0de602130d9d5/0_149_780_975/400.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Niemann\u2019s grandfather, Karl Niemann, in the summer of 1944.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Niemann\u2019s grandfather, Karl Niemann, in the summer of 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Derek Niemann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Was he punished after the war?</strong><br><strong>Derek: </strong>Oh yes. He was captured by the US army on the day war ended in Europe, 8 May 1945, and imprisoned in the former prisoner of war camps at Moosburg, Bavaria, and Sandbostel near Bremen. He was released three years later.</p> <p><strong>And how did the two of you meet?</strong><br><strong>Noemie:</strong> I\u2019d heard about Derek after <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/a-nazi-in-the-family/derek-niemann/9781780723716\" title=\"\">he wrote a book about his grandfather</a>, and was very keen to meet him. We finally met when he was giving a talk in a synagogue. I\u2019d heard another grandson of a Nazi speak and I didn\u2019t take to him at all. It wasn\u2019t an intellectual reaction, it was an emotional one, which I hadn\u2019t expected. But when I heard Derek speak, I knew I would feel comfortable with him.</p> <p><strong>Why were you so keen to meet a grandchild of a Nazi?</strong><br><strong>Noemie:</strong> I felt, with my past, I could either ignore it or embrace it, and if I was going to embrace it I should be proactive in whatever little way I can. I wanted to learn. Also, it\u2019s hard to get people to listen to just me \u2013 I\u2019m not a celebrity, I\u2019m just a Jewish woman, and in the current political climate you feel as if you\u2019re going to be dismissed as just another stroppy Jew. But I felt with the two of us, more people would listen.<br><strong>Derek:</strong> We gave a talk last week, and at the beginning everyone made eye contact with Noemie, but some could barely look at me. At the end, though, they were coming up and hugging me and shaking me by the hand. I realised that they can\u2019t accept my family, but they recognise my desire to bridge the differences between us.<br><strong>Noemie:</strong> I feel that at our talks people are much more fascinated with Derek. They\u2019ve heard my kind of stories before.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s true \u2026 I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of children of Holocaust survivors, but never </strong><strong>someone who </strong><strong>describes himself as a grandchild of a Nazi.</strong><br><strong>Derek:</strong> Yes, there aren\u2019t many of us around! I don\u2019t want to self-aggrandise, but at times I feel like Andy Murray talking about feminism \u2013 it\u2019s easy for some people to dismiss women calling out sexism, but it\u2019s harder when it comes from a man.<br><strong>Noemie:</strong> And that\u2019s why I think Derek\u2019s story is so powerful. People are used now to hearing Jews talk about antisemitism and the Holocaust, but when it comes from someone with Derek\u2019s background they\u2019re like, wow! And, of course, he has a much tougher job than me because he has to acknowledge the love he has for his father, and even his grandfather, while also talking about what they did. It\u2019s a far greater dichotomy than what I have.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"629c72945757129b9fa0a0e86ae64af6ab0d001d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/629c72945757129b9fa0a0e86ae64af6ab0d001d/0_281_779_467/500.jpg\" alt=\"Noemie (second from left) with her parents, her brother, Alain, and sister, Muriel, in 1976.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noemie (second from left) with her parents, her brother, Alain, and sister, Muriel, in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Noemie Lopian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Did it affect how you see yourself, Derek, knowing that such a close relative </strong><strong>did these terrible things?</strong><br><strong>Derek: </strong>I think there was a lot of guilt in the beginning, and that may have been why I wrote about it and reached out so much to the Jewish community. But I know that my grandfather is not me, and I am empowered to \u2026 not make up for what he did, but at least use his story for, hopefully, a good purpose.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever think about how your parents and grandparents would feel about </strong><strong>you two becoming friends?</strong><br><strong>Derek: </strong>All the time.<br><strong>Noemie:</strong> At first I tried to push those thoughts away. But then I realised that my father was a very humane man. He was a doctor after the war, and he had Germans among his patients. He went beyond hatred because he always said hatred eats up the person who hates. You have to move on and see the person for who they are. The Nazis tried to kill kindness and we fight against that.<br><strong>Derek: </strong>My father\u2019s sister was openly antisemitic for the rest of her life. What happened during the war didn\u2019t change her at all. She moved to Glasgow when she got married, and she would see a shop with \u201cGoldberg\u201d on it, and she would say: \u201cThat\u2019s a Jew.\u201d My dad also had this deeply ingrained antisemitism. I remember my mum once wanted to buy a menorah, and he said: \u201cI\u2019m not having that Jewish thing in the house.\u201d So he could say, on the one hand, that the Nazis did terrible things to the Jews, but at the same time, he would say other things like that. That education he got from his family and friends, he could never shake it off.</p> <p><strong>Do you think you would have been so aware of the recent rise of antisemitism in the west without </strong><strong>your family\u2019s connection?</strong><br><strong>Derek:</strong> I don\u2019t think so because, having done all this research, I have become sensitised to oppression in a way I wasn\u2019t before. I\u2019ve realised how comfortably bigoted I and my contemporaries were when we were kids. We would make Irish jokes, Jewish jokes \u2026 you could stand at the Arsenal and see a black player being abused and think: \u201cOh well,\u201d because it was normalised. I\u2019m ashamed I was like that, but we \u2013 in the comfortable minority \u2013 were like that.<br><strong>Noemie: </strong>This is why I urge the leaders of the countries to stand up and speak out because otherwise that behaviour is normalised. When the leader of the opposition in this country dismisses Jewish people\u2019s complaints [about his actions], he is giving permission to that behaviour. We always said \u201cnever again\u201d, but we have to work at it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a30eb2a836dfb92d51cc58b4ac65be24434b4ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a30eb2a836dfb92d51cc58b4ac65be24434b4ae/0_61_2802_3940/711.jpg\" alt=\"Ernst Israel Bornstein \u2026 \u2018He went beyond hatred.\u2019\" width=\"711\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ernst Israel Bornstein \u2026 \u2018He went beyond hatred.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Noemie Lopian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>But many of Corbyn\u2019s supporters would say that he has spoken out about antisemitism. And perhaps, more importantly, that the things many Jewish people have criticised him for \u2013 such as initially defending an antisemitic mural on Facebook \u2013 don\u2019t prove he\u2019s antisemitic.</strong><br><strong>Noemie:</strong> Yes, I get that a lot, people saying he\u2019s not anti-Jewish, he\u2019s anti-Israel. I accept that the actions of Israel, like any other country, can be criticised. But if the leader of the opposition befriends Hamas and Hezbollah, whose mission statement is to erase the existence of Israel \u2013 ie erasing me and my people again \u2013 then I don\u2019t feel safe.</p> <p><strong>When things happen, such as Donald Trump describing neo-Nazis as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, </strong><strong>and Jews get upset, a lot of people say they\u2019re overreacting and of course the Holocaust won\u2019t </strong><strong>happen again. How do you </strong><strong>respond to that?</strong><br><strong>Derek: </strong>Any behaviour that fosters suspicion or hatred is wrong, and the Holocaust is a long, long way down that path, but you have to get off that path right at the beginning. Researching my grandfather\u2019s story has given me a heightened awareness of the capability of humans to slide into evil deeds and find ways to exonerate themselves from culpability. It only needs the right conditions to expose our weaknesses and maybe I can see and understand that better than most.</p> <p><strong>Noemie, have you experienced more antisemitism recently?</strong><br><strong>Noemie: </strong>I remember as a kid people shouting: \u201cDirty Jew!\u201d, and I almost wouldn\u2019t think about it. You don\u2019t get that now, but I\u2019ve found that when I talk about antisemitism, the Israel question always comes up, especially among the left. I don\u2019t support harm or killing to anyone, so what I always say is that I strongly believe that with more positive dialogue on both sides there can be less killing.</p> <p><strong>Do you two talk to your children about their family histories?</strong><br><strong>Noemie: </strong>I have three daughters and I consciously turned to my past after the birth of my youngest. I don\u2019t particularly talk to them about their grandparents, but I\u2019m very open about my activities.<br><strong>Derek:</strong> I have a stepson, who is not bothered by a connection that is not a blood link. But I have shared the whole story with him, and he is enormously supportive of what I do.</p> <p><strong>What do you want people to take away from your talks?</strong><br><strong>Derek:</strong> To learn to look beyond difference and to act against prejudice before it\u2019s too late.<br><strong>Noemie:</strong> And also to remember that this happened. It\u2019s already fading from memory, which is why we talk to so many young people, at universities and schools.<br><strong>Derek:</strong> It feels like this is my life mission now. I met someone who was in the French resistance whose best friend was killed in Buchenwald, and he shook me by the hand. At our talks, survivors have invited me to sit with them afterwards and taken me by the hand. It\u2019s incredible.<br><strong>Noemie:</strong> I don\u2019t think I can change the world, but maybe by showing people how we have stepped beyond difference, that will make a difference.</p> <p><em>Derek Niemann\u2019s A <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nazi-in-the-family-616471.html\" title=\"\">Nazi in the Family</a> is published by Short Books.

      "bodyText": "Noemie Lopian, a 52-year-old Holocaust educator, grew up in Munich and Manchester hardly speaking about the Holocaust, even though both of her parents were in it. Her French mother, Renee, was questioned at gunpoint by the Gestapo at the age of 10 and imprisoned in the Prison du Pax in Annemasse, on the border between France and Switzerland. She was saved by the town\u2019s lord mayor, Jean Deffaugt, who persuaded the Gestapo to release the youngest children into his care, and the resistance fighter Marianne Cohn, who rescued at least 200 Jewish children during the war by smuggling them out of France\u2019s occupied zone. Lopian\u2019s Polish father, Dr Ernst Israel Bornstein, was arrested at 18 and moved between seven concentration camps during the war, enduring a number of long death marches. He was liberated near Munich by American soldiers on 30 April 1945. Derek Niemann, 57, lives in Bedfordshire and is a writer, teacher and contributor to the Guardian\u2019s country diary. Niemann knew nothing about his connection to the Holocaust until he was 49, when he found out, to his shock, that his paternal grandfather, Karl Niemann, was a Nazi war criminal. Last weekend, on Holocaust Memorial Day, it emerged that one in 20 Britons believe the Holocaust never happened, and one 12 think its scale has been exaggerated. Niemann and Bornstein now travel the country together and give talks about their different experiences, in the hope it will stem the tide of Holocaust denialism, and to educate people about antisemitism. Derek, what did you grow up knowing about your grandfather? Derek: He died the year before I was born, but my father had always said his father was a lowly official in a bank; a pen pusher. Then, my dad\u2019s sister died and it was like something opened up in him. I learned that my father had spent the entire war in Berlin, and the family had escaped into the Alps at the end of the war. The next breakthrough came when I was going to Berlin, and I found out the address of where my father had grown up. From that, I learned that my grandfather was in the SS and was convicted of crimes against humanity and the use of slave labour. I immediately started burrowing in Holocaust and SS archives. I learned that he\u2019d joined the Nazi party pretty early on, and, when he lost his job, he was recruited to the SS. At first, he was an auditor, and he worked his way up to become a business owner using the slave labour of concentration camps. He was going round to the camps and making sure they had supplies to keep working. I think he was a mediocrity who suddenly had a uniform and a chauffeur, and he thought he had to be loyal to the people who raised him up. The nonentities got to the top then. Was he punished after the war? Derek: Oh yes. He was captured by the US army on the day war ended in Europe, 8 May 1945, and imprisoned in the former prisoner of war camps at Moosburg, Bavaria, and Sandbostel near Bremen. He was released three years later. And how did the two of you meet? Noemie: I\u2019d heard about Derek after he wrote a book about his grandfather, and was very keen to meet him. We finally met when he was giving a talk in a synagogue. I\u2019d heard another grandson of a Nazi speak and I didn\u2019t take to him at all. It wasn\u2019t an intellectual reaction, it was an emotional one, which I hadn\u2019t expected. But when I heard Derek speak, I knew I would feel comfortable with him. Why were you so keen to meet a grandchild of a Nazi? Noemie: I felt, with my past, I could either ignore it or embrace it, and if I was going to embrace it I should be proactive in whatever little way I can. I wanted to learn. Also, it\u2019s hard to get people to listen to just me \u2013 I\u2019m not a celebrity, I\u2019m just a Jewish woman, and in the current political climate you feel as if you\u2019re going to be dismissed as just another stroppy Jew. But I felt with the two of us, more people would listen. Derek: We gave a talk last week, and at the beginning everyone made eye contact with Noemie, but some could barely look at me. At the end, though, they were coming up and hugging me and shaking me by the hand. I realised that they can\u2019t accept my family, but they recognise my desire to bridge the differences between us. Noemie: I feel that at our talks people are much more fascinated with Derek. They\u2019ve heard my kind of stories before. It\u2019s true \u2026 I\u2019ve spoken with a lot of children of Holocaust survivors, but never someone who describes himself as a grandchild of a Nazi. Derek: Yes, there aren\u2019t many of us around! I don\u2019t want to self-aggrandise, but at times I feel like Andy Murray talking about feminism \u2013 it\u2019s easy for some people to dismiss women calling out sexism, but it\u2019s harder when it comes from a man. Noemie: And that\u2019s why I think Derek\u2019s story is so powerful. People are used now to hearing Jews talk about antisemitism and the Holocaust, but when it comes from someone with Derek\u2019s background they\u2019re like, wow! And, of course, he has a much tougher job than me because he has to acknowledge the love he has for his father, and even his grandfather, while also talking about what they did. It\u2019s a far greater dichotomy than what I have. Did it affect how you see yourself, Derek, knowing that such a close relative did these terrible things? Derek: I think there was a lot of guilt in the beginning, and that may have been why I wrote about it and reached out so much to the Jewish community. But I know that my grandfather is not me, and I am empowered to \u2026 not make up for what he did, but at least use his story for, hopefully, a good purpose. Do you ever think about how your parents and grandparents would feel about you two becoming friends? Derek: All the time. Noemie: At first I tried to push those thoughts away. But then I realised that my father was a very humane man. He was a doctor after the war, and he had Germans among his patients. He went beyond hatred because he always said hatred eats up the person who hates. You have to move on and see the person for who they are. The Nazis tried to kill kindness and we fight against that. Derek: My father\u2019s sister was openly antisemitic for the rest of her life. What happened during the war didn\u2019t change her at all. She moved to Glasgow when she got married, and she would see a shop with \u201cGoldberg\u201d on it, and she would say: \u201cThat\u2019s a Jew.\u201d My dad also had this deeply ingrained antisemitism. I remember my mum once wanted to buy a menorah, and he said: \u201cI\u2019m not having that Jewish thing in the house.\u201d So he could say, on the one hand, that the Nazis did terrible things to the Jews, but at the same time, he would say other things like that. That education he got from his family and friends, he could never shake it off. Do you think you would have been so aware of the recent rise of antisemitism in the west without your family\u2019s connection? Derek: I don\u2019t think so because, having done all this research, I have become sensitised to oppression in a way I wasn\u2019t before. I\u2019ve realised how comfortably bigoted I and my contemporaries were when we were kids. We would make Irish jokes, Jewish jokes \u2026 you could stand at the Arsenal and see a black player being abused and think: \u201cOh well,\u201d because it was normalised. I\u2019m ashamed I was like that, but we \u2013 in the comfortable minority \u2013 were like that. Noemie: This is why I urge the leaders of the countries to stand up and speak out because otherwise that behaviour is normalised. When the leader of the opposition in this country dismisses Jewish people\u2019s complaints [about his actions], he is giving permission to that behaviour. We always said \u201cnever again\u201d, but we have to work at it. But many of Corbyn\u2019s supporters would say that he has spoken out about antisemitism. And perhaps, more importantly, that the things many Jewish people have criticised him for \u2013 such as initially defending an antisemitic mural on Facebook \u2013 don\u2019t prove he\u2019s antisemitic. Noemie: Yes, I get that a lot, people saying he\u2019s not anti-Jewish, he\u2019s anti-Israel. I accept that the actions of Israel, like any other country, can be criticised. But if the leader of the opposition befriends Hamas and Hezbollah, whose mission statement is to erase the existence of Israel \u2013 ie erasing me and my people again \u2013 then I don\u2019t feel safe. When things happen, such as Donald Trump describing neo-Nazis as \u201cvery fine people\u201d, and Jews get upset, a lot of people say they\u2019re overreacting and of course the Holocaust won\u2019t happen again. How do you respond to that? Derek: Any behaviour that fosters suspicion or hatred is wrong, and the Holocaust is a long, long way down that path, but you have to get off that path right at the beginning. Researching my grandfather\u2019s story has given me a heightened awareness of the capability of humans to slide into evil deeds and find ways to exonerate themselves from culpability. It only needs the right conditions to expose our weaknesses and maybe I can see and understand that better than most. Noemie, have you experienced more antisemitism recently? Noemie: I remember as a kid people shouting: \u201cDirty Jew!\u201d, and I almost wouldn\u2019t think about it. You don\u2019t get that now, but I\u2019ve found that when I talk about antisemitism, the Israel question always comes up, especially among the left. I don\u2019t support harm or killing to anyone, so what I always say is that I strongly believe that with more positive dialogue on both sides there can be less killing. Do you two talk to your children about their family histories? Noemie: I have three daughters and I consciously turned to my past after the birth of my youngest. I don\u2019t particularly talk to them about their grandparents, but I\u2019m very open about my activities. Derek: I have a stepson, who is not bothered by a connection that is not a blood link. But I have shared the whole story with him, and he is enormously supportive of what I do. What do you want people to take away from your talks? Derek: To learn to look beyond difference and to act against prejudice before it\u2019s too late. Noemie: And also to remember that this happened. It\u2019s already fading from memory, which is why we talk to so many young people, at universities and schools. Derek: It feels like this is my life mission now. I met someone who was in the French resistance whose best friend was killed in Buchenwald, and he shook me by the hand. At our talks, survivors have invited me to sit with them afterwards and taken me by the hand. It\u2019s incredible. Noemie: I don\u2019t think I can change the world, but maybe by showing people how we have stepped beyond difference, that will make a difference.

      "bodyText": "Just because we stopped talking about austerity doesn\u2019t mean it went away. The Centre for Cities published research this week on nearly a decade of Conservative fiscal tightening: councils have now lost 60p in every pound of funding they got from central government under Labour. Barnsley has suffered the greatest percentage cut in day-to-day spending on services, at 40%; Liverpool has had the deepest annual cuts per head, at \u00a3816. Three of the top five cities affected are in Yorkshire; there is a clear skew towards the north. A new funding formula explicitly redirects funds away from inner cities and towards the shires. This is far from new news: Simon Duffy, from the Centre for Welfare Reform, published an astonishing report in 2014 that detailed the cumulative effects of cuts to local authorities and to benefits. To be reliant on both local authority services and welfare over this period has meant suffering hardships that simply would not have been approved by any voter, had the consequences been spelled out in a manifesto. So the effect on local democracy sounds abstract, set against more concrete catastrophes such as that in adult social care. Yet there are lessons here, some harsh ones, if we\u2019re ever going to get to the business of political renewal. In the London borough of Lambeth, the council proposes the closure of five children\u2019s centres, with the remaining 18 grouped in some complicated fashion that involves sharing staff and pared-down services. Parents have been staging regular protests, with organisational support from Unison. The Green party has made an alternative suggestion to the council, which is seeking to balance its books: if it were to increase its financial reserves by less than currently proposed, it could keep these centres open for the next four years, while the borough holds its breath for a change of government. It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of children\u2019s centres: they\u2019re not simply part of a tapestry of early years provision, that you can pay for or not pay for, pick and choose. There is nothing else like them, where facilities, company, expertise and support are all located in the same place. \u201cThey\u2019re important in the way libraries are, rich and poor all walking through the same door,\u201d Kelly Rogers, a Unison organiser, has observed. The Labour council, faced with opposition, is cleaving to its \u201cblame Tory cuts\u201d line, sending out self-congratulatory emails about its successful budgets that don\u2019t even mention these closures, and only talk about the services they\u2019ve managed to protect. In a dynamic that has been replicated all over the country, the Labour council has become the hand-wringing instrument of Conservative austerity. An implacable opposition has built up between local activists and purportedly leftwing local government officials.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has delivered his election pitch to the Coalition\u2019s economic heartland, promising further tax relief for small business in a speech that stressed the importance of a strong economy. Seeking to draw differences with Labor over economic policy, Morrison announced the government would increase the instant asset write-off threshold to $25,000, effective immediately, with legislation to be introduced \u201cas a priority\u201d when parliament resumes next month. The change, which is forecast to cost $750m over the forward estimates, will allow businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10m to immediately deduct the cost of eligible assets (vehicles, machinery etc) until the end of the 2020 financial year. The existing threshold of $20,000 will remain in place until the end of June. \u201cIf you can\u2019t control your taxes, it\u2019s a sign you can\u2019t control your spending,\u201d the prime minister told an audience in Brisbane on Monday, where he has taken the cabinet as part of a bid to keep crucial Coalition seats. As previewed to media ahead of the delivery, Morrison\u2019s speech also included a promise to create 1.25 million jobs over five years if the Coalition wins the election, but later in the day the government\u2019s assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, struggled to explain what form those jobs would take. Robert initially told Sky News the jobs would be full time, before backtracking under questioning. \u201cThe intent is the prime minister announced 1.25 million new jobs to be be created ... we\u2019ll wait and see what the economy throws up in that respect [full or part time] but we are exceptionally confident that we will exceed the current target of what we\u2019ve set.\u201d Speaking to the ABC on Tuesday morning, Morrison said he was confident \u201cmost\u201d of the new jobs would be full time. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly our record that most jobs of the 1.2m created so far are full-time,\u201d he said. Robert also stumbled when asked why the government did not make its extension to the asset write-off program permanent. \u201cWell we have, that is exactly what we have done today \u2026 so we are, that is exactly what we are doing,\u201d he said. Reminded it was only set to run until the end of the next financial year, and asked if it was permanent, Robert said \u201cno, I am saying it is extended through until 30th of June this year \u2026 so this extends and increases the measure. \u201cSo many government programs have a lifetime of three years to see how they are working, how effective they are and whether they need to be changed or adjusted. So many, many programs are terminating, this is just one example of a terminating project, or program, but in this case, we have extended for one more year and increased it,\u201d he said. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, welcomed the tax relief move, indicating Labor would support the change, giving the government the numbers it needs to pass the measure next month. Labor has made inroads into the small business sector, one of the Coalition\u2019s traditional support bases, with its own deduction policy released in March. Labor\u2019s policy would allow businesses to deduct 20% of new eligible assets over $20,000, a measure it aims to make permanent. The government first increased the deduction threshold from $1,000 to $20,000 in the 2015-16 budget, extending the measure in subsequent budgets. Morrison\u2019s Brisbane announcement is the latest volley in the unofficial election campaign which began in earnest following the Christmas break, with the government expected to drip out big spending measures before the budget on 2 April. With the government still lagging in the polls, despite a two-point bounce in the latest Newspoll, a move which sits within the margin of error, the Coalition has turned to the economy as its election campaign foundation. While not going so far as to warn Australia risked entering a recession under a Labor government, Morrison hinted at it in his speech, continuing a narrative he has pursued since the August leadership spill. \u201cI do not want Australians to learn just how important a strong economy is to each of them by having to endure the cruel lessons of a weaker economy under Labor,\u201d Morrison said. It was the Coalition that \u201cmanaged to keep our AAA credit rating, after it was put at risk by Labor\u2019s reckless policy of spending money they never had,\u201d he said. The credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s placed Australia\u2019s AAA rating on negative watch following the 2016 election, which Malcolm Turnbull won. It reaffirmed the rating as \u201cstable\u201d only last year. Morrison will remain in Queensland until the end of the week as he seeks to shore up seats in danger of falling to Labor in the crucial swing state, with Dickson, Bonner, Forde and Capricornia all considered vulnerable.",

      "bodyText": "A rare durian fruit is causing a stir in Indonesia, where the pungent delicacy is selling for the equivalent of $1,000 each, or more than three times the average monthly wage. The so-called \u201cJ-Queen\u201d variety has gone sale at a shopping centre in Tasikmalaya, West Java \u2013 where several are on display in clear boxes atop red satin and adorned in fake flowers \u2013 with an accompanying price tag of 14m rupiah, or about \u00a3750. The average monthly wage in Indonesia is about 3.94m rupiah, according to data from the manpower ministry. News of the ostensibly rare durian has spread quickly in Indonesia, with social media users deriding its fantastical price tag, and locals flocking to the supermarket to snap a photograph alongside the spiky, pungent smelling fruit, considered a delicacy across much of south-east Asia. The brains behind the \u201cJ Queen\u201d variety is a 32-year-old Indonesian psychology major called Aka, who claims he created a new and rare version of durian by crossbreeding two superior varieties from different regions in Indonesia. The \u201cJ-Queen\u201d tree, he says, bears fruit only once every three years and reportedly has a \u201cpeanut and butter taste\u201d. Rather than typically oblong in shape, fruit from the J-Queen durian is round and yellow gold. \u201cMy intention is to improve the welfare of farmers by creating superior durians,\u201d Aka told the Indonesian news website Tribunnews, before adding that he has farms across Java. \u201cI have had durian gardens in Kendal, Pekalongan, Banyumas, Pangandaran, and Gunung Tanjung, Manonjaya, Tasikmalaya.\u201d But local farmers in Java say they have never heard of the purportedly unique variety, arguing that the most superior and rare Indonesian durians \u2013 the Montong and Kumbokarno varieties \u2013 normally sell for about 200,000 rupiah. According to reports in the Indonesian media, two \u201cJ-Queen\u201d durians have been sold since they were put out on display in the Plaza Asia shopping centre at the weekend.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales primary industries minister, Niall Blair, has admitted that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen nothing like this\u201d while touring the site of another massive fish death in the Lower Darling River at Menindee. The mass death incident in the Lower Darling, the third in a month, has left stretches of the Lower Darling upstream from Menindee covered in a carpet of dead fish. Most were small bony bream but golden perch and Murray cod have also been dying in recent days. Menindee local Graeme McCrabb said it was worse than the second event on 7 January, which killed hundreds of thousands of fish. \u201cIt\u2019s about 10km to 15km upstream from the town and the river is literally carpeted from one side to the other with thousands of bony bream,\u201d he said on Tuesday morning. \u201cThey\u2019re still dying, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of it yet.\u201d Standing on the bank of the Darling, Blair faced the media and a rowdy group of locals. He said he did not want to see further fish kills but had little to offer on solutions. The government has already tried installing aerators in the river at four sites to provide small refuges of more oxygenated water, but the latest fish kill occurred upstream from the aerators. Most locals believe the fish kills are the direct result of the government\u2019s decision to empty the Menindee Lakes in 2016 and 2017 and send the water downstream to other storages, leaving almost no water for flows during the prolonged drought that has gripped the state. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see this ever again,\u201d Blair told locals. \u201cWere the aerators the silver bullet? I never said that they were. Do I apologise for putting them in? Absolutely not.\u201d Blair said he was not aware of any other solutions other than river flows and that, in the drought conditions, this was a challenge. \u201cThe issue and the urgency at the moment is to come here and get the briefing first-hand, to be able to have a conversation with some of those issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared to stay in Sydney and get it sent through on a piece of paper or an email. \u201cIf I could change anything, it would be this and what happened in January and in December, and what\u2019s happening down on the Murrumbidgee and what happened in Lake Burrendong and what happened at Lake Cathie.\u201d Fisheries staff from the NSW primary industries department were on Tuesday heading to the Redbank weir near Balranald to confirm reports of the fish deaths on the Murrumbidgee River. \u201cState and commonwealth agencies are meeting this afternoon to discuss available options for managing flows within the Murrumbidgee River to address declining water quality at various locations,\u201d a spokeswoman said. When locals accused him of downplaying the massive fish kills in the Darling, Blair agreed that the others were \u201cnothing like this\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to acknowledge what we are seeing here is nothing like we\u2019ve ever seen in the state before,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. So I\u2019m not downplaying this.\u201d Blair said that some storages were down to 1% and the government was trying to manage them \u201cthe best that we can\u201d. He said a lot of the state had now \u201c0% going to farming\u201d, a reference to allocations to holders of general security licences. High security licence holders still have the right to pump water for farming and some irrigators have large on-farm storages where they hold their allocations. A fish clean-up team, contracted by the NSW government, has cleaned up the dead fish closer to the town. McCrabb said Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the minister was much more fruitful than last time, when Blair toured the river by boat and declined to meet with locals assembled at the boat ramp. \u201cHe was very keen to help the town and listened to our six-point plan for Menindee,\u201d McCrabb said. Blair also said he would consider the local water users\u2019 groups suggestions about how to make the lake system more resilient, including using some deeper lakes in the system to store water for drought conditions. A report from the South Australian royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan is due to be released any day. It is expected to find that the targets for recovery of water for the environment are too low and that the previous federal Labor government took into account factors other than the environment in setting the target. The health of Australia\u2019s rivers is set to be a major issue in both the upcoming NSW state and federal elections.",

      "bodyText": "The high court has opened the way for big-money election campaigns from third-party groups such as unions, striking down a New South Wales law setting strict caps on such spending. In a unanimous decision on Tuesday the court held the Electoral Funding Act \u2013 which halved the amount third-party groups can spend on state campaigns from $1.05m to $500,000 \u2013 infringed the implied freedom of political communication. A group of unions led by peak body Unions NSW had argued that setting lower caps for groups who do not run candidates in elections \u2013 such as unions, business groups and charities \u2013 was designed to handicap \u201cdisfavoured voices\u201d. While the impugned law only governs NSW elections, such as the upcoming March election, the precedent will hinder federal, state and territory governments attempting to limit campaign spending. The majority found it was unnecessary to decide on a separate provision preventing groups acting in concert to exceed the cap because there is now \u201cno cap\u201d for it to operate on, opening the way to unlimited spending until the law is rewritten. Tuesday\u2019s decision is the second major victory by Unions NSW and its affiliates against the NSW government, after they successfully challenged a total ban on union and corporate political donations in 2013. Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey said they were \u201cecstatic\u201d at the result. \u201cWe\u2019ve basically run this case twice now and both times the High Court has said the legislation is trying silence [the government\u2019s] critics and is not valid,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. The majority of the court held that the reduction in the spending cap was not \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to achieve the purpose identified by the NSW government, to prevent the drowning out of other voices in the political process by the distorting influence of money. The plurality (chief justice Susan Kiefel, Virginia Bell and Patrick Keane) and Justice James Edelman in a separate judgment rejected the NSW government\u2019s submission that political parties occupy a privileged position which justifies a higher spending cap. The plurality said the constitution \u201cin no way implies that a candidate in the political process occupies some privileged position in the competition to sway the people\u2019s vote\u201d. The judges accepted the unions\u2019 submission that \u201cno basis\u201d was given by an expert panel in 2014 advising the NSW government to halve the cap for third-party campaigners, adding that the government had \u201cnot justified\u201d the burden on implied freedom. Edelman went furthest in criticism of the NSW government, siding with the unions that the law had an \u201cadditional, illegitimate purpose to quieten the voices of third-party campaigners in contrast with parties or candidates for election\u201d. He accepted the unions submission that this was done \u201cto shut down \u2026 protected speech\u201d. Justice Stephen Gageler, by contrast, accepted that a \u201csubstantial variation\u201d in the cap was justified. But Gageler agreed with the plurality that the NSW government had failed to show that $500,000 was sufficient for third-party groups to fairly participate in campaigns. Similarly, justices Geoffrey Nettle and Michelle Gordon in separate judgments said the NSW government had failed to show that halving the cap was necessary to achieve its identified aim. Morey said the result meant unions \u201ccan all get together and run a coordinated campaign\u201d with one \u201coverarching message\u201d. \u201cUnions always rely on small donations from their members and the fees they pay,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to compete against the likes of BHP, the Commonwealth Bank or Malcolm Turnbull we have to work together and pool or resources to participate.\u201d Morey said the unions\u2019 campaign for the upcoming March election would focus on the privatisation of $60bn worth of government services.",

      "bodyText": "You might have seen the clip floating around social media. It\u2019s a panel discussion from the World Economic Forum at Davos, in which Michael Dell, the billionaire CEO responds to a question about a 70% marginal tax rate on the wealthiest Americans, a proposal recently floated by US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not supportive of that,\u201d Dell says, to much laughter from the assembled plutocrats. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it will help the growth of the US economy. Name a country where that\u2019s worked.\u201d At which point his co-panellist, MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson, chimes in: \u201cThe United States.\u201d As Dell and others sputter incredulously, Brynjolfsson explains that America didn\u2019t always allow the super-rich to pay a mere 37% in tax. \u201cFrom about the 1930s to the 1960s the tax rate [on the very rich] averaged about 70%,\u201d he says. \u201cAt times it was up as high as 95%. And those were actually pretty good years for growth \u2026 There\u2019s actually a lot of economics to suggest that it\u2019s not actually going to hurt growth.\u201d The response \u2013 and, more so, the clip\u2019s massive popularity \u2013 illustrates the success of a new style of American politics. Almost as soon as Ocasio-Cortez, running as a democratic socialist, defeated Joe Crowley, some mainstream Democrats dismissed her as a \u201cmeteor\u201d that would soon fizzle out. Earlier this month, Republican strategist and cable fulminator Ed Rollins described AOC as a \u201clittle girl\u201d with a big mouth. When she cast her vote for Speaker, audible boos rang out from the Republicans in the house. Yet the public approves of precisely those policies that most horrify Beltway insiders. A recent poll shows, for instance, 59% of voters liking AOC\u2019s tax plan, including 57% of Southerners and even 45% of GOP supporters. The magnates at the WEF might be so out of touch as to still think Bono relevant. But even in Davos questions about inequality now resonate \u2013 thanks, in part, to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposals. Her success deserves consideration outside America, not least because it confounds much of the established political wisdom. In the 2000s \u201cframing\u201d became an almost ubiquitous preoccupation for liberals, particularly in the wake of Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant! the bestselling book by linguist George Lakoff. Lakoff noted the political significance of certain metaphorical fames. Conservatives adopt the \u201cstrict father\u201d metaphor in which politicians act to protect the public from a dangerous world. If liberals inadvertently use terminology associated with that metaphor they undercut their own message. Instead, the argument goes, they must reframe the debate with rhetoric that metaphorically legitimates their own values. In practice, throughout the 2000s, the obsession with framing reinforced a longstanding reliance on spin doctors, focus groups and soundbites, with many progressives convinced that reaching the public depended, first and foremost, on perfectly crafted zingers. Then, of course, came 2016 and a presidential election in which Donald Trump destroyed his well-rehearsed opponents, seemingly by blurting out whatever came into his head. AOC embodies a quite different strategy. Yes, she\u2019s articulate and charismatic, and she positively rules on social media. But the \u201creframing\u201d she performs relies on message more than the metaphor, resetting the terms of debate not through spin but by politics. Traditionally Democrats react to socialism like the devil to holy water. But AOC openly embraced the label and helped set a whole generation debating what socialism might mean.

That\u2019s why \u2013 irrespective of how AOC\u2019s career plays out \u2013 her success to date offers an important lesson for progressives, in Australia as much as anywhere elsewhere. Those who want to change the world can\u2019t shape their ideas according to the conventional wisdom about what the public will accept, whether on refugees, climate change or anything else. For too long, politicians have used the alleged backwardness of the voters to justify their own pusillanimity.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for staying with us through another eventful day. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker announced that Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is close to finished. Trump accepts speaker Pelosi\u2019s State of the Union invitation. At a White House press briefing on Venezuela, national security adviser John Bolton accidentally flashed his handwritten notes that included something about \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia\u201d. Former Starbucks CEO and possible \u201ccentrist independent\u201d 2020 presidential candidate Howard Schultz makes his first stop on his book tour and it turns into a town hall meeting of sorts. And no town hall meeting is complete without at least one heckler. The Guardian\u2019s Erin Durkin is at former Starbucks CEO and possible independent 2020 presidential candidate Howard Schultz\u2019s first stop of his book tour, which has turned into a town hall of sorts. Speaking at a New York Barnes and Noble, he ruled out any possibility that he would run as a Democrat, despite his life-long affiliation with the party. \u201cIf I run for president, I\u2019m running as a centrist independent,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cIf I ran as a Democrat, I would have to say things that I know in my heart I do not believe, and I would have to be disingenuous.\u201d Much of the criticism that has been lobbed at Schultz is that running for president seems more like a vanity project for an \u201cegotistical billionaire asshole,\u201d as one protester put it, that will do nothing but divide the liberal vote and hand the election to President Trump. Earlier today, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s tweeted that he refused to run in 2016 for this reason. \u201cMike Bloomberg has built a great business, was a great mayor,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cI have tremendous respect for him, but I don\u2019t agree with his conclusion.\u201d Americans who don\u2019t affiliate with either party, Schultz said, \u201chave never had a legitimate choice to vote for what they believe in.\u201d Trump also took to Twitter today to take a jab at Schultz. Schultz called the president\u2019s attacks \u201cchildish.\u201d \u201cNobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I decide to run for president as an independent, I will believe and have the courage and the conviction to believe that I can win,\u201d he said, though he added he could not yet answer whether he would bow out if polls show he is helping Trump. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to do anything to put Donald Trump back into the Oval Office.\u201d Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is having his first public event since he said he was exploring an independent bid for president as a \u201ccentrist independent\u201d. He was immediately heckled. Roger Stone, the longtime ally of President Trump who was indicted last week in the Russia probe, is set to be arraigned in federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday at 11am EST. And Jerome Corsi, a right-wing author and conspiracy theorist, is already volunteering to testify, Reuters is reporting, and to \u201clet the chips fall where they may.\u201d Corsi had been one of two people Stone sought to use as intermediaries to communicate with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange about hacked Democratic Party emails in the 2016 election campaign, according to the indictment. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a witness,\u201d Corsi told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIf it\u2019s for Roger\u2019s benefit or not for Roger\u2019s benefit so be it but I\u2019m going to tell the truth to the best of my ability.\u201d While Corsi is ready to go, Stone\u2019s legal team appears to be having some trouble. Stone has maintained that he will not testify against Trump, but he said on ABC\u2019s This Week that he\u2019d consult with his attorneys about potentially cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is close to finishing his investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. The tens of thousands of immigration court hearings canceled during the five-week federal government shutdown could cause delays in the country\u2019s already severely backlogged immigration court that will take years to sort through, the Associated Press is reporting. Over 86,000 immigration court hearings were canceled during the standoff, the biggest number in California, followed by Texas and New York, according to an estimate from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. It estimates the courts have more than 800,000 pending cases overall. The shutdown over President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for funding for a border wall to keep out migrants has only added to the delays in the system, where cases can already take years to be resolved, said Jennifer Williams, deputy attorney in charge of the immigration law unit at Legal Aid in New York City. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be playing catch-up for years,\u201d she said. The shutdown did not affect hearings for immigrants being held in immigration detention. It also had no bearing on applications for green cards and U.S. citizenship, which are handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and are funded by filing fees. The cancellations were bad news for the many asylum applicants who have been waiting years to win approval so that they can bring loved ones to this country. It could be years before they are given new court dates, immigration attorneys said. But for those with weak asylum cases, the canceled hearings could be a good thing, enabling them to keep on living in the U.S. and fend off deportation for now. Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, has agreed to testify behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee next month, the Associated Press is reporting. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California announced that Cohen would testify before the intelligence panel on February 8. Cohen was initially scheduled to appear in an open hearing before the House Oversight Committee one day earlier, but he abruptly announced last week he was postponing his scheduled congressional testimony, citing \u201congoing threats against his family\u201d from Trump and the President\u2019s attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Cohen has also been subpoenaed to appear in mid-February before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the committee is in touch with Cohen\u2019s legal team about that appearance, too. \u201cWe will continue to work with Mr. Cohen and law enforcement in order to protect Mr. Cohen and his family,\u201d Schiff said in a statement, in which he thanked Cohen for agreeing to talk to the intelligence panel voluntarily. More from the Associated Press on the Mueller investigation: Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker says the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation is \u201cclose to being completed.\u201d Whitaker made the comment Monday during an unrelated news conference at the Justice Department in Washington. He says he\u2019s been \u201cfully briefed\u201d on the special counsel\u2019s investigation. He took over control overseeing the probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned at the president\u2019s request in November. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election. Whitaker says he hopes to receive Mueller\u2019s report as soon as possible. Donald Trump has nominated William Barr to serve as the next attorney general. His confirmation hearing was held earlier this month and he\u2019s awaiting a confirmation vote in the Senate. Paul Manafort\u2019s Feb. 8 sentencing was postponed Monday, Reuters is reporting, after prosecutors for the special counsel\u2019s office accused President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman of breaching his plea agreement in a parallel case in Washington. Judge T.S. Ellis in the Eastern District of Virginia said in a court order he wanted to delay the sentencing until the other judge ruled on whether Manafort had knowingly lied to investigators in breach of his plea deal, noting that such a decision \u201cmay have some effect on the sentencing decision in this case.\u201d The Trump administration announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil giant. The sanctions are meant to help punish \u201cthose responsible for Venezuela\u2019s tragic decline\u201d, the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told reporters at a White House briefing today. The hope is that the sanctions would boost Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader who last week declared himself interim president and was recognized by the United States. Referring to the situation in Venezuela, National Security Adviser John Bolton said at the same briefing that \u201cthe president has made it clear that all options are on the table.\u201d The notes scrawled on his notepad illustrated just what those options could be. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the West Coast taking over for Ben Jacobs. Stay tuned for more. Nancy Pelosi has invited Donald Trump to the Capitol to give the State of the Union yet again Sarah Sanders held the first White House press briefing of the year A new estimate from the Congressional Budget Office posits that the government shutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion. A longtime top Obama aide has signed on with Howard Schultz\u2019s potential third party bid for the White House. Nancy Pelosi has just invited Trump to deliver the speech on February 5. Sarah Sanders says \u201cthe charges in the indictment against [Roger] Stone have nothing to do with the president.\u201d Sanders doesn\u2019t have any information about whether Trump might pardon Roger Stone and won\u2019t raise it with him. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders accuses Speaker Nancy Pelosi of not acting in good faith over the State of the Union. As Sarah Sanders speaks from the podium, worth noting that two of the three cable news networks are not broadcasting her briefing. Larry Kudlow declines to acknowledge any economic damage from the shutdown at the White House. The first White House briefing of 2019 has begun with an announcement of new sanctions against the Maduro regime in Venezuela. The White House has just announced that it will welcome a trade delegation from China at the end of the month. Two senators have introduced legislation to require the special counsel to directly submit a report to Congress rather than simply to the attorney general. Another Democratic presidential candidate will enter the fray tonight. New Age author Marianne Williamson will announce her bid. Williamson travelled to Iowa last summer exploring a bid. Gwyneth Paltrow has a podcast? According to Politico he is, anyway \u2013 over claims made by former aide Cliff Sims in the new book Team of Vipers. Sims\u2019 book is due out tomorrow but was scooped up by the Guardian last week. It tells the now familiar tale of White House chaos, bickering and skullduggery. And apparently it has really upset the president. From Politico: President Donald Trump is \u201cvery pissed off\u201d and \u201creally hopping mad\u201d at former aide Cliff Sims\u2019 new book that reveals firsthand the chaos and infighting that is ever present in his White House, according to several current and former White House officials. Trump is asking aides: \u201cWho is this guy? Why is he writing this book? He wasn\u2019t even in meetings,\u201d the sources said. He also dismissively refers to Sims \u2013 who served until last May as director of White House message strategy and a special assistant to the president \u2014as \u201cthe videographer\u201d because he also helped Trump with the weekly video and radio addresses, according to three current and former White House officials. Potential billionaire presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has thrown some shade at potential billionaire presidential candidate Howard Schultz, claiming an independent run for president would \u201cend up re-electing\u201d Trump. Schultz announced this weekend that he is considering running for the White House as a \u201ccentrist independent, outside of the two-party system\u201d. On Monday Bloomberg, who is considering running as a Democrat, said he has crunched the numbers \u2013 and all an independent run would do is split the anti-Trump vote. It\u2019s no secret that I looked at an independent bid in the past. In fact I faced exactly the same decision now facing others who are considering it. The data was very clear and very consistent. Given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there is no way an independent can win. That is truer today than ever before. In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That\u2019s a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can\u2019t afford to run it now. Time change: Poll! Poll! Poll! This one is from Marquette Law School, who have surveyed Wisconsin voters. It seems 42% of Wisconsinites approve of the job Trump is doing, while 52% disapprove. That approval rating is better than the national average, but it\u2019s down from October, when 47% approved of Trump\u2019s performance. Worse news for Trump \u2013 who narrowly won in Wisconsin in 2016 \u2013 is that not many people say they will vote for him in 2020: Among all registered voters, 27% say they would definitely vote to reelect Trump if the 2020 elections were held today, 12% say they would probably vote to reelect him. Eight per cent would probably vote for someone else and 49% would definitely vote for someone else. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is due to give an on-camera press briefing at 3pm ET. Ordinarily that would not be news but these are not, as many eminently qualified people have observed, normal times. Sanders last briefed the White House press corps on camera on 18 December, Trump recently tweeted that he had told his press secretary \u201cnot to bother\u201d, and the general dwindling of this once-glorious illustration of the power of the first amendment/blast of sound and fury signifying nothing has become a story in itself. Amid the usual economies with the actualit\u00e9 and tetchy exchanges with grandstanding reporters with on-camera presences to think about, Sanders will doubtless be asked whether Trump is going to shut down the government again if he doesn\u2019t get his money for a wall. On Sunday, the president spoke to the Wall Street Journal and said he thought the chances of bipartisan negotiators producing a deal on border security funding he could accept were \u201cless than 50/50\u201d. The president also said he doubted he would accept less than the demand for $5.7bn for his border wall that caused the last shutdown, and doubted whether he would accept any deal involving a path to citizenship for young undocumented migrants, a Democratic priority. Earlier the same day, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney went on the talk shows and was duly asked if Trump was prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks\u2019 time, if his prediction proves accurate and no deal is produced. \u201cYeah, I think he actually is,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to shut the government down, let\u2019s make that very clear. He doesn\u2019t want to declare a national emergency.\u201d Most observers assume Trump will in fact do the latter, in an attempt to bypass Congressional budget control altogether. \u201cThe president\u2019s commitment is to defend the nation, and he will do it either with or without Congress,\u201d Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday. Acting without Congress would likely trigger both legal challenges and intense political and philosophical debate about the extent and/or abuse of executive power. So that will be fun. An early endorsement for Kamala Harris, from Congressman Ted Lieu: The Iowa caucuses are just 12 months away! Could this be a game-changer? Will Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, mount a presidential primary challenge against Donald Trump? Probably not, but it hasn\u2019t stopped news organizations from speculating. CNN is particularly keen on the idea, noting that Hogan \u201cenjoys high approval ratings\u201d in Maryland. But CNN adds, a little underwhelmingly: \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any concrete steps toward a primary bid and a spokesperson for Hogan did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\u201d There\u2019s nothing like a bit of Brexit news to make one feel better about US politics. The latest development in the ongoing shambles is that a top EU official believes the risk of a \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d \u2013 which essentially amounts to the UK crashing out of the EU with no clear plan forward \u2013 is now \u201cvery high\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s man in Westminster Andrew Sparrow has the latest developments. And if you\u2019re still confused \u2013 like me \u2013 about terms like \u201cbackstop\u201d, \u201cNorway plus\u201d and \u201cSuperCanada\u201d, then here\u2019s a handy guide. The border wall-inspired government shutdown cost the economy $3bn in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is expected to cost $8bn in the first quarter of 2019, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Some of $11bn that will be recovered once federal workers start getting paid again, the CBO says. But not all: Although most of the real GDP lost during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates that about $3bn will not be. That amount equals 0.02% of projected annual GDP in 2019. In other words, the level of GDP for the full calendar year is expected to be 0.02% smaller than it would have been otherwise. The CBO says the cost to the economy is due mainly to \u201cthe loss of furloughed federal workers\u2019 contribution to GDP, the delay in federal spending on goods and services, and the reduction in aggregate demand (which thereby dampened private-sector activity)\u201d. Trump wanted $5.7bn for the border wall, in exchange for ending the shutdown. Lindsey \u201cDonald Trump is a race-baiting, xenophic bigot\u201d Graham is up and about, continuing his single-minded propping up of the president. Donald Trump will not give his State of the Union address on Tuesday, according to an aide to Nancy Pelosi. CNN reports that the address \u2013 Trump\u2019s second \u2013 is not going to happen as had been scheduled before the shutdown. The back-and-forth over Trump giving his State of the Union speech in the House chamber was a running sidenote to the government shutdown. Pelosi asked Trump to postpone the address until after the shutdown ended, citing security concerns. Trump rejected that, saying he was going to do it anyway. Pelosi again said he would not be allowed to. The master dealmaker then caved, agreeing to postpone the speech. It\u2019s now unclear when Trump will address the nation. There\u2019s more bad news for Trump today \u2013 in the form of a Washington Post-ABC poll that finds the president \u201chas largely underperformed the even modest expectations that Americans had for him as he took office\u201d. Nearly six out of ten Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump as a person, according to the survey. A majority of people also \u201cdoubt his empathy, honesty and ability to make political deals\u201d, according to the Post. The poll compares the expectations people had for Trump in January 2017 to current views of the president. When Trump took office 50% of people thought he would do a good job on reducing the federal deficit, according to the poll. Now only 33% think he is doing well. The federal deficit was a longtime rallying cry for Republicans under Obama, but McConnell and co were strangely silent as Trump\u2019s tax cuts caused the deficit to balloon to $779bn in 2018 \u2013 an increase of 17%. Howard Schultz\u2019s announcement that he is considering a run for the White House as an independent has caused consternation among Democrats, who fear a third-party run from a candidate with many of their policies \u2013 Schultz himself told CBS he\u2019s a \u201clifelong Democrat\u201d and listed some progressive-ish policy positions \u2013 could split the vote and hand a second term to Trump. Trump himself duly tweeted about the former Starbucks chief executive on Monday morning, saying that Schultz is not \u201cthe smartest person\u201d \u2026 because he is. No presidential nickname has yet been coined. Schultz himself acknowledged that his ambitions are not for everyone, telling the news site Axios he knows he is: going to create hate, anger, disenfranchisement from friends, from Democrats. Axios reports that the billionaire businessman is, however, convinced he is doing the right thing. He\u2019s certainly doing the write thing, releasing a campaign-oriented biography today with a launch in his native New York. It\u2019s called From the Ground Up: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America. Before you rush to the store to order it, consider this from the Guardian\u2019s Lloyd Green, on the often (if not always) dubious pedigree of the presidential campaign book: Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. In Washington and around the country, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will return to work for the first time in 2019 as museums and national parks prepare to open. A surprising climb down by Donald Trump ended the longest shutdown in US history on Friday, but it could be a several more days before employees receive their pay. Congress has less than three weeks to present Trump with a border security plan he likes. A bipartisan group of members were selected to lead the negotiations but Trump has already dismissed the prospect that they will come up with a proposal he would sign. In that case, Trump has vowed to declare a national emergency to build his wall along the south-western border. And on the talk shows on Sunday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the president could shut down the government again. Trump has no public events scheduled today but that doesn\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t heard from him and won\u2019t be hearing more. Already this morning he has tweeted about tarrifs and bible study classes. He also taunted former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, saying he doesn\u2019t have the \u201cguts\u201d\u2019to run for president.",

The Summer Smash is an impressive spectacle, but for some it is more than that: a vindication of a beloved pastime, or even a way of life. Video games stopped being on the fringes of the entertainment industry a long time ago, and an event of this scale makes Fortnite\u2019s mainstream cachet clear to all and sundry.

It is hard, or even impossible, not to get swept up by the crowd\u2019s energy and Fortnite\u2019s frantically fast gameplay. The Summer Smash is an impressive spectacle, but for some it is more than that: a vindication of a beloved pastime, or even a way of life. Video games stopped being on the fringes of the entertainment industry a long time ago, and an event of this scale makes Fortnite\u2019s mainstream cachet clear to all and sundry. If one views the phenomenon of this game as evidence of a generation moving away from traditional sport, the choice of venue becomes a little ironic. \u201cIt was a great show! Very colourful, very social, very entertaining,\u201d one dad tells Guardian Australia, as the crowd heads towards the exit. His young son hears the conversation and chimes in, \u201cdoes that mean I can have more playing time?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d his father replies.",

The attorneys have asked for damages of at least $20m. \u201cThe Sacramento police executed Stephon Clark in his grandparents\u2019 backyard, mistaking his cell phone for a gun, assuming he was a criminal threat simply because he was a black man,\u201d Ben Crump, one of the attorneys for the family, said in a statement on Monday, adding that police \u201cignored him for six minutes, failing to render any help to save his life\u201d.

Clark, who left behind two young sons, was shot in a confrontation with two police officers on 18 March 2018. He was holding only an iPhone when officers killed him. Body-camera videos of the shocking killing went viral last March, sparking massive protests and national outrage.

The body-camera footage recorded the men shouting \u201cgun!\u201d and showed that they began shooting less than 20 seconds after they arrived. Both officers muted their microphones in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The officers were responding to calls about someone breaking into cars when they located Clark, police said at the time. Police in America disproportionately kill young black men and boys, and Clark\u2019s death quickly drew comparisons to high-profile cases, including the killings of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Philando Castile and Walter Scott. Clark\u2019s family and civil rights groups have long called for the two officers to face criminal charges, and the district attorney\u2019s office said Monday that its investigation was still ongoing.

The comments to ABC\u2019s 7:30 on the Labor leader\u2019s tour of Queensland last week signals that Shorten will break with a tradition of Australian political leaders courting Murdoch\u2019s favour, as former Labor leader Kevin Rudd did before his 2007 election victory. After a standing invitation from Murdoch to meet in New York, Shorten reportedly politely told the Australian-born media proprietor that it would not be necessary. \u201cNews Limited and Mr Murdoch shouldn\u2019t take that as any view on him in particular,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with their local management just as I deal with the local management of the ABC. \u201cBut my real conversation is not with the rich and powerful in this country.\u201d The comments mark a cooling relationship between Labor and News Corp. Launching the second volume of his autobiography in October, Rudd accused Murdoch of prosecuting a \u201cdirect agenda\u201d through his newspapers, which he says toppled Rudd himself and then Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister. Shorten has rejected Rudd\u2019s call for a royal commission into News Corp\u2019s influence, telling ABC\u2019s 7.30 that ownership of newspapers is \u201cnot something I can change or affect\u201d. \u201cI worry about the things I can change and I don\u2019t worry about the things I can\u2019t change,\u201d he said. \u201cSome elements of the media are very aggressive critics of Labor but I\u2019m not going to whinge about that. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the Labor side, the working people\u2019s side, you don\u2019t own the big banks, you don\u2019t own the big private health insurers and you don\u2019t own the big media, so that\u2019s sort of a fact of life.\u201d Before losing the leadership in August, Turnbull blamed \u201can insurgency\u201d in his own party and \u201coutside forces in the media\u201d as the architects of his demise, with sources close to Turnbull later claiming Kerry Stokes warned him Murdoch and News Corp were intent on removing him from power.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration has tightened the screws on Venezuela\u2019s embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, announcing sanctions against the country\u2019s state-owned oil company PDVSA in what the US national security adviser admitted was partly an attempt to counter strategic threats from Cuba and Iran. At a briefing in the White House, the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told reporters the sanctions would help punish \u201cthose responsible for Venezuela\u2019s tragic decline\u201d and boost Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader who last week declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president and was recognized by the United States. \u201cIt is a complete tragedy to have a humanitarian crisis in a country that has very rich resources,\u201d Mnuchin said. The sanctions \u2013 which represent the US\u2019s toughest economic move against Maduro to date \u2013 come five days after Guaid\u00f3\u2019s dramatic declaration sparked Venezuela\u2019s latest political crisis. The national security adviser, John Bolton, said $7bn of PDVSA assets would be immediately blocked as a result of the sanctions while the company would also lose an estimated $11bn in export proceeds over the coming year. Bolton said the sanctions were an attempt to alleviate \u201cthe poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis\u201d currently gripping the South American nation and stop \u201cMaduro and his cronies\u201d looting the assets of the Venezuelan people. \u201cNow is the time to stand for democracy and prosperity in Venezuela,\u201d he said, calling on \u201call responsible nations\u201d to back Guaid\u00f3. However, Bolton also conceded US strategic interests were in play, including concerns about the presence and activities of US foes in the region. \u201cWe think stability and democracy in Venezuela are in the direct national interests of the United States right now,\u201d Bolton told reporters. \u201cThe authoritarian regime of Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro has allowed the penetration by adversaries of the United States, not least of which is Cuba.\u201d He added: \u201cSome call the country \u2018Cubazuela\u2019, reflecting the grip that Cuba\u2019s military and security forces have on the Maduro regime. We think that is a strategic significant threat to the United States and there are others as well, including Iran\u2019s interest in Venezuela\u2019s uranium deposits.\u201d Maduro hit back in a live broadcast to the nation from the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. \u201cThis group of extremists that have stormed the White House have no limits,\u201d he said, attacking the \u201cbelittlement, disdain and aggression\u201d with which he claimed \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s unfit government\u201d treated Venezuela. Amir Richani, a Latin America analyst at ClipperData, which tracks energy shipments, said the sanctions were intended \u201cto continue the asphyxiation of Maduro\u2019s government\u201d and would come as a major blow. The US is the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude, followed by India and China, last year importing an average of around 500,000 barrels a day. Richani said the sanctions indicated the White House had decided to go \u201call-out\u201d against Maduro: \u201cThis is a really dangerous situation for Caracas.\u201d The notepad Bolton was holding as he took to the stage hinted at just how potentially dangerous it could be. A handwritten note on its yellow pages appeared to read: \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia\u201d. Asked if there was any possibility of US troops getting involved in the Venezuelan crisis, Bolton replied: \u201cLook, the president has made it very clear on this matter that all option are on the table.\u201d Any violence against Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition or US diplomatic staff \u201cwould be met by a significant response\u201d.In his televised broadcast Maduro accused Bolton and Trump of seeking to destroy his leftist \u201cBolivarian\u201d administration through a coup that risked plunging Venezuela into conflict. \u201cI hold Donald Trump responsible for any violence that might come to pass in Venezuela. It will be you, se\u00f1or presidente Donald Trump, responsible for this policy of regime change in Venezuela, and the blood that might flow in Venezuela will be on your hands \u2026 You will have your hands covered in blood, if you lead Venezuela into partial or generalised violence.\u201d Earlier on Monday, Pope Francis said he feared bloodshed. Speaking on the papal plane as he returned from a five-day visit to Panama, the pope told reporters: \u201cIn this moment, I support all the Venezuelan people because they are a people who are suffering. \u201cI suffer for what is happening in Venezuela. What is it that scares me? Bloodshed.\u201d The Republican senator Marco Rubio celebrated the fresh sanctions, tweeting: \u201cAll property &amp; interests of PdVSA are now blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.\u201d Rubio, thought to have been a major influence in Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Guaid\u00f3, added: \u201cVenezuela\u2019s oil belongs to the Venezuelan people and the money for oil will now go to them through the legitimate government of Guaido.\u201d In a second tweet, Rubio posted a photograph of Maduro and wrote: \u201cAll bad things must also come to an end.\u201d In the latest sign of coordination between Guaid\u00f3 and the White House, Guaid\u00f3 also announced on Monday plans to name a new board for PDVSA and its US refining subsidiary, Citgo. The move would help kickstart the recovery of an industry \u201cthat today is living through a dark moment,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 tweeted.",

      "bodyText": "More than half of the inmates held in prisons for young people in England and Wales are from a black and minority ethnic (BME) background, the highest proportion on record, the prisons watchdog has said, prompting warnings that youth jails have hit \u201cAmerican\u201d levels of disproportionality. About 51% of boys in young offender institutions (YOIs) \u2013 prisons for boys aged 15 to 17 and young adult men aged 18 to 21 \u2013 identified as being from a BME background, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) found. In addition, the inspectorate found 42% of children in secure training centres (STCs) \u2013 prisons for children up to the age of 17 \u2013 were from a BME background. The proportion of BME boys and men behind bars in YOIs in England and Wales is nearly four times the 14% BME proportion of the wider UK population. David Lammy MP, who published a review into the treatment of and outcomes for BME individuals in the criminal justice system in 2017, said he was shocked by the figures, which have rocketed since he released the report, when the BME proportion in YOIs and STCs was just over 40%. He said: \u201cThis is very alarming. England and Wales are now hitting an American scale of disproportionality in our youth justice system. The government urgently needs to step up implementation of my review. \u201cThere are real problems with the youth justice system. I\u2019m very concerned by how youth justice courts are performing. They\u2019re not very close to communities. Parents seem to be disengaged. Community members seem to be disengaged.\u201d Lammy said that as part of his research he observed positive practices in places such as New Zealand, where the community engaged in youth justice. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case in this country. It\u2019s really remote. Magistrates courts are being cut so it\u2019s even more remote,\u201d he said. The Labour MP for Tottenham repeated concerns about the lack of diversity within the judiciary. \u201cI raise some serious concerns about our courts, about the paucity of black and ethnic minority judges and magistrates right across the country.

I think that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Lammy\u2019s review said prosecutions against some BME suspects should be deferred or dropped to help tackle the bias against them in the criminal justice system. He said allowances should also be made for younger defendants\u2019 immaturity and criminal records should be sealed to help former offenders find work, adding that statistics suggested discrimination was worse than in the US in some cases. The inspectorate found that the proportion of boys who identified as being from a BME background varied depending on the establishment, from one in five (21%) at the Keppel unit in West Yorkshire, to nearly three-quarters (71%) at Feltham in west London. The percentage identifying as being from a BME background also varied between STCs, from 33% at Oakhill in Buckinghamshire to 55% at Medway in Kent. Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cFor the first time, more than half of boys in prison identify as being from a black or minority ethnic background. \u201cSixteen months after the Lammy review was published, it is disturbing that disproportionality is growing.\u201d Between 2013-14 and 2017-18, the number of children including 18-year-olds held in YOIs, STCs and secure children\u2019s homes fell by 24%, from 1,318 to 997, according to HMIP\u2019s report. The assessment covered the experiences of boys in five male YOIs, plus a specialist unit for boys, and children \u2013 including a small number of girls \u2013 held in three STCs. The watchdog warned that too many youngsters felt unsafe in custody, saying signs of improvement have yet to translate into a significant shift in children\u2019s perceptions of their treatment and conditions. HMIP\u2019s analysis, based on a survey of 686 children detained in 2017-18, found just over a third (34%) of those held in STCs reported feeling unsafe at some point since arriving at the centre, while the figure was 40% for YOIs.",

      "bodyText": "A health board has been criticised over the case of a nursing assistant who murdered a neighbour in a sexually motivated attack while under investigation for abusing three patients with learning disabilities. Kris Wade had been suspended from work for three years after the allegations of sexual abuse when he murdered his neighbour, Christine James, at her flat on Cardiff Bay in south Wales. An independent review has highlighted a string of concerns about the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board\u2019s (ABMUHB) handling of the case. It pointed out that Wade, who is the son of a former director of the health board, did not undergo a police records check before he moved from a job in IT to his role working with vulnerable adults. The review from Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) concluded there was an \u201cunacceptable delay\u201d in recognising the first alleged attack on a resident as a safeguarding issue. It also challenged a key conclusion made in an internal review that the health board could not have predicted or prevented the murder. Wade murdered James in March 2016 when she rejected his advances after he had turned up at her flat with a suitcase containing sex toys. He was jailed for a minimum of 21 years. The HIW reviews said Wade, whose father is a former clinical director of the health board\u2019s learning disability directorate, was first employed at ABMUHB in its IT department, but in 2004 he began his job as a nursing assistant at an acute assessment and treatment unit (unit A) after it was suggested working with screens may have been contributing to his ill-health. In December 2011, one of the residents of unit A made several allegations to staff that Wade had inappropriately touched and sexually assaulted her. Wade was placed on special leave but after a police investigation and disciplinary review it was decided that no further action would be taken and he returned to work at a second residential unit. Two more residents came forward to allege that Wade had sexually assaulted them while they were at unit A. Wade was suspended \u2013 on pay \u2013 and again the police investigated and passed on details to the Crown Prosecution Service but it decided that he should not be charged. The health board began its own disciplinary process. A dismissal letter was sent to Wade in April 2016 stating that the health board was terminating his employment for gross misconduct as, on the balance of probability, inappropriate behaviour had taken place. But by this time Wade was on remand having been arrested for the murder of James. HIW made 24 recommendations for improvement and said key findings included: There was an unacceptable delay in recognising and reporting the first allegation as a safeguarding issue. The redeployment of Wade to the learning disability directorate did not follow the health board\u2019s redeployment policy. No CRB or DBS checks were ever completed for Wade. The conclusion by the internal review that Wade\u2019s actions outside of his employment could not have been predicted or prevented was not evidence-based. There was no evidence to either support or refute this. ABMUHB\u2019s chief executive, Tracy Myhill, said: \u201cOur hearts go out to the three women who were sexually assaulted by Kris Wade while they were under our care. We again apologise sincerely to them for his abhorrent actions, and continue to offer them any ongoing support they might need. \u201cWe also extend our sympathies to the family of Mr Wade\u2019s neighbour, whom he murdered while on long-term suspension from work. \u201cMuch has changed since Mr Wade was first employed over 15 years ago.

McCullin said the nation \u201cused to be very tolerant, and now we\u2019ve lost a lot of that tolerance\u201d. He added: \u201cRight now, England is in such an uncomfortable place, because of Brexit. I\u2019ve found an England even more confused than ever \u2026 we\u2019re in a mess, a God almighty mess.\u201d McCullin, whose pictures of struggling industrial communities in County Durham in the 1970s illuminated the social strife there, said England was \u201csliding down the global wealth scale\u201d, adding that \u201cpoor people, in the north of England in particular, haven\u2019t had a fair slice of the cake\u201d. The photographer toured England, visiting some of his former haunts, for the BBC Four documentary Don McCullin: Looking For England. He expressed a desire not to knock his country too much, saying he has always been proud of his compatriots\u2019 fortitude. But he added: \u201cThings have moved on from the earlier days and the pride I had for England. For instance, we have had the most appalling, appalling violence, which has overtaken our country in the last year \u2026 and that is very, very embarrassing.\u201d \u2022 Don McCullin: Looking For England will broadcast on BBC Four on Monday 4 February at 9pm.",
