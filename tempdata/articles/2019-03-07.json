      "bodyText": "Theresa May will make a last-ditch attempt to persuade the EU to give her a better Brexit deal on Friday, as she struggles to hold her crumbling government together following a day of cabinet embarrassments in Westminster. The prime minister will plead with EU leaders to offer further concessions, as it became clear that talks in Brussels have stalled and hardline Eurosceptics in her party are likely to vote down the deal for a second time in parliament next week. Senior Tory critics of May expressed astonishment that her strategy was a refusal to change course in the face of defeat, with one cabinet source saying No 10 realised it was about to lose the meaningful vote but seemed unable to make a coherent case to MPs why they should vote for it. Instead, May will turn her fire at the EU in a speech delivered from the Brexit stronghold of Grimbsy in Lincolnshire, saying: \u201cJust as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too. \u201cIt is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal. We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.\u201d The speech will take place after a series of unforced errors by three cabinet ministers, forcing May\u2019s chief spokeswoman to insist the prime minister still had confidence in them all. As cabinet discipline appeared to break down, Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, had to issue a grovelling apology for saying that deaths caused by police and soldiers during the Troubles were \u201cnot crimes\u201d. Then Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, had to say sorry for referring to the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, as a \u201ccoloured woman\u201d, and Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, suggested it should be for the Foreign Office to hold a debate on allegations of Islamophobia in the UK. One Conservative former cabinet minister said it was \u201clike the last days of Rome\u201d and it was difficult to see how May would last many more weeks, even if her Brexit deal scraped through under heavy pressure. The consensus among dozens of Tory MPs and ministers spoken to by the Guardian was that the withdrawal deal would not pass, as it appeared unlikely that Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, would secure a legally binding agreement from the EU that the Irish backstop was temporary. Without such an assurance, the hardline Eurosceptics in the European Research Group (ERG) and the Democratic Unionist party will have no reason to change their vote, as they will not countenance the idea that the UK could be bound into a permanent customs union with the EU. Given the likelihood of defeat, there was heavy speculation in Westminster that May will end up pulling the votes she had promised MPs on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit and a second on whether to extend article 50. A senior government adviser said she could announce straight after losing the meaningful vote that she would seek an extension from the EU, knowing that she would only get either a short technical extension to enable the passing of her withdrawal deal or a lengthy 21-month one enabling a full rethink \u2013 dubbed a Brexit reset. The prime minister would then return to the House of Commons for a third time to put those proposals to a vote. May has a serious problem with holding a vote on whether parliament should rule out no deal, as it is unclear which side of the argument she would be on and would risk resignations of cabinet ministers from each side of the Brexit debate if she whipped in either direction.

His comments were a strong hint that May would have to reach out to Labour and try to agree a Brexit involving a permanent customs union if the deal is not voted through in its current form. \u201cThe Labour party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the PM\u2019s deal. Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very hard about the implications of voting against the prime minister\u2019s deal next Tuesday, because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will have to be forged across the House of Commons and that will inevitably mean compromises being made,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Amid an absence of ideas about how to break the stalemate, former prime minister Gordon Brown joined a group of business leaders in calling for a one-year extension to article 50 in order to set up region by region public hearings on which Brexit option is preferred. Responding to May\u2019s speech, Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, said it was \u201cbecoming increasingly clear that Theresa May will not be able to deliver the changes she promised to her failed Brexit deal [and] this speech looks set to be an admission of failure.\u201d There were reports from Brussels on Thursday night that the EU was open to making an offer on bolstering the review system for the Irish backstop but it was not clear this would be enough for Cox to change his legal advice that the mechanism could bind the UK into a permanent customs union.

Barker explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To the bewilderment of some EU negotiators, Geoffrey Cox, the UK\u2019s attorney-general, invoked the Victorian-era legal concept to explain how a revamped system of arbitration could guarantee the Northern Ireland backstop plan is not \u201cindefinite\u201d. </p> <p>The proposal, based around the judgment of an imaginary south London commuter, aimed to find a fair escape route from the provisions of the backstop, the part of the Brexit deal most loathed by Eurosceptics. </p> <p>But the suggestion by Mr Cox, Britain\u2019s top legal officer, was flatly rejected in Brussels and has little chance of surviving even in watered-down form, according to EU officials ...</p> <p>\u201cThey have no clue,\u201d said one official handling Brexit, who added that the UK\u2019s ideas were becoming \u201ccrazier and crazier\u201d. Other senior EU diplomats were scathing about Mr Cox, a barrister depicted as a latecomer to the talks, improvising beyond his expertise. Noting the attorney-general\u2019s booming voice, one joked that the discussions had reached a point of \u201cboom and bust\u201d.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c814a6de4b016d23425743c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-07T16:44:45.309Z\">4.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from the New Statesman\u2019s <strong>George Eaton.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/1103687680460754944\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A year ago, Amber Rudd said the new registration scheme for EU migrants would be \u201cas easy as setting up an online account at LK Bennett\u201d.

Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by Home Office or [the ministry for communities] as appropriate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-07T20:12:04.574Z\">at 8.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c814010e4b016d23425736d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-07T16:04:20.805Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon reprimanded by statistics chief for using unpublished hospital waiting time figures</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong>has been reprimanded by the UK\u2019s statistics regulator for using unpublished data to defend her government\u2019s widely-criticised performance on hospital waiting times.</p> <p>Ed Humpherson, the director general for regulation at the <strong>UK Statistics Authority</strong>, wrote to the Scottish government\u2019s chief statistician, Roger Halliday, today to chide the first minister for quoting figures which could not be independently verified by outsiders and had not come from NHS Scotland\u2019s statistics service.</p> <p>Humpherson said the authority had previously complained about ministerial use of this unpublished data, produced for Sturgeon by her officials, when it had been used on another occasion at Holyrood. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Waiting times are a major concern to patients and their families.</p> <p>The statistics informing debates about them must therefore be trustworthy, of suitable quality, and useful.

As the Press Association reports, Hunt said this was the \u201crisk\u201d from Salmond broadcasting on the Kremlin-backed channel, which was formerly known as Russia Today. The former SNP leader - who is no longer a member of the party - turned to broadcasting after losing his seat in the Commons in the 2017 election. The Alex Salmond Show has been broadcasting on RT since November that year. </p> <p>Hunt was speaking about the risks cyber attacks can pose to democracies during a visit to Glasgow and he was asked if Salmond\u2019s TV show was a threat to British security, or just a threat to SNP credibility. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s more about the SNP credibility when they do these kind of things and I think is the same risk that Jeremy Corbyn runs with the Labour party in the UK. Corbyn has an approach that essentially he will support anyone who shares his anti-western world view. Therefore, by definition, if you are anti-America, anti-Israel, anti the west, then he will support you.

In it, Johnson discussed how as London mayor he responded to an earlier rise in such crimes with a massive increase in police stop-and-search operations.</p> <p>The scheme, called Operation Blunt Two, was \u201cone thing we did that I think helped to reduce the stabbings\u201d, he said. Opponents warned more stop-and-search could be discriminatory, Johnson wrote: \u201cWe ignored these voices. It worked.\u201d</p> <p>There is, however, more to this narrative than billed. A <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508661/stop-search-operation-blunt-2.pdf\">Home Office analysis</a> of Blunt Two in 2016 found that while knife crime did fall during Johnson\u2019s tenure, there\u2019s no evidence that the focus on stop-and-search had anything to do with it.</p> <p>The study, highlighted today by the Liberal Democrats, examined crime levels in various London boroughs which saw differing levels of police action. There was, the authors said, \u201cno discernible crime-reducing effects from a large surge in stop and search activity at the borough level during the operation\u201d.</p> <p>A parallel analysis of ambulance service data on calls for weapons-related injuries in the report found that the number of such callouts actually fell faster in the boroughs with lower levels of weapons searches.</p> <p>The authors stress this does not definitively mean the operation was a failure, only that any positive effect cannot be measured. Either way, it\u2019s not quite the picture painted by Johnson.</p> <p>The Lib Dems\u2019 home affairs spokesman, <strong>Ed Davey</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>His gall would be impressive if it weren\u2019t so destructive. Instead of reducing crime, expanding Stop and Search will only increase discrimination and undermine the community relations police officers need to prevent knife crime.</p> <p>We know what is needed to tackle this knife crime epidemic: more police, more youth services and a proper public health approach.

He started by saying that he could not comment on the detail of the negotiations, but he then ended up being more forthcoming than one might have expected.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Cox rejected EU claims that the UK has not put forward a clear plan to amend the backstop.</strong> He may have been responding in particular to<strong> Nathalie Loiseau</strong>, the French Europe minister, who made this specific charge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/07/uk-should-offer-new-brexit-proposal-french-europe-minister-says\">in an interview today with the Guardian, </a>but other EU figures have been saying much the same, either directly or in anonymous briefings. Commenting on the talks, Cox said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are discussing detailed, coherent, careful proposals. We are discussing text with the European Union. I am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last 48 hours that the proposals are not clear. They are as clear as day. And we are continuing to discuss them.</p> </blockquote> <p>In her Guardian interview Loiseau said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are still waiting for a proposal from London. It\u2019s really a British initiative which has to come ...</p> <p>At this stage we know what the UK does not want, and that\u2019s a first phase, but it\u2019s not necessarily enough ... We have not heard proposals, ideas or initiatives coming from the British government to overcome the current difficulties.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Cox said talks with the EU on the backstop would resume \u201cvery shortly\u201d and could go through the weekend.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These discussions ... are going to be resuming very shortly. They are going to be continuing almost certainly through the weekend and we will endeavour to give the House as early notice as we can if and when we have something to report.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would publish his legal advice on any new document negotiated with the EU.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He implied that the government was no longer seeking to reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement.</strong> Asked if it was government policy to reopen the agreement, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop which will cause me to ... change my advice. That is government policy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He joked about his new backstop plan being known as \u201cCox\u2019s codpiece\u201d.</strong> Tory Brexiters have been using the phrase to diminish what Cox is trying to achieve, implying that any assurances he get will just be cosmetic, intended to disguise the horrors of the backstop.

If it gets defeated again, there will be a vote on Wednesday on a no-deal Brexit and, if that option gets rejected, there will be a vote on Thursday on extending article 50. Hammond would not say how the government would ask its MPs to vote on the no-deal motion, assuming May\u2019s deal falls again, but no one expects the government to whips its MPs to vote in favour and Hammond said he had a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that the Commons would reject no deal.</p> <p>So what would happen then? Nick Robinson asked Hammond if he would be willing to accept the idea of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU for good (Labour\u2019s policy) as an alternative. Hammond did not reject the idea, or explicitly endorse it, but he strongly hinted that this was what might happen if Tory Brexiters continued to reject May\u2019s deal. He told Robinson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I would say is this: you are not raising an issue that isn\u2019t widely known and understood, that the Labour party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the PM\u2019s deal. </p> <p>Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very, very hard about the implications of voting against the prime minister\u2019s deal next Tuesday, because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will have to be forged across the House of Commons, and that will inevitably mean compromises being made.</p> <p>The way for my colleagues to avoid that is to vote for the prime minister\u2019s deal on Tuesday and get it done.</p> </blockquote> <p>The fact that Hammond is making the argument in these terms is probably a measure of how desperate the government is getting ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, which it is widely expected to lose. I will be doing a lot more on this as the day goes on.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, gives a speech in Glasgow on \u201cDefending Democracy in the Cyber Age\u201d. </p> <p><em>10.10am: </em>Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 10.30am: </em>Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announces next week\u2019s Commons business to MPs.</p> <p><em>1.35pm: </em>Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, speaks at the Enders media conference.</p> <p>As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said he concluded that Bradley had to go after hearing a damning assessment of her from Nuala O\u2019Loan, the former police ombudsman in Northern Ireland. (See 3.42pm.) Relatives of people killed in Northern Ireland by the military have also said Bradley should resign because of what she said about the Troubles yesterday. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has apologised to Diane Abbott for \u201cclumsy language\u201d after describing the shadow home secretary as \u201ccoloured\u201d in a radio interview. The Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, has been accused of ignoring repeated pleas by Tory members to investigate alleged racist and Islamophobic incidents, including a claim that a white senior party official referred to an Asian councillor as an orangutan. Geoffrey Cox is facing a backlash in Brussels and Dublin after claiming the Irish backstop posed a risk to the human rights of people in Northern Ireland. Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out holding an unofficial Scottish independence referendum, after her deputy suggested she could call one without legal approval. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. According to Alex Barker at the Financial Times (paywall), Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, caused some surprise in the Brexit talks in Brussels on Tuesday night by raising the notion of \u201cthe man on the Clapham omnibus\u201d - a longstanding concept in English law, but a phrase that features in the EU treaties. Barker explains: To the bewilderment of some EU negotiators, Geoffrey Cox, the UK\u2019s attorney-general, invoked the Victorian-era legal concept to explain how a revamped system of arbitration could guarantee the Northern Ireland backstop plan is not \u201cindefinite\u201d. The proposal, based around the judgment of an imaginary south London commuter, aimed to find a fair escape route from the provisions of the backstop, the part of the Brexit deal most loathed by Eurosceptics. But the suggestion by Mr Cox, Britain\u2019s top legal officer, was flatly rejected in Brussels and has little chance of surviving even in watered-down form, according to EU officials ... \u201cThey have no clue,\u201d said one official handling Brexit, who added that the UK\u2019s ideas were becoming \u201ccrazier and crazier\u201d. Other senior EU diplomats were scathing about Mr Cox, a barrister depicted as a latecomer to the talks, improvising beyond his expertise. Noting the attorney-general\u2019s booming voice, one joked that the discussions had reached a point of \u201cboom and bust\u201d. This is from the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton. On a day when two cabinet ministers are already in trouble for comments that caused offence, the Labour MP Naz Shah has queried why, when she asked for a debate on Islamophobia earlier today during business questions, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said this would be a matter for the Foreign Office. I\u2019ve asked Leadsom\u2019s office for an explanation, and will post the answer when I get a reply. UPDATE: Asked why Leadsom said this was an issue for the Foreign Office, a spokesperson for her office said: Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. It was thought that the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia. International efforts to combat Islamophobia (and all forms of religious persecution and prejudice) are led by the PM\u2019s special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swiftly by Home Office or [the ministry for communities] as appropriate. Nicola Sturgeon has been reprimanded by the UK\u2019s statistics regulator for using unpublished data to defend her government\u2019s widely-criticised performance on hospital waiting times. Ed Humpherson, the director general for regulation at the UK Statistics Authority, wrote to the Scottish government\u2019s chief statistician, Roger Halliday, today to chide the first minister for quoting figures which could not be independently verified by outsiders and had not come from NHS Scotland\u2019s statistics service. Humpherson said the authority had previously complained about ministerial use of this unpublished data, produced for Sturgeon by her officials, when it had been used on another occasion at Holyrood. He said: Waiting times are a major concern to patients and their families. The statistics informing debates about them must therefore be trustworthy, of suitable quality, and useful. We are therefore extremely disappointed that it has been necessary for us to intervene in this way. He said the figures were already due to be officially released by the NHS\u2019s information services division in May 2019. Jumping the gun, without clear guidance about the data\u2019s quality and limitations, risked undermining public confidence, he said. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, urged Sturgeon to apologise at first minister\u2019s questions. She would not do so, but said her government would \u201creflect carefully on anything that the Office for Statistics Regulation says. She said: The statistics that I used were accurate and, as I understand it, are available to anybody on request and will be published by ISD Scotland. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson has defended Karen Bradley. This is from the Labour MP David Lammy on why Amber Rudd\u2019s \u201ccoloured\u201d comment was offensive. (See 2.42pm.) Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, says the comments from Nuala O\u2019Loan, the former police ombudsman in Northern Ireland, about Karen Bradley on the World at One (see 2.04pm) show that Bradley no longer has the credibility she needs to stay in her job. He said: Today I wrote to Karen Bradley, asking her to come to the Commons and give a real apology for her comments. But following the former ombudsman\u2019s comments, it\u2019s clear that Karen Bradley does not have sufficient credibility to stay in her post. This was not just a gaffe and Bradley did not simply \u2018misspeak\u2019. What she said reflected a disturbing pattern, with her and the prime minister having made a succession of baseless claims about military personnel being treated unfairly compared to others. If Theresa May can\u2019t find a replacement, they must finally tell us what the government is going to do with Northern Irish legacy cases. Here is the letter Lloyd wrote to Bradley earlier. The Labour MP Jess Phillips has again used a Commons debate about International Women\u2019s Day to read out a complete list of women killed by men (or where the principal suspect is a man) in the UK since the last such day. It took her just over four minutes to read out the entire list, in chronological order of their deaths. The first was Jennifer Rogers, 56, stabbed by her husband on 17 March last year. Her husband was jailed for manslaughter. The last was Sarah Henshaw, 40, found dead in her flat in Armley, Leeds on 11 February. A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Before reading the list, Phillips said: I read these names not only to continue to highlight how male violence can terrorise ordinary women\u2019s lives, but to pay tribute to them, and those who didn\u2019t survive, and give them the opportunity to be heard. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story on Amber Rudd calling Diane Abbott \u201ccoloured\u201d. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has described Amber Rudd\u2019s decision to call her coloured \u201coutdated, offensive and revealing\u201d. Abbott has also retweeted this tweet from the Labour MP Danielle Rowley. And this one from the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush. Amber Rudd has apologised. She said she was \u201cmortified at my clumsy language\u201d and has apologised for describing Diane Abbott as \u201ccoloured\u201d. (See 2.42pm.) Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has referred to Diane Abbott as \u201ccoloured\u201d. As Patrick Maguire reports at the Staggers, she used the term in an interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2. Speaking about the abuse directed at MPs (see 1.12pm), Rudd said: It definitely is worse if you\u2019re a woman, and it\u2019s worst of all if you\u2019re a coloured woman. I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, and I think that\u2019s something we need to continue to call out. As a former home secretary, where equality and diversity issues are part of the portfolio, you would have thought that she would have known better than to use a term that, although once commonplace, has been considered offensive in mainstream discourse for decades. Alex Salmond\u2019s RT chat show could create the impression the former first minister and the SNP do \u201cnot understand the difference between good and evil\u201d, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has claimed. As the Press Association reports, Hunt said this was the \u201crisk\u201d from Salmond broadcasting on the Kremlin-backed channel, which was formerly known as Russia Today. The former SNP leader - who is no longer a member of the party - turned to broadcasting after losing his seat in the Commons in the 2017 election. The Alex Salmond Show has been broadcasting on RT since November that year. Hunt was speaking about the risks cyber attacks can pose to democracies during a visit to Glasgow and he was asked if Salmond\u2019s TV show was a threat to British security, or just a threat to SNP credibility. He replied: It\u2019s more about the SNP credibility when they do these kind of things and I think is the same risk that Jeremy Corbyn runs with the Labour party in the UK. Corbyn has an approach that essentially he will support anyone who shares his anti-western world view. Therefore, by definition, if you are anti-America, anti-Israel, anti the west, then he will support you. That is why he refused to condemn Russia over the novichok attacks in Salisbury. And I think Alex Salmond runs exactly the same risk of fundamentally showing people that the SNP doesn\u2019t understand the difference between good and evil, and doesn\u2019t understand that for all its fault the international order that we have at the moment has done more to promote freedom and democracy than any international order we have had in history. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has hit back at EU complaints that his proposals to end the Brexit deadlock have been too vague, saying that negotiations in Brussels will continue throughout the weekend. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has urged hard Brexiters to vote for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal or risk a soft Brexit compromise, even if concessions on the backstop can\u2019t be secured from the EU. The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has been forced to make a humiliating apology for the \u201coffence and hurt\u201d caused after she suggested deaths caused by soldiers and police during the Troubles were not crimes. Speaking on the World at One, Nuala O\u2019Loan, a former police ombudsman in Northern Ireland, said Bradley\u2019s comment yesterday showed that she was not fit to do the job. O\u2019Loan said: [Bradley\u2019s] comments demonstrated a total lack of understanding, a total disregard for the rule of law, and I think that somebody who holds the position of secretary of state, and is supposed to be attempting to help us build a new Northern Ireland, should not have said what she said. And when she came back to the Commons, she didn\u2019t even apologise to the people who must have been devastated by what she said. She said the 10% [of deaths during the Troubles] at the hands of the military and the police were not crimes, they were people acting under orders and instructions, fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way. I do not think that that is a proper description. It is not even in any way allowing for the process of investigation and prosecution, where prosecution is required. It demonstrates a mindset which I think is incompatible with the office of secretary of state ... What Karen Bradley has said has demonstrated yet again that she is not fit to be the secretary of state for Northern Ireland. She does not understand the history of Northern Ireland, she does not understand the extent to which I, as police ombudsman, and others over the decades have been investigating situations where police officers and members of the military were involved in crime, and have been convicted of crime. It simply shows a total lack of comprehension of Northern Ireland and we cannot continue to have a secretary of state who is in such a state of ignorance and who does not even understand the basic principles of governance and law. Rank-and-file police officers have reacted with fury to suggestions by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that forces should move resources to prioritise tackling knife crime. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has announced that Labour has asked the economic historian Robert Skidelsky to carry out a review into the case for a shorter working week. Britain\u2019s equality watchdog has said it believes Labour may have \u201cunlawfully discriminated against people\u201d, as it announced the first step of a statutory inquiry into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints. Keith Brown, the deputy leader of the Scottish National party, has said Nicola Sturgeon should call a second independence referendum without waiting for the legal powers to do so. The top civil servant at the Department for Exiting the EU is to retire early at the end of March, the Press Association reports. Philip Rycroft, 57, was appointed permanent secretary in October 2017 after predecessor Olly Robbins moved to 10 Downing Street to be the prime minister\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. Rycroft, who joined DExEU as second permanent secretary in 2016 shortly after the EU referendum, will be replaced at the department by Clare Moriarty, currently top civil servant at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Wednesday\u2019s Daily Mail carried a long opinion piece by Boris Johnson about how to curb the current spate of stabbings involving young people. In it, Johnson discussed how as London mayor he responded to an earlier rise in such crimes with a massive increase in police stop-and-search operations. The scheme, called Operation Blunt Two, was \u201cone thing we did that I think helped to reduce the stabbings\u201d, he said. Opponents warned more stop-and-search could be discriminatory, Johnson wrote: \u201cWe ignored these voices. It worked.\u201d There is, however, more to this narrative than billed. A Home Office analysis of Blunt Two in 2016 found that while knife crime did fall during Johnson\u2019s tenure, there\u2019s no evidence that the focus on stop-and-search had anything to do with it. The study, highlighted today by the Liberal Democrats, examined crime levels in various London boroughs which saw differing levels of police action. There was, the authors said, \u201cno discernible crime-reducing effects from a large surge in stop and search activity at the borough level during the operation\u201d. A parallel analysis of ambulance service data on calls for weapons-related injuries in the report found that the number of such callouts actually fell faster in the boroughs with lower levels of weapons searches. The authors stress this does not definitively mean the operation was a failure, only that any positive effect cannot be measured. Either way, it\u2019s not quite the picture painted by Johnson. The Lib Dems\u2019 home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, said: His gall would be impressive if it weren\u2019t so destructive. Instead of reducing crime, expanding Stop and Search will only increase discrimination and undermine the community relations police officers need to prevent knife crime. We know what is needed to tackle this knife crime epidemic: more police, more youth services and a proper public health approach. We mustn\u2019t let Boris\u2019s dishonest arguments distract us. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has highlighted the abuse that female politicians receive on Twitter by recording a video giving examples of some of the insults she has received herself. The most controversial poster that appeared during the referendum campaign in 2016 was the \u201cBreaking Point\u201d one unveiled by the then Ukip leader, Nigel Farage. It was launched only hours before a far-right terrorist murdered the Labour MP Jo Cox. Today For Our Future\u2019s Sake, the youth and student campaign for a second referendum, have produced a rather effective parody. Superimposing pictures of Brexiters over the images of migrants in the original, it says the country is being \u201cswamped by a tide of incompetents\u201d. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, has delivered an abject apology for what she said yesterday about all military and police killings in Northern Ireland during the Troubles being lawful. Yesterday afternoon she clarified what she meant, saying that she was just making a point about the security services generally acting within the law, but her new statement goes much further. She apologises and says she is \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for the offence she caused. She says her language was \u201cdeeply insensitive\u201d. Here is the statement in full. Yesterday I made comments regarding the actions of soldiers during the Troubles. I want to apologise. I am profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt that my words have caused. The language was wrong and even though this was not my intention, it was deeply insensitive to many of those who lost loved ones. I know from those families that I have met personally just how raw their pain is and I completely understand why they want to see justice properly delivered. I share that aim and that is why I launched the public consultation on addressing the legacy of the Troubles. My position and the position of this government is clear. We believe fundamentally in the rule of law. Where there is any evidence of wrongdoing this should be pursued without fear or favour whoever the perpetrators might be. That is a principle that underpins our approach to dealing with legacy issues and it is one from which we will not depart. There was an urgent question in the Commons earlier on knife crime. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, used it to criticise Philip Hammond, the chancellor, for saying in interviews this morning that the police should tackle knife crime by redeploying resources from other areas. Abbott said: Many people will find the fact that the chancellor of the exchequer is suggesting that all the police have to do is move resources from other areas to fight knife crime is monstrous, and an insult to grieving families? Victoria Atkins, the Home Office minister who was responding, did not directly address Abbott\u2019s claim in her response, but pointed to the government decision to \u201cincrease police resources by nearly a billion pounds\u201d last month. A few minutes ago in the Commons Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, just accused Geoffrey Cox\u2019s parliamentary private secretary Alex Burghart of trying to intimidate him. Francois said that, after he asked Cox a question about whether it was appropriate for Cox to \u201cmark his own homework\u201d by giving legal advice on the Brexit deal he was negotiating, Burghart came up to him to complain his question was \u201cindecent\u201d. In response, John Bercow, the speaker, dismissed the complaint, saying that Francois was \u201cnot a notably delicate flower\u201d. Bercow said that he knew this from personal experience. He said he remembered being rude to Francois himself when they met at a conference in 1983. He told Francois he was \u201cintellectually knee-high to a grasshopper\u201d, Bercow said. (He has got a phenomenal memory). Bercow implied Francois did not seem to mind too much, telling MPs that what he said did no harm to Francois\u2019 career. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just confirmed that MPs will vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal on Tuesday next week. She said that, if the government loses the vote, she will make a further business statement on Tuesday about how the government will allow a vote on a no-deal Brexit, followed by a vote on extending article 50 if no deal gets rejected. But she did not say, as May originally proposed, that the no-deal vote would be on the Wednesday and the article 50 extension debate on Thursday. That could be a hint that both of those votes might take place on Wednesday, as Laura Kuenssberg suggested last night. (See 10.10am.) Here are the main points from what Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, told MPs about the Brexit talks. He started by saying that he could not comment on the detail of the negotiations, but he then ended up being more forthcoming than one might have expected. Cox rejected EU claims that the UK has not put forward a clear plan to amend the backstop. He may have been responding in particular to Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, who made this specific charge in an interview today with the Guardian, but other EU figures have been saying much the same, either directly or in anonymous briefings. Commenting on the talks, Cox said: We are discussing detailed, coherent, careful proposals. We are discussing text with the European Union. I am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last 48 hours that the proposals are not clear. They are as clear as day. And we are continuing to discuss them. In her Guardian interview Loiseau said: We are still waiting for a proposal from London. It\u2019s really a British initiative which has to come ... At this stage we know what the UK does not want, and that\u2019s a first phase, but it\u2019s not necessarily enough ... We have not heard proposals, ideas or initiatives coming from the British government to overcome the current difficulties. Cox said talks with the EU on the backstop would resume \u201cvery shortly\u201d and could go through the weekend. These discussions ... are going to be resuming very shortly. They are going to be continuing almost certainly through the weekend and we will endeavour to give the House as early notice as we can if and when we have something to report. He said he would publish his legal advice on any new document negotiated with the EU. He implied that the government was no longer seeking to reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement. Asked if it was government policy to reopen the agreement, he said: It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop which will cause me to ... change my advice. That is government policy. He joked about his new backstop plan being known as \u201cCox\u2019s codpiece\u201d. Tory Brexiters have been using the phrase to diminish what Cox is trying to achieve, implying that any assurances he get will just be cosmetic, intended to disguise the horrors of the backstop. But Cox sought to appropriate the jibe. He told MPs: It has come to be called \u201cCox\u2019s codpiece\u201d. What I am concerned to ensure that is what is inside the codpiece is in full working order. ITV\u2019s Alastair Stewart implies the phrase may be more appropriate than Cox was willing to admit. This is what the Labour is saying in response to the announcement from Equality and Human Rights Commission that it is starting an investigation into allegations about antisemitism in the party. A spokesperson said: We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC. Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations. Antisemitism complaints received since April 2018 relate to about 0.1% of our membership, but one antisemite in our party is one too many. We are determined to tackle antisemitism and root it out of our party. Attorney general questions are now over. I will post a summary shortly. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, asks why the \u201cstar chamber\u201d set up by Tory MPs to assess Cox\u2019s new deal does not include any Labour MPs. Cox says he will be presenting his views to the \u201cstar chamber\u201d of the Commons. Cox says he will publish his legal opinion on any new document negotiated with the EU. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry asks Cox if he has advised Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, that what she said yesterday about the military not breaking the law when they killed people during the Troubles was ill-advised, and possibly in contempt of court. Cox says Bradley has corrected what she said. The DUP\u2019s Gavin Robinson says Cox if he agrees that, if the backstop were to be permanent, it would breach the Belfast agreement. Cox says he cannot give a direct answer, because that would breach the convention that he must not disclose legal advice to the government. But he says that the issue Robinson raised as not escaped him. Bob Neill, the Tory chair of the justice committee, asks Cox if he agrees that media commentary on the negotiation is unhelfpul. Cox agrees. The running commentary is \u201coften based on hearsay and rumour\u201d, and it is not conducive to the negotiation, he says. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks why the EU would consider an alternative arbitration system, given there is already one in the backstop plan. Cox says what matters is the question that gets put to the arbitration system. Cox says the talks with the EU will resume \u201cvery shortly\u201d and could continue over the weekend. Cox says he has put \u201cdetailed, coherent, careful proposals\u201d to the EU. He says he was surprised to read claims from Brussels saying the opposite. His plans were \u201cas clear as day\u201d, he says. It is attorney general questions in the Commons. It is only a 20-minute slot, and normally it attracts zero media interest. But, now that Geoffrey Cox, the AG, has been tasked with trying to rescue the Brexit talks, journalists are all ears Cox tells MPs that he cannot discuss the details of his negotiations with the EU, but he says the talks will resume \u201cshortly\u201d. Geoffrey Cox says talks with the EU on backstop assurances will resume \u201cshortly\u201d. Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman asks if it is still government policy to to re-open the withdrawal agreement. Cox says he is trying to get assurances that will allow him to change his legal advice about the possibility of the UK being trapped in the backstop. He says his plan has been referred to in the media as \u201cCox\u2019s codpiece\u201d. He says his task is to ensure that what is in the codpiece \u201cis in full working order\u201d. Britain\u2019s equality watchdog has said it believes Labour may have \u201cunlawfully discriminated against people\u201d as it announced the first step of a statutory inquiry into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. An Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) spokesperson said: Having received a number of complaints regarding antisemitism in the Labour party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour party to give them an opportunity to respond. Here are some of the main Brexit stories around overnight and this morning. The Financial Times (paywall) says Downing Street fears it will lose control of the Brexit process if it loses the vote next week. Downing Street insiders conceded that if Mr Cox did not secure the \u201clegally binding\u201d changes he would need in order to alter his assessment, Mrs May would be heading for another crushing defeat next week. \u201cIf we lose the vote on March 12, we lose control,\u201d admitted one aide to the prime minister, adding that within days of such a defeat parliament would vote to delay Britain\u2019s exit and that Europhile MPs would insist on a much softer form of Brexit. Gordon Rayner, in the Daily Telegraph splash (paywall), says ministers expect to lose next week\u2019s vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal by up to 100 votes. Theresa May\u2019s cabinet is resigned to her Brexit deal being defeated by up to 100 votes next week after talks in Brussels collapsed without progress on Wednesday. Downing Street is already making plans for a third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the deal on the assumption that Tuesday\u2019s vote is lost, and Mrs May is considering making a major speech on Friday to plead for support from MPs. One minister said it appeared \u201ccertain\u201d that the Commons vote on the Brexit deal will be lost, and that Mrs May\u2019s next move would depend on the scale of the defeat. Nick Gutteridge and Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun say the UK-EU talks on the backstop are \u201con the verge of collapse\u201d. Alberto Nardelli at BuzzFeed has details of a note summarising a briefing to EU ambassadors yesterday about the two new backstop proposals presented by the UK to Brussels. The UK is still looking for ways to change the substance of the Brexit deal agreed with the European Union despite having been repeatedly told that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened, according to a diplomatic note seen by BuzzFeed News. Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard in his London Playbook briefing summarises some EU reaction to the British proposals. My POLITICO colleague Jacopo Barigazzi emails from Brussels after multiple conversations with EU diplomats who explained the opposition to the UK\u2019s proposals. \u201cThe UK wants this [arbitration] panel to be able to declare the backstop \u2018nil,\u2019\u201d one diplomat tells Jacopo. \u201cWalking out by the UK is not an option for the EU. Backstop is not a backstop if one can unilaterally walk out of it.\u201d This, fundamentally, remains the problem for the EU side, just as it has been all along. Another diplomat is somewhat blunter about Britain\u2019s approach. \u201cThe requests were insane,\u201d the official says. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says there is talk of the votes on a no-deal Brexit and on extending article 50 both being held on Wednesday next week, instead of over two days as planned (Wednesday and Thursday). Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told Tories earlier (in terms) that if they did not back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit, they could end up with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit. His interview coincided with Corbyn himself saying, in an article in the Daily Mirror, that he is \u201cmore certain than ever\u201d that he can construct a Commons majority for a softer Brexit. Referring to his meeting yesterday with Tory and Labour MPs backing the \u201cNorway plus\u201d Brexit, he wrote: On Tuesday, I met the five biggest organisations that represent Britain\u2019s businesses, large and small. They want what Labour wants, the uncertainty to end and a sensible deal to be struck. Yesterday, I saw senior Labour and Conservative MPs to discuss a close economic relationship with the EU, which would help protect jobs like those of the Honda workers in Swindon, some of whom I also met. I left both meetings more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs and more determined to achieve it. Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, is in Britain today for a conference of British and French mayors. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of her visit, she said the UK should put forward new ideas to resolve the Brexit crisis. She was also on Today this morning. She told the programme the withdrawal agreement could not be re-opened. We cannot reopen this negotiation on the withdrawal agreement because it is balanced... We don\u2019t like the backstop, we don\u2019t want to have to implement it, and if we have to, we don\u2019t want to stay in the backstop. We all agree that it should be temporary, and that it\u2019s a last resort solution. As my colleague Matthew Weaver reports, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, also used his Today interview to reject calls from Sajid Javid, the home secretary, for an emergency fund to tackle the surge in knife crime. \u201cVote for Theresa May\u2019s deal, or you will end up with a soft Brexit.\u201d Those weren\u2019t quite the words that Philip Hammond, the chancellor, used in his interview on the Today programme this morning, but undoubtedly that was his message. May has promised MPs a new vote by Tuesday on her deal. If it gets defeated again, there will be a vote on Wednesday on a no-deal Brexit and, if that option gets rejected, there will be a vote on Thursday on extending article 50. Hammond would not say how the government would ask its MPs to vote on the no-deal motion, assuming May\u2019s deal falls again, but no one expects the government to whips its MPs to vote in favour and Hammond said he had a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that the Commons would reject no deal. So what would happen then? Nick Robinson asked Hammond if he would be willing to accept the idea of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU for good (Labour\u2019s policy) as an alternative. Hammond did not reject the idea, or explicitly endorse it, but he strongly hinted that this was what might happen if Tory Brexiters continued to reject May\u2019s deal. He told Robinson: What I would say is this: you are not raising an issue that isn\u2019t widely known and understood, that the Labour party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the PM\u2019s deal. Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very, very hard about the implications of voting against the prime minister\u2019s deal next Tuesday, because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will have to be forged across the House of Commons, and that will inevitably mean compromises being made. The way for my colleagues to avoid that is to vote for the prime minister\u2019s deal on Tuesday and get it done. The fact that Hammond is making the argument in these terms is probably a measure of how desperate the government is getting ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, which it is widely expected to lose. I will be doing a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, gives a speech in Glasgow on \u201cDefending Democracy in the Cyber Age\u201d. 10.10am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons. After 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announces next week\u2019s Commons business to MPs. 1.35pm: Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, speaks at the Enders media conference. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I wrap up, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

While Americans, Britons and Canadians vote during the week, Australians vote on Saturdays, making it easier for people to get to the polls. There\u2019s a holiday atmosphere at booths, where community groups raise money by selling cupcakes, raffle tickets and \u201cdemocracy sausages\u201d. Specially-made stalls for secret voting are another Australian invention, and political parties have no role in running elections, which are left to non-partisan public servants \u2013 \u201csomething Americans can only dream of,\u201d Brett says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a3d850a5f2ecf4cf0735c5ee5830f919d0752de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3d850a5f2ecf4cf0735c5ee5830f919d0752de/0_0_5700_3796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judith Brett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judith Brett, author of From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage: How Australia got Compulsory Voting.

Digging into the history of Australia\u2019s unique voting system, she found it was steeped in the colonies\u2019 foundations and culture.</p> <p>America\u2019s early political ideas, came from the philosopher John Locke, who held that individuals and their rights came before government. But by the time the Australian colonies were establishing their institutions in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the ideas of political reformer Jeremy Bentham were in vogue. Bentham rejected the idea of natural or divine rights preceding governments \u2013 rights are created by law, so government comes first. Australians needed governments to build roads, railways and other infrastructure and tended to trust them. \u201cGovernment came before society in Australia and was gratefully accepted,\u201d Brett writes.</p> <p>It helped that people who migrated to Australia tended to be the ambitious middle class rather than members of the aristocracy. \u201cThey can try out some of the new ideas, there is a commitment to not reproducing the class hierarchy and the status hierarchies of the old world,\u201d Brett says.</p> <p>While Australia was not the first country to have compulsory voting \u2013 that was Belgium \u2013 it happened early, with Queensland the first state in 1914 (for whites only). Federally, it has been compulsory to vote in elections since 1924.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6699185bd1698c352e18e862902d75eeb3d9afa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6699185bd1698c352e18e862902d75eeb3d9afa5/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"From Secret Ballot To Democracy Sausage: How Australia got Compulsory Voting, by Judith Brett.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Secret Ballot To Democracy Sausage: How Australia got Compulsory Voting, by Judith Brett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Text Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that the uninterested or the ignorant should not be forced to vote never took serious hold, with modern surveys showing more than 70% support for compulsory voting. The most common argument in favour when it was introduced, writes Brett, was that \u201cthe elected government should represent not just the majority of those who vote but the majority of those eligible to vote. This would increase the government\u2019s legitimacy and make sure it paid attention to the interest of all the people\u201d.</p> <p>Today, more than 90% of those on the roll turn up. You don\u2019t actually have to vote, but you have to attend a polling booth, even if you stuff a blank or spoiled ballot in the box.</p> <p>Australia was an electoral innovator in many ways, but the historic disenfranchisement of Indigenous people is a \u201cshameful story\u201d, Brett says. When the 1902 federal Franchise Act came to be debated, the proposed law would have given \u201call adult persons\u201d the right to vote in a national election, including Indigenous Australians as well as women \u2013 but the new government compromised to get the bill passed. The West Australian senator Alexander Matheson moved the amendment denying the vote to Indigenous people, saying, \u201cSurely it is absolutely repugnant to the greater number of the people of the commonwealth that an Aboriginal man, or Aboriginal lubra or gin \u2013 a horrible, dirty, degraded creature \u2013 should have the same rights, simply by virtue of being 21 years of age, that we have, after some debate today, decided to give to your wives and daughters.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/10/barack-obama-praises-australias-mandatory-voting-rules\">Barack Obama praises Australia's mandatory voting rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It took until 1962 for Indigenous Australians in all states to get the right to vote in federal elections, and it was only after the election of the Hawke government in 1983 that they were required to enrol. The Franchise Act, Brett says, became another of the \u201cinfamous stepping stones of cruelty and shame\u201d in the treatment of First Australians.</p> <p>Compulsory voting keeps politics focused on the centre rather than the fringe of politics. To win elections, political parties have to appeal not just to their base but to the majority of people. Australia is also one of only a few countries with preferential voting, which means a voter ranks candidates in order of preference, compared with most countries where the candidate with the most votes wins. It ensures that those elected have the support of the majority of voters.</p> <p>\u201cIt keeps the emotional temper of the conflict down,\u201d says Brett. \u201cThat\u2019s become more evident recently with the way politics has gone in the United States, where you\u2019ve had issues around sexuality and race being used to motivate voters. If you need to get out the vote, you need to have things that people are going to feel passionate about, and that\u2019s not necessarily such a good thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"964c65fc8f5fde4b9a8bcf0d673a2900cf879221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/964c65fc8f5fde4b9a8bcf0d673a2900cf879221/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A youth climate rally held in Brisbane on December 8, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By attempting to appeal to the fringe right on climate change, the Coalition has got \u2018right out of whack\u2019 with the majority of the population, Brett says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brett gives the example of the fringe right within the Liberal party that has fiercely rejected action on climate change \u2013 the issue that cost former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull his job. Yet most Australians want serious action on climate change and the party has \u201cgot themselves right out of whack, and you can see [prime minister] Scott Morrison trying to pull them back desperately now\u201d.</p> <p>Brett disagrees with commentators who argue Australian politics is becoming as polarised as the United States. It\u2019s \u201clazy thinking \u2026 our political culture is pretty different.

      "bodyText": "A couple of years ago, Judith Brett\u2019s publisher told her his \u201cpublisher\u2019s nose was twitching\u201d. Donald Trump had been elected with only a quarter of eligible voters supporting him, and just 37% of eligible Britons voted to leave the European Union. \u201cAll of a sudden people were realising what an advantage for us in Australia that we had compulsory voting,\u201d says Brett, a historian and academic. Her publisher, Michael Heyward, said to himself, \u201cWhen did we get it?\u201d Australia, which has had six prime ministers in eight years, is suffering from an increasing mistrust in politicians, in parties, even in democracy. And in the next few months \u2013 the lead-up to a federal election \u2013 politics is set to become even more dispiriting. Yet, according to Brett, Australia has a degree of inoculation from the polarisation infecting politics in the United States, the UK and much of Europe. Her new book, From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage, teases out the reasons \u2013 prosaic at one level, profound at another. Australia is one of only 19 countries out of 166 electoral democracies where voting is compulsory, and one of only nine that enforce it. It is the only English-speaking country that compels its citizens to vote. The impact is hard to overstate. In 2015, former US president Barack Obama praised Australia\u2019s system, saying it would be \u201ctransformative\u201d if everyone voted in the United States. But Australia\u2019s system is an electoral beacon for seemingly smaller reasons too. While Americans, Britons and Canadians vote during the week, Australians vote on Saturdays, making it easier for people to get to the polls. There\u2019s a holiday atmosphere at booths, where community groups raise money by selling cupcakes, raffle tickets and \u201cdemocracy sausages\u201d. Specially-made stalls for secret voting are another Australian invention, and political parties have no role in running elections, which are left to non-partisan public servants \u2013 \u201csomething Americans can only dream of,\u201d Brett says. Brett is known for her critically acclaimed works on Australia\u2019s Liberal party, including last year\u2019s National Biography award-winning The Enigmatic Mr Deakin. Digging into the history of Australia\u2019s unique voting system, she found it was steeped in the colonies\u2019 foundations and culture. America\u2019s early political ideas, came from the philosopher John Locke, who held that individuals and their rights came before government. But by the time the Australian colonies were establishing their institutions in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the ideas of political reformer Jeremy Bentham were in vogue. Bentham rejected the idea of natural or divine rights preceding governments \u2013 rights are created by law, so government comes first. Australians needed governments to build roads, railways and other infrastructure and tended to trust them. \u201cGovernment came before society in Australia and was gratefully accepted,\u201d Brett writes. It helped that people who migrated to Australia tended to be the ambitious middle class rather than members of the aristocracy. \u201cThey can try out some of the new ideas, there is a commitment to not reproducing the class hierarchy and the status hierarchies of the old world,\u201d Brett says. While Australia was not the first country to have compulsory voting \u2013 that was Belgium \u2013 it happened early, with Queensland the first state in 1914 (for whites only). Federally, it has been compulsory to vote in elections since 1924. The idea that the uninterested or the ignorant should not be forced to vote never took serious hold, with modern surveys showing more than 70% support for compulsory voting. The most common argument in favour when it was introduced, writes Brett, was that \u201cthe elected government should represent not just the majority of those who vote but the majority of those eligible to vote. This would increase the government\u2019s legitimacy and make sure it paid attention to the interest of all the people\u201d. Today, more than 90% of those on the roll turn up. You don\u2019t actually have to vote, but you have to attend a polling booth, even if you stuff a blank or spoiled ballot in the box. Australia was an electoral innovator in many ways, but the historic disenfranchisement of Indigenous people is a \u201cshameful story\u201d, Brett says. When the 1902 federal Franchise Act came to be debated, the proposed law would have given \u201call adult persons\u201d the right to vote in a national election, including Indigenous Australians as well as women \u2013 but the new government compromised to get the bill passed. The West Australian senator Alexander Matheson moved the amendment denying the vote to Indigenous people, saying, \u201cSurely it is absolutely repugnant to the greater number of the people of the commonwealth that an Aboriginal man, or Aboriginal lubra or gin \u2013 a horrible, dirty, degraded creature \u2013 should have the same rights, simply by virtue of being 21 years of age, that we have, after some debate today, decided to give to your wives and daughters.\u201d It took until 1962 for Indigenous Australians in all states to get the right to vote in federal elections, and it was only after the election of the Hawke government in 1983 that they were required to enrol. The Franchise Act, Brett says, became another of the \u201cinfamous stepping stones of cruelty and shame\u201d in the treatment of First Australians. Compulsory voting keeps politics focused on the centre rather than the fringe of politics. To win elections, political parties have to appeal not just to their base but to the majority of people. Australia is also one of only a few countries with preferential voting, which means a voter ranks candidates in order of preference, compared with most countries where the candidate with the most votes wins. It ensures that those elected have the support of the majority of voters. \u201cIt keeps the emotional temper of the conflict down,\u201d says Brett. \u201cThat\u2019s become more evident recently with the way politics has gone in the United States, where you\u2019ve had issues around sexuality and race being used to motivate voters. If you need to get out the vote, you need to have things that people are going to feel passionate about, and that\u2019s not necessarily such a good thing.\u201d Brett gives the example of the fringe right within the Liberal party that has fiercely rejected action on climate change \u2013 the issue that cost former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull his job. Yet most Australians want serious action on climate change and the party has \u201cgot themselves right out of whack, and you can see [prime minister] Scott Morrison trying to pull them back desperately now\u201d. Brett disagrees with commentators who argue Australian politics is becoming as polarised as the United States. It\u2019s \u201clazy thinking \u2026 our political culture is pretty different. There may be that level of polarisation within the political class, because they\u2019re much more heated in the way they argue their politics, but there\u2019s not so much evidence of it, I don\u2019t think [among the general population].\u201d Australians may distrust their politicians and abhor their behaviour, she says, but they value the role of government in their lives and they trust their electoral system. Australians look overseas and are shocked with how few people turn up to vote. Americans find it astonishing that anyone would be compelled to do so. Brett has always favoured compulsory voting, and she is not sure why other countries have not embraced it. \u201cIn the US, I think it\u2019s because of the value they put on individual liberty, the political culture is just not majoritarian. In England, I think it\u2019s because of the fact that there\u2019s still a deep class bias in their political system.\u201d Other comparable countries such as Canada or New Zealand have voluntary voting, too. The idea is beginning to be discussed in a more serious way as a reform that could rekindle faith that governments are there to serve all the people. Australians barely know their own history, Brett says, but their electoral system is worth celebrating. It\u2019s perhaps as important as Gallipoli in forging who we are. \u201cAustralia was born not on the battlefields but at the ballot box.\u201d \u2022 From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage: How Australia Got Compulsory Voting, by Judith Brett, published by Text Publishing.",

      "bodyText": "An exciting new research project by the Guardian and Team Populism shows empirically what many have asserted and felt: the world is getting more populist. Professor Kirk Hawkins, from Brigham Young University in Utah, and 46 researchers analysed 728 public addresses by 140 presidents and prime ministers in 40 countries, in Europe and the Americas. This is the largest comparative project of this nature I am aware of, and a treasure trove for academics and journalists. The study shows not just that the number of populist leaders has doubled, but that the average populist content of political leaders\u2019 speeches has doubled too. Where political speeches were on average \u201cnot populist\u201d in 2004, they are approaching \u201csomewhat populist\u201d today. To be clear, most of the political leaders studied were \u201cnot populist\u201d, but that is to be expected of this particular subset of politicians, ie national leaders. Even today, populism is still primarily a feature of political challengers, who were not included in this study. As expected, politicians that are broadly considered to be populist, such as the late Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, president of Turkey, scored highest on the populism scale (\u201cvery populist\u201d), but some mainstream politicians scored \u201csomewhat populist\u201d too, such as the former Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader and the former Latvian PM Einars Rep\u0161e. Some have even come to use a discourse, at least occasionally, that is even more populist than some true populists\u2019. The most striking example in the dataset is Theresa May\u2019s speech to the 2018 Conservative party conference, which can easily hold its own with Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural address a year earlier. These findings confirm that we are living with a populist zeitgeist, in an era when aspects of populism have become dominant within the political debate. More and more mainstream politicians are using \u201cpro-people\u201d and/or \u201canti-elite\u201d rhetoric to win voters \u2013 in part to fight off electoral challenges from true populist actors. But populist sentiments are not limited to party politics. Both traditional and, particularly, social media are consumed by populist sentiment. Nowadays it is \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d (a popular populist phrase) that \u201cthe elite\u201d is corrupt and that \u201ccommon sense\u201d (another one) is being ignored. Even movies and songs celebrate populist values, such as John Rich\u2019s Shuttin\u2019 Detroit Down (2009) and even Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Sweet Home Alabama (2002). Programmes that celebrate \u201cthe people\u201d, from American Idol to Big Brother have replaced those glorifying \u201cthe elite\u201d \u2013 such as Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. This populist zeitgeist has also led to the normalisation of the term populism on both the left and the right by intellectuals and politicians. For instance, the rightwing Dutch premier, Mark Rutte, claims that (his) \u201cgood populism\u201d is the best antidote to \u201cbad populism\u201d, even though the parties of \u201cgood populism\u201d \u2013 Rutte\u2019s conservative VVD and the (nominally) Christian democratic CDA \u2013 have nosedived in the polls; meanwhile \u201cbad populism\u201d is polling at record levels \u2013 ie Geert Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom (PVV) and Thierry Baudet\u2019s Forum for Democracy (FvD). And on the other side of the political spectrum, leftwing intellectuals such as Chantal Mouffe and politicians including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon argue that only \u201cleft populism\u201d can defeat the populist radical right. Importantly, neither Rutte\u2019s \u201cgood populism\u201d nor Mouffe\u2019s \u201cleft populism\u201d is really populist in the sense that most scholars use the term today. As I have argued before, Rutte\u2019s (good) populism is really nativism (lite). It attacks the ethnic other (notably Muslims) rather than the corrupt elite (of which his own party, the VVD \u2013 the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy \u2013 is by far the most significant representative). And Mouffe\u2019s \u201cleft populism\u201d fundamentally rejects the monism that defines populism, instead defending a pluralist vision that, despite the rhetoric, is best described as social democracy. In the public discourse, populism is mainly used as a synonym for anti-establishment sentiments, the idea that \u201cthe elite\u201d is corrupt, or at least incompetent or ineffective. This sentiment is now so widespread that most \u201celites\u201d \u2013 which include academics and journalists \u2013 have internalised it. With references to populist vagaries such as \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201csilent majority\u201d, they hope to show that they are on the side of \u201cthe people\u201d, and therefore part of the political solution. In reality, they just confirm the frustrations and prejudices of the populist electorates. The only way to change the populist zeitgeist is to denounce both populism (lite) and anti-populism \u2013 in which \u201cthe people\u201d are seen as corrupt and the (former) elite as morally pure. As Mouffe rightly argues, we have to (re)politicise the political debate, but by openly acknowledging and respecting the pluralism of our societies \u2013 in terms of interests and opinions, rather than ethnicities or religions.
