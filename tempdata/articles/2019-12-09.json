The picture makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee5fd38f08951c7479d28a#block-5dee5fd38f08951c7479d28a\">today\u2019s Daily Mirror splash</a>. Johnson repeatedly refused to comment on the picture, which Pike had on his phone, and kept making general points about the NHS. It is not unusual for politicians to avoid difficult topics in interviews, but as he was speaking Johnson took Pike\u2019s camera, and placed it in his pocket (apparently to stop Pike asking further questions about it), thinking that his ploy would be out of shot. But the cameraman filmed what he was doing, and Pike revealed it to viewers, and so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joepike/status/1204018593656180736\">the clip</a> when viewed in its entirety is much more damaging to Johnson than the usual \u201cpolitician dodges tricky question\u201d footage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee50298f0820fa95dad0e6#block-5dee50298f0820fa95dad0e6\">Labour has been saying that it is evidence that Johnson \u201ccould not care less\u201d. </a>Pike\u2019s clip has now attracted 3.7m viewers. One of the features of this election is that it has seen broadcast journalists increasingly using short interviews to record combative clips that go viral on social media. Granada\u2019s <strong>Hannah Miller </strong>achieved <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hannahITV/status/1203336121368928257\">the same thing at the weekend</a>, confronting Johnson with challenging questions about cuts to children\u2019s services. Lord Reith would probably not approve, but given that Johnson is avoiding a lot of long-form media scrutiny during this campaign, like the Andrew Neil interview, it is not surprising that some of the reporters who do get the chance to ask him questions are going for him robustly. Viewers probably want to see politicians quizzed like this. This definitely counts as a bad day for Johnson, but in trying to assess how much difference it might make, it is important to keep things as perspective. It is not as bad as when Gordon Brown called a woman a bigot in the 2010 campaign for raising concerns about immigration, and post-election analysis subsequently concluded that bigot-gate had no effect on the result at all. Labour even won the constituency where the voter was insulted.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1204100056762265600\">ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has blamed \u201csenior Tories\u201d for telling him and other journalists that a special adviser to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had been assaulted by anti-Tory protesters outside Leeds general hospital.</a> </strong>Subsequently video footage shows that the aide, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee86518f08be0cbf46d26d#block-5dee86518f08be0cbf46d26d\">accidentally hit by an outstreched arm.</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1204100056762265600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is completely clear from video footage that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MattHancock</a>'s adviser was not whacked by a protestor, as I was told by senior Tories, but that he inadvertently walked into a protestor's hand.

The subsequent UK-EU trade deal will be another matter entirely, and the only template for that is <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_political_declaration.pdf\">the 27-page political declaration (pdf).</a> But increasingly Tories have been arguing that this deal is close to conclusion too (even though it is not) and Johnson was giving the same impression at the Q&amp;A. In response to questions about whether manufacturing companies in the north-east would be safe after Brexit, Johnson said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The great thing about the deal that we have ready to go is that it protects businesses, it protects supply chains, it means we leave the EU with our relationships absolutely intact, so that we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota relationship with the EU as we come out. We protect our supply chains ....</p> \n   <p>The thing about the deal we\u2019ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it. So, as we come out, it\u2019s all protected from the point of view of big, motor manufacturing investors in our country ...</p> \n   <p>We have a decent deal ... What it also does is it keeps us in a state of grace, a state of equivalence with our European Union friends and partners. So the zero-tariff, zero-quota arrangements that we have, the just-in-time supply chains, they remain absolutely there, perfect and intact. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Under Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, Britain would be in a transition period until the end of 2020, during which current trade arrangements would continue to apply. This may be what Johnson was referring to when he spoke about the UK staying in a \u201cstate of equivalence\u201d. But Johnson also seemed to be implying that this would be a long-term goal. As explained earlier (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/09/general-election-labour-sets-out-plan-for-first-100-days-in-office-live-news?page=with:block-5dee29888f08e7796de8f511#block-5dee29888f08e7796de8f511\">11.10am)</a>, an eventual trade deal that fully protects supply chains might be possible \u2013 but only if Johnson were to abandon what he has said in the past about wanting a Brexit that would allow the UK to diverge from EU regulation.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson refused to give details of the pledge that all Tory candidates have given him saying they will support his Brexit deal.</strong> Asked for how long they would be bound by this pledge, he just said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They have pledged to me personally to support the deal we have done.

Joseph, 65, terminal cancer patient, Northern Ireland</em></p> \n  <p>Given the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution, this is partly down to convention. However, as the existing prime minister, Boris Johnson would have the first go at forming a government. If he could not command a majority, according to the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60641/cabinet-manual.pdf\">cabinet manual</a>, the Whitehall bible for government operations, the Queen would then call the leader \u201cwho appears most likely to be able to command the confidence of the house\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: If there is the possibility of a hung parliament with Labour, which party would they most likely go into a coalition with and why? Angel, digital marketing apprentice, Milton Keynes</em></p> \n  <p>While the polls suggest a Conservative majority, it remains possible that the Tories would fail to achieve this, which could bring a minority Labour government, backed by other parties. Rather than a formal coalition, some sort of confidence-and-supply or even case-by-case arrangement seems more likely. Parties are understandably wary of speculating before an election about how this would work, and it would need complex negotiations. As to who: Labour could potentially expect support from the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens. But there are many complications, for example the SNP\u2019s demand for a new independence referendum, and Jo Swinson\u2019s insistence that the Lib Dems could not help put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. In short: a lot would remain to be seen.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: The PM keeps saying that we have a great economy, but do we? No one is pulling him up on it. Bill Muskett, 66, retired, Cheshire</em></p> \n  <p>You can argue all day about the strength or otherwise of the economy, depending on whether you cite, say, employment figures or data on in-work poverty. But you\u2019re right on one key point: Boris Johnson has managed to get through almost all the election with remarkably little scrutiny of nearly 10 years of Tory rule, in part due to his fairly ludicrous claim to be \u201ca new administration\u201d. It\u2019s partly a media failure, partly a factor of the endless focus on Brexit.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:45:31.010Z\">at 1.45pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee496d8f0820fa95dad092\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:26:52.963Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just under five minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election.

Do you have any hope for the future? If so, what is it? Rob Perry, Norwich</em></p> \n  <p>It has, in truth, been a pretty depressing election so far. If I am to look at the positives for the future, politics is extremely changeable at the moment, and party fortunes could rise and fall very quickly. One factor could be pushes for electoral reform \u2013 the more the first-past-the-post system creates anomalies (such as Ukip winning nearly 13% of the vote in 2015 and getting precisely one seat), the more pressure there will be for a proportional system. If that happened, people could forget tactical voting and just pick the party whose politics they like the most. This could arguably create a more consensual type of politics.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will a Labour defeat end Corbyn\u2019s career? Peter, retired, North Yorkshire</em></p> \n  <p>As someone who got (mildly) booed by a Labour crowd the other week for asking Corbyn if he would retire if he lost another election, it\u2019s fair to say some activists would like him to stay on. But it does seem likely he would step down as leader (if not as an MP). The struggle in Labour is already half-ongoing for who could succeed him, and whether it would be a keeper of the Corbyn flame, such as Rebecca Long-Bailey, or someone from a different section of Labour.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: In the event of a Labour win and a second referendum, which way would Boris Johnson vote? Chris, 47, author and business owner, Warrington</em></p> \n  <p>That answer, officially, would be between him and the ballot box. But as someone who has, after some wavering, tied his political colours so tightly to the mast of Brexit, he would presumably be expected to argue very strongly for leave \u2013 unless he really disliked Labour\u2019s Brexit plan and, for example, called for a boycott of the referendum.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:31:18.828Z\">at 1.31pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee492e8f0820fa95dad08e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:22:12.535Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>chartered a plane this morning for part of his campaign dash across the UK - from Doncaster to Teesside (even though it would only be a few hours by road).</p> \n  <p>The plane had an unmistakeable odour after the prime minister, his aides and the travelling press pack had spent time in a fish market in Grimsby this morning.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was not commenting in the morning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5be23ba-19d0-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\">on the leaked paper casting doubt on the viability of his Brexit plan</a>.

Is the scrutiny being felt within the media, and what effect is it having? Josh Rodell, 27, engineer, London</em></p> \n  <p>The social media world is not necessarily more fractious than past eras, but it does make it easier for people to express their annoyance. As such, more or less everywhere you turn there have been criticisms of the media \u2013 notably the BBC \u2013 for supposed bias. My own, completely personal, view is that (within the basic paradigm of a fundamentally small-c conservative viewpoint) the BBC tries extremely hard to be balanced and generally does a decent job, despite occasional cock-ups. What is mentioned less is the naked partisanship of many newspapers, a tone which is ramped up all the more at elections.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why is Jeremy Corbyn so unpopular with non-Labour voters? Is it more his personality or specific policies? George G, 62, fascinated with UK politics, Virginia, US</em></p> \n  <p>You could come up with all sorts of answers to this. Focus groups identify both, and it does seem that hostile voters can identify Corbyn in a somewhat contradictory way as being both too radical and too indecisive. It is, however, worth always seeing these opinions in the context of the treatment of Corbyn by the majority of the print media, which is consistently hostile to him. Yes, many people get their news elsewhere, but the repeatedly negative front-page headlines about Corbyn arguably set a wider tone. This is not to say that there are not valid criticisms of the Labour leader, but the context is important, too.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why is it not illegal to openly lie and mislead the electorate? Dave, West Midlands</em></p> \n  <p>I suppose the short answer is that a law on this would be hugely difficult to enforce, not least to prove lying involves showing intent as well as inaccuracy, and it would be a very subjective and controversial process. But would I like more public condemnation and shame for politicians who openly say things that they, and we, know are not true? Yes, I would.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:34:54.427Z\">at 1.34pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee3a4b8f0820fa95dacf90\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T13:14:34.578Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">John McDonnell's speech and Q&amp;A - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from <strong>John McDonnell</strong>\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A.

Vicki, Cumbria</em></p> \n  <p>You could make the argument \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/02/hugh-grant-i-want-to-do-my-bit-to-prevent-a-national-catastrophe\">has Hugh Grant</a>, among many others \u2013 that your friend could vote tactically in whatever constituency she lives in so as to have the most chance of preventing a Conservative MP and thus limiting or stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s majority.

There is Johnson and Corbyn promising everything, but the kitchen. Kim, 55, Manchester</em></p> \n  <p>This is an interesting area. Politicians promising the moon on a stick in elections is hardly a new phenomenon, but this campaign has seen an arguable increase in voter scepticism about many of these pledges. Sometimes the reason for the scepticism is obvious. For example, Boris Johnson has pledged to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, when the UK is merely part-way through a long and tricky departure process. Similarly, Jo Swinson\u2019s initial claim that she could become PM wasn\u2019t especially convincing.

But it would be very hard to do. If Boris Johnson won the election and lost his seat he would either need to be made a peer (you can be PM from the Lords, but in this Commons-centric era it would be pretty tough) or a loyal MP with a safe seat could resign, triggering a byelection. The latter would seem by far the most likely outcome.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Can we please have a definitive answer on whether or not there will be checks and paperwork needed for goods crossing the Irish Sea, over and above current ones, before the election please. John Davidson, 77, retired, Liverpool</em></p> \n  <p>The definitive answer seems to be: yes to \u201cchecks\u201d of some sort, though what these will be is up for debate and depends on the future Brexit deal.

This is a debate about people and their lives. This is a debate about people who are facing extreme prejudice and discrimination. It takes us back to a very similar situation to where we were on gay rights decades ago, when people were being told that they were somehow as a person wrong for being who they were. And the vitriol that was heaped on them by society drove people to huge mental crises, in many cases to misery and sometimes to suicide. We see that amongst non-binary and trans people today and I think we should be making sure that every individual is protected.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On the issue of women-only spaces, Swinson said the priority was to keep people safe. But she said processes were already in place to address this. She went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I do think it is important that people are protected. And I don\u2019t think there should be some kind of hierarchy of equality, because trans women are some of the most vulnerable women in our society facing huge discrimination. And all women who have been on the receiving end of violence deserve to have safe spaces, whether they are gay, straight, bi, whether they are trans, whether they are cis, whatever their race is, whatever their background they come from. And they need to be protected on that individual basis.</p> \n   <p>And I have to say, we are talking about a very small part of the population. And implicit in this is an assumption that trans women are in some way more likely to be violent. And it is just not borne out.

But all of the goods would have to be checked, and that would be the default position.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Johnson\u2019s plan would contravene the Act of Union. </strong>She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That, of course, is very concerning for us, because it goes very much to the heart of the Act of Union.

And if we are to have what has been proposed, then it wouldn\u2019t be free-flowing trade. And that of course causes us great concern. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said Johnson\u2019s plan could lead to shoppers in Northern Ireland not being able to buy goods on sale in Britain, or having to pay a higher price for them.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Most of our goods, particularly in the retail sector, come from Great Britain, and therefore any checks on those goods would lead to higher costs, perhaps even less choice, for people here in Northern Ireland, and that is completely unacceptable. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1125b5aececeb3d382761f728870848e37af6aef\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1125b5aececeb3d382761f728870848e37af6aef/0_106_5448_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster, the DUP leader.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster, the DUP leader.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T10:33:54.321Z\">at 10.33am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dee06dc8f08e7796de8f3f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T08:34:42.546Z\">8.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: The Guardian says voters are confused by your plans for an Australian-style points system.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson made one of his worst campaign trail errors today when he repeatedly tried to avoid having to confront emotive evidence of a young boy not getting proper treatment at an NHS hospital. He was giving a stand-up interview to ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, and Pike tried to get him to comment on a picture of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on the floor in Leeds general hospital, where he was being treated for suspected pneumonia, because there were no beds available. The picture makes today\u2019s Daily Mirror splash. Johnson repeatedly refused to comment on the picture, which Pike had on his phone, and kept making general points about the NHS. It is not unusual for politicians to avoid difficult topics in interviews, but as he was speaking Johnson took Pike\u2019s camera, and placed it in his pocket (apparently to stop Pike asking further questions about it), thinking that his ploy would be out of shot. But the cameraman filmed what he was doing, and Pike revealed it to viewers, and so the clip when viewed in its entirety is much more damaging to Johnson than the usual \u201cpolitician dodges tricky question\u201d footage. Labour has been saying that it is evidence that Johnson \u201ccould not care less\u201d. Pike\u2019s clip has now attracted 3.7m viewers. One of the features of this election is that it has seen broadcast journalists increasingly using short interviews to record combative clips that go viral on social media. Granada\u2019s Hannah Miller achieved the same thing at the weekend, confronting Johnson with challenging questions about cuts to children\u2019s services. Lord Reith would probably not approve, but given that Johnson is avoiding a lot of long-form media scrutiny during this campaign, like the Andrew Neil interview, it is not surprising that some of the reporters who do get the chance to ask him questions are going for him robustly. Viewers probably want to see politicians quizzed like this. This definitely counts as a bad day for Johnson, but in trying to assess how much difference it might make, it is important to keep things as perspective. It is not as bad as when Gordon Brown called a woman a bigot in the 2010 campaign for raising concerns about immigration, and post-election analysis subsequently concluded that bigot-gate had no effect on the result at all. Labour even won the constituency where the voter was insulted. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston has blamed \u201csenior Tories\u201d for telling him and other journalists that a special adviser to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had been assaulted by anti-Tory protesters outside Leeds general hospital. Subsequently video footage shows that the aide, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, was accidentally hit by an outstreched arm. Boris Johnson has threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away as a source of funding. He made the surprise revelation that this policy was under consideration at a Q&amp;A where he was facing hostile questions about his botched TV interview about the Leeds general hospital incident. His comments had all the hallmarks of a famous \u201cdead cat\u201d \u2013 a term that Johnson himself first put into the public domain, when he was revealing how the Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby (whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Isaac Levido is running the Conservative campaign) uses big media stories to distract attention from events that are getting negative coverage. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking his word over the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has revealed some of the contents of the first budget that he says Labour will hold on Wednesday 5 February if it wins the election. A Conservative general election candidate shared messages on social media claiming Muslims play the \u201crace card\u201d and have a \u201cnasty culture\u201d, in the latest escalation of concern over Islamophobia in the party. The Mail on Sunday falsely claimed that Labour was planning to scrap a tax exemption on homeowners, in a prominent story that has since been used by the Conservatives as part of their election campaign. As my colleague Jim Waterson reports, the press regulator Ipso ruled that the newspaper\u2019s reporting was inaccurate and \u201ccould cause significant concern to readers that, under a Labour government, they could be liable to pay a tax they are exempt from under current legislation.\u201d That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has posted this video clip of an incident involving Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, a special adviser to Matt Hancock, outside Leeds general hospital. If this is the only incident of physical contact, it does not really amount to him being hit, which is the allegation that was being made earlier and given to journalists. To say that he was hit would normally imply some intent. This video shows him being hit by accident. The Conservatives are on course to make significant gains in Wales, according to a YouGov poll. Labour is on 40%, only just ahead of the Tories (37%) and Plaid Cymru is in third place on 10%. Roger Awan-Scully, head of politics at Cardiff University, projected that if the figures are accurate this could leave Labour with 20 seats in Wales (down from 28 in 2017). The Conservatives could win 16 (10 more than in 2017) Awan-Scully said this would be the lowest Labour seat number in Wales since 1983 (when there were 38 rather than 40). Forty per cent of people said they believed Boris Johnson would be a good prime minister, while 33% said Jeremy Corbyn would do a good job in No 10. The poll was carried out for ITV Wales and Cardiff University. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been visiting Leeds General Infirmary, in an attempt to defuse the row generated by four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on the floor there when being treated, and Boris Johnson\u2019s reaction to it. He told BBC News that he was \u201chorrified\u201d by what happened. As a parent of young children who has had to visit A&amp;E with them, he said he could understand how the parents felt. Asked what he would say to them, he replied: It\u2019s not good enough, and I\u2019ve apologised. But Hancock said Jack\u2019s parents were not blaming the staff. And he said the hospital accepted it had a problem, and that it was taking steps to deal with it. He also said the government was putting in investment to address exactly this sort of problem. Asked why he had come in person, he said he wanted to get reassurance that the trust was doing everything it could. He said he had been impressed by their response, and by the work of the staff. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A earlier. Boris Johnson said the Conservatives were considering abolishing the TV licence. Here is ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on the consequences of this. It is also worth pointing out that Johnson seemed keen to set this running as a story because he was also facing strong criticism over another story with the potential to hog the headlines ... Johnson sidestepped questions about whether his attempt to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview showed that he did not care about problems facing NHS patients. (See 3.19pm.) He claimed that manufacturing firms reliant on EU supply chains would not lose out under his plan for Brexit. Throughout the whole campaign he has been arguing that he has a Brexit deal ready to go, referring to the withdrawal agreement. The subsequent UK-EU trade deal will be another matter entirely, and the only template for that is the 27-page political declaration (pdf). But increasingly Tories have been arguing that this deal is close to conclusion too (even though it is not) and Johnson was giving the same impression at the Q&amp;A. In response to questions about whether manufacturing companies in the north-east would be safe after Brexit, Johnson said: The great thing about the deal that we have ready to go is that it protects businesses, it protects supply chains, it means we leave the EU with our relationships absolutely intact, so that we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota relationship with the EU as we come out. We protect our supply chains .... The thing about the deal we\u2019ve got ... it makes sure we have complete equivalence when it comes to our standards, our industrial requirements and the rest of it. So, as we come out, it\u2019s all protected from the point of view of big, motor manufacturing investors in our country ... We have a decent deal ... What it also does is it keeps us in a state of grace, a state of equivalence with our European Union friends and partners. So the zero-tariff, zero-quota arrangements that we have, the just-in-time supply chains, they remain absolutely there, perfect and intact. Under Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, Britain would be in a transition period until the end of 2020, during which current trade arrangements would continue to apply. This may be what Johnson was referring to when he spoke about the UK staying in a \u201cstate of equivalence\u201d. But Johnson also seemed to be implying that this would be a long-term goal. As explained earlier (see 11.10am), an eventual trade deal that fully protects supply chains might be possible \u2013 but only if Johnson were to abandon what he has said in the past about wanting a Brexit that would allow the UK to diverge from EU regulation. Johnson refused to give details of the pledge that all Tory candidates have given him saying they will support his Brexit deal. Asked for how long they would be bound by this pledge, he just said: They have pledged to me personally to support the deal we have done. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which they fail to do that. We haven\u2019t lobotomised them, they\u2019ve done it of their own free will, they believe in this deal, they see it\u2019s the best way forward for our country and I think they will be crazy if they didn\u2019t see it was the best way forward. He claimed not to know why the Conservative party had paid Google to ensure that, when people searched for Labour\u2019s manifesto, a Tory website criticising it appeared ahead of it in search results. According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham, the Tory proposal to abolish the licence fee isn\u2019t just something dreamed up this afternoon to distract attention from the row about Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the story about a boy having to sleep on a hospital floor. Wickham says No 10 aides have been looking at this for weeks. That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that Johnson\u2019s decision to talk about it today wasn\u2019t a distraction exercise (or a \u201cdead cat\u201d, to use Lynton Croby\u2019s terminology). It certainly looked as if Johnson was talking this up (ignoring his own advice not to announce policy \u201con the hoof\u201d) to get reporters off the hospital story. And this is what Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary and outgoing Labour deputy leader, said about Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about considering abolishing the licence fee (See 2.37pm.). Watson said: This is a pathetic attempt by Boris Johnson to distract from his refusal to even look at the picture of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on a hospital floor. We already know that Boris Johnson is a danger to our NHS. His comments today reveal that he will threaten the very existence of another of Britain\u2019s great institutions, the BBC, by scrapping its funding mechanism. This is on top of the cruel decision to strip over-75s of their free TV licences. And here is Jeremy Corbyn commenting on the photograph that Boris Johnson did not want to talk about. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to say whether he would resign as Labour leader if Boris Johnson won the election. When he was asked this, he replied: We put forward a positive manifesto with a fully costed programme and I am taking that message out all over the country. That message is getting home to people. They realise this Thursday is a straight choice: do you want to carry on with austerity and underfunding of public services or do you want a Labour government that will tax fairly to fund properly. ICM has a new poll out. It suggests the Conservatives have a lead of just six points, which would put the UK in hung parliament territory, although, of course, it is not in line with most other polling, which points to Boris Johnson having a much bigger lead. In his Q&amp;A in Sunderland Boris Johnson was twice asked about his attempt to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview. The first question came from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, who asked if that incident said something about whether the Tories understood the real concerns of people living in the north of England. Johnson gave a general answer, without saying anything specific about his earlier interview with ITV\u2019s Joe Pike. (See 1.36pm.) Johnson said: I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019re doing to rebuild Leeds general infirmary and it\u2019s one of the hospitals we will rebuild from the beginning, it\u2019ll be a fantastic project. Then ITV\u2019s Paul Brand tried again. He said: One of your biggest challenges in this election is to persuade people that you really do care, that you really are trustworthy. And yet today when you\u2019re shown that picture of the four-year-old boy on the floor of an A&amp;E department you take the phone away and put it in your pocket, what does that say about how much you really care? Johnson said he had already addressed this. He went on: We are not only investing in children\u2019s services in Leeds but we\u2019re also rebuilding the whole Leeds infirmary from top to bottom. And we can do that because we\u2019re now putting the biggest ever investment into the NHS. What I don\u2019t want to see is a fantastic programme that is going to unite and level up our country being blocked again. In the original interview, when Pike did eventually get Johnson to look at the picture of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr sleeping on a hospital floor, Johnson said: It\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo. And I apologise obviously to the families and all those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS, and on the whole I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making huge investments into the NHS, and we can only do it if we get parliament going, if we unblock the current deadlock, and we move forward. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at a rally in Bristol. He is holding up the Daily Mirror splash, which features the story about four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr having to sleep on a hospital floor. He says the Tories have had nine years to invest properly in the NHS. [Boris Johnson has] had nine years to properly fund the NHS. A child being treated on the floor is a disgrace to our society. It\u2019s a child with pneumonia on the floor of a hospital in modern Britain. This is a disgrace. They need to invest in our public services. He also says Labour would not allow the NHS to be sold off to the Americans. He says the US wants to enter the British healthcare market. But healthcare stopped being a market when the NHS was set up by Labour in the 1940s, he says. This is what Boris Johnson said about considering scrapping the TV licence. He was responding to a question about what he would not abolish all TV licences. At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licences, though I am certainly looking at it. What I will say is that \u2013 I\u2019m under pressure not to extemporise policy on the hoof. But you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a media organisation still make sense in the long term, given the way other organisations manage to fund themselves. That\u2019s all I will say. I think the system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax \u2013 everybody has a TV \u2013 bears reflection, let me put it that way. How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels? That is the question. Abolishing the TV licence would have huge implications for the BBC, which relies on the TV licence for its funding. Johnson said that he did not want to make up policy on the hoof, but it did sound as if he was deliberating floating this as an idea \u2013 knowing that it would get picked up enthusiastically by the media (journalists are particularly interested in stories about how media organisations get their money \u2013 because he is also facing a lot of negative coverage over his attempt to avoid having to confront a picture of a boy being forced to sleep on a hospital floor in a TV interview. (See 1.36pm.) He did get tough questions about this at the Q&amp;A too. I will post a full summary soon. Boris Johnson said he is \u2018looking at\u2019 scrapping the BBC licence fee. Responding to a question about why he would not abolish all TV licences, Boris Johnson said: \u2018At this stage we are not planning to get rid of all TV licences, though I am certainly looking at it. \u2018I think the system of funding out of what is effectively a general tax \u2013 everybody has a TV \u2013 bears reflection, let me put it that way. How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of TV and radio channels? That is the question.\u2019 Q: Have you done enough to persuade people who voted Labour in the past to trust you? Johnson says: \u201cHow am I supposed to know? I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d He says Labour would be disastrous for the UK. Q: You are trying to show people you care. But when a reporter shows you a distressing image, you put the phone in your pocket. What does that say about about whether you care? Johnson says he has addressed this already. He wants more investment in the NHS. Q: What will people think of the fact that you could not even look at a picture of a four-year-old boy having to sleep on a hospital floor? Johnson says his government is putting more money into the NHS, and recruiting more nurses. He says you can only do that with a strong economy, and if you get Brexit done. That is why he hopes people will vote for a one nation Conservative government. Q: Services in Sunderland have been slashed. How can anyone trust your party on public services? Johnson says \u201cthis new, one nation government\u201d is determined to put more money into public services. He says he wants to lift national insurance, that would give everyone a \u00a3500 tax cut. (That would only happen if the national insurance threshold were raised to \u00a312,500 - which is only a long-term aspiration, and not something the Tories are committed to doing in the next parliament. The actual value of the national insurance cut proposed by the Tories is about \u00a385.) Q: Nissan has said it will leave if you do not get a decent Brexit deal. Johnson says he has a decent deal. The UK will be able to leave on 31 January. But it keeps the UK in a state of grace, a state of equivalence, with the EU. Q: It took five years to get a Canada deal. Johnson says the UK will leave in a state of equivalence. Johnson is now taking questions from journalists. Q: Why have you chosen Conservative candidates in Sunderland who are not from the area? Johnson says he thinks his candidates will do a fantastic job. Tony Blair did not have deep roots in Sedgefield, he said. Q: Why don\u2019t you abolish TV licences for everyone? Johnson says he won\u2019t make an unfunded promise at this stage of the campaign. But he thinks the BBC should cough up and pay for TV licences for all over-75s. He says you have to ask whether that system of funding still makes sense in the modern era. This is something he will look at, he says He says he won\u2019t go further than that now. Johnson questions long-term viability of the TV licence as a means of funding the BBC. Q: Would you fund the air ambulance? Johnson says this is an incredible organisation. He is surprised how little the government contributes to it. It can save lives. Johnson says the deal he has \u201cready to go\u201d will protect supply chains. It will involve complete equivalence, protecting supply chains. Johnson is now taking questions from employees. Q: Will it profit us, leaving the EU? Yes, says Johnson. He says he thinks there is investment worth $150bn dollars ready to come into the UK when Brexit happens. And he says the UK will be able to protect its supply chains because of the Brexit he will negotiate. Boris Johnson is doing a Q&amp;A at a factory in Sunderland. He is starting his with standard stump speech. Yesterday, in an interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Boris Johnson complained about EU migrants being able to treat the UK as if it were \u201cpart of their own country\u201d. He said: I\u2019ve said that what we want to do is bear down on migration, particularly of unskilled workers who have no job to come to and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened over the last couple of decades or more. You\u2019ve seen quite a large number of people coming in from the whole of the EU \u2013 580m population \u2013 able to treat the UK as though it\u2019s basically part of their own country and the problem with that is there has been no control at all and I don\u2019t think that is democratically accountable. This morning Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, described his attitude as \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cdog-whistle politics\u201d. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour in his interview with ITV\u2019s Joe Pike (see 1.36pm) claims he \u201ccould not care less\u201d about how the boy was being treated in hospital. Ashworth said: Refusing to even look at an image of a child suffering because of Conservative cuts to the NHS is a new low for Boris Johnson. It\u2019s clear he could not care less. Don\u2019t give this disgrace of a man five more years of driving our NHS into the ground. Sick toddlers like Jack deserve so much better. Here is ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston on Boris Johnson trying to avoid having to look at a picture of a boy having to sleep on the floor in a hospital. (See 1.36pm.) Thanks for all your questions Our political team will answer more of your questions about the election on Wednesday at 12.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. This is from ITV\u2019s Joe Pike, who tried to get Boris Johnson to look at the photograph of a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia having to sleep on the floor in a hospital because of a shortage of beds. Johnson at first refused to look at the photograph on Pike\u2019s phone until Pike effectively shamed him into doing so by revealing to viewers that Johnson had put the phone in his pocket. At that point Johnson said it was a \u201cterrible, terrible photo\u201d, and repeated the apology he had made earlier. (See 8.28am.) Q: In the event of no party having an overall majority on Friday, does the Queen decide who she will invite to form a coalition government or is it always the last PM given first stab at it? Joseph, 65, terminal cancer patient, Northern Ireland Given the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution, this is partly down to convention. However, as the existing prime minister, Boris Johnson would have the first go at forming a government. If he could not command a majority, according to the cabinet manual, the Whitehall bible for government operations, the Queen would then call the leader \u201cwho appears most likely to be able to command the confidence of the house\u201d. Q: If there is the possibility of a hung parliament with Labour, which party would they most likely go into a coalition with and why? Angel, digital marketing apprentice, Milton Keynes While the polls suggest a Conservative majority, it remains possible that the Tories would fail to achieve this, which could bring a minority Labour government, backed by other parties. Rather than a formal coalition, some sort of confidence-and-supply or even case-by-case arrangement seems more likely. Parties are understandably wary of speculating before an election about how this would work, and it would need complex negotiations. As to who: Labour could potentially expect support from the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens. But there are many complications, for example the SNP\u2019s demand for a new independence referendum, and Jo Swinson\u2019s insistence that the Lib Dems could not help put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. In short: a lot would remain to be seen. Q: The PM keeps saying that we have a great economy, but do we? No one is pulling him up on it. Bill Muskett, 66, retired, Cheshire You can argue all day about the strength or otherwise of the economy, depending on whether you cite, say, employment figures or data on in-work poverty. But you\u2019re right on one key point: Boris Johnson has managed to get through almost all the election with remarkably little scrutiny of nearly 10 years of Tory rule, in part due to his fairly ludicrous claim to be \u201ca new administration\u201d. It\u2019s partly a media failure, partly a factor of the endless focus on Brexit. Just under five minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election. Send them in to us here. Q: I\u2019ve never been more depressed about the state of the political system. Do you have any hope for the future? If so, what is it? Rob Perry, Norwich It has, in truth, been a pretty depressing election so far. If I am to look at the positives for the future, politics is extremely changeable at the moment, and party fortunes could rise and fall very quickly. One factor could be pushes for electoral reform \u2013 the more the first-past-the-post system creates anomalies (such as Ukip winning nearly 13% of the vote in 2015 and getting precisely one seat), the more pressure there will be for a proportional system. If that happened, people could forget tactical voting and just pick the party whose politics they like the most. This could arguably create a more consensual type of politics. Q: Will a Labour defeat end Corbyn\u2019s career? Peter, retired, North Yorkshire As someone who got (mildly) booed by a Labour crowd the other week for asking Corbyn if he would retire if he lost another election, it\u2019s fair to say some activists would like him to stay on. But it does seem likely he would step down as leader (if not as an MP). The struggle in Labour is already half-ongoing for who could succeed him, and whether it would be a keeper of the Corbyn flame, such as Rebecca Long-Bailey, or someone from a different section of Labour. Q: In the event of a Labour win and a second referendum, which way would Boris Johnson vote? Chris, 47, author and business owner, Warrington That answer, officially, would be between him and the ballot box. But as someone who has, after some wavering, tied his political colours so tightly to the mast of Brexit, he would presumably be expected to argue very strongly for leave \u2013 unless he really disliked Labour\u2019s Brexit plan and, for example, called for a boycott of the referendum. Boris Johnson chartered a plane this morning for part of his campaign dash across the UK - from Doncaster to Teesside (even though it would only be a few hours by road). The plane had an unmistakeable odour after the prime minister, his aides and the travelling press pack had spent time in a fish market in Grimsby this morning. Johnson was not commenting in the morning on the leaked paper casting doubt on the viability of his Brexit plan. His aides have been briefing against it though, with a Conservative spokesman saying: Our new deal with the EU takes the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, out of the EU. A Conservative majority government will implement this deal and agree a trade agreement next year. In doing so we will strengthen our union, and we will not extend the implementation period beyond December 2020. You have been sending in your questions about the general election which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: What is your view from the inside of how the areas of the media that have been attempting balance during this campaign have handled it? Is the scrutiny being felt within the media, and what effect is it having? Josh Rodell, 27, engineer, London The social media world is not necessarily more fractious than past eras, but it does make it easier for people to express their annoyance. As such, more or less everywhere you turn there have been criticisms of the media \u2013 notably the BBC \u2013 for supposed bias. My own, completely personal, view is that (within the basic paradigm of a fundamentally small-c conservative viewpoint) the BBC tries extremely hard to be balanced and generally does a decent job, despite occasional cock-ups. What is mentioned less is the naked partisanship of many newspapers, a tone which is ramped up all the more at elections. Q: Why is Jeremy Corbyn so unpopular with non-Labour voters? Is it more his personality or specific policies? George G, 62, fascinated with UK politics, Virginia, US You could come up with all sorts of answers to this. Focus groups identify both, and it does seem that hostile voters can identify Corbyn in a somewhat contradictory way as being both too radical and too indecisive. It is, however, worth always seeing these opinions in the context of the treatment of Corbyn by the majority of the print media, which is consistently hostile to him. Yes, many people get their news elsewhere, but the repeatedly negative front-page headlines about Corbyn arguably set a wider tone. This is not to say that there are not valid criticisms of the Labour leader, but the context is important, too. Q: Why is it not illegal to openly lie and mislead the electorate? Dave, West Midlands I suppose the short answer is that a law on this would be hugely difficult to enforce, not least to prove lying involves showing intent as well as inaccuracy, and it would be a very subjective and controversial process. But would I like more public condemnation and shame for politicians who openly say things that they, and we, know are not true? Yes, I would. Here are the main points from John McDonnell\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. The full text of his speech is here. McDonnell said that Boris Johnson was \u201cprobably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced\u201d and that people would agree with Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, who said this morning he could not be trusted. (See 12.09pm.) McDonnell said Labour would hold its first budget on Wednesday 5 February if it won the election. Explaining what would be in the budget, he said in his speech: This is the budget that will save the NHS, that starts to rebuild the public services the Tories have brought to their knees. A budget that will put money in people\u2019s pockets, a real living wage of \u00a310 an hour. Money to fix the worst aspects of universal credit, while we design its replacement, a 5% pay rise for public sector workers after years of pay freezes. The Waspi compensation scheme will be established and legislation brought forward to scrap tuition fees Urgent funding will be brought forward rapidly to tackle the funding crisis in our NHS, our schools and education service. To establish free personal social care and childcare, to bring forward urgent homeless support, and inject much needed resources into our council services, with a full comprehensive spending review to follow later in 2020 to allocate resources for the full five years. He said he would set up its new Treasury national transformation unit before Christmas if Labour won. (See 11.19am.) He said Labour would use people\u2019s assemblies to give people a say in how nationalised utilities were run. (See 11.21am.) He said Labour\u2019s enemies were \u201cpeople who hate the people of this country\u201d. (See 11.28am.) He referred to \u201cthose at the top\u201d, but he did not make it clear whether he was talking about Conservative politicians, or the financial elite, or the media - or all three - although he did implicate Boris Johnson, referring to contemptuous comments by the PM about the working class in some of his old newspaper articles. He denied being worried about the pound crashing in the event of a Labour victory, and instead said he thought it could go up in value. When it put to him that in the past he said a Labour victory could lead to a run on the pound, he claimed he had said the opposite. Labour had been advised that there would not be a run on the pound, he said. He went on: My fear is the pound will start going up because of our investment plans. He did not rule out trying to break up the giant tech companies. Asked if he was attracted by the idea, which is also favoured by Elizabeth Warren, one of the frontrunners to be the Democratic presidential candidate in the US in 2020, he replied: I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s about breaking them up or whether it\u2019s about proper regulation. That will be the debate and the discussion that we will be having. But there are clearly issues of accountability and there are clearly issues about the fair treatment of them as a sector, as against other sectors. Given that the major tech giants are all American, a British government would probably have very little say over this anyway. He refused to rule out a Sunday Times report saying he might take over as interim Labour leader in the event of the party losing the election. Asked about the story, he just insisted it was not a valid question because Labour would win. (See 11.39am.) He claimed Labour had inspired other progressive parties around the world to be more radical, including the Democrats in America. He said: I think we\u2019ve helped inspire the debate within the US, where the debate around radical policies has caught the wind, and all the Democratic candidates now are aspiring policies that maybe five or 10 years ago that they wouldn\u2019t have even considered. I think that\u2019s happening in a number of countries. He claimed that pundits would be surprised by the election result. People wanted real change, he said: I think what you\u2019ll see is, despite what\u2019s happening in the opinion polls, although the opinion polls have consistently being trending towards us, I think you\u2019ll see, as some of you were shocked in the 2017 general election, I think you\u2019ll be even more shocked this time. Q: A good friend says she won\u2019t vote because, although she is anti-Conservative, she would feel a hypocrite for voting Green, and Labour are too leftwing for her and she doesn\u2019t believe they can afford their manifesto pledges. How can I persuade her? Vicki, Cumbria You could make the argument \u2013 as has Hugh Grant, among many others \u2013 that your friend could vote tactically in whatever constituency she lives in so as to have the most chance of preventing a Conservative MP and thus limiting or stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s majority. The Lib Dems would probably argue that if she doesn\u2019t like the Tories, and the Greens and Labour are too leftwing, she could give them a try. Q: How can we trust any of the promises made by the leaders of the main parties? There is Johnson and Corbyn promising everything, but the kitchen. Kim, 55, Manchester This is an interesting area. Politicians promising the moon on a stick in elections is hardly a new phenomenon, but this campaign has seen an arguable increase in voter scepticism about many of these pledges. Sometimes the reason for the scepticism is obvious. For example, Boris Johnson has pledged to \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, when the UK is merely part-way through a long and tricky departure process. Similarly, Jo Swinson\u2019s initial claim that she could become PM wasn\u2019t especially convincing. I suppose the best answer would be the slightly boring one: read parties\u2019 manifestos and see what seems feasible/appealing to you. Some of your questions so far have been about what happens if a leader of a winning party loses their seat, and about checks for goods crossing the Irish Sea: Q: What happens if the leader of the winning party loses their seat as an MP? Marina Nea, housewife, Essex If they lose their seat there is no law prevening them from being prime minister \u2013 Alec Douglas-Home was briefly in No 10 before becoming MP. But it would be very hard to do. If Boris Johnson won the election and lost his seat he would either need to be made a peer (you can be PM from the Lords, but in this Commons-centric era it would be pretty tough) or a loyal MP with a safe seat could resign, triggering a byelection. The latter would seem by far the most likely outcome. Q: Can we please have a definitive answer on whether or not there will be checks and paperwork needed for goods crossing the Irish Sea, over and above current ones, before the election please. John Davidson, 77, retired, Liverpool The definitive answer seems to be: yes to \u201cchecks\u201d of some sort, though what these will be is up for debate and depends on the future Brexit deal. My colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, wrote a good mini-Twitter thread on this yesterday. Q: Where can I follow the best prognoses after the voting closes? Is there any special site focusing on the close seats interesting in the case of tactical voting? Frank, IT service consultant, Germany The gold standard for instant results is the post-election exit poll, a vast effort which involves asking people how they actually did vote, and is usually released just after the polls close at 10pm. For a rolling update of specific seats, a good one-stop bet is the fantastic Britain Elects Twitter feed. Rebecca Long-Bailey has refused to deny that she would seek to become Labour leader if Jeremy Corbyn were to step down following defeat on Thursday. Speaking after addressing business leaders at a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d talk in Manchester\u2019s financial centre, Spinningfields, the shadow business secretary said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever thought about before if I\u2019m honest.\u201d Long-Bailey, who is widely seen as John McDonnell\u2019s preferred candidate for the next Labour leader, also would not confirm whether Corbyn would go if Labour lost, saying only that: \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a crystal ball to find out.\u201d When asked why Corbyn has such a dismal personality rating among voters, Long-Bailey said leaders were always \u201cmarmite\u201d. In 2015 that was the mantra that we were hearing, \u2018no one likes Ed Miliband\u2019, and then in the last general election it was like, \u2018oh, no one likes Jeremy Corbyn\u2019. Unfortunately we\u2019ve moved to a system now where people view politicians in the same way as the American-style system, where it\u2019s all about one person and their personality rather than their policies. While an Opinium poll from the weekend showed the Conservatives held a 15-point lead over Labour, just days ahead of the election, Long-Bailey said feedback on doorsteps during the campaigning had been \u201cvery different\u201d to the picture being portrayed by surveys. Normally in an election you get a don\u2019t know on the doorstep because they\u2019re too polite to tell you they\u2019re not going to vote for you. But these are genuine don\u2019t knows in most cases because they\u2019re engaging and they\u2019re asking questions because they\u2019re not sure where to go. I think a lot of those don\u2019t knows are going to be the deciding factor on Thursday. A lot of people haven\u2019t made their mind up and I think it\u2019s going to be a very interesting general election. I\u2019m Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering any questions you have on the general election today. I have been covering politics since just after the Brexit referendum, and previously wrote about national and international news. Before joining the Guardian I worked for various other organisations, including Agence France-Presse, where I was based in Beijing, Hong Kong and Paris. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. In the Q&amp;A earlier McDonnell was also asked if he had been too ambitious, because some voters did not believe all Labour\u2019s spending promises. McDonnell said his plans were ambitious. He said the combination of Tories lies, and hostile media reporting, had had some effect. But Labour had 500,000 members who had been explaining these plans, he said. He also said he and his team had spent two years touring the country explaining what they wanted to do. This is what John McDonnell said about Boris Johnson in the Q&amp;A. Isn\u2019t it interesting that as the prime minister tours around different constituencies, he finds it incredibly difficult even to mix with people ... What we\u2019re getting back on the doorstep is he\u2019s probably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced. Arlene Foster, I think, has come to a judgment this morning which is echoed right the way across the country; this is a man whose word you cannot trust. Ask our experts a question As part of a new series, you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Today, Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer any questions you have on the general election. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: If you win on Friday, what will be the first thing you do in No 11? And if you don\u2019t win, will you resign immediately or stay in office for a bit? On the second question, McDonnell says Labour is going to win. He says, if Labour wins, he will want to have meetings with the permanent secretary at the Treasury within minutes. He will want to send a letter to the Office for Budget Responsibility, in preparation for a budget eight weeks from Wednesday ie, Wednesday 5 February. That\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary shortly. Q: Could you work with the Democratic Unionist party? You have mentioned Arlene Foster warmly twice this morning? McDonnell says if Labour has to govern as a minority government, he will. He has worked with DUP MPs on issues in the past, he says. He says he cannot imagine the DUP voting against a real living wage, or more investment. Q: What would your policies mean for tech giants? And would you want to break them up, as Elizabeth Warren is proposing in the US? McDonnell says he has a group working on this. He has called for a taxation regime \u2013 \u201cunitary taxation\u201d \u2013 that would lead to them paying more. He says he is not sure whether they need to be broken up, or whether proper regulation would address the problems. But they do need to be more tightly regulated, he says. He says there are questions about their role in society - not just the amount of tax they pay. He says this is a global debate. He is glad it has started. McDonnell does not rule out calling for tech giants to be broken up. Q: [From an Australian journalist] The Australian Labor party was defeated earlier this year on a moderate platform. Would you encourage other leftwing parties to be more ambitious? McDonnell says he thinks Labour has inspired other parties. In the US, Democratic candidates are proposing policies they would not have chosen a decade ago, he says. He says he has an agenda whose time has come. Q: Yesterday the Sunday Times said there is a plan for you to take over as interim Labour leader if the party loses. Can you rule that out? McDonnell says he can rule that out because there is going to be a majority Labour government. McDonnell brushes aside claim he might replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader if Labour loses on Friday. McDonnell says he thinks the pound will go up in value if Labour win. He says people should look at what has happened to the value of the pound under the Tories. Q: Do you think the election will be decided in Labour heartlands? And why do you think there are people willing to vote Tory who have never done so for decades? McDonnell says the election will be decided everywhere. He says, although Boris Johnson is touring marginals, it is striking that he is not mixing with ordinary people. He says Johnson is \u201cprobably the least trusted politician that people have ever experienced\u201d. He says a lot of people will agree with what Arlene Foster said this morning. He also says he thinks people will be surprised by the election result. Q: Is there a price you are not willing to pay for privatised companies? McDonnell says he is not writing a blank cheque. Parliament will decide the price, he says. He says there is strong public support for bringing these firms back into public control. They are natural monopolies, he says. And people are fed up of being \u201cripped off\u201d. John McDonnell is now taking questions. Q: Are you saying there are four days to save the planet? McDonnell says the country is facing twin emergencies; the climate crisis, and a social emergency. He refers to the boy forced to sleep on the floor of a hospital. That is why this election is about saving the NHS, he says. And he says our grandchildren will not forgive us if we do not address the climate crisis. Q: Would you definitely vote remain in a future referendum? McDonnell says he cannot see a better deal than remain, but when Labour does bring its new Brexit deal back, he will make his assessment of it then. McDonnell says Labour\u2019s opponents hate the people of this country. There will always be those at the top who will do anything to stop us \u2013 we\u2019ve seen character assassinations, lies and smears taken to a new level \u2026 When they attack me, or Jeremy, we know it\u2019s not really about us. It\u2019s about you; they hate the people of this country. They think \u2013 and I quote the prime minister \u2013 that you\u2019re drunk and criminal, they hate the idea you might dream of a better life. They hate the idea you might want real change in how things have been done for so long, and a say in how things are done in future. And here is his peroration. When they come to write the history books, and write about when it all began to turn around. When your children or grandchildren ask you: What did you do to end that world of rough sleeping and food banks? What did you do to save the NHS and stop the Tories selling it off? What did you do to bring back pride to our town? And to finally wrestle back control from those who had kept it to themselves for so long? You can tell them: It all began when we voted Labour, when together we laid the foundations of that new society, foundations so deeply rooted that no Tory could ever tear them up. You can tell them: It was when we proved, once and for all, that the doubters were wrong. That the doubters are always wrong: another world really is possible. McDonnell says it is now clear that Boris Johnson would not be able to get Brexit done quickly. Despite all his promises it is clear to all that far from getting Brexit done, under Johnson Brexit won\u2019t be done for years or we risk a catastrophic no deal. He says he agrees with what Arlene Foster said this morning (see 9.23am); you cannot trust Johnson, he says. McDonnell says Labour will make the nationalised companies publicly accountable. In our first 100 days we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership. We\u2019ll set up boards to run these utilities made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others. We\u2019ll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services \u2013 those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online, with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before, so you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we\u2019ll create new people\u2019s assemblies to give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run. McDonnell says Labour will set up its national transformation unit before Christmas. The first priority of a Labour government will be getting investment going to make this happen. We\u2019ll set up our national transformation unit immediately \u2013 before Christmas \u2013 so it can start work in the Treasury, before being moved out to its new office in the north of England early next year. It will provide the initial finance for our new national investment bank, regional development banks and Post Bank, using the power of the Treasury to get affordable finance on to every high street in Britain. He says people have lost faith in how much change is possible. We\u2019ve already started our meetings with the Treasury, they are working up plans and getting ready to implement all this. So don\u2019t be fooled by the doubters who say our plans are unachievable. A decade of austerity, and 40 years of believing the market knows best, have dulled people\u2019s sense of what\u2019s possible, just as they were intended to do. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving a speech now on the first 100 days of a Labour government. He says Labour has won the argument about austerity. He says Boris Johnson himself now admits austerity was wrong, although, McDonnell says, under Tory manifesto plans, austerity would continue for another five years. He says he has been having detailed meetings with colleagues about what Labour will do when it gets into government. Good jobs and whole industries that were once the pride of our country have been lost and replaced with dreary, exploitative, insecure and low-paid jobs, or in some cases no jobs at all. No wonder people feel disillusioned in politicians. As our manifesto makes clear, turning these two things around will be our number one priority in government. Our green industrial revolution will deliver the changes we need to avert climate catastrophe. And it will put British industry back on the map, bringing prosperity to every part of our country. It will give every community something to be proud of. On the Today programme this monring Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, repeated the usual Conservative claim that Boris Johnson would be able to agree a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year. (See 8.17am.) Anyone who has followed this issue even just half-closely will know that there are good grounds for thinking that the Tories are not being realistic, and the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a good Twitter thread this morning explaining why. It starts here. And here is one of her key points. This chart from the academic and Brexit specialist Simon Usherwood also sums up the problems to be addressed in the next phase of the Brexit negotiation. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, did a phone-in on Radio 5 Live this morning. The Liberal Democrats are committed to reforming the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for trans people to change their gender, and this has led to concern that it would put women at risk in women-only space from people who are anatomically male. In the phone-in, Swinson was clearly on the defensive on this issue, and did not seem to get very far in terms of persuading the sceptical caller who raised the issue. But Swinson was much better on the Today programme this morning when Justin Webb raised the same issue. Asked if she thought biological sex existed, she replied: Not on a binary ... from what I\u2019ve read, I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m an expert on the subject, but I don\u2019t think things are as binary as is often presented. Swinson also insisted that this was a rights issue. This is not a scientific debate. This is a debate about people and their lives. This is a debate about people who are facing extreme prejudice and discrimination. It takes us back to a very similar situation to where we were on gay rights decades ago, when people were being told that they were somehow as a person wrong for being who they were. And the vitriol that was heaped on them by society drove people to huge mental crises, in many cases to misery and sometimes to suicide. We see that amongst non-binary and trans people today and I think we should be making sure that every individual is protected. On the issue of women-only spaces, Swinson said the priority was to keep people safe. But she said processes were already in place to address this. She went on: I do think it is important that people are protected. And I don\u2019t think there should be some kind of hierarchy of equality, because trans women are some of the most vulnerable women in our society facing huge discrimination. And all women who have been on the receiving end of violence deserve to have safe spaces, whether they are gay, straight, bi, whether they are trans, whether they are cis, whatever their race is, whatever their background they come from. And they need to be protected on that individual basis. And I have to say, we are talking about a very small part of the population. And implicit in this is an assumption that trans women are in some way more likely to be violent. And it is just not borne out. And I think there is a demonisation of a community going on here, and I often find the media is complicit in it. These are from the politics professor Tim Bale. He is flagging up research from two other academics, Cristian Vaccari and David Smith, in this article for the Conversation. Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that a referendum on Brexit would be held before a second vote on Scottish independence. As PA Media reports, the Scottish first minister told BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that Labour wanted to hold an EU poll within six months of being elected and that she would want another Scottish independence referendum towards the end of 2020. She said: It looks as if the EU [referendum] would come first and then an independence referendum towards the end of next year. That\u2019s the sequencing. In terms of the priority, in order of importance if you like, I want the whole UK to get the opportunity to escape Brexit, but of course an EU referendum doesn\u2019t guarantee that Scotland escapes Brexit, we could have the same result we had in 2016. And whether it\u2019s Brexit or stopping any other Westminster policy being imposed on Scotland, the way to do that is to become independent and that\u2019s why that choice over the future of our country is so important. Here are some of the main items on the agenda for today. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on what Labour would do in its first 100 days. 2pm: Jeremy Corbyn addresses a rally in Bristol. Later he is doing campaign stops in Stroud, Worcester and Wolverhampton. Boris Johnson is also due to deliver a speech during his various campaign visits today, but the timing has not been confirmed. On the subject of whether or not there will be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland under Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan (see 9.23am), it is worth pointing out that the briefing issued by the Conservative party press office on Friday, in response to the document leaked by Labour on this subject, specifically said there would be checks. It said (bold type inserted by me): The deal ensures that there will not be any tariffs in either direction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and allows for \u2018unfettered access\u2019 between Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Article 6, link). We will ensure no change to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. There will be checks as goods head into Northern Ireland, but the only goods that will pay tariffs will be goods that are destined for the Republic. Boris Johnson has also managed to ensure that, if the UK Government believes that someone has paid a customs fee who shouldn\u2019t have, we have the unilateral power to reimburse or waive any tariff. This means that, if we have a majority Conservative government, we can ensure that goods headed to Northern Ireland never pay tariffs. When Boris Johnson was running for the Conservative party leadership, he had the enthusiastic backing of Democratic Unionist party MPs. That changed abruptly when Johnson unveiled his plan for a new withdrawal agreement that involved a de facto customs border down the Irish Sea - something he insisted \u201cno British Conservative government\u201d would accept when he gave a speech to the DUP annual conference in November 2018. Despite effectively being betrayed, the DUP does not want Jeremy Corbyn to win the election, and during the campaign it has been relatively reluctant to criticise Johnson in personal terms. But this morning Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, did let slip her true feeling about his reliability in an interview on the Today programme. Here are the main points. Foster said Johnson could not be trusted to keep his word. Asked about the extent to which Johnson was seen as someone who could not be trusted by unionists in the light of his U-turn over a customs border down the Irish Sea, she replied: I think it is right for the leadership of unionism in Northern Ireland to try to work with the prime minister of the day to get the best deal for Northern Ireland. We will always do that. We will continue to do that. I think it says more about the person who broke their word than me and the leadership of the \u2026 Democratic Unionist party. When asked if that meant she would not take him at his word in future, she said: Well, I think once bitten, twice shy. We will certainly be looking for the detail of what this is going to look like. She said that HM Revenue and Customs officials had told the DUP that Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan would involve goods coming to Northern Ireland from Britain having to be checked. Johnson has at at times flatly denied this, as he did when he visited Northern Ireland last month, although in an interview yesterday he did say there would be checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland if they were destined for the Republic of Ireland, having initially said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question of there being checks on goods going [between] NI/GB and GB/NI.\u201d Nick Robinson, the presenter, asked Foster a question the Financial Times\u2019 political editor asked of Johnson directly: Was he lying, or did he not understand the policy? Foster refused to answer this directly, and she did not directly accuse Johnson of lying or of not understanding his policy. But she said the DUP had been told by HM Revenue and Customs that there would be checks. She said: Before Boris Johnson announced his deal, we spoke to \u2013 myself and Nigel Dodds \u2013 HMRC officials and we asked them a number of questions about goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and they were very clear with us that it would mean that all of those goods would have to be checked. Obviously, only those goods that were going to the Republic of Ireland would have tariffs imposed on them. But all of the goods would have to be checked, and that would be the default position. She said Johnson\u2019s plan would contravene the Act of Union. She said: That, of course, is very concerning for us, because it goes very much to the heart of the Act of Union. That Act of Union not just talks of political and constitutional union, it also talks about trade, and it says there has to be a free flow of trade between the different parts of the United Kingdom. And if we are to have what has been proposed, then it wouldn\u2019t be free-flowing trade. And that of course causes us great concern. She said Johnson\u2019s plan could lead to shoppers in Northern Ireland not being able to buy goods on sale in Britain, or having to pay a higher price for them. She said: Most of our goods, particularly in the retail sector, come from Great Britain, and therefore any checks on those goods would lead to higher costs, perhaps even less choice, for people here in Northern Ireland, and that is completely unacceptable. Q: The Guardian says voters are confused by your plans for an Australian-style points system. What are you trying to achieve? Johnson says he wants to put immigration under democratic control. He says unskilled people would not be able to come to the UK without a job. Q: To what level? Johnson says he does not know. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. Q: Do you support HS2? Johnson says he is reviewing this. It is sensible to do this, and decide if this is a good use of money. Q: You just said HS2 will cost more than \u00a3100bn. But the budget is \u00a388bn. So you are saying it could cost another \u00a310bn plus? Johnson says he does think the total cost will be \u201cnorth of \u00a3100bn\u201d. That is an awful lot of money. Johnson says he thinks total cost of HS2 would be more than \u00a3100bn - well above the current estimate. Q: Today Priti Patel, the home secretary, is claiming there would be 52 more murders a year under Labour. Where has she got those figures? Johnson says he does not know. Q: It\u2019s an article she wrote in the Daily Telegraph. She is making it up, isn\u2019t she? Johnson says Patel is making a point about the need for robust policing. Johnson says that if you increase police numbers you will get crime down. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Seth Jacobson. Boris Johnson is being interviewed by Nick Ferrari on LBC now. Ferrari starts by saying Johnson is trying to break the \u201cred wall\u201d of Labour-held seats. Johnson claims not to recognise the phrase. He says he is trying to win seats. Q: You are near Leeds, where a boy spent the night on a hospital floor because of a lack of beds. Johnson does not comment on that specific story, but says the government is putting a record amount into the NHS. Q: What would you say to the boy\u2019s family? Johnson says he apologises to everyone who has had a bad NHS experience. But most people are treated well by the NHS, he says. It needs proper funding. Of course I sympathise very much and I apologise to everybody who has a bad experience. By and large I think the NHS do an amazing job and I think that they deserve all praise for the service they provide \u2013 but they do need investment and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it now. But they need investment from a one nation government that really cares and understands \u2013 that\u2019s us that cares and understands \u2013 and you need long-term funding. Johnson apologises to family of boy forced to sleep on hospital floor. He says Labour would be \u201cdeeply destructive\u201d to the economy, meaning there would be no money for the NHS. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, has just been on the Today programme, where he was pressed about a story in today\u2019s Financial Times that reports that civil servants in the Department for Exiting the EU had cast doubt on the prospect of leaving the EU by December 2020. A document seen by the paper said \u201cdelivery of the required infrastructure, associated systems, and staffing to implement the requirements of the protocol by December 2020 represents a major strategic, political and operational challenge\u201d. Asked whether such a deal was capable with the EU, Sunak, a rising star in the Conservative party, said: Having sat on a committee chaired by Michael Gove to plan for our departure fro the EU, I\u2019ve actually been incredibly impressed by all the preparations that have gone on which mean we\u2019re in very good shape not just to deal with new trading relationships but all the other things. He also said that a \u201cnew immigration system\u201d was something that the government had been planning for, \u201cmaking sure the systems were in place and the resources were there so we can have control over our immigration policy\u201d. He went on: It\u2019s exactly the type of thing we\u2019ve been planning for and we can do after we leave but then again it can only happen after we actually deliver the election result and leave the EU. When pressed on whether no-deal planning would resume next week if the Tories were returned to office, he replied: We won\u2019t need to plan for no deal because we will have a deal to leave with. There is going to be a trade deal. The framework is already there in the political declaration. Our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, is with Boris Johnson at Grimsby fish market this morning as he embarks on a three-day blitz of Labour seats across the party\u2019s traditional heartlands in Wales, the Midlands and Yorkshire. Boris Johnson started the day just after 6am at a fish market in Grimsby, a Tory target seat held by Labour\u2019s Melanie Onn with a majority of 2,565. He toured the market and watched a live auction before holding up a cod for the cameras and dragging a crate of fish across the warehouse. The PM got a mixed welcome with a number of fish wholesalers saying they were planning to vote for him but one started booing loudly. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has been on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as the final few days of campaigning get under way. She has admitted it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look likely\u201d her party will win a majority as she insisted the Lib Dems have led the campaign for a second EU referendum. Asked about her party\u2019s manifesto pledge to revoke article 50, Swinson said: It\u2019s only in the circumstances of a Liberal Democrat majority government which of course in itself would be democratic. But where we are right now that obviously doesn\u2019t look likely. The most likely way we can stop Brexit is through a people\u2019s vote and the Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people\u2019s vote for three-and-a-half years. Conservatives, Greens, Labour, Lib Dems and SNP have answered questions about the climate crisis, including: Does your party support the students striking from school and/or the Extinction Rebellion protests demanding urgent action on the climate crisis? Conservatives: We don\u2019t support students losing out on their education, though we recognise and respect the passion that young people feel. We do not support illegal action that disrupts the lives of ordinary, hardworking people. Greens: We have supported the school strikers from day one. Young people will be most affected by the effects of climate chaos but don\u2019t have a political voice or vote. Labour: Absolutely. This year saw the blossoming of a global movement calling on politicians to wake up. We have turned its demands into detailed, credible plans for real change. Lib Dems: Of course we support this action. It is deeply worrying that children are feeling the need to strike because they\u2019re worried about their future. We are supportive of the aims of Extinction Rebellion and support their right to protest. But some of their actions have been counter-productive. SNP: We applaud the actions by school students in drawing attention to the need for greater urgency in tackling climate change. Read Kate Proctor\u2019s devastating account of the Brexit party\u2019s run over the last few weeks, which she descibes as a \u201ccampaign on life support\u201d. At Hull Ionians RUFC on a soaking wet Thursday morning last month, chairs were swiftly removed from the back few rows of a Brexit party event. It did the trick. The curtained event space, usually reserved for weddings, suddenly went from looking half empty to almost full. After the highs of the EU election campaign, when Nigel Farage\u2019s party drew thousands to glitzy rallies, a swathe of empty chairs beneath a glitter ball might not be how he imagined his eighth general election campaign would pan out. Still, the show goes on. Farage waited in the wings expressionless before exploding into life, striding down the gangway to his soundtrack of the party\u2019s 2019 campaign, Power by Kanye West. He vigorously shook the hands of those followers who had paid \u00a32.50 to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be on stage in leave country,\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m in the heart of a part of England that feels very, very let down by parliament, [the] political class. It\u2019s three-and-a-half years on and we\u2019ve still not got Brexit.\u201d Except he is in Haltemprice and Howden, the seat of the arch-Eurosceptic David Davis, a former Brexit secretary. Worse, it is not a seat the party is contesting. Running events a few miles into the wrong constituency is one of many hallmarks of a campaign that is now on life support. The day ahead Boris Johnson will make campaign visits to the east of England, the north-east and south-west. John McDonnell will give a speech on Labour\u2019s plans for its first 100 days in government this morning in London, while the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will be campaigning in the south-west. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Ed Davey, will be canvassing for votes in Guildford. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, will take part in a photocall in Coatbridge, then join her party\u2019s candidate for Lanark and Hamilton East, on a visit to the Wallace tea rooms where they will help bake a cake. Good morning. We\u2019re here, in the final stretch of the campaign. The country will go to the polls on Thursday, but before that happens, the parties are giving their pitches one final push. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will outline the party\u2019s plan for the first 100 days of a Labour government, while the party focuses on the benefit of its policies to the bank balances of voters, promising the public that a Labour government would put \u201cmoney in your pocket\u201d. Amid concerns that Labour has overpromised with a blizzard of announcements during the six-week campaign, Corbyn will focus on the NHS and voters\u2019 finances in the final crucial days of campaigning. Meanwhile, the Tories have been much quieter than the opposition ahead of the vote \u2013 as John Harris points out, they have been throughout the campaign \u2013 though Boris Johnson did do an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News yesterday, which John Crace described as a \u201c20-minute audio-visual barrage of near constant mansplaining and manspreading\u201d. The Tories have been much less forthcoming about their plansand those they have promised are problematic. Johnson\u2019s proposal of 40 new hospitals has not been costed (although some say it could be as much as \u00a324bn), his promise to introduce an \u201cAustralian-style\u201d immigration system has been criticised. At the odder end of the spectrum is Johnson\u2019s claim that getting Brexit done will lead to a baby boom such as the one that he wrongly alleges occurred after the London Olympics. But, their message that the Conservatives will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d seems to have cut through, and despite stagnating in the polls they still look strongly placed to win the election. Thanks for reading along, I\u2019ll have the blog for the early hours before handing over to my colleagues. Let\u2019s get cracking.",

The former BBC journalist Linden Kemkaran, who is standing for the Conservatives in Labour-held Bradford East, retweeted a user on Twitter last week who dismissed Islamophobia as nonsense \u2013 describing it as a \u201ccrock\u201d. She retweeted two others who accused the shadow minister for women and equalities, Naz Shah, who is standing in the neighbouring constituency, of being \u201cnot white enough\u201d to have experienced Bradford\u2019s \u201cno-go areas\u201d and claimed that the prospective MP\u2019s loyalties did not lie in the city. Kemkaran also liked a post labelling Shah \u2013 who is British-born and of Pakistani heritage \u2013 a \u201cPakideshi\u201d who pushes the \u201cdoggy-do-do Muslim narrative\u201d. It comes after the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, apologised on Sunday after a string of allegations of Islamophobia and racism against the party\u2019s candidates. The Guardian revealed on Friday that at least four ministers had gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates accused of anti-Muslim hatred. Kemkaran \u2013 who has been pictured with Boris Johnson \u2013 became embroiled in a row with Shah after the shadow minister accused her of using \u201cfar-right language\u201d, claiming she told young people at a hustings last Thursday that the city had \u201ccrime-infested streets\u201d and \u201cno-go areas\u201d. In response, Kemkaran retweeted a user \u2013 whose Twitter biography reads \u201cNo to that cult, Islam\u201d \u2013 who sent a message to Shah saying: \u201cYou are a dunce.

      "body": "<p>It was no accident that the explosion of creativity and iconoclasm in the 1960s coincided with economic expansion and the relaxation of fiscal austerity (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/corbyn-launches-final-election-push-to-deny-tories-a-majority\" title=\"\">Corbyn in last-ditch drive to focus on voters\u2019 finances</a>, 9 December).</p> <p>By contrast, the economic austerity we have endured for the past decade has led to an austerity of thought and aspiration. Its result has been resignation in the face of growing poverty, resentment of minorities and strangers, a sullen rejection of internationalism, and an impoverished view that any attempt at radical improvement and expansive thinking is hopeless.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s distinctive fiscal promise is merely the vehicle for a more aspirant, caring and forgiving society. If we want to draw the most fundamental distinction between Conservative and Labour election promises we should look to the kind of society each imagines. Look to the (more radical) Labour manifesto of 1964, with its echo of those expansive times: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml\" title=\"\">The morality of money and property is a dead and deadening morality</a>\u201d. That manifesto promised \u201chumanising the whole administration of the state\u201d. An end to the austerity of imagination.<br><strong>Prof Saville Kushner</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>\u2022 Labour needs to convince voters in this last stretch that Jeremy Corbyn and Labour are ready to lead, and to attack this issue straight on. They have allowed the opposition narrative that they are radical dreamers with no real grip on reality, or governance experience, to be accepted by the majority of the population.</p> <p>They need to emphasise that their proposals, or similar, have all been in place before in the UK or in Europe (for example, nationalisation) and that they heed the advice of scientists and experts (which often the Conservatives do not).</p> <p>Also, they should remind the population that the vast majority of the work of governing the country is done by a very competent civil service, whom Labour respects and whose advice they take very seriously. As such, they are more than ready and capable to govern.<br><strong>Dr Steven Richard Scott</strong><br><em>Concordia University, Canada</em></p> <p>\u2022 The magnitude of the choice that lies ahead this week can feel overwhelming. An election of such importance is not merely defined by the stark differences between a government undergoing an identity crisis and an official opposition promising the most radical manifesto since Clement Attlee. Unlike most other elections, this election will not be defined by a series of firsts but, rather, by lasts.</p> <p>It is our last chance to save the NHS, our last chance to address the climate crisis and commit to crucial targets. It is our last chance to support our schools and provide the funding that they have been starved of for years. It is our last chance to support university lecturers, who have been forced to strike twice in less than two years over deteriorating working conditions and unnecessary pension reform (a term that the neoliberal elite love throwing around when what they actually mean is asset stripping). It is our last chance to properly fund our vital public services.</p> <p>This is also our final chance to put the nail in austerity\u2019s coffin. And, lest we forget, this is our last chance to stop a disastrous hard Brexit. This is no longer about leave or remain. We cannot allow the narrative pervading this false dilemma to cost people their jobs, to significantly reduce living standards, and to obliterate working conditions and environmental protections.</p> <p>This was a Tory crisis that the architects of austerity have turned into a national catastrophe. I cannot vote this Thursday, but most of you can. Your decision will have a profound impact on my future, and on the lives of those without a voice.<br><strong>Thanasi Hassoulas</strong><br><em>Penarth, Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have observed the constant negative and disproportionate bombardment of Jeremy Corbyn and seen a man of amazing strength and dignity resisting overwhelming pressure to abandon his beliefs of refraining from personal abuse of his opponents and the media.</p> <p>He is a great example of how to debate calmly without the need to shout and scream, as is the norm in parliament. The problem for him is the number of people believing it is necessary to shout to be seen as \u201cstrong\u201d. You have to be far stronger to resist this temptation.</p> <p>He seems to be a genuine compassionate and caring believer in what he has set out in his policy document with a strong commitment to achieving his goals to improve the lot of the people. He is very clear as to where his priorities are and appears confident he can achieve them. He and his impressive team are fully versed in the policy detail He has never needed a minder.</p> <p>For anyone unsure of how to vote I would say give the Labour party a chance to prove they honestly will try their best to achieve their programme. Just consider if the Conservatives are returned to parliament there is a very high probability of the return to austerity and the continued impact it has had.</p> <p>I would like to have an answer to the question of how Boris Johnson and Conservative party voters feel about their contribution to the effects of their policies on the most vulnerable people. Perhaps Corbyn could ask them.<br><strong>Pam Blackshaw</strong><br><em>Oldham, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 I see myself as a Labour/Lib Dem/Green hybrid so am an embodiment of what Polly Toynbee refers to (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/progressives-stop-tory-wave-wakefield\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s red wall is weak. Progressives must join forces</a>, Journal, 3 December). However, our current voting system continues to prevent my views being accurately represented. I have voted Labour all my life and will do so again on 12 December. Once upon a time my vote represented a 100% belief in all the Labour party stood for; now it is partially a tactical vote to hopefully prevent the Tories from winning. The progressive centre and left parties must plan for cooperation and compromise right from the outset of the new parliament \u2013 and that includes a determination to radically reform the voting system.

      "bodyText": "It was no accident that the explosion of creativity and iconoclasm in the 1960s coincided with economic expansion and the relaxation of fiscal austerity (Corbyn in last-ditch drive to focus on voters\u2019 finances, 9 December). By contrast, the economic austerity we have endured for the past decade has led to an austerity of thought and aspiration. Its result has been resignation in the face of growing poverty, resentment of minorities and strangers, a sullen rejection of internationalism, and an impoverished view that any attempt at radical improvement and expansive thinking is hopeless. Labour\u2019s distinctive fiscal promise is merely the vehicle for a more aspirant, caring and forgiving society. If we want to draw the most fundamental distinction between Conservative and Labour election promises we should look to the kind of society each imagines. Look to the (more radical) Labour manifesto of 1964, with its echo of those expansive times: \u201cThe morality of money and property is a dead and deadening morality\u201d. That manifesto promised \u201chumanising the whole administration of the state\u201d. An end to the austerity of imagination. Prof Saville Kushner Liverpool \u2022 Labour needs to convince voters in this last stretch that Jeremy Corbyn and Labour are ready to lead, and to attack this issue straight on. They have allowed the opposition narrative that they are radical dreamers with no real grip on reality, or governance experience, to be accepted by the majority of the population. They need to emphasise that their proposals, or similar, have all been in place before in the UK or in Europe (for example, nationalisation) and that they heed the advice of scientists and experts (which often the Conservatives do not). Also, they should remind the population that the vast majority of the work of governing the country is done by a very competent civil service, whom Labour respects and whose advice they take very seriously. As such, they are more than ready and capable to govern. Dr Steven Richard Scott Concordia University, Canada \u2022 The magnitude of the choice that lies ahead this week can feel overwhelming. An election of such importance is not merely defined by the stark differences between a government undergoing an identity crisis and an official opposition promising the most radical manifesto since Clement Attlee. Unlike most other elections, this election will not be defined by a series of firsts but, rather, by lasts. It is our last chance to save the NHS, our last chance to address the climate crisis and commit to crucial targets. It is our last chance to support our schools and provide the funding that they have been starved of for years. It is our last chance to support university lecturers, who have been forced to strike twice in less than two years over deteriorating working conditions and unnecessary pension reform (a term that the neoliberal elite love throwing around when what they actually mean is asset stripping). It is our last chance to properly fund our vital public services. This is also our final chance to put the nail in austerity\u2019s coffin. And, lest we forget, this is our last chance to stop a disastrous hard Brexit. This is no longer about leave or remain. We cannot allow the narrative pervading this false dilemma to cost people their jobs, to significantly reduce living standards, and to obliterate working conditions and environmental protections. This was a Tory crisis that the architects of austerity have turned into a national catastrophe. I cannot vote this Thursday, but most of you can. Your decision will have a profound impact on my future, and on the lives of those without a voice. Thanasi Hassoulas Penarth, Cardiff \u2022 I have observed the constant negative and disproportionate bombardment of Jeremy Corbyn and seen a man of amazing strength and dignity resisting overwhelming pressure to abandon his beliefs of refraining from personal abuse of his opponents and the media. He is a great example of how to debate calmly without the need to shout and scream, as is the norm in parliament. The problem for him is the number of people believing it is necessary to shout to be seen as \u201cstrong\u201d. You have to be far stronger to resist this temptation. He seems to be a genuine compassionate and caring believer in what he has set out in his policy document with a strong commitment to achieving his goals to improve the lot of the people. He is very clear as to where his priorities are and appears confident he can achieve them. He and his impressive team are fully versed in the policy detail He has never needed a minder. For anyone unsure of how to vote I would say give the Labour party a chance to prove they honestly will try their best to achieve their programme. Just consider if the Conservatives are returned to parliament there is a very high probability of the return to austerity and the continued impact it has had. I would like to have an answer to the question of how Boris Johnson and Conservative party voters feel about their contribution to the effects of their policies on the most vulnerable people. Perhaps Corbyn could ask them. Pam Blackshaw Oldham, Greater Manchester \u2022 I see myself as a Labour/Lib Dem/Green hybrid so am an embodiment of what Polly Toynbee refers to (Labour\u2019s red wall is weak. Progressives must join forces, Journal, 3 December). However, our current voting system continues to prevent my views being accurately represented. I have voted Labour all my life and will do so again on 12 December. Once upon a time my vote represented a 100% belief in all the Labour party stood for; now it is partially a tactical vote to hopefully prevent the Tories from winning. The progressive centre and left parties must plan for cooperation and compromise right from the outset of the new parliament \u2013 and that includes a determination to radically reform the voting system. It is time for voters\u2019 nuanced views to be recognised and for Polly\u2019s \u201cprogressive concordance of the reasonable\u201d to prevail. Toby Wood Peterborough, Cambridgeshire \u2022 It\u2019s odd that some voters are willing to lend their vote to a Boris Johnson administration for five years. It would be like lending your car keys to a drunk. Sure, you\u2019ll get them back, but what state will your car be in?
