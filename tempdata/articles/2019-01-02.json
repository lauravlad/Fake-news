PHE has asked for a cut of 20% by 2020, with a 5% reduction in the year to April 2018. The industry failed to hit that target, achieving 2% instead. Many companies have opted to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar, particularly in soft drinks.</p> <p>WHO is aiming to produce guidance on sweeteners because, it says, \u201ctheir use is widespread and they continue to be heavily promoted as healthy alternatives to sugars\u201d.</p> <p>The Cochrane review was set up to answer a set of questions posed by WHO about the effects on adult and child health of consuming sweeteners and specifically the impact on obesity.</p> <p>The evidence analysed in the review was not very robust, said the reviewers. They included 56 studies but said most were small and did not last long enough to come to firm conclusions.</p> <p>The studies were set up to look at different types of sweeteners, measuring weight, blood sugar (glycaemic) control, oral health, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood and behaviour in consumers. For most of them, there was no statistical difference in weight loss or health benefits of adults and children using higher doses of sweeteners rather than small amounts or none.</p> <p>The review did not find solid evidence of any major safety issues. People who used sweeteners did not appear to have an increased cancer risk, for instance. But there was what the authors described as a \u201cvery low certainty of evidence\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Low-calorie and artificial sweeteners, increasingly added to drinks and food as the industry responds to pressure to cut sugar, may not help people lose weight and there is not enough evidence on their safety, according to a major new review. The review, carried out by Cochrane \u2013 an international non-profit research group \u2013 aims to provide evidence for the World Health Organization, which is preparing guidance on what it calls \u201cnon-sugar sweeteners\u201d or NSSs \u2013 a term that includes artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and low or no-calorie natural alternatives such as stevia. \u201cNo evidence was seen for health benefits from NSSs and potential harms could not be excluded,\u201d says the review, published in the British Medical Journal, which calls for better-quality research to be done. Food and drink manufacturers have been under pressure from Public Health England (PHE) to reduce the sugar content of their products to help tackle the obesity crisis. PHE has asked for a cut of 20% by 2020, with a 5% reduction in the year to April 2018. The industry failed to hit that target, achieving 2% instead. Many companies have opted to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar, particularly in soft drinks. WHO is aiming to produce guidance on sweeteners because, it says, \u201ctheir use is widespread and they continue to be heavily promoted as healthy alternatives to sugars\u201d. The Cochrane review was set up to answer a set of questions posed by WHO about the effects on adult and child health of consuming sweeteners and specifically the impact on obesity. The evidence analysed in the review was not very robust, said the reviewers. They included 56 studies but said most were small and did not last long enough to come to firm conclusions. The studies were set up to look at different types of sweeteners, measuring weight, blood sugar (glycaemic) control, oral health, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood and behaviour in consumers. For most of them, there was no statistical difference in weight loss or health benefits of adults and children using higher doses of sweeteners rather than small amounts or none. The review did not find solid evidence of any major safety issues. People who used sweeteners did not appear to have an increased cancer risk, for instance. But there was what the authors described as a \u201cvery low certainty of evidence\u201d. More and better studies of the effects and the safety of sweeteners were needed, they said. However, sweeteners had their uses, said PHE. \u201cUsing sweeteners is one way the food and drink industry can reduce sugar in everyday products,\u201d said Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at PHE. \u201cThe evidence suggests sweeteners are safe and can help consumers make healthier choices.\u201d \u201cI would say that there is no convincing evidence of clear health benefits in the general population. There might be a small benefit on weight, but we don\u2019t have high quality data with long-term follow-up that definitely confirm this effect,\u201d said Joerg J Meerpohl, co-director of Cochrane Germany and one of the authors. \u201cFinally, there is a good, and safe, alternative for people/people trying to loose weight: water, and non-/less-sweetened foods. In other words, there is no need to either add free additional sugar, or sweeteners in most instances.\u201d Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThe findings of this study are not surprising and confirm the view that artificial sweeteners are not a magic bullet to prevent obesity. Replacement of sugary drinks with artificial sweeteners helps prevent weight gain in children but is not superior to the preferred alternative \u2013 water.\u201d Another expert said sweeteners were still preferable to sugar and pointed out that some large studies not included in the review showed they did help some people lose weight. \u201cThis paper does not change my mind \u2013 non-sugar sweeteners remain far better than sugar-sweetened beverages given lack of calories in the former, and the well-known harms of the latter including in particular on dental health,\u201d said Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. \u201cAlso, the two best randomised trials ever conducted did show benefits of lower weight gain in children and adolescents when comparing diet drinks to sugar-sweetened beverages. \u201cThe issue with this current study is that it also includes data from sources other than randomised trials and as soon as you do this, the quality of the evidence becomes far weaker and for this reason hard conclusions are near impossible to make from studies which mix different types of studies. \u201cThe authors recognise this to some extent and I strongly agree with them when they say there is a need for higher quality and larger randomised trials in the nutritional field, however hard they may be to conduct, as, without these, some issues will never be fully resolved.\u201d In a linked editorial in the BMJ, Vasanti Malik, from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in the US, also said more research was needed.

The idea, which is routinely floated after high-profile school shooting incidents, was given new life after being promoted by Donald Trump following the Parkland massacre. The National Association of School Resource Officers, the largest organization of school-based law enforcement officers, also opposes arming teachers. The recommendation that would allow teachers to volunteer to carry weapons seeks to expand on a \u201cguardian\u201d program passed into law by the same school safety act that established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas commission in March 2018. Currently, the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program allows local school systems to partner with local sheriffs to arm eligible school employees who are not primarily classroom teachers. The program is voluntary, must be approved by the school board and requires each participating staff member complete 132 hours of comprehensive firearm safety and proficiency training. The commission recommended that the state legislature \u201cshould expand the guardian program to allow teachers \u2026 to carry concealed firearms on campuses for self-protection, and the protection of other staff and students in response to an active assailant incident\u201d. The program\u2019s namesake, Aaron Feis, died shielding students during the 2018 attack, and the attachment of his name to the provision angered some student activists because it is unknown whether Feis would have supported the controversial program. The March school safety bill also included a number of limited gun control provisions including raising the legal age to purchase firearms to 21 and allowing a court to prohibit a violent or mentally ill individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm. The recommendation is a very small part of the expansive report, which lays out in second-by-second detail what is believed to have happened before, during and after the 14 February 2018, shooting attack that left 17 dead and 17 wounded. The report was also highly critical of the Broward county sheriff\u2019s office, calling its active shooter policy for deputies at the time of the Parkland attack \u201cinsufficient\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with current and standard law enforcement practice\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar has dropped to its lowest level in 10 years against the greenback on Thursday after weak manufacturing results in China and the European Union fuelled concerns about global growth. The Aussie dollar, which was trading just above 70 US cents on Wednesday, dipped sharply around 9.30am AEDT on Thursday, trading at 67.49 US cents. That\u2019s a drop of more than 3%. The last time the Australian dollar was so low was in early 2009. By midday it had climbed back above 69 US cents. In overnight trade, the US dollar climbed against the euro and sterling, but edged lower against the safe-haven Japanese yen as investors remained wary of slowing global growth and volatile equity markets. Weak manufacturing data from Spain, France, Italy, and Germany, sent the euro 1.1% lower. Factory activity weakened across much of Europe and Asia in December as the US-China trade war and a slowdown in demand hit production in many economies, offering little reason for optimism as the new year began. Chris Weston, head of research at foreign exchange trader, Pepperstone, said the falls were the result of a string of poor results prompted concerns about global growth, including poor manufacturing results in China, Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner. Weston said US president Donald Trump\u2019s assurance that trade talks with China were \u201cprogressing well\u201d had failed to quell fears about the global economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a confluence of various factors, to be honest.

Frydenberg attributed the shift to \u201ca variety of factors\u201d, including an increase in the official US interest rate and smaller trading volumes over the Australian summer.

The new law is part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/15/oregon-third-gender-option-identity-law\">recent wave</a> of changes in states throughout the US that have made it easier for transgender, gender-nonconforming and intersex people to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/11/intersex-rights-gender-sara-kelly-keenan-birth-certificate\">accurate documents</a> that recognize their identities.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that finally non-binary people are recognized, that we exist,\u201d said Alon Altman, who is genderqueer and was one of the first people in line on Wednesday morning to get their new ID.

      "bodyText": "California is now allowing a third gender option on state identification cards and driver\u2019s licenses, a major win for non-binary people that could pave the way for reforms across the country. On Wednesday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) began issuing IDs to non-binary residents, who aren\u2019t male or female, giving them an \u201cX\u201d marker instead of the traditional \u201cM\u201d or \u201cF\u201d. The new law is part of a recent wave of changes in states throughout the US that have made it easier for transgender, gender-nonconforming and intersex people to have accurate documents that recognize their identities. \u201cI\u2019m glad that finally non-binary people are recognized, that we exist,\u201d said Alon Altman, who is genderqueer and was one of the first people in line on Wednesday morning to get their new ID. Altman, who uses gender-neutral \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns, said the document provided a formal rebuttal to bigoted people who continue to assert that \u201cthere are only two genders\u201d: \u201cNow, I have an official paper that says no.\u201d Oregon became the first state to adopt the \u201cX\u201d marker for state IDs in 2017, and a number of states and cities have since followed suit and also adopted new rules to allow non-binary people to have gender-neutral markers on their birth certificates. At the same time, there have been legal battles and legislative efforts across the globe aimed at allowing non-binary passports. Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Canada and other countries have implemented changes, but the US government has not. Having the correct gender on a state ID can help non-binary and trans people in their daily interactions and transactions where they may be misgendered or denied basic recognition, whether at work, a bar, a doctor\u2019s office, a bank, a police station or any other place where people have to show ID. \u201cIt\u2019s the very beginning of a way larger fight,\u201d said Nazanin Szanto, a 25-year-old genderqueer Oakland resident. \u201cNon-binary people have been here forever \u2026 Now, we\u2019re getting recognition. We\u2019re getting a chance to live slightly more authentically.\u201d California estimates that about 54,600 people will take advantage of the reforms and seek an ID gender change in the first year of the new law, said Artemio Armenta, a DMV spokesperson. The new law allows people to \u201cself certify\u201d, which means they don\u2019t need medical records. This change will also make it easier for trans people to change their IDs to male or female since they previously required doctor\u2019s notes. The state estimates roughly 20,000 people will seek gender changes each subsequent year, Armenta said. California often leads the way in progressive policies and could set the stage for the rapid adoption of reforms across the nation, said Toby Adams, the executive director of the Intersex and Genderqueer Recognition Project, noting that many in California have long advocated for this change and are heading to the DMV this week. \u201cHaving an \u2018M\u2019 or \u2018F\u2019 marker on that piece of identification that is used so frequently is really like being forced to carry around a lie about who you are,\u201d she said. Xin Farrish and Char Crawford, who are San Francisco spouses and are non-binary, said they anticipated the \u201cX\u201d marker on their IDs would lead to frequent questions and opportunities to educate others about non-binary people. \u201cI\u2019m very eager and curious to see what will happen,\u201d said Crawford, 34. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do \u2026 I do hope the rest of the country follows the lead of California and Oregon.\u201d Farrish, 36, said people often make incorrect assumptions about their gender when they see their ID and hope the change to \u201cX\u201d can make a difference: \u201cThis feels like it is exactly right.\u201d Some have recognized that there are risks to getting the \u201cX\u201d marker, including the potential for increased harassment or interrogation from federal agencies that don\u2019t recognize the third gender option. \u201cThere are a lot of folks who can\u2019t be out, and it\u2019s safer for them to have \u2018M\u2019 or \u2018F\u2019 on their license,\u201d said Szanto, who plans to get the \u201cX\u201d marker. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m doing for myself. It has a lot more to do with visibility and advocacy for folks who can\u2019t be visible.\u201d Altman, who works at Google and went to the Santa Clara DMV, live-tweeted their experience and said in an interview after getting their ID that the process was fairly smooth. At airports and other places, people often scrutinize their ID out of \u201ccuriosity\u201d, they said. \u201cThey see me and say, \u2018Wait is that a man or a woman?\u2019 They think the IDs will tell the \u2018truth\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t want to have to deal with people second-guessing, what is their real gender?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What better to ease viewers out of any residual festive mood and into the new year than Waco: Madman or Messiah? \u2013 Storyville (BBC Four)? This dense two-part documentary, first shown in the US in early 2018, chronicles the events that led to the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Texas in 1993, which resulted in scores of deaths. The title\u2019s implication that David Koresh might not have been all bad may seem a little off given the horrific outcome. But it turns out to be a fair indication of a nuanced film that interviews many people involved, from government officials to survivors, some of whom still believe that Koresh was sent by God to do his work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"954e765700c44f3b0731e8763ca9fff6420d9957\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/954e765700c44f3b0731e8763ca9fff6420d9957/98_0_1434_1792/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Branch Davidian leader, David Koresh.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sent by God to do his work? \u2026 the Branch Davidian leader, David Koresh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The blunt force of the material is remarkable, and there is a lot of it. You get the sense that, even at 85 minutes for the first instalment, there would have been enough for a Ken Burns-style detailed analysis over many more hours than this. There are interviews with people who survived the siege, and with those who left the Branch Davidians before their apocalyptic beliefs led them towards the hellish inferno that Mount Carmel became. There is extensive footage from inside the complex over the 12 years Koresh was there, rolling news coverage of the siege itself, and 247 tapes\u2019 worth of conversations between Koresh and the FBI, which took place as the standoff played out.</p> <p>Many of the tapes had not been heard by the public before this documentary. Given the context in which they were recorded, their calm is staggering. Koresh, formerly Vernon Howell, gives a history of his life and beliefs, and of how, having struggled with a difficult childhood, he came to be a self-proclaimed messiah. His aunt recalls how his mother was 14 when she had him, and he was raised as her sibling until she married a cruel man and took him away from the family he knew. When he joined the Branch Davidians, after a night of \u201ccussing out God\u201d, he claimed to have impregnated their 70-year-old leader. \u201cI am God!\u201d he yelled, asking how that would be possible if he were not. She was said to miscarry, and as a result, he started to believe that she was not the spiritual leader and therefore he must be.</p> <p>It gets stranger and more disturbing. Accounts of Koresh\u2019s charisma and skills of persuasion come thick and fast. \u201cHe could tell you the grass was blue, and he would get you to believe it,\u201d says one former follower. As his leadership grew more proscriptive and controlling, Koresh issued an edict that marital relations were forbidden within the families who moved to Mount Carmel to follow him, then declared that he was the only one capable of producing \u201crighteous children\u201d. He fathered 24 of them. He had sexual relationships with underage girls, often with the permission of their families.

      "bodyText": "What better to ease viewers out of any residual festive mood and into the new year than Waco: Madman or Messiah? \u2013 Storyville (BBC Four)? This dense two-part documentary, first shown in the US in early 2018, chronicles the events that led to the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Texas in 1993, which resulted in scores of deaths. The title\u2019s implication that David Koresh might not have been all bad may seem a little off given the horrific outcome. But it turns out to be a fair indication of a nuanced film that interviews many people involved, from government officials to survivors, some of whom still believe that Koresh was sent by God to do his work. The blunt force of the material is remarkable, and there is a lot of it. You get the sense that, even at 85 minutes for the first instalment, there would have been enough for a Ken Burns-style detailed analysis over many more hours than this. There are interviews with people who survived the siege, and with those who left the Branch Davidians before their apocalyptic beliefs led them towards the hellish inferno that Mount Carmel became. There is extensive footage from inside the complex over the 12 years Koresh was there, rolling news coverage of the siege itself, and 247 tapes\u2019 worth of conversations between Koresh and the FBI, which took place as the standoff played out. Many of the tapes had not been heard by the public before this documentary. Given the context in which they were recorded, their calm is staggering. Koresh, formerly Vernon Howell, gives a history of his life and beliefs, and of how, having struggled with a difficult childhood, he came to be a self-proclaimed messiah. His aunt recalls how his mother was 14 when she had him, and he was raised as her sibling until she married a cruel man and took him away from the family he knew. When he joined the Branch Davidians, after a night of \u201ccussing out God\u201d, he claimed to have impregnated their 70-year-old leader. \u201cI am God!\u201d he yelled, asking how that would be possible if he were not. She was said to miscarry, and as a result, he started to believe that she was not the spiritual leader and therefore he must be. It gets stranger and more disturbing. Accounts of Koresh\u2019s charisma and skills of persuasion come thick and fast. \u201cHe could tell you the grass was blue, and he would get you to believe it,\u201d says one former follower. As his leadership grew more proscriptive and controlling, Koresh issued an edict that marital relations were forbidden within the families who moved to Mount Carmel to follow him, then declared that he was the only one capable of producing \u201crighteous children\u201d. He fathered 24 of them. He had sexual relationships with underage girls, often with the permission of their families. One of the most extraordinary testimonies comes from the Branch Davidian Kathryn Schroder, who talks of giving up her husband for Koresh. \u201cIt was the highest honour \u2026 to be taken as God\u2019s wife when you don\u2019t even feel like you deserve it.\u201d By 1993, Koresh\u2019s paranoia and insularity had become destructive. The cult had trained for apocalyptic warfare, armed to the hilt for the end of days, as written in the book of Revelation. (Dick J Reavis, a hard-boiled reporter for the Dallas Observer and one of the standout contributors, gives his own unique take: \u201cWhen I read the book of Revelation, I say, oh, the guy who wrote it was on acid. First acid work.\u201d) According to this film, 82 people, including 23 children, lost their lives. There has been much controversy over the government\u2019s handling of the siege; there is space left to explore why and how it went so horribly wrong in the second part, airing on Thursday. Waco: Madman or Messiah? is certainly a detailed account that distributes its astonishment evenly, though the story of it all, from the beginnings of the cult to their own end of days, is so enormous that plenty is skipped over in order to tell the story concisely. Netflix\u2019s Wild Wild Country was another popular slack-jawed account of life in a cult. It got away with a confusing and messy chronology by weight of the story being so gripping. This documentary takes a more elegant approach, and is no less fascinating for it.",

Some massive results near the bottom of the table, particularly for Burnley, who climb out of the bottom three at the expense of Southampton, who will be delighted with their point away to Chelsea. That\u2019s eight defeats on the bounce for Huddersfield, the first time in their league history that that has happened. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m eager to hear Sean Dyche\u2019s thoughts on Brady\u2019s disgraceful foul given his recent moralising re diving \u2026\u201d emails Stephen Carr (the real one?!). </p> <p>An incredibly frustrating evening for Chelsea, not only for the result, but also the performance. It\u2019s not as though they were knocking down Southampton\u2019s door, although Angus Gunn did make two saves which caught the eye. Palace are now six points clear of the bottom three with that 2-0 win at Wolves \u2013 Roy Hodgson has got Zaha and co playing well.</p> <p>A crazy game at Bournemouth, where we saw six first-half goals and four within six minutes to leave this MBMer particularly flustered. Two well-matched teams in truth, Watford will feel more frustrated, having let a 2-0 and 3-2 lead slip. Neither teams are likely to trouble the European places or relegation zone this season. </p> <p>The same can probably be said for West Ham and Brighton. The Hammers\u2019 defending at set pieces was AWFUL but they are lucky to have a striker like Arnautovic, who could easily play for a Champions League team in my opinion. Worth noting that two of West Ham\u2019s subs, Noble and Antonio, had a real impact off the bench, although it was debatable as to whether Antonio kept the ball in play to set up West Ham\u2019s equaliser. It was a matter of millimetres. </p> <p>Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. I\u2019ll see you next time. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100\"> <table data-embed-type=\"table\"

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s your lot. Some massive results near the bottom of the table, particularly for Burnley, who climb out of the bottom three at the expense of Southampton, who will be delighted with their point away to Chelsea. That\u2019s eight defeats on the bounce for Huddersfield, the first time in their league history that that has happened. \u201cI\u2019m eager to hear Sean Dyche\u2019s thoughts on Brady\u2019s disgraceful foul given his recent moralising re diving \u2026\u201d emails Stephen Carr (the real one?!). An incredibly frustrating evening for Chelsea, not only for the result, but also the performance. It\u2019s not as though they were knocking down Southampton\u2019s door, although Angus Gunn did make two saves which caught the eye. Palace are now six points clear of the bottom three with that 2-0 win at Wolves \u2013 Roy Hodgson has got Zaha and co playing well. A crazy game at Bournemouth, where we saw six first-half goals and four within six minutes to leave this MBMer particularly flustered. Two well-matched teams in truth, Watford will feel more frustrated, having let a 2-0 and 3-2 lead slip. Neither teams are likely to trouble the European places or relegation zone this season. The same can probably be said for West Ham and Brighton. The Hammers\u2019 defending at set pieces was AWFUL but they are lucky to have a striker like Arnautovic, who could easily play for a Champions League team in my opinion. Worth noting that two of West Ham\u2019s subs, Noble and Antonio, had a real impact off the bench, although it was debatable as to whether Antonio kept the ball in play to set up West Ham\u2019s equaliser. It was a matter of millimetres. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. I\u2019ll see you next time. I\u2019ve just seen footage of Fabregas after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge. He is clearly saying his goodbye to the Chelsea fans, waving to the crowd and blowing kisses and he makes his way around the pitch. It\u2019s also all over at Newcastle, where Manchester United have won 2-0. That\u2019s four wins on the bounce for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r \u2013 Manchester United are now just six points adrift of Chelsea in fourth! That it on the south coast. A crazy first half, an underwhelming second. 90+2 min: Penalty shout for Watford! Cleverly beats Ake to the ball in Bournemouth\u2019s box, toe-poking the ball round the Dutchman, but the former Manchester United and Everton man falls a little too theatrically. Not given. 90 min: Three minutes added on at Bournemouth 3-3 Watford. Both teams look knackered. It\u2019s worth remembering that Southampton made eight changes from their last game, but they defended with real cohesion and heart. Valery, Vestergaard and Yoshida in particular were excellent. Saints fans will be delighted that their team has that resilience under Hasenh\u00fcttl. They certainly didn\u2019t look capable of a goalless draw at Chelsea under Hughes. An email from Matt Richman: I\u2019m preaching to a small but preexisting choir now when I complain about the state of Chelsea\u2019s fans. Heading to the Bridge\u2019s exit as soon as the clock hits 90, at 0-0 against a bottom half team with the away fans bringing the only audible noise in the arena? Come on now \u2026 84 min: Watford have the ball in the net, but Deeney is denied his hat-trick for a foul on Ak\u00e9. It\u2019s a good header from Deeney, who glances it inside the near post but in fairness, Watford\u2019s captain didn\u2019t argue with the decision to rule of the goal. Burnley hold on for the win, despite going down to 10 late on. A huge result for Roy Hodgson. What a defensive performance that is from the Saints: especially Angus Gunn on his Premier League debut! Zaha has got a reputation of going down a little easy, but there\u2019s no doubt that this was a spot kick: Wolves\u2019 Bennett the guilty party. Milivojevic makes no mistake, curling a brilliant shot into the top left corner. 90+1 min: Penalty shout for Chelsea! Long nudges Alonso inside the box, the Spaniard goes down but Mike Dean waves play on! 89 min: It\u2019s 10 v 10 in Huddersfield! Brady given a straight red for a tackle on Mbenza. Both feet were off the ground and it was a pretty shocking scissor tackle in truth! Five minutes added on here for injury time. 87 min: Huddersfield are going route one now. They\u2019ve got three minutes left to find an equaliser against Burnley. 71 min: After a manic first-half in the 8pm kick-off at Bournemouth, there have been no goals in the second. It\u2019s still 3-3 there. \u201cWatford should be down to 8 men,\u201d emails J.R. in Illinois. \u201cDoucoure got only a yellow for a flying kung fu kick on Fraser and Capoue, already on a yellow, somehow is still on the pitch after lashing out and raking his fingers across Gosling\u2019s eyeballs. It\u2019s pretty crazy. Referee David Coote has had no control of the game at any point.\u201d 85 min: Southampton are defending magnificently at Chelsea. Yoshida in particular has been great. Still 0-0. A massive goal for Palace, and it\u2019s a good finish from Jordan Ayew, who scores his first goal for the south London club. If results stay this way, they will be six points clear of the bottom three at full-time. 80 min: Declan Rice goes close to completing the comeback for West Ham. The ball breaks kindly to the youngster on the edge of the area and Rice absolutely leathers a shot towards the top corner, but it just flies wide into the side netting. 77 min: Morata denied again! This time it\u2019s a fantastic save from Gunn which keeps the score goalless. Loftus-Cheek, who came on for Willian in the first half, uses his pace and power to drive forward and the ball eventually ends up with Morata on the left. The Spaniard is one on one with Gunn, but is rushed into taking the ball onto his left foot. Gunn sticks out a left hand and palms it again. Manchester United have taken the lead at Newcastle. Join Jacob Steinberg for more. Burnley come from behind to take the lead against 10-man Huddersfield. And it was the red card that was probably decisive, Huddersfield were far too stretched at the back. Wood found Westwood on the edge, and the former Villa man neatly slipped in Ashley Barnes, who had time to take a touch and slot it past Lossl. 70 min: Morata is deemed to be offside, but this is a matter of inches! He\u2019s probably just off, after Fabregas showed great awareness to slip him in. Still goalless at the Bridge with Southampton. Two goals in three minutes sees West Ham level! It\u2019s that man Arnautovic again, after good work from another substitute, Antonio. The Englishman showed great pace and power to get to the byline ahead of Bernardo, Antonio cut the ball back to Arnautovic and the Austrian showed great composure to kill the ball dead and lash it in off the underside of Brighton\u2019s bar. Arnautovic looks really fired up! He beckons for his team-mates to get the ball, West Ham are now going for the winner! Mark Noble makes an instant impact! He floats a great ball over the top, Arnautovic shows great strength to hold off Duffy \u2013 no mean feat \u2013 and he pops the ball between the legs of the onrushing Brighton keeper Button. 62 min: West Ham make two much-needed changes: Antonio comes on for Snodgrass and Noble comes on for Obiang. Looks like Arnautovic will have a strike partner now, West Ham are going for broke. Bournemouth 3-3 Watford is getting back underway. Let\u2019s hope for more of the same in the second half. West Ham are going to pieces, and it\u2019s due to more dismal defending at a corner. Another Gross delivery goes all the way through West Ham\u2019s six yard box. Duffy is completely unmarked, has enough time to take a touch, and pokes a shot into the roof of Fabianski\u2019s net. West Ham concede for the eight successive home game! Brighton score from a Pascal Gross corner: Locadia is standing on Fabianski, and the Polish keeper can only punch the ball to the edge of the area, where Stephens is waiting. The midfielder gets his knee over the ball and crashes a shot into the net. There was nobody on the far post: had there been, it surely would have been blocked. 55 min: Nothing to report at Stamford Bridge, other than Valery, the young right back is having an excellent game against Hazard. 53 min: Big chance for West Ham! Felipe Anderson runs at Brighton\u2019s defence \u2013 the Brazilian is so dangerous when he\u2019s in full-flight \u2013 but the former Lazio man drags his shot inches wide of Brighton\u2019s left-hand post. 52 min: West Ham\u2019s Zabaleta has taken a knock: he\u2019s clutching his head. Play has stopped, but I think he\u2019s going to be OK to continue. 50 min: Big chance for Burnley! A corner is delivered to the back post, Chris Wood has a free header two yards out, but he nods it wide! Lossl was flapping at thin air, he was nowhere! 47 min: Schindler apparently forgot that he had already got a yellow! Scenes. Peeeeeep! We\u2019re underway again in the 7.45pms. Carroll has been hooked by Pellegrini at half-time. He\u2019s taken off for Perez. \u201cLondon stadium resident here, emails Ian Sargeant. \u201cNo highlights here so far. It\u2019s been dreadful. Guy next to me has texted the screen operator to see if they can show ITV3 instead of snippets of the game and adverts.\u201d The 7.45pm GMT games about to get underway, but why not give this a read and make yourself a cuppa. 44 min: Bournemouth break forward, Fraser is starting to enjoy himself on the left wing, cutting inside two players but slipping at the crucial moment. The ball simply popped up into Foster\u2019s arms for an easy save. So we\u2019ve got no goals in three of the four 7.45pm kick-offs and six goals in Bournemouth v Watford. This is getting silly now. We\u2019ve had four goals in six minutes, and six in the half. It\u2019s a wonderful Bournemouth move that brings them level. Brooks breaks down the right, sends a cross in which is dummied expertly by Wilson. Femenia buys the dummy, leaving Fraser free at the back post. The little Scot makes no mistake, calmly side-footing the ball into the corner. It\u2019s fair to say that Bournemouth\u2019s fans have gone absolutely mental. Sensational scenes in our 8pm kick-off. Almost directly from kick-off, Watford re-take the lead! Deeney wins a flick on, and Sema steals in from the right. He takes the shot early, and fires a volley inside the near post from outside the box, catching Begovic completely off guard. And breath. Bournemouth are level! A quite sensational header from Callum Wilson, who beautifully glances a free-kick into the top corner. No chance for Foster! Bournemouth get one back, but just wait \u2026 Mike Dean is booed off for showing the red card to Schindler. West Ham have probably had the better of it. It\u2019s been a poor game: Gunn making one good save from Hazard. 44 min: Huddersfield are making an immediate change: Durm is coming on for Pritchard, so it looks like the Terriers\u2019 attacking intent will be limited. Durm comes on at left back, with Kongolo moving inside to centre back. 42 min: This game has turned on its head! What a nightmare couple of minutes for Huddersfield. McNeil, who has once again been very impressive for Burnley, drives at Schindler, who was already on a yellow card. The German is booked again \u2013 he argues but it\u2019s a yellow all day long. It\u2019s a free kick to Burnley on the edge of the box, Gudmundsson curls an effort over the wall but Lossl saves well. Burnley get back on terms! Dwight McNeil gets some space on the left, and finds Chris Wood, who makes no mistake from six yards. That\u2019s his 100th goal in English football. Watford double their lead, and it\u2019s two for Deeney too! Deulofeu runs at Ak\u00e9, his cross is blocked, but Deeney is there to pounce on the rebound and lash the ball into the net. 37 min: Penalty shout for West Ham. Arnautovic goes down in heap after a clumsy tackle from Dunk. It\u2019s probably a penalty but Chris Kavanagh waves play on! 35 min: Hazard denied by Gunn! Chelsea have been poor but they spring into life down the left. Hazard slips his man and fires a fierce shot towards the roof of the net, but the ball his Gunn in the shoulder and bounces clear. He didn\u2019t know much about it, but that was an excellent save from the 22 year old. Mouni\u00e9\u2019s first goal since April! This is a simple goal, but a good one, all owing to the cross from Mbenza, who curls a beautiful, inswinging, arching delivery from the left wing. It catches Mee and Tarkowski flat-footed in the middle and all Mouni\u00e9 has to do it glance it into the corner from six yards out. Massive goal at the bottom. 30 min: Amazing double save from Huddersfield\u2019s Lossl! First he gets down well to palm away a back-post header, then immediately gets up and spreads himself in front of Westwood, who sees his shot blocked from an acute angle! The away side take the lead with their first attack. Femenia plays an incisive ball into the right channel, Doucour\u00e9 crosses and Deeney heads it back across goal. A classic header from the club captain. 10 min: First chance in the late kick-off between Bournemouth and Watford, which falls to the home side. A cross is headed out and Lerma slashes at it wildly. Should have done a lot better. 22 min: I\u2019ve been impressed with Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez this season. He\u2019s led the line well and also provided a genuine goal threat. Seems to be struggling tonight though against Palace. It\u2019s 0-0 there. 20 min: Whisper it, but Southampton are looking quite comfortable at Stamford Bridge. 17 min: Big chance for Huddersfield! Billing wings a long throw into the box: Mouni\u00e9 wins the flick on with the ball falling to Kongolo who swivels and misses. The ball breaks to Schindler six yards out and the German toe-pokes it at goal, but his shot is blocked by his team-mate Pritchard. Corner to Huddersfield, which is well cleared by Burnley. 15 min: It\u2019s kicked off in the late kick off between Bournemouth and Watford, and also with Newcastle v Manchester United, which you can follow with Jacob Steinberg. 13 min: Azpilicueta floats a wonderfully-weighted ball over the top of Southampton\u2019s defence and Morata has a golden chance to score, but only glances the ball into Gunn\u2019s arms. It was a tricky header no doubt \u2013 a slightly easier version of that RVP goal for Holland in the World Cup \u2013 but still a tame effort from the Spaniard. Morata hasn\u2019t scored enough for Chelsea this season, but Azpilicueta has a funny knack of picking out his compatriot with crosses. I remember at least three Chelsea goals from that combination. The two obviously have a good connection on the pitch. 11 min: Carroll is doing his best to hold the ball up, but he\u2019s a little bit off the pace, and fouls Stephens well inside West Ham\u2019s half. 9 min: Chelsea have their first big chance of the game with a free kick on the edge of Southampton\u2019s box. It\u2019s on the right side, so suiting the left footer, and Alonso sees his effort deflected over. 7 min: Palace are dominating at Wolves, they\u2019ve had 83% possession! No big chances yet though. 5 min: Huddersfield are having all of the ball against Burnley, who seem to have reverted to their normal selves: compact without the ball, direct with it. 2 min: Brighton have started well at West Ham. Two corners in quick succession lead to two chances: the first sees in-form Locadia volley a shot at goal, which is blocked by Obiang. The second sees the ball drop to Duffy at the back post, but the defender can only loop a header into Fabianski\u2019s arms. Peeeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re underway in four games: Chelsea v Southampton Huddersfield v Burnley West Ham v Brighton Wolves v Crystal Palace Bournemouth v Watford will kick off at 8pm. Yep, although he doesn\u2019t have as much dynamism. He can\u2019t play wide, he can\u2019t play in a two in midfield. He basically has to play in the No 10 role, which is not the same as Lanzini, or even Snodgrass. West Ham\u2019s No 9, Andy Carroll, is making his first start in exactly a year, when he started against West Brom. He did this in injury time. He\u2019s got eight goals in his last eight games in January. Doesn\u2019t even wear gloves. FACT! If there is ever a campaign to bring back stanchions, this video is surely it. Palace battered Wolves 4-1 in 1995, scoring four worldies in the process. Just a rumour but it looks like Dominic Solanke\u2019s move to Palace is off. For all the confirmed transfers, have a go on our interactive. In other news, this is a friend of a friend. If anyone can help with further sightings/ CCTV then please let the police know on 101 quoting incident 262 on 23rd December. Samir Nasri is on the bench for West Ham, following the end of his doping suspension and his short-term move to east London. Will be very interesting to see how he gets on this season \u2013 it\u2019s a very West Ham signing the guy is obviously a baller, but not sure he\u2019ll have the legs to suit Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team. With Mark Noble and Robert Snodgrass in the squad, I\u2019m not sure how much room there is for another ball-playing midfielder that sort of floats around the edge of the penalty box. Bournemouth v Watford will now kick off at 8pm. The fire service has been called to deal with an incident at Dean Court. Team news for Bournemouth: Gosling and Lerma come into central midfield, with Surman dropping to the bench. Looks like Eddie Howe\u2019s side are playing a 4-4-2 tonight. Watford make a massive five changes from the side that drew against Newcastle: Femen\u00eda, Holebas, Doucour\u00e9, Sema, and Deeney come in for Janmaat, Masina, Quina, Hughes, Success Tough match this for Southampton, who are not expected to win at Chelsea but have a much easier run of games in January and February. Their next five games in the league see them face Leicester, Everton, Palace, Burnley and Cardiff. Saints are currently out of the relegation zone on goal difference. I\u2019d say Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl would be disappointed if there isn\u2019t daylight between them and the bottom three by the end of that run. Hasenh\u00fcttl does make a couple of interesting changes: England U-21 goalkeeper Angus Gunn, son of former Norwich keeper Bryan, makes his first Premier League start and 19-year-old Callum Slattery is on the Southampton bench for the first time. Matt Targett has a knock so it looks like Cedric Soares will play on the left side of defence.

And finally we kept a clean sheet on set pieces. I thought it was a very professional performance. We were in control and kept plugging away. A great strike by Marcus and great reaction by Rom. When you the keeper sees big Rom running towards you, I think you will take your hands away. In the first half it was like a testimonial at times - too slow. But a very professional performance in the end. We have the FA Cup on Saturday morning but we go to Dubai and work on a bit of fitness. It\u2019s a good time now. In March and April we will need legs and I think we\u2019ve got them.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2d3580e4b02fb91ff0d25e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-02T22:06:54.088Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Marcus Rashford speaks! </strong>\u201cHard work was definitely the key. They were difficult to break down. When we could counter that was when they were open. We got there in the end. I think relaxing in front of goal is key. Having those words around you makes a difference.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Romelu Lukaku speaks about his goalscoring cameo!</strong> \u201cYou have to be ready. That\u2019s what the manager asked from me. I just tried to help the team. I knew the goalkeeper might fumble. He didn\u2019t in the first half but I was there. Marcus, I and Anthony are learning a lot from the manager.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c2d33a6e4b0cebe7617ef34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-02T22:01:58.187Z\">10.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newcastle defended well for long spells and had some good chances but it was an uphill struggle after Martin Dubravka gifted Romelu Lukaku the opener. </strong>Rafa Benitez\u2019s side are two points above the bottom three and are in desperate need of reinforcements this month. The picture looks rosier for Manchester United, though. A fourth consecutive win under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer maintains their post-Jose recovery and sees them go six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Suddenly their season has meaning, although it will be interesting to see how they fare against Tottenham on Sunday week.

Just like the old days in a way. In fact sometimes you almost get the sense that United would love nothing more than to transport themselves back to the 90s. Why not get the whole band back together? Fergie and Ole together in the dugout, Giggsy and Becks on the wings, Keano ... well, maybe it wouldn\u2019t work with Keano and Fergie any more. But you get the drift. The 90s: a bloody great time to be alive if you supported Manchester United Football Club.</p> <p>Mind you, the same could be said of Newcastle United supporters. Those were some rare times indeed for St James\u2019s Park regulars. They almost won the title with Kevin Keegan and charge and the football was magnificent, with the likes of Faustino Asprilla, Peter Beardsley, David Ginola, Les Ferdinand, Alan Shearer and Temuri Ketsbaia in attack. This was one of the top fixtures. There was always excitement and meaning when Newcastle played Manchester United.</p> <p>At the start of 2019, however, things are a little different for both of these clubs. Having sacked Jose Mourinho last month, United are in a state of flux and it remains to be seen if their revival under Caretaker Ole will last, even though the Norwegian interim has lifted them eight points off the top four after starting with thumping wins over Cardiff, Bournemouth and Huddersfield. Newcastle, meanwhile, are gripped by gloom and ennui as they pine for someone to buy the club from Mike Ashley. Rafa Benitez\u2019s side are three points above the bottom three after one win in seven and the manager continues to strike a fatalistic tone. Newcastle can\u2019t even go down the 90s nostalgia route; they already tried that with Shearer in 2009.</p> <p>Benitez is likely to go defensive this evening. He usually does when he hosts one of the Big Six at St James\u2019 Park, though you wonder if it might be a plan to attack this United side, who are weaker at the back than in attack. That\u2019s something Solskjaer\u2019s already cottoned on to after lifting the Mourinho straitjacket off his players and giving Paul Pogba the freedom to play with his natural swagger. They\u2019ve started to look a little more like the Manchester United of old again. Compared to Newcastle they\u2019re certainly more in touch with their true identity at the moment. But there\u2019s still a long way to go.<br></p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 8pm GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-02T19:35:06.402Z\">at 7.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Louise Taylor\u2019s report from St James\u2019s Park. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks! \u201cA fourth clean sheet in open play on the spin. And finally we kept a clean sheet on set pieces. I thought it was a very professional performance. We were in control and kept plugging away. A great strike by Marcus and great reaction by Rom. When you the keeper sees big Rom running towards you, I think you will take your hands away. In the first half it was like a testimonial at times - too slow. But a very professional performance in the end. We have the FA Cup on Saturday morning but we go to Dubai and work on a bit of fitness. It\u2019s a good time now. In March and April we will need legs and I think we\u2019ve got them.\u201d Marcus Rashford speaks! \u201cHard work was definitely the key. They were difficult to break down. When we could counter that was when they were open. We got there in the end. I think relaxing in front of goal is key. Having those words around you makes a difference.\u201d Romelu Lukaku speaks about his goalscoring cameo! \u201cYou have to be ready. That\u2019s what the manager asked from me. I just tried to help the team. I knew the goalkeeper might fumble. He didn\u2019t in the first half but I was there. Marcus, I and Anthony are learning a lot from the manager.\u201d Newcastle defended well for long spells and had some good chances but it was an uphill struggle after Martin Dubravka gifted Romelu Lukaku the opener. Rafa Benitez\u2019s side are two points above the bottom three and are in desperate need of reinforcements this month. The picture looks rosier for Manchester United, though. A fourth consecutive win under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer maintains their post-Jose recovery and sees them go six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Suddenly their season has meaning, although it will be interesting to see how they fare against Tottenham on Sunday week. Ole v Poch: spicy. That\u2019s your lot! 90 min+5: Dubravka saves Lukaku\u2019s low shot. But it\u2019s a bit late now, isn\u2019t it. 90 min+3: Lingard releases Pogba, who skips round Dubravka and tries to fire into an empty net. However he\u2019s forced himself wide and ends up stroking the ball into the side netting. The Newcastle fans jeer, but they aren\u2019t really getting the last laugh here, are they. 90 min+1: Pogba\u2019s still arguing with Shelvey. He got his revenge on the Newcastle midfielder with a heavy tackle a few minutes ago. By the way, six added ones. 90 min: Yedlin is down with a foot injury. 89 min: Shelvey sends a header on to the top of the net. 87 min: Jesse Lingard replaces Marcus Rashford, who turns out to be good at football. Who knew? 85 min: Ritchie sends a shot well off target. Newcastle are done here. 83 min: This is all pretty embarrassing for Jose Mourinho, isn\u2019t it. 82 min: Yoshinori Muto replaces Fabian Schar. A Newcastle attack breaks down and United set off on of their own, Rashford freeing Lukaku down the right. Lukaku cuts inside before finding Sanchez, who turns, looks up and pokes a brilliant pass through three Newcastle defenders, all of whom have left Rashford alone on the left. Rashford takes a moment to make up his mind. Then he slides a serene finish under Dubravka. Easy. United kill the game on the counterattack! 75 min: Shaw\u2019s booked for pulling back Yedlin. Shelvey\u2019s free-kick is cleared as far as Atsu, who fires wide from 20 yards. 74 min: Rashford slams the free-kick into the wall. The Newcastle fans are booing Pogba now, which is stupid. 73 min: Shelvey brings Pogba down with an awful challenge 30 yards from goal, lunging into the back of Pogba\u2019s legs with his studs. That was basically a stamp. Absolutely moronic from Shelvey, who could have done Pogba some serious harm. No wonder Pogba is fuming and wants a word with Shelvey, who is very lucky not to be sent off. 71 min: Shelvey clips a free-kick into the area from the right after a foul by Sanchez. Pogba inadvertently turns the ball through to Rondon but the striker\u2019s too slow to control, turn and shoot before De Gea denies him. 69 min: Shelvey blazes high and wide from 20 yards. That\u2019s the cue for Newcastle to bring on Kenedy for Perez. 66 min: That\u2019s two in two off the bench for Lukaku. He\u2019s had his critics this season but he\u2019s making an impact for Solskjaer. The free-kick\u2019s to the left of the D and around 30 yards from goal. Marcus Rashford fancies another strike. He drives it over the wall and it moves through the air awkwardly. Dubravka should still hold it, though. It\u2019s straight at him and he has both hands behind it. Instead he spills it and Lukaku reacts before Lascelles to force the rebound home from six yards! He\u2019s been on the pitch less than a minute. What a substitution from Solskjaer! He can do no wrong! 63 min: United make a double change, Juan Mata and Anthony Martial making way for Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku. United, meanwhile, have a free-kick on the left. And... 61 min: Shelvey, influential again, prods a pass through to the livewire Atsu. However he doesn\u2019t have the pace or strength to get away from Lindelof, who levers the winger off the ball as De Gea races out to smother. 60 min: Shelvey clips a beautiful pass through to Perez, slicing United open brilliantly with the outside of his right foot. Yet Perez wants too long and lets Shaw recover to make a fine block on his shot. Then Shelvey has a pop from 18 yards. Straight at De Gea. Newcastle are the better side at the moment. 59 min: Martial tries to thread a pass through to Rashford, but Ritchie eases the striker off the ball and makes sure Newcastle get a goal-kick. 58 min: Atsu scoots down the left and decides to have a shot from 20 yards. His effort flashes well wide. 57 min: Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez are warming up for United, who might make a change soon. 55 min: It\u2019s impressive how little has happened since half-time. 53 min: Jonjo Shelvey replaces the injured Mo Diame. Shelvey will either win the game for Newcastle or lose it for them. 51 min: Shaw and Mata both try to get the ball into the middle from the left. Nothing doing. Moments later Lindelof outmuscles Rondon and knocks a pass through to Rashford, who\u2019s played onside by Schar. The striker cuts inside, ignores his team-mates in the middle and hits a shot out for a throw. 48 min: A low-key start to the half. 46 min: Newcastle get the second half underway. It\u2019s not long before Lindelof gets a booking. Half-time reading The home fans applaud. It hasn\u2019t been too bad, you know, but we await the first goal. Manchester United end the half looking likelier. 45 min+2: Diame returns. 45 min: Now Diame\u2019s down and in need of a chat with the physio. This has petered out. Two added minutes. 44 min: Atsu returns to the pitch after some treatment. He\u2019s faded after a bright start. Newcastle could do with him stirring again. They have no spark up front at the moment. 42 min: Mata\u2019s curling delivery tempts Phil Jones. He clears it effortlessly. 41 min: Pogba\u2019s fouled on the right. Mata goes across to take the free-kick. 39 min: After some treatment, Martial lives. Hopefully he won\u2019t have woken up thinking that Mourinho\u2019s still in charge. 38 min: Perez accidentally boots the ball straight into Martial\u2019s face. Down goes the Frenchman. It\u2019s been that sort of half. In fact it\u2019s quite a feat we haven\u2019t seen either team score a farcical goal yet. But Phil Jones is on the pitch, so anything\u2019s possible. 36 min: \u201cIf Solksjaer picks Phil Jones to play against Mbappe and Neymar surely UEFA are going to have to step in with some kind of mercy rule,\u201d Michael Meagher says. No, Michael. Solskjaer just loves attacking football too much. 35 min: Newcastle attack for the first time in around 15 minutes. Atsu crosses from the right and Rondon heads over from six yards. He couldn\u2019t quite rise high enough. 32 min: Lascelles, who\u2019s on a booking, dives into another full-blooded challenge to stop a surging Pogba, who\u2019s sent flying into the air. The replays suggest that was just about on the right side of legal. Which is fortunate for Lascelles given that Pogba was in the Newcastle area. 31 min: Pogba finds Martial, who threatens to burst through on the left, only for Schar to stand firm and deny the forward with a no-nonsense challenge. Moments later Martial flicks the ball through to Rashford, carving Newcastle open. When the ball\u2019s whipped off Rashford\u2019s toes, just in the nick of time, it runs to the right for Mata. But before the Spaniard can stroke home from close range, Dubravaka throws himself at his feet to save Newcastle again. 30 min: Pogba scoops a shot wide from the edge of the area. 28 min: Lascelles overruns the ball and commits himself into a thunderous challenge on Herrera. An obvious yellow card for the Newcastle skipper. 25 min: Another chance for United. Pogba slips a pass inside to Mata, who conjures a delightful assist to set up Martial. However the Frenchman slips after taking the ball on his chest and ends up scooping a disappointing volley over the bar. United\u2019s frustration grows. 24 min: Out of nothing, a long ball from the back from United causes all sorts of problems in the Not United defence. Lascelles and Schar run into each other in the Laurel and Hardy style, allowing Rashford to burst clear. Luckily for the comedy duo, Dubravaka\u2019s going about his job more seriously tonight and he ensures that a sliding Rashford can\u2019t poke the ball past him and into the net. 23 min: Atsu tries to release Rondon but United defender Phil Jones covers and manages not to score an own goal. \u201cGood evening J\u00e4cob, what\u2019s with all these photos of Manchester United staff smiling broadly?\u201d Justin K\u00e4v\u00e4n\u00e4gh says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Alexis Sanchez even knew how to smile any more. What a difference a visit from a kindly old veteran filled with good will from Lapland over Christmas makes.\u201d 22 min: \u201cIt\u2019s Newcastle United so please stop referring to Manchester just as United in your updates,\u201d weeps John Manning. 20 min: Still no goals for Rashford or Pogba or Martial. Get Fellaini on. That\u2019s how it works, right? 18 min: Perez drops deep and drives a lovely pass over the top to Atsu. Where\u2019s Valencia gone? The right-back\u2019s leaving his man a lot of space. However Atsu\u2019s first touch takes him wide and he lacks a clinical touch again, dragging a lame effort across the face of goal from the left of the United area. 15 min: United counter after that scare and almost silence the increasingly noisy home fans, only for Martial\u2019s shot from the left to rip into the side netting. Close. This might turn into a good game! 14 min: Atsu threatens again on the left after poor defending from Jones. The winger stands up Lindelof and dribbles past the Swede. He\u2019s cut inside on to his right feet and he tries to surprise De Gea with a low stabbed effort. The United goalkeeper is alive to the danger, though, diving to his right to hold. Moments later Newcastle cause more problems. Jones, who scored a majestic own goal against Valencia last month, is hassled into conceding possession by Perez after dawdling near his own area. It\u2019s so dozy and the pressure from Perez sees the ball run through to an onside Rondon, who\u2019s clear on goal. However the striker doesn\u2019t react quickly enough - was he expecting a flag? - and lets Jones race back to make a recovery tackle. 13 min: Newcastle lob an up and under into the United area and Atsu, more alert than Herrera, darts in from the left. The winger controls well but he\u2019s quickly under pressure and only manages to slide a shot straight at De Gea, who makes an easy save. 10 min: Martial runs on to a long ball down the right and tries to outpace Lascelles, who leans in and knocks the United forward over on the edge of the area. Andre Marriner isn\u2019t interested in United\u2019s appeals for another free-kick. Newcastle will argue it\u2019s a contact sport. 9 min: Martial wins a free-kick on the left after being fouled by Yedling. It\u2019s quite far out and the angle isn\u2019t great, but Rashford decides he wants to have a go after scoring at Cardiff. The striker tries to catch out Dubravka with a wobbling low effort towards the near post but the Newcastle goalkeeper dives to his right to make the save. He can\u2019t keep hold of the ball, though, and it squirms clear. There\u2019s a moment of panic in the Newcastle defence but they eventually get the situation under control. Or, to be more precise, Phil Jones was the player trying to do something with the loose ball. 8 min: This feels like Crystal Palace v Chelsea on Sunday, with the hosts sitting back and the visitors seeing most of the ball. The question is whether United can break Newcastle down. Or whether Newcastle will chance their arm with an attack or two. 7 min: Yedlin clips Pogba\u2019s heels on the left. United resist the temptation to send the big men forward from the back. They just keep on playing. Newcastle eventually win the ball back for a brief spell of possession, but they don\u2019t keep it for long. 5 min: Diame picks up possession on the halfway line and pings a long pass straight out for a goal-kick. Excellent. 4 min: United attack down the left, Martial dribbling into the area and exchanging passes with Mata. Yedlin stops the ball reaching Martial, who would have been through on goal. The ball comes back to Pogba, who shoots straight at Dubravka from the left. It seems Newcastle are playing a back five, with Dummett joining Schar and Lascelles in the middle and Yedlin and Ritchie as wing-backs. 2 min: Philippe Albert. Peep! Manchester United, in their red shirts and white shorts, get the game underway, kicking from left to right in the first half. Newcastle are, get this, in black and white stripes. Here come the teams! We\u2019ll have football under the St James\u2019s Park lights soon. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you Brits be bothered to get the basics right?\u201d Charles Bruggman roars. \u201cHis name is Fabian Sch\u00e4r (the umlaut modifies the sound). If you cannot find a keyboard with the appropriate accents, the alternative spelling is \u2018Schaer\u2019. Brexit does not justify sloppiness.\u201d Brexit means I don\u2019t have to use umlauts any more. About bloody time! Although I do have it in my locker. Watch: Ch\u00e4rles. Rafa Benitez speaks! \u201cIt will be a tough game but we are confident that we can win if we do things well. At the same time I say to my players we have to stay focused to the end. Hopefully it will be the same as last season and we can win. The key thing is to do things right. If we do maybe they will be frustrated. But they are a good team.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks! \u201cThe boys have set the standards of where we can perform. The first proper test is when you come away from home. It\u2019s never an easy game at Newcastle, although we had a decent record here when we played. It\u2019s a strong bench. We have a strong squad and that gives us options. I want to put Alexis Sanchez on because he\u2019s been looking sharp in training. He\u2019s been away for a month but he\u2019s really worked hard.\u201d Pre-match reading You\u2019ll remember that Alexis Sanchez\u2019s last-minute winner in Manchester United\u2019s comeback win over Newcastle at Old Trafford in October was a real turning point for Jose Mo... oh. But that was a cracking game. Newcastle swept into a two-goal lead at half-time and were unlucky not to be further ahead. They\u2019ll have a chance if they play like that, but they know better than most sides that United are hugely dangerous when they gather attacking momentum. Newcastle make one change after last Saturday\u2019s draw at Watford. Fabian Schar replaces the injured Federico Fernandez at the back. Manchester United make three changes after last Sunday\u2019s win over Bournemouth. Antonio Valencia replaces Ashley Young at right-back, Phil Jones comes in for the suspended Eric Bailly and Juan Mata starts in place of Jesse Lingard. Alexis Sanchez, who was absolutely devastated to see Jose Mourinho go, is on the bench after returning from injury. Newcastle: Dubravka; Yedlin, Schar, Lascelles, Dummett; Diame, Hayden; Ritchie, Perez, Atsu; Rondon. Subs: Woodman, Manquillo, Lejeune, Shelvey, Kenedy, Muto, Joseulu. Manchester United: De Gea; Valencia, Lindelof, Jones, Shaw; Matic, Herrera, Pogba; Mata; Rashford, Martial. Subs: Romero, Young, Fred, Darmian, Lingard, Sanchez, Lukaku. Referee: Andre Marriner. Hello. Turns out Sir Alex Ferguson headed into Manchester United\u2019s training ground to give a pep talk to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his coaching staff. Just like the old days in a way. In fact sometimes you almost get the sense that United would love nothing more than to transport themselves back to the 90s. Why not get the whole band back together? Fergie and Ole together in the dugout, Giggsy and Becks on the wings, Keano ... well, maybe it wouldn\u2019t work with Keano and Fergie any more. But you get the drift. The 90s: a bloody great time to be alive if you supported Manchester United Football Club. Mind you, the same could be said of Newcastle United supporters. Those were some rare times indeed for St James\u2019s Park regulars. They almost won the title with Kevin Keegan and charge and the football was magnificent, with the likes of Faustino Asprilla, Peter Beardsley, David Ginola, Les Ferdinand, Alan Shearer and Temuri Ketsbaia in attack. This was one of the top fixtures. There was always excitement and meaning when Newcastle played Manchester United. At the start of 2019, however, things are a little different for both of these clubs. Having sacked Jose Mourinho last month, United are in a state of flux and it remains to be seen if their revival under Caretaker Ole will last, even though the Norwegian interim has lifted them eight points off the top four after starting with thumping wins over Cardiff, Bournemouth and Huddersfield. Newcastle, meanwhile, are gripped by gloom and ennui as they pine for someone to buy the club from Mike Ashley. Rafa Benitez\u2019s side are three points above the bottom three after one win in seven and the manager continues to strike a fatalistic tone. Newcastle can\u2019t even go down the 90s nostalgia route; they already tried that with Shearer in 2009. Benitez is likely to go defensive this evening. He usually does when he hosts one of the Big Six at St James\u2019 Park, though you wonder if it might be a plan to attack this United side, who are weaker at the back than in attack. That\u2019s something Solskjaer\u2019s already cottoned on to after lifting the Mourinho straitjacket off his players and giving Paul Pogba the freedom to play with his natural swagger. They\u2019ve started to look a little more like the Manchester United of old again. Compared to Newcastle they\u2019re certainly more in touch with their true identity at the moment. But there\u2019s still a long way to go. Kick-off: 8pm GMT.",

Doucour\u00e9\u2019s studs were high as he recklessly lunged at Fraser, yet the referee decided it was only a yellow-card offence.</p> <p>Watford were 2-0 up but a couple of goals in the blink of an eye, from Nathan Ak\u00e9 and Callum Wilson, brought Bournemouth level. Although Ken Sema then restored Watford\u2019s lead with his first goal since arriving from \u00d6stersund in the summer, Bournemouth quickly equalised again through the excellent Fraser.

Asked whether he thought Doucour\u00e9 was fortunate to stay on the pitch, he replied: \u201cYes, I do. I think it was a straight red card. I think Ryan is very fortunate not to have picked up a serious injury. It was a very dangerous tackle. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to see those type of tackles in any league.\u201d</p> <p>As for Deeney\u2019s remarks about Gosling, in particular the accusation that the Bournemouth midfielder had tried to deliberately hurt Cleverley, Howe said: \u201cI know Dan inside and out and he\u2019s not that type of player. He\u2019s an honest guy. Yes, he\u2019s mistimed the tackle. But in terms of those words, that\u2019s not in Dan\u2019s makeup.\u201d</p> <p>Gosling had an eventful match. It was his wayward pass that led to Deeney doubling Watford\u2019s lead, after the striker had emphatically headed in Sema\u2019s fine cross to open the scoring in the 14th minute. Gosling then saw his header brilliantly saved by Foster before Ak\u00e9 headed in the rebound to reduce the deficit. Fraser delivered the free-kick that led to that goal and also provided the dead-ball delivery from which Wilson equalised with a towering header.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bournemouth\u2019s celebrations were quickly cut short as Sema thrashed home a low left-foot shot from 22 yards that beat Asmir Begovic at his near post.

Deeney, who also scored twice and was a handful throughout, is likely to land himself in trouble with those controversial comments, which will go down badly with Bournemouth and also the FA. The striker did also admit that Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, his Watford teammate, was lucky not to be dismissed for an awful challenge on Ryan Fraser in the first half. Doucour\u00e9\u2019s studs were high as he recklessly lunged at Fraser, yet the referee decided it was only a yellow-card offence. Watford were 2-0 up but a couple of goals in the blink of an eye, from Nathan Ak\u00e9 and Callum Wilson, brought Bournemouth level. Although Ken Sema then restored Watford\u2019s lead with his first goal since arriving from \u00d6stersund in the summer, Bournemouth quickly equalised again through the excellent Fraser. It was breathless stuff and perhaps not surprising that the second half turned into something of an anticlimax when it came to the goal count. There was no shortage of incident, though, as Ben Foster produced several superb saves, Watford appealed in vain for a late penalty after the ball struck Ak\u00e9 on the hand, and Gosling made that full-blooded challenge on Cleverley that led to him being booked and provoked such an angry response from Deeney. \u201cIt was an interesting game to be involved in,\u201d Deeney said. \u201cThe defending from both teams was Sunday league at best, to be honest. It was an end-to-end game. It could have been 6-6. As entertainers we\u2019re happy but not as professionals. The only people that are happy are the fans. Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 probably did get lucky [to not be sent off]. But you can\u2019t tell me that their boy did not try to do Tom Cleverley. They know it. We know. But the referee bottled it on a few occasions.\u201d Eddie Howe, the Bournemouth manager, had a rather different take. Asked whether he thought Doucour\u00e9 was fortunate to stay on the pitch, he replied: \u201cYes, I do. I think it was a straight red card. I think Ryan is very fortunate not to have picked up a serious injury. It was a very dangerous tackle. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to see those type of tackles in any league.\u201d As for Deeney\u2019s remarks about Gosling, in particular the accusation that the Bournemouth midfielder had tried to deliberately hurt Cleverley, Howe said: \u201cI know Dan inside and out and he\u2019s not that type of player. He\u2019s an honest guy. Yes, he\u2019s mistimed the tackle. But in terms of those words, that\u2019s not in Dan\u2019s makeup.\u201d Gosling had an eventful match. It was his wayward pass that led to Deeney doubling Watford\u2019s lead, after the striker had emphatically headed in Sema\u2019s fine cross to open the scoring in the 14th minute. Gosling then saw his header brilliantly saved by Foster before Ak\u00e9 headed in the rebound to reduce the deficit. Fraser delivered the free-kick that led to that goal and also provided the dead-ball delivery from which Wilson equalised with a towering header. Bournemouth\u2019s celebrations were quickly cut short as Sema thrashed home a low left-foot shot from 22 yards that beat Asmir Begovic at his near post. Bournemouth, in keeping with the helter-skelter nature of the game, went straight back up the other end and drew level. Junior Stanislas, who impressed as a makeshift right-back, delivered a low centre that Fraser, who was totally unmarked, coolly dispatched. Howe, like everyone else, was still trying to make sense of it all afterwards. \u201cI\u2019ve got mixed emotions,\u201d he said.",

Things certainly appeared to have changed since the last time Solskj\u00e6r patrolled the away technical area here in the spring of 2014; back then Alan Pardew\u2019s Newcastle won 3-0, confirming Cardiff\u2019s relegation from the Premier League. Not that the Norwegian could afford to relax as he surveyed a backline which could easily have conceded an early goal when Phil Jones\u2019s ill-advised back pass played Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n onside and the hitherto noisy travelling fans congregated high in the Leazes End temporarily fell silent. Ultimately, Jones recovered to rescue the situation but Ben\u00edtez had a glimmer of optimism.

That mattered, particularly as, at the other end, Lascelles\u2019s style had also been cramped, albeit for a different reason, namely the yellow card he received for a wince-inducing challenge on Ander Herrera.

      "bodyText": "Burnley took advantage of West Yorkshire generosity to claim a second successive victory after the home side proved incapable of protecting a first-half lead for more than seven minutes even before the dismissal of their most reliable defender. Huddersfield have found this season hard enough going with 11 men on the pitch, so having to play the whole of the second half without Christopher Schindler was always going to be testing, and Ashley Barnes was able to make Burnley\u2019s extra man count before the end. Both teams were down to 10 men by the final whistle, however, Robbie Brady having seen red for a reckless attempt to halt Isaac Mbenza\u2019s breakaway as the game moved into stoppage time, but there was no time left for Huddersfield and the same might soon be true of their stay in the Premier League. As ever, David Wagner could not fault his players\u2019 attitude, though the reality to be faced is that the Terriers have lose eight league games in a row and last won in November. \u201cOur luck can change, we\u2019ve had a lot of narrow defeats,\u201d the Huddersfield manager said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to think about luck any more, it costs me too much energy.\u201d Sean Dyche accepted the sending off changed the game but said it was still a test of patience to find a way through. \u201cWe were always probing, always asking questions, and eventually we got our reward.\u201d Huddersfield have not been scoring enough goals to be anything other than bottom of the table, though Wagner feels that the football his side have been producing deserves a better points reward, if only his forwards could be more clinical in front of goal. A good example of what he meant arrived early in this game, when an intricate passing move eventually found Elias Kachunga in space on the right, only to produce a cross that obliged Steve Mouni\u00e9 to attempt an overhead kick that flew harmlessly over the bar. With both Chris Wood and Barnes up front Burnley always looked capable of hitting their opponents on the break, though the closest they came to a first-half lead was from a set piece, Jonas L\u00f6ssl getting down low to keep out Ben Mee\u2019s header from an Ashley Westwood free kick. That seemed to act as a wake-up call for the home side, who redoubled their attacking efforts almost immediately. Phil Bardsley had to intervene to prevent Kachunga\u2019s firm header reaching its target, and when the resulting corner was not fully cleared Mbenza\u2019s cross from the left found Mouni\u00e9 at the far post. The striker has not exactly been rampant this season, this was his first goal of the campaign, but his header managed to beat Tom Heaton. No sooner had Huddersfield gone in front than their evening began to fall apart. Luck had a role in the ball reaching Dwight McNeil when the teenager set up Burnley\u2019s equaliser, but he still bamboozled Florent Hadergjonaj before sliding the ball across for Wood to score from six yards. Two minutes after being pegged back the Terriers found themselves short-handed when Schindler picked up a second yellow for a sprawling tackle on McNeil. Neither of the offences was heinous, the first had been for a similarly clumsy foul on Wood, but a centre half on a caution has to be careful. Wagner\u2019s reaction was to substitute an unhappy looking Alex Pritchard, immediately robbing them of one of their brighter attacking performers. Huddersfield still found it difficult to contain McNeil in the second half, which made it all the harder to understand why Dyche replaced him just after the hour. A fit-again Brady was a more than capable substitute, but McNeil had been passing Hadergjonaj for fun on the left, as well as launching Charlie Taylor on the overlap. Burnley almost profited when the home side sent too many men forward and Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Ashley Westwood broke from halfway, only for the former to shoot straight at L\u00f6ssl.

      "bodyText": "Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate and incoming US senator for Utah, has sharply criticised Donald Trump both personally and professionally, accusing him of deserting the nation\u2019s allies and lacking the character to lead a \u201cdivided\u201d nation. Romney said on Wednesday afternoon that it was Trump\u2019s abrupt announcement last month that he intended to pull US troops out of Syria immediately that prompted the incoming senator to write an opinion article criticizing the president. In a Washington Post essay published on Tuesday evening, Romney said Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cmade a deep descent\u201d in December and blamed him for the departures of the defence secretary, Jim Mattis, and White House chief of staff, John Kelly. \u201cThe appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president\u2019s thoughtless claim that America has long been a \u2018sucker\u2019 in world affairs all defined his presidency down,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d Trump responded to Romney\u2019s criticism on Wednesday morning on Twitter, calling on him to be a team player. Romney then said in a TV interview with CNN on Wednesday afternoon that he was prepared to work with any president \u2013 but was willing to speak out when he did not agree with them. \u201cIt\u2019s important, as I begin this new job, to make it very clear where I stand. And I also note that the departure of Secretary [James] Mattis and the decision to pull out of Syria and the abrupt way it was done was a precipitating event for my finally going on this record,\u201d he said. Romney praised Trump\u2019s tax policies, stance on China and appointment of conservative judges but said they were \u201cmainstream\u201d Republican policies. Since Trump\u2019s rise, Romney has been one in a long list of traditionalist Republicans who have publicly bristled at Trump\u2019s decorum and leadership style, while generally supporting his policy goals. \u201cTo a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA president should unite us and inspire us to follow \u2018our better angels\u2019. A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect. As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit. \u201cWith the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent\u2019s shortfall has been most glaring.\u201d He added that \u201cTrump\u2019s words and actions have caused dismay around the world\u201d and cited Pew reports suggesting belief among people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden that the US president would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d had fallen from 84% in 2016, when Barack Obama was president, to 16% a year later under Trump. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted late on Tuesday to say that Romney \u201clacked the ability to save this nation\u201d, adding: \u201cJealousy is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it.\u201d Romney is staking out an independent position two days before he takes office in the GOP-controlled Senate on Thursday. It is unclear whether Trump will face a serious challenge in 2020 to securing the Republican party\u2019s presidential nomination. It would be the first time since 1992 that an incumbent had faced such a challenge. Trump remains extraordinarily popular with Republican voters, boasting an approval rating that hovered near the low 90s through the end of the year. But, as the Mueller investigation winds on into its third calendar year, Trump also faces increased scrutiny, with an incoming Democratic House preparing to launch a number of additional inquiries into Trump\u2019s conduct and presidency. Romney, who has run for president twice, has long been viewed as a potential challenger to Trump\u2019s 2020 ambitions, and the two men have had a complicated political relationship. Trump endorsed Romney\u2019s run for a Senate seat in Utah in February last year, as well as Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a \u201cfraud\u201d who was \u201cplaying the American public for suckers\u201d. Trump responded that Romney had \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign against Barack Obama. Despite Romney\u2019s prior criticism, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, Trump briefly considered tapping Romney as secretary of state. In his essay on Tuesday, Romney said he \u201cwill speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions\u201d. Reuters contributed to this report \u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2019. The findings of the Pew reports cited by Mitt Romney related to confidence in who was US president at the time of the research to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d, rather than specifically confidence in Donald Trump as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "Fifteen games into his career with Crystal Palace, and 83 minutes into a match that seemed certain to end in deadlock, Jordan Ayew scored a goal. He took it nicely too, collecting a wayward shot by Patrick van Aanholt before slotting the ball into the net from six yards. Luka Milivojevic then confirmed a precious away win for Roy Hodgson\u2019s side by converting a penalty in stoppage time after Ryan Bennett upended Wilfried Zaha. Ayew\u2019s goal, his first since joining Palace on loan from Swansea in the summer, was particularly timely on a day when the club\u2019s attempt to sign the Liverpool reserve striker Dominic Solanke broke down. \u201cWe were interested but it turns out there are complications,\u201d said Hodgson, who refused to comment on reports that Palace became unsure about the player\u2019s fitness, adding: \u201cI do feel a little disappointed for the player because at one stage he had made up his mind in our favour but it didn\u2019t work out. There are other elements that are beyond a coach\u2019s control.\u201d Palace\u2019s two goals here brought the tally for the season to 19 from 21 Premier League matches and Hodgson suggested the club may yet sign someone else to help bolster their options. Any transfer may be partly funded by the departure of Jason Puncheon, with Hodgson saying the club are in talks over a potential departure of the midfielder to Huddersfield. Wolves, too, are keen to sharpen their attack and are interested in Tammy Abraham, the Chelsea forward who has scored regularly while on loan this season at Aston Villa. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo would not say anything about that beyond indicating that Wolves are on the prowl this month for players who could enhance them \u201cbut the core of the squad will stay the same\u201d. On the pitch, meanwhile, Nuno did not get what he wanted. Immediately after beating Tottenham at Wembley on Saturday, the manager made a new year\u2019s resolution that he demanded his team honour: improve the home form. Instead, Wolves broke it at the first chance. They have now lost five of their last seven matches at Molineux. For a long time here it looked like the only losers would be the 30,666 spectators who turned up to watch two weary-looking sides grapple weakly with each other.

Enter J\u00fcrgen\u2019s festive miracle, a period of four weeks, six matches (plus six minutes of added time at Anfield) during which Liverpool have gone from four points behind City to seven points clear at the top.</p> \n<p>It is a remarkable surge of cold, hard sporting will, eight wins in a row in all competitions, with 23 goals scored and three conceded. In its shadow City have stuttered and stumbled. To such a degree that ahead of Thursday night\u2019s brilliantly-timed meeting between the two it is the blue half of this table-topping syzygy that seems arguably the more fascinating right now.</p> \n<p>When City travelled to Anfield in October the match was billed by Sky Sports\u2019 endlessly salivating marketing arm as \u201cChampions versus Challengers\u201d. Such is Liverpool\u2019s momentum it is City who must now chase and apply pressure, Guardiola who must try to do something different, and indeed unprecedented, in his own coaching career.</p> \n<p>Winning ugly, taking a title with a stumble along the way: this is something no Pep team have done before. \u201cWe are so close!\u201d Guardiola can be heard yelling at his players during the in-house hagiography of the title-winning season. But it was never really close. City simply ran away from the field, playing with such frictionless brilliance that as recently as this November there was already talk of a kind of ultimacy, of the greatest team of the past 25 years, the last century, perhaps the century to come.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d0dd7b8d-2149-4f60-89bf-ad51af6380cf\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nSTYwQHJjK4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead of which Guardiola\u2019s team must now come from behind. At Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City Guardiola, has won seven league titles in nine seasons, but his champion teams have all run from the front, bending the race to their own will from the gun. The closest to a messy league title win is probably the second one at Barcelona, which went to the final day of the season. But even then Bar\u00e7a just kept on running ahead of the tide, never stumbling, racking up 99 points in the process.</p> \n<p>In those two seasons without a title both Pep-built teams \u2013 Barcelona in his last season, City in his first \u2013 have malfunctioned long before the season\u2019s end, both times accompanied by an element of flounce, of conceding the scrap with high-minded grace. Victory is yet to come on more pragmatic terms. This would be an excellent time to start, and not just for the sake of the Premier League season.</p> \n<p>It is always tempting to look for flaws in a team that has presented itself as close to sporting perfection. The chief snark directed at this City team is that it excels above all in putting away the mid-rankers. Victory on Thursday night might wrench the initiative back from Liverpool. But it would also be the first time City have beaten a team ahead of them in the league since Arsenal in December 2016.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b5bffde51c41fdf58c23be8c70e1cc31789853a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b5bffde51c41fdf58c23be8c70e1cc31789853a/0_153_5388_3233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardiola and his players after their defeat at Chelsea, who exploited the space behind the City full-backs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardiola and his players after their defeat at Chelsea, who exploited the space behind the City full-backs.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The strongest opponents City faced in 2018 were Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Lyon.

But City also haven\u2019t come from behind to win a league game since West Ham at home last season.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year. Or rather, it is if you take your lead from a chortling, bearded man who has spent most of the last month dispensing his own kind of giddy, red-suited festive cheer. At the start of December J\u00fcrgen Klopp could be seen haring across the Anfield pitch, skipping and leaping and making a strange yanking gesture with his arms, like a man repeatedly puncturing an inflatable lilo with a breadknife while being pursued by a swarm of angry jack russells. Liverpool\u2019s stoppage-time Merseyside derby winner had just prevented Klopp\u2019s team from slipping four points behind Manchester City, in the process prolonging the slow-burn heat of another moribund title race. Except not this time. Enter J\u00fcrgen\u2019s festive miracle, a period of four weeks, six matches (plus six minutes of added time at Anfield) during which Liverpool have gone from four points behind City to seven points clear at the top. It is a remarkable surge of cold, hard sporting will, eight wins in a row in all competitions, with 23 goals scored and three conceded. In its shadow City have stuttered and stumbled. To such a degree that ahead of Thursday night\u2019s brilliantly-timed meeting between the two it is the blue half of this table-topping syzygy that seems arguably the more fascinating right now. When City travelled to Anfield in October the match was billed by Sky Sports\u2019 endlessly salivating marketing arm as \u201cChampions versus Challengers\u201d. Such is Liverpool\u2019s momentum it is City who must now chase and apply pressure, Guardiola who must try to do something different, and indeed unprecedented, in his own coaching career. Winning ugly, taking a title with a stumble along the way: this is something no Pep team have done before. \u201cWe are so close!\u201d Guardiola can be heard yelling at his players during the in-house hagiography of the title-winning season. But it was never really close. City simply ran away from the field, playing with such frictionless brilliance that as recently as this November there was already talk of a kind of ultimacy, of the greatest team of the past 25 years, the last century, perhaps the century to come. Instead of which Guardiola\u2019s team must now come from behind. At Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City Guardiola, has won seven league titles in nine seasons, but his champion teams have all run from the front, bending the race to their own will from the gun. The closest to a messy league title win is probably the second one at Barcelona, which went to the final day of the season. But even then Bar\u00e7a just kept on running ahead of the tide, never stumbling, racking up 99 points in the process. In those two seasons without a title both Pep-built teams \u2013 Barcelona in his last season, City in his first \u2013 have malfunctioned long before the season\u2019s end, both times accompanied by an element of flounce, of conceding the scrap with high-minded grace. Victory is yet to come on more pragmatic terms. This would be an excellent time to start, and not just for the sake of the Premier League season. It is always tempting to look for flaws in a team that has presented itself as close to sporting perfection. The chief snark directed at this City team is that it excels above all in putting away the mid-rankers. Victory on Thursday night might wrench the initiative back from Liverpool. But it would also be the first time City have beaten a team ahead of them in the league since Arsenal in December 2016. The strongest opponents City faced in 2018 were Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Lyon. Against these teams their record reads played 12, won four, lost six. This is, of course, unsurprising. The stronger teams are, believe it or not, a little harder to beat. But there is also a tactical and textural dimension to this. City\u2019s system is built without compromise, is above all optimistic, geared always towards producing the perfect game, colouring the entire world sky blue for 90 minutes. Often this involves scoring early and simply streaking away from there, a microcosm of those title-winning seasons. Which is fine when it works, as it does most times. But City also haven\u2019t come from behind to win a league game since West Ham at home last season. More recently against Crystal Palace and Chelsea going behind has seemed to spook the whole system, not least because successive opponents have pressed at the same weakness. Chelsea at the start of December showed how to surge in behind City\u2019s full-backs when they press high and fail to track back urgently enough, or miss the right kind of cover from midfield. Several times at Stamford Bridge, a long flat diagonal pass out of defence found wide open green spaces behind the blue shirts. Palace did the same down the right a fortnight later. Last week Jamie Vardy and Marc Albrighton went scampering in down the left at the King Power Stadium. It is Guardiola\u2019s love of overloads, of fearlessly stretching the pitch, that Lyon first managed to exploit in the Champions League, something better opponents than Schalke will also pick away at in the late stages of that competition. Andr\u00e9s Iniesta pointed out this week that City really should come close to winning the Champions League given the investment made and the calibre of coach in charge. To do so, and indeed to make a mark on Klopp\u2019s December surge, might require something different to what we\u2019ve seen, the willingness to adapt and protect a weakness, to clench a scented handkerchief to the nose and deign to win ugly now and then. At the Etihad, City will face a Liverpool team with more varied ways of playing, greater physical strength, and an attack perfectly equipped to prey on that brittleness on the flanks.

      "bodyText": "Nasa\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft has beamed home its first close-up images of Ultima Thule, a lump of rock the shape of an unfinished snowman that lies 4 billion miles away on the edge of the solar system. Taken as the probe sped past the body in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day, the pictures reveal a dark reddish object about 21 miles long and 10 miles wide that spins on its axis once every 15 hours or so. The colour image of Ultima Thule, revealing its reddish tint, was taken at 05.01 GMT on New Year\u2019s Day from a distance of about 18,000 miles, 30 minutes before the probe made its closest pass of the space rock. The spacecraft snapped thousands of images of the object, known formally as 2014 MU69, in a fleeting encounter that set a record for the most distant flyby in history. From a billion miles beyond Pluto, it takes data sent at the speed of light about six hours to reach Earth. \u201cMeet Ultima Thule,\u201d said Alan Stern, the mission\u2019s principal investigator, as he unveiled the images at a press conference on Wednesday. The scientists originally described the object as shaped like a bowling pin, but Stern said he had changed his mind on seeing the new picture. \u201cThat bowling pin is gone. It\u2019s a snowman if anything at all,\u201d he said. The odd shape of Ultima Thule is thought to have come about when swirling ice and dust particles coalesced in the early life of the solar system and eventually led to two large lumps of rock colliding and sticking together. Stern said that the gravity of each \u201clobe\u201d was enough to keep the two parts of Ultima Thule in contact. Preliminary analysis of the images showed that the neck that joins the two lobes of Ultima Thule is brighter than the rest of the mottled surface, probably because loose grains had collected there, said Cathy Olkin, a scientist on the mission. The dark red hue of much of the surface is thought to be due to the effects of space radiation on exotic ices on the surface. The New Horizons spacecraft launched in 2006 on a mission to explore Pluto. When it shot past the dwarf planet in 2015, it captured breathtaking shots of the distant world, one now known to host mountains of solid nitrogen and volcanoes that blast ice into space. Like Pluto, Ultima Thule lies in a region of the solar system called the Kuiper belt, a doughnut-shaped ring of dwarf planets, boulders and other debris left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. The Nasa probe came within 2,200 miles of Ultima Thule, meaning \u201cbeyond the known world\u201d, as it hurtled past at 31,500mph. Mission scientists at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland had to wait 10 hours for New Horizons to confirm that the flyby at 05.33 GMT on Tuesday had proceeded smoothly and that the spacecraft was still operational. At such terrific speed, a collision with a particle as small as a grain of rice could have spelt disaster for the probe.

The lawmakers and advocates, who have convened a detention review panel, intend to produce a detailed document on their findings, following claims that the activists, some of whom were instrumental in securing women the right to drive in Saudi Arabia, have been maltreated in Dhahban prison and denied access to lawyers or relatives. The all-party panel includes the Conservative former chair of the foreign affairs select committee Crispin Blunt, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, and Paul Williams, a Labour member of the health and social care select committee. All eight women have been subjected to abuse, including threats of rape, electric shocks and beatings, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Speaking before the panel formally handed its request for visiting rights to Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi ambassador to the UK, Blunt said: \u201cThere are credible concerns that the conditions in which the Saudi women activists are being detained may have fallen significantly short of both international and Saudi Arabia\u2019s own standards. \u201cWe make this request to the Saudi authorities so that we can assess for ourselves the conditions in which the Saudi women activists have been and are being detained today. \u201cNo person should be subjected to the type of treatment that has allegedly been inflicted upon these women activists while in detention.

The panic that once held us in acute fear has thankfully dissipated. Infection rates are reducing and we hear proclamations that \u201cAids is over\u201d in this country \u2013 but thousands of us are still living with HIV, its complications, stigma and prejudice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/18/groundbreaking-australian-hiv-trial-should-be-replicated-researchers-say\">Groundbreaking Australian HIV trial should be replicated, researchers say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>HIV/Aids has impacted my life more than anything, and it continues to challenge me each day. I\u2019ve lived with the virus for most of my adult life. As a teenager coming to terms with my sexuality, I faced violent homophobia. The attacks came from teachers and students, and from within my own family. I was beaten, bashed and bullied out of high school. I had chronic anxiety and contemplated suicide countless times. Queensland in the 1980s was a hostile place for LGBTIQ people. It was the era of Joh-Bjelke-Petersen and the grim reaper. The media was saturated with reports that demonised the gay community, and the thought of contracting HIV and dying of Aids terrified me.</p> <p>I felt like I had no place in Queensland, so I fled to Sydney when I was 20 and got swept up in the drug scene. I was rebellious and having a wild time but I was also numbing the self-hatred about my sexuality. I took a lot of risks and put myself in danger. On some level I was punishing myself. I contracted HIV because I couldn\u2019t accept my sexuality. Under the influence of so much drugs and alcohol, it was a crash waiting to happen.</p> <p>Thankfully I eventually turned what felt like a death sentence into something constructive. I stopped using drugs and started to face myself \u2013 I accepted who I was. In many ways my life was just beginning. I became a healthy, conscious person with hopes and dreams. I studied social science and creative writing at university. I travelled to India, Europe, the US and South America. The virus was transforming me and my life for the better.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Few conditions have the same consequences for a person in terms of their self-esteem and relationships</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t want to gloss over the reality of living with HIV. There\u2019s been plenty of physical and emotional struggles. My sanity has been pushed to the limit by humiliating bouts of illness and hideous experiments with toxic medication. At one stage that meant swallowing 26 pills a day and throwing my guts up on city streets.

      "bodyText": "I was diagnosed HIV positive nearly 20 years ago, and living with the virus has changed a great deal. It\u2019s not a death sentence and we\u2019re living much longer. The panic that once held us in acute fear has thankfully dissipated. Infection rates are reducing and we hear proclamations that \u201cAids is over\u201d in this country \u2013 but thousands of us are still living with HIV, its complications, stigma and prejudice. HIV/Aids has impacted my life more than anything, and it continues to challenge me each day. I\u2019ve lived with the virus for most of my adult life. As a teenager coming to terms with my sexuality, I faced violent homophobia. The attacks came from teachers and students, and from within my own family. I was beaten, bashed and bullied out of high school. I had chronic anxiety and contemplated suicide countless times. Queensland in the 1980s was a hostile place for LGBTIQ people. It was the era of Joh-Bjelke-Petersen and the grim reaper. The media was saturated with reports that demonised the gay community, and the thought of contracting HIV and dying of Aids terrified me. I felt like I had no place in Queensland, so I fled to Sydney when I was 20 and got swept up in the drug scene. I was rebellious and having a wild time but I was also numbing the self-hatred about my sexuality. I took a lot of risks and put myself in danger. On some level I was punishing myself. I contracted HIV because I couldn\u2019t accept my sexuality. Under the influence of so much drugs and alcohol, it was a crash waiting to happen. Thankfully I eventually turned what felt like a death sentence into something constructive. I stopped using drugs and started to face myself \u2013 I accepted who I was. In many ways my life was just beginning. I became a healthy, conscious person with hopes and dreams. I studied social science and creative writing at university. I travelled to India, Europe, the US and South America. The virus was transforming me and my life for the better. I don\u2019t want to gloss over the reality of living with HIV. There\u2019s been plenty of physical and emotional struggles. My sanity has been pushed to the limit by humiliating bouts of illness and hideous experiments with toxic medication. At one stage that meant swallowing 26 pills a day and throwing my guts up on city streets. I\u2019ve had two lengthy stints in hospital with Aids, and I\u2019ve been socially isolated for long periods due to poverty, illness and a sheer lack of self-worth that can afflict many HIV positive people.

      "body": "<p>On a whisper-still January dawn, the most terrifying day of Allan Oppert\u2019s life began unremarkably and with a feeling of deep calm.</p> \n<p>Like most Sundays, he woke to a knock on the door from his friends Dan and Dave. At Allan\u2019s neat house in the small seaside town of Binningup, in the south-west corner of Western Australia, the three men drank strong coffee before towing Allan\u2019s boat to a nearby ramp where three friends were launching another vessel. The two groups were heading out on the ocean together, a familiar arrangement aimed at ensuring safety.</p> \n<p> Oppert turned the key on his boat\u2019s engine as the western horizon illuminated a glassy sea, a low swell barely bothering the shore. At the height of an Australian summer, mornings on the ocean offered early respite from the baking heat and unrelenting wind of the afternoon. The two boats were heading to a dive site that the men visited most weekends of the year, conditions allowing. A 15-minute boat ride from shore, the site featured a roughly cylindrical cavity about 6m wide and 3m deep on the ocean floor. In 33m of water, the \u201ccrater\u201d bristled with crayfish, a delicious but formidable-looking crustacean prized for its sweet, delicate flesh. After several hours and two separate dives into the heart of the crater, a single tank of air remained between the six men.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41b0d64b15d63919d06066ac701d474348a47da6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41b0d64b15d63919d06066ac701d474348a47da6/0_0_1742_1161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great white shark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A great white shark.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Smith</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I said to Dan, \u2018You go,\u2019 and he said, \u2018No, you go.\u2019</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>After entering the water for his third dive of the day, this time alone, Oppert, a 42-year-old prison officer, began his descent. The process, as always, involved the release of air from inside his buoyancy vest to enable heavy weights strapped to his hips to drag him from the surface to the ocean floor. But this time he didn\u2019t quite make it. The torpedo-shaped bulk of a huge great white shark inside the crater below loomed into view and, in the nanosecond that followed, Oppert registered both the animal\u2019s curious demeanour \u2013 \u201clike a dog on a scent\u201d \u2013 and a firm belief that his life would not end there.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>[The shark is] going over to one spot and having a look and going over to another and having a sniff. These sharks are like dogs, in their gestures and in their behaviour. They hunch up their backs when they are annoyed, and she was annoyed. All of a sudden, she\u2019s spun around. I got about halfway to the bottom. [I thought,] \u2018She\u2019s going to attack from the back or she\u2019s going to attack from the side.\u2019 The funny thing is that I didn\u2019t think about dying.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>An uncannily cool head gave Oppert the presence of mind to reinflate his buoyancy vest, preventing further descent. (Days later, while examining his equipment, he noted the depth gauge registered just 17 metres.)</p> \n<p>Considering that great white sharks have been clocked swimming 13 metres a second, it is no surprise that the impact of the strike instantly pulled Oppert\u2019s face mask down around his neck.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It happened in a split second. The mouth\u2019s opened up and she\u2019s hit me in the guts with her nose. I thought: \u2018Oh, here we go.\u2019</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But he kept his regulator \u2013 the mouthpiece that delivers air \u2013 firmly between his teeth. Throughout the dog-like shaking of his body that followed, he managed to pull the mask back over his face and purge it of water, returning terrifying visibility \u2013 an intimate view into the gelatinous gill slits of the world\u2019s biggest predatory fish.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I thought to myself, \u2018Whew!

The pressure was so great that I thought if it gets any tighter, they\u2019ll snap \u2013 she\u2019ll snap both my legs off.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Oppert\u2019s steel speargun, which that morning had shot some large fish, was at the moment of the attack positioned across his thigh. It would be fair to surmise that the very implement that probably attracted the shark in the first place \u2013 by prompting fish distress signals that can travel far across the ocean \u2013 also helped to preserve his life by preventing the shark\u2019s teeth from gaining full purchase above his knee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b80a494041bfa43c0f0a7874e20ef45d2a2780e0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b80a494041bfa43c0f0a7874e20ef45d2a2780e0/0_0_4458_2349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset at Binningup beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"527\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunset at Binningup beach.<br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mik Rowlands/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When the shark released its grip, the inflated buoyancy vest sent Oppert shooting to the surface, where he raised the alarm and was pulled to safety. </p> \n<p>Like many others in Western Australia at the time, Oppert was well aware of a fatal shark attack that had occurred four years earlier on a suburban beach about 150km up the coast. A middle-aged man had been mauled in shallow water in front of dozens of onlookers. But in the years that followed the death of Ken Crew in 2000 \u2013 the first such attack in living memory \u2013 many West Australians held the view it had been a one-off event, a freakish aberration caused by a \u201crogue\u201d shark that had \u201cmistaken\u201d the swimmer for a seal. With no subsequent fatality to spook him and no inkling that an attack would kill a surfer further down the coast just six months later, Oppert had descended without a care in the world. It was a decision that nearly cost him his life and has left him 14 years later with the still visible scars from the multiple puncture marks of a shark\u2019s teeth on his legs.</p> \n<h2>\u2018This damn big shark\u2019</h2> \n<p>Ken Crew\u2019s death in the state capital of Perth changed the city\u2019s notion of itself as a beach-lover\u2019s paradise. It marked a moment of horror that still resonates.</p> \n<p>Eighteen years on, first-person accounts of those who swam with Crew and witnessed his death continue to have an effect on me, particularly those of his friend Jerry Ventouras.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I turned around and saw this enormous fin travelling on the inside of Ken. It came in behind him. It was surreal. This damn big shark \u2013 somewhere between five metres and six metres \u2013 head up out of the water, its jaws wide open surging towards Ken. Without even stopping, [it] seemed to grab him across the lower half of his body, lift him out of the water and give him a couple of shakes like a dog would shake at a bone, [and then] dropped him in the middle of the pool in a great cloud of blood. There was no sound.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b56cdd495812b0af5483ca64525048bc0453526d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b56cdd495812b0af5483ca64525048bc0453526d/0_0_3630_2415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pylon off Cottesloe beach in Perth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pylon off Cottesloe beach in Perth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Smudger Scammell/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>West Australians were slow to forget what they learned about great white sharks that day. For most of us, venturing into the open ocean is a matter of idle leisure no more. But the state\u2019s transition from heedless to near-hysterical has been a while in the making.</p> \n<p>Between September 2011 and July 2012, five people were killed by white sharks. Their deaths brought a tangible sense of panic and turned WA into an undisputed white shark hotspot. With each new encounter, swimmers, surfers and divers have become both more jittery and polarised in their views about what should be done.</p> \n<p>The WA government has installed measures to help protect ocean users. A network of 30 satellite-linked shark monitoring receivers, which signal the presence of tagged sharks, is one line of defence, in addition to the introduction of non-lethal \u201csmart\u201d drum lines \u2013 a system in which sharks are baited on a hook, then tagged and released offshore.</p> \n<p>This summer, some of WA\u2019s most popular surf breaks will be linked for the first time to this broader network of receivers, and smart drum lines will be trialled. This follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/18/margaret-river-pro-surfing-event-cancelled-amid-further-shark-attack-fears\">the cancellation in April of the high-profile international surf competition the Margaret River Pro</a>, after two surfers were attacked by great white sharks just hours, and a few kilometres, apart.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8b4c5c9e8f9f365163a438a5a1d3b83ffce222d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8b4c5c9e8f9f365163a438a5a1d3b83ffce222d/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shark attack victim being airlifted to the Royal Perth hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shark attack victim being airlifted to the Royal Perth hospital.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The situation became untenable when<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Brazilian pro surfer and current world champion, Gabriel Medina, told his 6 million Instagram followers he didn\u2019t feel safe competing in Margaret River \u2013 an Australian surfing mecca.</p> \n<p>Despite bolstered aerial surveillance, smart drum lines and the addition of further shark monitoring receivers, confidence is far from buoyant. Most surfers and divers understand that only tagged sharks moving into specific swimming and surfing areas can be pinged. In WA, that\u2019s 450 sharks, of which 290 are white sharks.</p> \n<p>A separate problem is that many south-west surf breaks are located in deep water above dark substrate, making shark-spotting from the air almost impossible. But Surf Life Saving WA\u2019s ramped-up drone monitoring program is finding plenty of sharks, and more surfers and swimmers are staying informed about problem areas via SLSWA\u2019s Twitter feed.</p> \n<p>Survivors of shark attacks and their families often lament the fact that sharks were spotted in the area hours or days beforehand and, had they had known this, they would never have entered the water. </p> \n<h2>\u2018Felt like a brick wall\u2019</h2> \n<p>In contrast to Allan Oppert\u2019s lack of concern about the shark risk, as he descended for his third dive of the day in 2004, Bernie Williams certainly did worry and was relying on his dive buddy\u2019s shark shield (a device worn on the ankle that emits an electromagnetic field to deter sharks) on the 2006 morning he met the protagonist of his worst nightmare.</p> \n<p>The then 46-year-old contracts manager was on his second dive looking for exotic shells and crayfish with his friends Brian and Jenny, in 20m of water 6km off City beach in Perth. About 15 minutes into the dive, he heard an approaching boat. Sensing it had pulled up close to his own unoccupied vessel and that keys and wallets may be the target, he ascended to briefly check on the visitors. Satisfied that they seemed happily preoccupied with a matter on the opposite side of their boat, Williams descended once more. What he didn\u2019t know on that choppy January morning was that the visiting boaters \u2013 who had been fishing nearby when a huge shark appeared beside their vessel \u2013 had come to warn him and his dive buddies about the danger. They had been looking for dive bubbles over the side of their boat when Williams briefly surfaced behind them, then quickly descended again.</p> \n<p> Back on the ocean floor, Williams found that his friends were nowhere to be seen. So he bounced about two metres off the ocean floor to clock their position. Mid-bounce he was struck from behind with an immense force.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I am not very small and for something to take me from zero to 100km an hour in a fraction of a second, bending me double, you think, \u2018God, have I been hit by a submarine?\u2019 It came up from below, behind, and rammed me, just hammered me. When I first got hit I was winded, picked up by the left arm and pushed through the water so the visibility went. I was stunned, didn\u2019t know what was going on. I had a dead weight hanging off my arm. Your peripheral vision in a face mask is nothing [so] when it slowed down a bit I could swing my head around. Then the bells went off. A shark\u2019s eyeball literally filled my face mask. I remember looking down its side when it was swinging me around like a dog with a goanna and I noticed my flippers were about half-way down its length. A big shark. It was just so solid. Felt like a brick wall.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Apparently hampered by the position of the spear gun along Williams\u2019 left side, the animal released its grip and the diver found himself on the ocean floor, where he quickly took refuge in the recess of a reef ledge.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I tucked up against a wall. I remember kneeling on the sand and [the ledge] came up to just over waist height. I was hunched down but there wasn\u2019t enough room for me to get everything in there. I was really puffing hard, breathing like a steam train, beginning to hyperventilate. I remember hearing my heart banging. Banging away, banging away. Thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead. This thing has got my name punched \u2026 it\u2019s not going away.\u2019 I was that close to going to the dark side \u2013 going into a blind panic, close to saying, \u2018You can\u2019t do anything, you might as well just roll over.\u2019</p> \n <p>[But] I was really annoyed with it, that it was going to stop me seeing my family, actually kill me. You think to yourself you [will die] unless you try and work out how you are going to get out of this. I managed to slow [my breathing] down, checked my gear was OK, keeping an eye on the shark. Still had plenty of air. It went away into the gloom. I had a rough idea where I\u2019d seen it disappear. Next thing it came flying across the reef at me. I had my spear gun and I thought I could shoot it but then it\u2019s just going to get annoyed and crazier. I saw it come in and out of the gloom. Then it charged. It ran me down like a car. It was like a dart. The distance would have been 15 to 20 metres and it covered that in a couple of seconds. I had just enough time to lift my spear gun and try to fend it off. It went straight over my head. It would have been one metre above me. The girth of the thing. Like a car going over. Massive. Absolutely massive.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The speed of the shark as it bit down on Williams\u2019 elbow and vigorously shook him created an unusual wound \u2013 saltwater forced into the bite area at high pressure had a gouging effect, but he didn\u2019t become aware of the pain until he realised the shark\u2019s tactics had moved him further away from the reef and out on to the sand. Returning to the cover of the reef ledge, he noticed he was bleeding badly and visibility was diminishing.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Blood was making the water shimmery. At that stage I was feeling woozy, beginning to fade. The shark charged again. It [got to] within a couple of metres and all of a sudden it did a shimmy in the water, turned its tail and took off. The speed of the thing!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Assuming the animal had disappeared and would soon make another run at him, Williams turned in anticipation, to see his two dive friends swimming quickly, elbow to elbow, across the reef. With Jenny signalling that she had just seen a giant shark, it was soon clear that the pair had arrived with Jenny\u2019s shark shield just in time. Bernie believes the abrupt shift in the shark\u2019s behaviour and swimming direction as it homed in for another strike signalled its clear discomfort once inside the orbit of the approaching shield.</p> \n<p>He believes his friends may not have returned to find him for another 10 minutes had they not seen the shark, as both had plenty of air in their tanks. By the time the three pulled themselves to the safety of the boat just a couple of minutes later, Bernie\u2019s own tank was almost empty.</p> \n<h2>How humans react</h2> \n<p>Research has shown that sharks maintain a pattern of \u201ctemporary residency\u201d at favoured sites along with periods of long-distance travel using some \u201ccommon corridors\u201d. They do not permanently stay at any one site but are more likely to be present at favoured places and in common corridors. The fact that they don\u2019t give birth until they reach about 5m in length and 16 years of age, and have an 18-month gestation period, make the sharks \u201cvulnerable to even low levels of exploitation (including incidental bycatch) and are slow to recover\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Oceans-and-coasts/Sharks/White-shark-research-findings\">according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO).</p> \n<p>It is also now clear that Australia has two distinct great white shark populations; an eastern population and a western-southern population. In other words, the 2.6m great white shark that injured a surfer at Ballina, on Australia\u2019s east coast, in November 2018 probably belonged to a different \u2013 and considerably smaller \u2013 population than the animal (or animals) that attacked surfers in April in Margaret River.</p> \n<p>Back in 2007 one of the world\u2019s foremost white shark experts, Dr Barry Bruce, told me that anyone who thought they knew how many white sharks were cruising Australian waters was \u201cspeaking through their backside\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"358d5736ef3a993428ec82bfc9a20cefb4d0e7a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/358d5736ef3a993428ec82bfc9a20cefb4d0e7a3/0_0_2100_3400/618.jpg\" alt=\"A surfer in the water despite shark warning signs posted on the beach in the NSW city of Newcastle\" width=\"618\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A surfer in the water despite shark warning signs posted on the beach in the NSW city of Newcastle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In February Bruce <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20593-w\">co-published an article in the journal Scientific Reports</a> about a groundbreaking CSIRO study that used world-first genetic analysis to estimate that there are between about 760 and 2,250 adult white sharks (best estimate 1,460 sharks) in the southern-western population off South Australia and WA, and between about 470 and 1,030 adult white sharks off eastern Australia (best estimate 750 sharks).</p> \n<p>The total white shark population off eastern Australia was estimated to be between 2,909 and 12,802 sharks (best estimate 5,460 sharks). Due to a lack of genetic data for juveniles, the total number of the southern-western population could not be directly estimated using these techniques.</p> \n<p>There are double the number of adult white sharks in the WA-South Australia population and fewer surfers, swimmers and divers (4.1 million people) compared with the east coast (18.8 million). And yet, since 2000, the western population has been responsible for 21 fatalities compared with the east coast\u2019s five.</p> \n<p>Shark nets have been used for decades on the east coast of Australia, with mixed success. But the problem of unintended bycatch, including dolphins and turtles, puts them out of favour in WA. Certainly, there is no silver bullet.</p> \n<p>A newly appointed independent scientific advisory panel on sharks will provide advice to the WA government on the effectiveness of its new shark mitigation technologies and scientific research into white shark populations, movements and behaviours.</p> \n<p>The lead author of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/queensland-shark-numbers-down-by-90-per-cent-in-55-years-for-some-species\">University of Queensland study</a> a that shows 90% decline in Queensland shark numbers says more advanced approaches to safeguarding ocean users are needed. Dr George Roff says drum lines, nets and culls are not the answer.</p> \n<p>\u201cNets do not stop sharks from entering beaches, but instead are designed to entangle and trap sharks [and] there is no scientific evidence that I am aware of that shows that culling is an effective approach to reducing shark attacks,\u201d he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07bd00674c17a788e0d9af48d5aba312e58e0530\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07bd00674c17a788e0d9af48d5aba312e58e0530/0_0_4912_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dead great hammerhead shark found caught in a shark net off a beach on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dead great hammerhead shark found caught in a shark net off a beach on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sea Shepherd Australia/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cSmart drum lines are good for understanding where sharks go and if a certain shark tends to return to the same beach, but white sharks often travel hundreds to thousands of kilometres.

With bay after bay of blinding white sand and clear cerulean waters, this part of the world could have been enhanced by a Technicolor enthusiast\u2019s sleight of hand.</p> \n<p>But on the morning of 2 December 2006, a bruise of clouds hung low over Esperance and a bitter south-easterly wind soured surf conditions. Golebiowski was eager for a surf, nonetheless. So he headed out by car with older brother Sam and a teenage friend to a protected cove they knew would be breaking clean and perfect.</p> \n<p>Nestled between two national parks, Wharton beach, on Duke of Orleans Bay, is a favourite with families for its long and easy sandbar breaks close to shore.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It was overcast and gloomy, a \u2018sharky\u2019 morning, but sharks [were] the last thing to think about when you are 15 and going for a surf with your brother and a mate.

Instead, Golebiowski rode each wave into shore, walked the length of the beach and then paddled out for the next ride.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0cdb664202540fe3d99934e3a15313e347078e7b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cdb664202540fe3d99934e3a15313e347078e7b/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Golebiowski\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zac Golebiowski.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dare Parker</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>[After] three or four waves I got one that was a bit of a dud.

A very big strike. It was a full-on horizontal attack in water that was only just head height. When I take my friends to where the attack happened they are always amazed that a shark attack could have happened there.</p> \n <p>The shark bit [off] my leg and the force of the bite took me down, pulled me under. There was no fighting for air. It was too shallow for that. It took me under and let go. I came straight back up and called for help.

It was just ferocious.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And, were it not for the spear gun he was carrying, his life may well have ended there and then, on 30 October 2015. Like Allan Oppert and Bernie Williams, Norman Galli believes that the steel implement saved his life. In the first moment of the attack, the gun was rammed hard up against his ribcage. He believes its barrel became stuck in the back of the shark\u2019s jaw.</p> \n<p>The town of Albany was a whaling port until 1978, when ships carrying harpooned whales would attract hungry white sharks in their wake. There have been several shark attacks in the area in recent years, including the fatal mauling of the 17-year-old spear fisher and free diver Jay Muscat nine months before Norman Galli\u2019s close call, and in the same stretch of water.</p> \n<p> Free divers descend for minutes at a time on a single breath of air \u2013 held for long enough to locate and harpoon a fish, and return to the surface, which is where Galli was floating at the time of the attack.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It shook me violently and I felt the cut of a tooth in my stomach. There was just a lot of white water and foam. When it released me and the commotion stopped I lifted my head out of the water, expecting to see the boat on top of me, but it was in the same position 150 metres or so away. I shouted for Anton. I backed up into a two-metre-deep rock ledge with my back towards Bald Island, feeling very vulnerable without my spear gun, which I could see about 20 metres away. Anton had parked the boat a safe distance from the swell and surge, which was crashing in to the island, and he called me to the boat. The island is surrounded by tall granite cliffs so I couldn\u2019t get out of the water. I had to swim 30 metres or so. I didn\u2019t know what had happened until I climbed on to the boat and blood was dripping from my stomach. When I lifted my arm, there were teethmarks in the wetsuit.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It is difficult to tell whether any of the attacks described here might have been prevented by the mitigation strategies now in place in WA. Even if the shark that attacked Golebiowski in Esperance had been tagged, there were no receivers at the remote beach and, even if there had been, who knows whether an alert would have reached him in time. The same could be said of Galli and Pollard.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8cbc72b7d3e0539324862fe52d2b4c89378ff616\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbc72b7d3e0539324862fe52d2b4c89378ff616/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zac Golebiowski with his boogie board\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zac Golebiowski with his boogie board.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dare Parker</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But for surfers and divers in particular, shark shields are recognised as potent protection. Among the suite of measures designed to keep ocean users safer, the WA government has introduced a rebate for approved shields, the first such initiative in the world. So far, 2,300 regular ocean users have taken up the offer, embedding them in surfboards or wearing them on ankles.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, a number of attacks on Australia\u2019s east coast in recent months will be in the thoughts of many ocean users across the country this summer. But only time will tell whether government measures can take a bite out of WA\u2019s formidable reputation as a global shark-attack hotspot.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Fiona Adolph is writing a book about shark attacks in Western Australian in the past 20 years</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "On a whisper-still January dawn, the most terrifying day of Allan Oppert\u2019s life began unremarkably and with a feeling of deep calm. Like most Sundays, he woke to a knock on the door from his friends Dan and Dave. At Allan\u2019s neat house in the small seaside town of Binningup, in the south-west corner of Western Australia, the three men drank strong coffee before towing Allan\u2019s boat to a nearby ramp where three friends were launching another vessel. The two groups were heading out on the ocean together, a familiar arrangement aimed at ensuring safety. Oppert turned the key on his boat\u2019s engine as the western horizon illuminated a glassy sea, a low swell barely bothering the shore. At the height of an Australian summer, mornings on the ocean offered early respite from the baking heat and unrelenting wind of the afternoon. The two boats were heading to a dive site that the men visited most weekends of the year, conditions allowing. A 15-minute boat ride from shore, the site featured a roughly cylindrical cavity about 6m wide and 3m deep on the ocean floor. In 33m of water, the \u201ccrater\u201d bristled with crayfish, a delicious but formidable-looking crustacean prized for its sweet, delicate flesh. After several hours and two separate dives into the heart of the crater, a single tank of air remained between the six men. I said to Dan, \u2018You go,\u2019 and he said, \u2018No, you go.\u2019 After entering the water for his third dive of the day, this time alone, Oppert, a 42-year-old prison officer, began his descent. The process, as always, involved the release of air from inside his buoyancy vest to enable heavy weights strapped to his hips to drag him from the surface to the ocean floor. But this time he didn\u2019t quite make it. The torpedo-shaped bulk of a huge great white shark inside the crater below loomed into view and, in the nanosecond that followed, Oppert registered both the animal\u2019s curious demeanour \u2013 \u201clike a dog on a scent\u201d \u2013 and a firm belief that his life would not end there. [The shark is] going over to one spot and having a look and going over to another and having a sniff. These sharks are like dogs, in their gestures and in their behaviour. They hunch up their backs when they are annoyed, and she was annoyed. All of a sudden, she\u2019s spun around. I got about halfway to the bottom. [I thought,] \u2018She\u2019s going to attack from the back or she\u2019s going to attack from the side.\u2019 The funny thing is that I didn\u2019t think about dying. An uncannily cool head gave Oppert the presence of mind to reinflate his buoyancy vest, preventing further descent. (Days later, while examining his equipment, he noted the depth gauge registered just 17 metres.) Considering that great white sharks have been clocked swimming 13 metres a second, it is no surprise that the impact of the strike instantly pulled Oppert\u2019s face mask down around his neck. It happened in a split second. The mouth\u2019s opened up and she\u2019s hit me in the guts with her nose. I thought: \u2018Oh, here we go.\u2019 But he kept his regulator \u2013 the mouthpiece that delivers air \u2013 firmly between his teeth. Throughout the dog-like shaking of his body that followed, he managed to pull the mask back over his face and purge it of water, returning terrifying visibility \u2013 an intimate view into the gelatinous gill slits of the world\u2019s biggest predatory fish. I thought to myself, \u2018Whew! It\u2019s big!\u2019 She was clenched down on both legs and the teeth were through to the bone. The pressure was so great that I thought if it gets any tighter, they\u2019ll snap \u2013 she\u2019ll snap both my legs off. Oppert\u2019s steel speargun, which that morning had shot some large fish, was at the moment of the attack positioned across his thigh. It would be fair to surmise that the very implement that probably attracted the shark in the first place \u2013 by prompting fish distress signals that can travel far across the ocean \u2013 also helped to preserve his life by preventing the shark\u2019s teeth from gaining full purchase above his knee. When the shark released its grip, the inflated buoyancy vest sent Oppert shooting to the surface, where he raised the alarm and was pulled to safety. Like many others in Western Australia at the time, Oppert was well aware of a fatal shark attack that had occurred four years earlier on a suburban beach about 150km up the coast. A middle-aged man had been mauled in shallow water in front of dozens of onlookers. But in the years that followed the death of Ken Crew in 2000 \u2013 the first such attack in living memory \u2013 many West Australians held the view it had been a one-off event, a freakish aberration caused by a \u201crogue\u201d shark that had \u201cmistaken\u201d the swimmer for a seal. With no subsequent fatality to spook him and no inkling that an attack would kill a surfer further down the coast just six months later, Oppert had descended without a care in the world. It was a decision that nearly cost him his life and has left him 14 years later with the still visible scars from the multiple puncture marks of a shark\u2019s teeth on his legs. \u2018This damn big shark\u2019 Ken Crew\u2019s death in the state capital of Perth changed the city\u2019s notion of itself as a beach-lover\u2019s paradise. It marked a moment of horror that still resonates. Eighteen years on, first-person accounts of those who swam with Crew and witnessed his death continue to have an effect on me, particularly those of his friend Jerry Ventouras. I turned around and saw this enormous fin travelling on the inside of Ken. It came in behind him. It was surreal. This damn big shark \u2013 somewhere between five metres and six metres \u2013 head up out of the water, its jaws wide open surging towards Ken. Without even stopping, [it] seemed to grab him across the lower half of his body, lift him out of the water and give him a couple of shakes like a dog would shake at a bone, [and then] dropped him in the middle of the pool in a great cloud of blood. There was no sound. West Australians were slow to forget what they learned about great white sharks that day. For most of us, venturing into the open ocean is a matter of idle leisure no more. But the state\u2019s transition from heedless to near-hysterical has been a while in the making. Between September 2011 and July 2012, five people were killed by white sharks. Their deaths brought a tangible sense of panic and turned WA into an undisputed white shark hotspot. With each new encounter, swimmers, surfers and divers have become both more jittery and polarised in their views about what should be done. The WA government has installed measures to help protect ocean users. A network of 30 satellite-linked shark monitoring receivers, which signal the presence of tagged sharks, is one line of defence, in addition to the introduction of non-lethal \u201csmart\u201d drum lines \u2013 a system in which sharks are baited on a hook, then tagged and released offshore. This summer, some of WA\u2019s most popular surf breaks will be linked for the first time to this broader network of receivers, and smart drum lines will be trialled. This follows the cancellation in April of the high-profile international surf competition the Margaret River Pro, after two surfers were attacked by great white sharks just hours, and a few kilometres, apart. The situation became untenable when the Brazilian pro surfer and current world champion, Gabriel Medina, told his 6 million Instagram followers he didn\u2019t feel safe competing in Margaret River \u2013 an Australian surfing mecca. Despite bolstered aerial surveillance, smart drum lines and the addition of further shark monitoring receivers, confidence is far from buoyant. Most surfers and divers understand that only tagged sharks moving into specific swimming and surfing areas can be pinged. In WA, that\u2019s 450 sharks, of which 290 are white sharks. A separate problem is that many south-west surf breaks are located in deep water above dark substrate, making shark-spotting from the air almost impossible. But Surf Life Saving WA\u2019s ramped-up drone monitoring program is finding plenty of sharks, and more surfers and swimmers are staying informed about problem areas via SLSWA\u2019s Twitter feed. Survivors of shark attacks and their families often lament the fact that sharks were spotted in the area hours or days beforehand and, had they had known this, they would never have entered the water. \u2018Felt like a brick wall\u2019 In contrast to Allan Oppert\u2019s lack of concern about the shark risk, as he descended for his third dive of the day in 2004, Bernie Williams certainly did worry and was relying on his dive buddy\u2019s shark shield (a device worn on the ankle that emits an electromagnetic field to deter sharks) on the 2006 morning he met the protagonist of his worst nightmare. The then 46-year-old contracts manager was on his second dive looking for exotic shells and crayfish with his friends Brian and Jenny, in 20m of water 6km off City beach in Perth. About 15 minutes into the dive, he heard an approaching boat. Sensing it had pulled up close to his own unoccupied vessel and that keys and wallets may be the target, he ascended to briefly check on the visitors. Satisfied that they seemed happily preoccupied with a matter on the opposite side of their boat, Williams descended once more. What he didn\u2019t know on that choppy January morning was that the visiting boaters \u2013 who had been fishing nearby when a huge shark appeared beside their vessel \u2013 had come to warn him and his dive buddies about the danger. They had been looking for dive bubbles over the side of their boat when Williams briefly surfaced behind them, then quickly descended again. Back on the ocean floor, Williams found that his friends were nowhere to be seen. So he bounced about two metres off the ocean floor to clock their position. Mid-bounce he was struck from behind with an immense force. I am not very small and for something to take me from zero to 100km an hour in a fraction of a second, bending me double, you think, \u2018God, have I been hit by a submarine?\u2019 It came up from below, behind, and rammed me, just hammered me. When I first got hit I was winded, picked up by the left arm and pushed through the water so the visibility went. I was stunned, didn\u2019t know what was going on. I had a dead weight hanging off my arm. Your peripheral vision in a face mask is nothing [so] when it slowed down a bit I could swing my head around. Then the bells went off. A shark\u2019s eyeball literally filled my face mask. I remember looking down its side when it was swinging me around like a dog with a goanna and I noticed my flippers were about half-way down its length. A big shark. It was just so solid. Felt like a brick wall. Apparently hampered by the position of the spear gun along Williams\u2019 left side, the animal released its grip and the diver found himself on the ocean floor, where he quickly took refuge in the recess of a reef ledge. I tucked up against a wall. I remember kneeling on the sand and [the ledge] came up to just over waist height. I was hunched down but there wasn\u2019t enough room for me to get everything in there. I was really puffing hard, breathing like a steam train, beginning to hyperventilate. I remember hearing my heart banging. Banging away, banging away. Thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead. This thing has got my name punched \u2026 it\u2019s not going away.\u2019 I was that close to going to the dark side \u2013 going into a blind panic, close to saying, \u2018You can\u2019t do anything, you might as well just roll over.\u2019 [But] I was really annoyed with it, that it was going to stop me seeing my family, actually kill me. You think to yourself you [will die] unless you try and work out how you are going to get out of this. I managed to slow [my breathing] down, checked my gear was OK, keeping an eye on the shark. Still had plenty of air. It went away into the gloom. I had a rough idea where I\u2019d seen it disappear. Next thing it came flying across the reef at me. I had my spear gun and I thought I could shoot it but then it\u2019s just going to get annoyed and crazier. I saw it come in and out of the gloom. Then it charged. It ran me down like a car. It was like a dart. The distance would have been 15 to 20 metres and it covered that in a couple of seconds. I had just enough time to lift my spear gun and try to fend it off. It went straight over my head. It would have been one metre above me. The girth of the thing. Like a car going over. Massive. Absolutely massive. The speed of the shark as it bit down on Williams\u2019 elbow and vigorously shook him created an unusual wound \u2013 saltwater forced into the bite area at high pressure had a gouging effect, but he didn\u2019t become aware of the pain until he realised the shark\u2019s tactics had moved him further away from the reef and out on to the sand. Returning to the cover of the reef ledge, he noticed he was bleeding badly and visibility was diminishing. Blood was making the water shimmery. At that stage I was feeling woozy, beginning to fade. The shark charged again. It [got to] within a couple of metres and all of a sudden it did a shimmy in the water, turned its tail and took off. The speed of the thing! Assuming the animal had disappeared and would soon make another run at him, Williams turned in anticipation, to see his two dive friends swimming quickly, elbow to elbow, across the reef. With Jenny signalling that she had just seen a giant shark, it was soon clear that the pair had arrived with Jenny\u2019s shark shield just in time. Bernie believes the abrupt shift in the shark\u2019s behaviour and swimming direction as it homed in for another strike signalled its clear discomfort once inside the orbit of the approaching shield. He believes his friends may not have returned to find him for another 10 minutes had they not seen the shark, as both had plenty of air in their tanks. By the time the three pulled themselves to the safety of the boat just a couple of minutes later, Bernie\u2019s own tank was almost empty. How humans react Research has shown that sharks maintain a pattern of \u201ctemporary residency\u201d at favoured sites along with periods of long-distance travel using some \u201ccommon corridors\u201d. They do not permanently stay at any one site but are more likely to be present at favoured places and in common corridors. The fact that they don\u2019t give birth until they reach about 5m in length and 16 years of age, and have an 18-month gestation period, make the sharks \u201cvulnerable to even low levels of exploitation (including incidental bycatch) and are slow to recover\u201d, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It is also now clear that Australia has two distinct great white shark populations; an eastern population and a western-southern population. In other words, the 2.6m great white shark that injured a surfer at Ballina, on Australia\u2019s east coast, in November 2018 probably belonged to a different \u2013 and considerably smaller \u2013 population than the animal (or animals) that attacked surfers in April in Margaret River. Back in 2007 one of the world\u2019s foremost white shark experts, Dr Barry Bruce, told me that anyone who thought they knew how many white sharks were cruising Australian waters was \u201cspeaking through their backside\u201d. In February Bruce co-published an article in the journal Scientific Reports about a groundbreaking CSIRO study that used world-first genetic analysis to estimate that there are between about 760 and 2,250 adult white sharks (best estimate 1,460 sharks) in the southern-western population off South Australia and WA, and between about 470 and 1,030 adult white sharks off eastern Australia (best estimate 750 sharks). The total white shark population off eastern Australia was estimated to be between 2,909 and 12,802 sharks (best estimate 5,460 sharks). Due to a lack of genetic data for juveniles, the total number of the southern-western population could not be directly estimated using these techniques. There are double the number of adult white sharks in the WA-South Australia population and fewer surfers, swimmers and divers (4.1 million people) compared with the east coast (18.8 million). And yet, since 2000, the western population has been responsible for 21 fatalities compared with the east coast\u2019s five. Shark nets have been used for decades on the east coast of Australia, with mixed success. But the problem of unintended bycatch, including dolphins and turtles, puts them out of favour in WA. Certainly, there is no silver bullet. A newly appointed independent scientific advisory panel on sharks will provide advice to the WA government on the effectiveness of its new shark mitigation technologies and scientific research into white shark populations, movements and behaviours. The lead author of a University of Queensland study a that shows 90% decline in Queensland shark numbers says more advanced approaches to safeguarding ocean users are needed. Dr George Roff says drum lines, nets and culls are not the answer. \u201cNets do not stop sharks from entering beaches, but instead are designed to entangle and trap sharks [and] there is no scientific evidence that I am aware of that shows that culling is an effective approach to reducing shark attacks,\u201d he says. \u201cSmart drum lines are good for understanding where sharks go and if a certain shark tends to return to the same beach, but white sharks often travel hundreds to thousands of kilometres. For smart drum lines to be successful they have to tag a large number of sharks within the population. \u201cModern technologies such as camera-mounted drones can monitor beaches for sharks in real time, and Sharksafe barriers trialled in South Africa show that white sharks can be successfully excluded from swimming areas.\u201d \u2018A full-on horizontal attack\u2019 Just 11 months on and about 700km away from where Bernie Williams was attacked, 15-year-old Zac Golebiowski was enjoying a morning\u2019s surf at a remote beach on Australia\u2019s south coast when his life was irrevocably changed. In a nation renowned for its picturesque coastline, Esperance beaches represent some of the most \u201cgrammable\u201d of all. With bay after bay of blinding white sand and clear cerulean waters, this part of the world could have been enhanced by a Technicolor enthusiast\u2019s sleight of hand. But on the morning of 2 December 2006, a bruise of clouds hung low over Esperance and a bitter south-easterly wind soured surf conditions. Golebiowski was eager for a surf, nonetheless. So he headed out by car with older brother Sam and a teenage friend to a protected cove they knew would be breaking clean and perfect. Nestled between two national parks, Wharton beach, on Duke of Orleans Bay, is a favourite with families for its long and easy sandbar breaks close to shore. It was overcast and gloomy, a \u2018sharky\u2019 morning, but sharks [were] the last thing to think about when you are 15 and going for a surf with your brother and a mate. I had never heard about sharks at Whartons \u2013 it is the last thing, the very last thing, I expected. The sandbar was so shallow that, after each ride, it was impossible to turn and duck his long malibu surfboard under oncoming sets. Instead, Golebiowski rode each wave into shore, walked the length of the beach and then paddled out for the next ride. [After] three or four waves I got one that was a bit of a dud. It didn\u2019t quite take me all the way into the beach. I started to paddle back out to where my brother was. The shark came in from deeper water and took my right leg as I was paddling towards [him]. It came from the side and it felt like what\u2019d you\u2019d imagine a big king hit to be like. A very big strike. It was a full-on horizontal attack in water that was only just head height. When I take my friends to where the attack happened they are always amazed that a shark attack could have happened there. The shark bit [off] my leg and the force of the bite took me down, pulled me under. There was no fighting for air. It was too shallow for that. It took me under and let go. I came straight back up and called for help. The [2.5-metre to three-metre) shark was probably a juvenile, curious, experimenting maybe. If it had been bigger it would have bitten me in half. A big shark in full hunting mode, it would have been carnage. [My brother] said it circled a couple of times. It could have attacked two more people but didn\u2019t. Any higher up my leg and it would have got [major] arteries. Golebiowski\u2019s survival was enabled by the quick and decisive action of his brother and strangers on the beach. Despite his trauma, the ocean continues to draw him in. No longer able to stand on a surfboard, he now uses a boogie board. It\u2019s generally pretty good. I just think about the chances of a shark coming back and attacking a person again \u2013 it is never going to happen. But surfing at Whartons is a whole other ballgame. In the last few years with so many attacks I have thought about [the attack] more. It is coming up to 12 years since it happened. I [don\u2019t] feel comfortable out there at all. There were eight WA shark fatalities in almost as many years after Golebiowski\u2019s ordeal. On 2 October 2014 Sean Pollard, then 23, narrowly escaped becoming the ninth when he suffered a devastating attack by two great white sharks at the Esperance surf break where two and a half years later, in April 2017, 17-year-old Laeticia Brouwer became the state\u2019s most recent shark attack victim. Pollard lost his left arm and right hand, and ligaments in both legs were damaged when a shark made three ferocious strikes, as the former electrician attempted to fend it off with his surfboard. In 2015 he told 60 Minutes: I felt this massive bump and the shark came underneath me. I was trying to paddle calmly so I wasn\u2019t splashing around like I was panicking, but once it got directly behind me it charged. Went in for the kill. Both my arms were in its mouth, its eye was right there. That vision \u2013 this cover going over its eye as it bit down on me \u2013 [is] burnt into my mind. It took me underwater, started shaking its head. I remember having to hold my breath and it shook seven or eight times. That\u2019s when I got bumped from behind by another shark. Back on the surface and with both hands now severed, he lay on his back and kicked for his life, catching a wave back into shore, where decisive action by four bystanders almost certainly saved his life. \u2018It shook me violently\u2019 Almost a year after Pollard survived this attack, a free diver and spear fisher Norman Galli, then 50, dropped into a glassy sea off a small island near Albany, a five-hour drive further south. The environmental manager from Perth and his regular dive partner, Anton Van Zyl, had been in the water all morning spearing about a dozen fish when Galli felt the impact of what he initially thought must have been the hull or motor of a speeding boat. I was right up along a ledge that went from two metres depth down to five metres. I actually thought that the boat had driven over me \u2013 that is how hard and sudden the impact was. And how quickly it was over. I was blindsided. He had twice before encountered great white sharks in the ocean at close range. In both instances \u2013 in South Africa in 2000 and near Moore River on WA\u2019s mid-west coast in 2012 \u2013 the animals departed as quickly as they appeared. But this time it was a different story. Experienced spear fishers say the shark that is going to bite you is the one you don\u2019t see, and I certainly didn\u2019t see this shark at all. It came in at a 45-degree angle from behind and attacked very close to the surface. The impact was hard, brutal. I was shaken around like a rag doll. It was just ferocious. And, were it not for the spear gun he was carrying, his life may well have ended there and then, on 30 October 2015. Like Allan Oppert and Bernie Williams, Norman Galli believes that the steel implement saved his life. In the first moment of the attack, the gun was rammed hard up against his ribcage. He believes its barrel became stuck in the back of the shark\u2019s jaw. The town of Albany was a whaling port until 1978, when ships carrying harpooned whales would attract hungry white sharks in their wake. There have been several shark attacks in the area in recent years, including the fatal mauling of the 17-year-old spear fisher and free diver Jay Muscat nine months before Norman Galli\u2019s close call, and in the same stretch of water. Free divers descend for minutes at a time on a single breath of air \u2013 held for long enough to locate and harpoon a fish, and return to the surface, which is where Galli was floating at the time of the attack. It shook me violently and I felt the cut of a tooth in my stomach. There was just a lot of white water and foam. When it released me and the commotion stopped I lifted my head out of the water, expecting to see the boat on top of me, but it was in the same position 150 metres or so away. I shouted for Anton. I backed up into a two-metre-deep rock ledge with my back towards Bald Island, feeling very vulnerable without my spear gun, which I could see about 20 metres away. Anton had parked the boat a safe distance from the swell and surge, which was crashing in to the island, and he called me to the boat. The island is surrounded by tall granite cliffs so I couldn\u2019t get out of the water. I had to swim 30 metres or so. I didn\u2019t know what had happened until I climbed on to the boat and blood was dripping from my stomach. When I lifted my arm, there were teethmarks in the wetsuit. It is difficult to tell whether any of the attacks described here might have been prevented by the mitigation strategies now in place in WA. Even if the shark that attacked Golebiowski in Esperance had been tagged, there were no receivers at the remote beach and, even if there had been, who knows whether an alert would have reached him in time. The same could be said of Galli and Pollard. But for surfers and divers in particular, shark shields are recognised as potent protection. Among the suite of measures designed to keep ocean users safer, the WA government has introduced a rebate for approved shields, the first such initiative in the world. So far, 2,300 regular ocean users have taken up the offer, embedding them in surfboards or wearing them on ankles. In the meantime, a number of attacks on Australia\u2019s east coast in recent months will be in the thoughts of many ocean users across the country this summer. But only time will tell whether government measures can take a bite out of WA\u2019s formidable reputation as a global shark-attack hotspot. \u2022 Fiona Adolph is writing a book about shark attacks in Western Australian in the past 20 years",

But their idea of Asia is a fantasy | Jeevan Vasagar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Margaret Thatcher was a great admirer of the former British colony, but more recently others who have been intrigued by Singapore\u2019s success include Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Michael Gove as education secretary in 2012 and Owen Paterson, a luminary of the Tory Eurosceptic benches. Others, such as Sir James Dyson, the Brexiter businessman, speak with their wallet. He picked Singapore and not the UK post-Brexit to build his new electric vehicle. Javid at least speaks from experience \u2013 he earned \u00a33m a year as head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Singapore trading division.</p> <p>Hunt, quickly refashioning his modernising politics to suit an imminent date with a Tory party electorate, is a more surprising advocate for Singapore. He used an article in the Mail on Sunday before his visit on Wednesday to hail its remarkable transformation from a tiny territory devoid of natural resources into the world\u2019s eighth-richest country, adding it was \u201ca reminder of the tidal shifts that can exist within the ebb and flow of the changing world order\u201d.</p> <p>In taking this course, Hunt is taking a political risk both for himself and for Brexit. He risks burning his remaining bridges with the small modernising base in the Tory party, but he also risks associating Brexit at such a sensitive time with an economic and democratic model that may be anathema to wavering Brexit voters.</p> <p>Brexit critics often claim the Tory party vision is for a deregulated Singapore-on-Thames, and here is a senior cabinet minister only weeks before the key Brexit vote travelling 6,700 miles to confirm this to be the case.</p> <p>For EU negotiators, anxious that a bargain-basement Britain does not have privileged access to its single market, the warning could not be clearer.</p> <p>At one level, the parallels with the birth of Singapore and post-Brexit Britain are worth drawing. Singapore was expelled in 1965 from its short-lived union with its larger Malaysian neighbours, something that proved to be a blessing in disguise for a small city state few thought could prosper alone.</p> <p>At the time of independence, Singapore\u2019s GDP per capita stood at just $512. Now it has the eighth-largest GDP per capita in the world and is consistently ranked among the tiger countries, with the highest density of millionaires relative to population. Its achievements in schooling and housing are striking.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to create a new kind of economy, try new methods and schemes never tried before anywhere else in the world, because there was no other country like Singapore,\u201d wrote Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s founder in his memoirs, From Third World to First.</p> <p>But here the potential parallels between two nations reborn become more difficult. Lee explicitly refused to cede any ground to democracy while Singapore\u2019s fellow Asian tiger economies were democratising.</p> <p>Beginning in 1963, political rival the Socialist Front \u2013 a left-wing split from the ruling People\u2019s Action party (PAP) \u2013 suffered mass arrests through the use of the Internal Security Act. Subsequent parliamentary elections have not exactly been cliff-hangers. Thanks to a mixture of bans, libel laws and media repression, the PAP manages to win all but three or four of the 80-plus seats up for contest.</p> <p>Singapore had indeed modernised and developed economically, yet its authoritarian rule went unchallenged. As Milton Friedman, the great free-market economist observed in the 1990s, as much of the world succumbed to democratic rule, Singapore demonstrated that \u201cit is possible to combine a free private market economic system with a dictatorial political system\u201d.</p> <p>Independent trade unions were so weakened that by the 1970s strikes and work stoppages had disappeared. Wages have been kept low through the use of state-sponsored trade unions and the widespread use of cheap migrant labour, something that Brexit is designed to halt. Income inequality has also widened, even if on most measures it is wider in the US.</p> <p>Throughout his life, Lee defended this trade-off of democratic rights for growth, insisting that the former would have precluded the latter. \u201cWe decide what is right, no matter what the people think.\u201d</p> <p>Asked on BBC Radio 4 how Singapore fitted into his \u201cinvisible chain of democracies\u201d Hunt simply changed the subject. In a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, he resorted to euphemism: \u201cThe British legacy of the rule of law, clean administration, independent courts and the English language have all been part of Singapore\u2019s success.\u201d</p> <p>It is also not clear if Singapore\u2019s transformation into an export-orientated manufacturing base for international capital is relevant to the modern UK. Singapore grew at a time when globalisation allowed multinational corporations to take advantage of different labour and production costs in manufacturing. There is little chance, for instance, of the UK becoming a major exporter of electronic goods based on low wages.</p> <p>Singapore also grew through a form of state intervention more associated with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, than pro-Brexit economist Patrick Minford. Large infrastructure projects were financed from a fund based on state-compelled savings. State enterprise and public investment were at the heart of the growth. Housing is largely publicly owned.</p> <p>Significantly, one of the observers most sceptical about the parallels between Singapore and Brexit is Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. In an interview with Bloomberg in November he said: \u201cThe Singapore government accounts for 16% of GDP, maybe 17%. So to say that you\u2019re going to be like Singapore, are you going to give up two-thirds of your government spending, state pensions and national health?\u201d</p> <p>Hunt would presumably answer in the negative, inviting the wider question as to what cause he is advancing by his visit.</p>",

Quite how Singapore, an authoritarian state capitalist economy akin to China, has become the pre-eminent Tory model for the UK post-Brexit, as opposed to other more democratic economies, is puzzling. Margaret Thatcher was a great admirer of the former British colony, but more recently others who have been intrigued by Singapore\u2019s success include Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Michael Gove as education secretary in 2012 and Owen Paterson, a luminary of the Tory Eurosceptic benches. Others, such as Sir James Dyson, the Brexiter businessman, speak with their wallet. He picked Singapore and not the UK post-Brexit to build his new electric vehicle. Javid at least speaks from experience \u2013 he earned \u00a33m a year as head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Singapore trading division. Hunt, quickly refashioning his modernising politics to suit an imminent date with a Tory party electorate, is a more surprising advocate for Singapore. He used an article in the Mail on Sunday before his visit on Wednesday to hail its remarkable transformation from a tiny territory devoid of natural resources into the world\u2019s eighth-richest country, adding it was \u201ca reminder of the tidal shifts that can exist within the ebb and flow of the changing world order\u201d. In taking this course, Hunt is taking a political risk both for himself and for Brexit. He risks burning his remaining bridges with the small modernising base in the Tory party, but he also risks associating Brexit at such a sensitive time with an economic and democratic model that may be anathema to wavering Brexit voters. Brexit critics often claim the Tory party vision is for a deregulated Singapore-on-Thames, and here is a senior cabinet minister only weeks before the key Brexit vote travelling 6,700 miles to confirm this to be the case. For EU negotiators, anxious that a bargain-basement Britain does not have privileged access to its single market, the warning could not be clearer. At one level, the parallels with the birth of Singapore and post-Brexit Britain are worth drawing. Singapore was expelled in 1965 from its short-lived union with its larger Malaysian neighbours, something that proved to be a blessing in disguise for a small city state few thought could prosper alone. At the time of independence, Singapore\u2019s GDP per capita stood at just $512. Now it has the eighth-largest GDP per capita in the world and is consistently ranked among the tiger countries, with the highest density of millionaires relative to population. Its achievements in schooling and housing are striking. \u201cWe had to create a new kind of economy, try new methods and schemes never tried before anywhere else in the world, because there was no other country like Singapore,\u201d wrote Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s founder in his memoirs, From Third World to First. But here the potential parallels between two nations reborn become more difficult. Lee explicitly refused to cede any ground to democracy while Singapore\u2019s fellow Asian tiger economies were democratising. Beginning in 1963, political rival the Socialist Front \u2013 a left-wing split from the ruling People\u2019s Action party (PAP) \u2013 suffered mass arrests through the use of the Internal Security Act. Subsequent parliamentary elections have not exactly been cliff-hangers. Thanks to a mixture of bans, libel laws and media repression, the PAP manages to win all but three or four of the 80-plus seats up for contest. Singapore had indeed modernised and developed economically, yet its authoritarian rule went unchallenged. As Milton Friedman, the great free-market economist observed in the 1990s, as much of the world succumbed to democratic rule, Singapore demonstrated that \u201cit is possible to combine a free private market economic system with a dictatorial political system\u201d. Independent trade unions were so weakened that by the 1970s strikes and work stoppages had disappeared. Wages have been kept low through the use of state-sponsored trade unions and the widespread use of cheap migrant labour, something that Brexit is designed to halt. Income inequality has also widened, even if on most measures it is wider in the US. Throughout his life, Lee defended this trade-off of democratic rights for growth, insisting that the former would have precluded the latter. \u201cWe decide what is right, no matter what the people think.\u201d Asked on BBC Radio 4 how Singapore fitted into his \u201cinvisible chain of democracies\u201d Hunt simply changed the subject. In a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, he resorted to euphemism: \u201cThe British legacy of the rule of law, clean administration, independent courts and the English language have all been part of Singapore\u2019s success.\u201d It is also not clear if Singapore\u2019s transformation into an export-orientated manufacturing base for international capital is relevant to the modern UK. Singapore grew at a time when globalisation allowed multinational corporations to take advantage of different labour and production costs in manufacturing. There is little chance, for instance, of the UK becoming a major exporter of electronic goods based on low wages. Singapore also grew through a form of state intervention more associated with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, than pro-Brexit economist Patrick Minford. Large infrastructure projects were financed from a fund based on state-compelled savings. State enterprise and public investment were at the heart of the growth. Housing is largely publicly owned. Significantly, one of the observers most sceptical about the parallels between Singapore and Brexit is Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. In an interview with Bloomberg in November he said: \u201cThe Singapore government accounts for 16% of GDP, maybe 17%. So to say that you\u2019re going to be like Singapore, are you going to give up two-thirds of your government spending, state pensions and national health?\u201d Hunt would presumably answer in the negative, inviting the wider question as to what cause he is advancing by his visit.",

      "bodyText": "The clothing brand Ted Baker has come under fire from the Methodist church over the harassment scandal that forced the company\u2019s founder, Ray Kelvin, to take a leave of absence. Epworth, a fund manager owned by the Methodist church, wrote to Ted Baker last month to demand an investigation into the allegations against Kelvin after 300 former and current staff signed an online petition complaining about behaviour including \u201cforced hugs\u201d and \u201cear kissing\u201d. The claims are now the subject of an independent investigation led by a City law firm. Epworth owns a small stake in Ted Baker and is said to have urged swift action, including changes to the corporate culture, if wrongdoing was unearthed. On its website the fund, which has \u00a31.4bn of assets under management, says it aims to ensure that its investments are \u201cconsistent with the Christian faith and that it seeks to use its \u201cinfluence to improve ethical standards in the businesses we invest in. We ask ourselves if the companies we are investing in are sustainable and operating in a way that is to the benefit of all stakeholders, including wider society.\u201d The Ted Baker controversy came to light in early December when a petition appeared on the employee campaigning platform Organise. The petition called for an end to the alleged behaviour, saying: \u201cIt is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged.\u201d Until the Observer reported the allegations, Kelvin\u2019s hugs were accepted as part of a quirky culture at Ted Baker\u2019s London head office, according to current and former employees. But staff of both sexes have now accused Kelvin of ear kissing, shoulder massages and asking young female employees to sit on his knee. After several days of allegations the company brought in the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills to lead an investigation. Organise said it had sent about 100 anonymised reports of alleged harassment to the Ted Baker board. Herbert Smith will report back to a committee of Ted Baker\u2019s non-executive directors. Kelvin, who owns a 35% of the listed company, initially tried to continue in the role of chief executive but agreed to take a voluntary leave of absence after the company\u2019s board was made aware of \u201cfurther serious allegations\u201d. The 63-year-old opened the first Ted Baker store in Glasgow in 1988 and, 30 years on, it has 544 outlets worldwide and annual sales of \u00a3590m. Kelvin released a statement in which he said the accusations were \u201cvery serious and upsetting\u201d and that it was \u201conly right\u201d they should be investigated. He added: \u201cTed Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years. I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. Ted Baker means everything to me and I can\u2019t bear to see it harmed in any way.\u201d Ted Baker and Epworth declined to comment on the letter.",

While the government protection measures appear to be working, the outlook for the whales remains bleak: only 411 are believed to remain worldwide, with fewer females giving birth than in previous years. The urgency in deploying environmental protections comes after a catastrophic 12 right whales were killed in Canadian waters in 2017 \u2013 the deadliest year on record for the species. Most of the deaths were the result of collisions with marine vessels. Rope entanglements from fishing boats were also suspected in two deaths. Another six were killed in American waters. Sweeping measures introduced last year by Canada\u2019s government include a 100-meter buffer zone between the whales and boats, fishing closures and vessel slowdowns. Violations of the rules can run steep: fines range from C$100,000 ($73,000) to C$500,000 ($366,543) \u2013 with repeat offenders facing potential jail time. Large boats, including cruise ships, are required to slow their speed down to 10 knots in protection zones, reducing the risk of colliding with whales. The new limits have prompted some cruise ship companies to modify itineraries and bypass the region. The government has also implemented dynamic fishing closures, meaning fishermen must quickly pull up any traps, lines and ropes if whales are spotted in the area. The habitat range of right whales has become increasingly erratic and unpredictable, making it difficult to anticipate which areas are in need of closure. In recent years, right whales have become a common sight in the Gulf Saint Lawrence \u2013 Canada\u2019s busy shipping thoroughfare \u2013 setting the stage for deadly interactions with marine traffic. The strict rules have frustrated both the fishing industry and residents in the Quebec and Newfoundland.

      "bodyText": "Some psychologists are upset at the deployment of purported scientific techniques in magic tricks, according to the Times. The newspaper cites a study (paywall) co-authored by Gustav Kuhn, a reader in psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, in which a group of people watched a magic trick. Those who knew that the performer was a magician were as likely to believe his false claims about being able to read a person\u2019s mind as those who were told he was a psychologist. Yet according to Kuhn, the neurolinguistic programming (NLP) techniques claimed by some magicians \u2013 in which facial cues and body language can be read \u2013 iare \u201ccomplete pseudoscience\u201d. So how do magicians feel about this? Tom MacKay is a mentalist, magician and NLP trainer who also has a master\u2019s in psychology. \u201cWhen NLP is claimed as a pseudoscience, it is really a misunderstanding of what it is,\u201d he says. \u201cNLP was developed as a way to model successful thinking.\u201d He works with athletes, for instance, to improve performance. The confusion arises, MacKay says, because \u201ca lot of people who say they are doing mentalism claim to read body language and facial cues. Which hand is the coin in? That\u2019s a classic magic trick. I might be able to predict which hand it is in through observing physiology with quite a few people, but it wouldn\u2019t work 100%. In magic, you want things to be 100%. Magicians say it\u2019s NLP when it isn\u2019t.\u201d Hugh Shields, a magician also known as Hughdini, trained under NLP co-creator Richard Bandler (who also taught NLP to Derren Brown and Paul McKenna). \u201cDo [tricks] work because of NLP or for some other reason?\u201d he asks.

By that stage, the \u00a358m deal between Dortmund and Chelsea that will see the 20-year-old attacker loaned back to the Westfalenstadion for the rest of the season before he completes his move to the west London club in the summer was virtually agreed, with Pulisic signing a five-and-a-half year deal at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/02/chelsea-christian-pulisic-borussia-dortmund\">Christian Pulisic joins Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund for \u00a358m</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In truth, however, this has been a transfer in the making ever since he and his agent, Rob Moore, opted to turn down Dortmund\u2019s offer of a new contract at the end of last season. Previously the poster boy for the club\u2019s ambitious new approach based on promoting players from its youth academy, Pulisic moved to Germany in 2015 after being scouted at a youth tournament the previous year and had made more than 70 appearances in the Bundesliga before he turned 20 in September.</p> \n<p>But the emergence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/21/bundesliga-dortmund-gladbach-jadon-sancho-report-bayern\" title=\"\">the young England forward Jadon Sancho</a> at the tail-end of last season and the signing of the Danish winger Jacob Bruun Larsen have seen him start only five of Dortmund\u2019s 17 league matches this campaign. Indeed they have established a surprise six-point lead over Bayern Munich at the halfway stage, meaning the prospect of losing yet another prized asset to one of Europe\u2019s wealthiest clubs was perhaps not the disaster it may once have been, despite his undoubted ability.</p> \n<p>Dortmund have now recouped more than \u00a3220m since August 2017 from the sales of Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and sporting director, Michael Zorc, certainly seemed philosophical about losing such a talented and marketable player. \u201cIt was always Christian\u2019s dream to play in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cThat certainly has to do with his American background, and as a result we were unable to extend his contract.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1cb492c4-743f-4f19-92b8-1b72c3e9dea0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G3FSVZXbZnw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Manchester United and Liverpool both expressed interest in signing him last summer, although it was Chelsea who pushed hardest given their attempt to provide more competition for the ageing Willian and Pedro who are both \u2013 like Eden Hazard \u2013 out of contract in the summer of 2020. An attempt to make Pulisic Maurizio Sarri\u2019s first signing in July fell short when Dortmund demanded in excess of \u00a370m but with his value decreasing due to his contract situation, they got their man.</p> \n<p>Chelsea insist that paying the third-highest transfer fee in their history after Kepa Arrizabalaga and \u00c1lvaro Morata will not have any bearing on the future of Hazard despite his diminishing contract status, although Pulisic has shown he is capable of operating in a number of forward positions, including as a No10. His arrival also inevitably casts doubt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/01/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-callum-hudson-odoi\" title=\"\">over the future of Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> despite Sarri\u2019s insistence that the teenage forward has the ability to become of the best young players in Europe, with Bayern Munich reportedly having already had a \u00a320m bid for him rejected. It will be intriguing to see whether he is tempted to follow the example of Sancho and England youth teammate Reiss Nelson \u2013 currently on loan at Hoffenheim from Arsenal \u2013 by heading to the Bundesliga to further his development.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pulisic will make the reverse journey having spent a year living in Oxfordshire village of Tackley and playing for Brackley Town\u2019s youth team before returning to the US with his family at the age of eight. \u201cI was nervous about coming to England at first, with \u2018soccer\u2019 and everything, but when I left at first I missed it a lot.

      "bodyText": "Even with all his experience of dealing with media, Christian Pulisic could not resist almost giving the game away. It was mid-November and the USA squad were settling into their hotel before the friendly against England at Wembley when the conversation turned to whether he would one day return to the country where he first fell in love with football as a child. \u201cEngland, the Premier League, is a league where lots of kids dream of playing so there is no reason why maybe one day I won\u2019t play here,\u201d he said rather cryptically. Yet the double negative was fooling no one. By that stage, the \u00a358m deal between Dortmund and Chelsea that will see the 20-year-old attacker loaned back to the Westfalenstadion for the rest of the season before he completes his move to the west London club in the summer was virtually agreed, with Pulisic signing a five-and-a-half year deal at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. In truth, however, this has been a transfer in the making ever since he and his agent, Rob Moore, opted to turn down Dortmund\u2019s offer of a new contract at the end of last season. Previously the poster boy for the club\u2019s ambitious new approach based on promoting players from its youth academy, Pulisic moved to Germany in 2015 after being scouted at a youth tournament the previous year and had made more than 70 appearances in the Bundesliga before he turned 20 in September. But the emergence of the young England forward Jadon Sancho at the tail-end of last season and the signing of the Danish winger Jacob Bruun Larsen have seen him start only five of Dortmund\u2019s 17 league matches this campaign. Indeed they have established a surprise six-point lead over Bayern Munich at the halfway stage, meaning the prospect of losing yet another prized asset to one of Europe\u2019s wealthiest clubs was perhaps not the disaster it may once have been, despite his undoubted ability. Dortmund have now recouped more than \u00a3220m since August 2017 from the sales of Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and sporting director, Michael Zorc, certainly seemed philosophical about losing such a talented and marketable player. \u201cIt was always Christian\u2019s dream to play in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cThat certainly has to do with his American background, and as a result we were unable to extend his contract.\u201d Manchester United and Liverpool both expressed interest in signing him last summer, although it was Chelsea who pushed hardest given their attempt to provide more competition for the ageing Willian and Pedro who are both \u2013 like Eden Hazard \u2013 out of contract in the summer of 2020. An attempt to make Pulisic Maurizio Sarri\u2019s first signing in July fell short when Dortmund demanded in excess of \u00a370m but with his value decreasing due to his contract situation, they got their man. Chelsea insist that paying the third-highest transfer fee in their history after Kepa Arrizabalaga and \u00c1lvaro Morata will not have any bearing on the future of Hazard despite his diminishing contract status, although Pulisic has shown he is capable of operating in a number of forward positions, including as a No10. His arrival also inevitably casts doubt over the future of Callum Hudson-Odoi despite Sarri\u2019s insistence that the teenage forward has the ability to become of the best young players in Europe, with Bayern Munich reportedly having already had a \u00a320m bid for him rejected. It will be intriguing to see whether he is tempted to follow the example of Sancho and England youth teammate Reiss Nelson \u2013 currently on loan at Hoffenheim from Arsenal \u2013 by heading to the Bundesliga to further his development. Pulisic will make the reverse journey having spent a year living in Oxfordshire village of Tackley and playing for Brackley Town\u2019s youth team before returning to the US with his family at the age of eight. \u201cI was nervous about coming to England at first, with \u2018soccer\u2019 and everything, but when I left at first I missed it a lot. I missed that culture,\u201d he recalled in November. \u201cEveryone liked to play soccer, everyone was there. And then I would come back to the US and no one really wanted to play soccer, so it was different.\u201d Now he will get the chance to show he has been worth the wait.",

If the loathing of a person or thing is too partisan, someone will defend them \u2013 which creates more bitter division. And a hate figure can\u2019t be anyone too obvious. Triggering the nation\u2019s bile ducts is complex biology. When the target is acquired, though, the effort is all worth it. I\u2019ve identified the first five hatees of 2019. However many more come along, these, I guarantee, will last us all year. Whether or not they really deserve it. Meghan Markle. There were rumours that the new duchess was making no friends in the palace, but it was hard to pick a side. She wanted to marry in a particular tiara, but, according to reports, the Queen wouldn\u2019t let her because it was a Russian emerald, and Markle had a tantrum. So what are the moral parameters of this tiff? If you\u2019ve got a load of emeralds so shady you can\u2019t wear them, why not sell them and give the money to refugees? It emerged yesterday, however, that Markle has banned Prince Harry from drinking alcohol, coffee and tea for January. Ancient principles are at stake. This is a stone-cold classic, Guys and Dolls switcheroo (Marry the man today / give him the girlish laughter / give him your hand today / and save the fist for after). (Core values: marriage, tea.) Bacon. It gives you cancer, but so do loads of things. Nobody hates cigarettes (it\u2019s smokers we can\u2019t abide). It\u2019s not the meat per se, it\u2019s the nitrates, and you can\u2019t hate a nitrate. This cured product acts so innocently delicious, so timelessly wholesome, when all along it\u2019s been asbestos with tasty rind. The problem with bacon, see, is that it\u2019s not on the level. (Core value: English breakfast.) Bros. The success of the documentary Bros: After the Screaming Stops will lead some production company to give the Goss brothers a reality show. The philosophising will pall after seven minutes, but the vehicle will be kept on the road for months. We\u2019ll feel generalised embarrassment, and this, being uncomfortable, will morph straight into hatred. Mark my words. (Core value: the humility of the has-been.) The Ferry Company With No Ferries. It\u2019s hard not to blame Seaborne Freight, contracted to provide emergency capacity on the short straits in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But at least Ferry McNonExistentFerryFace will give us all a laugh, as we sink, giggling, into the sea. (Core value: caustic resignation.) The Woman Who Looked As If She Punched a Police Horse. A woman in Adelaide was reported to have ambled up to a horse on New Year\u2019s Eve and punched it. It turns out that she may have actually punched someone on the other side of the horse. But still, who would throw punches in the vicinity of a horse? (Core value: be kind to horses.)",

      "bodyText": "Hours after taking office, Brazil\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, has launched an assault on environmental and Amazon protections with an executive order transferring the regulation and creation of new indigenous reserves to the agriculture ministry \u2013 which is controlled by the powerful agribusiness lobby. The move sparked outcry from indigenous leaders, who said it threatened their reserves, which make up about 13% of Brazilian territory, and marked a symbolic concession to farming interests at a time when deforestation is rising again. \u201cThere will be an increase in deforestation and violence against indigenous people,\u201d said Dinaman Tux\u00e1, the executive coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous People of Brazil (Apib). \u201cIndigenous people are defenders and protectors of the environment.\u201d Sonia Guajajara, an indigenous leader who stood as vice-presidential candidate for the Socialism and Freedom party (PSOL) tweeted her opposition. \u201cThe dismantling has already begun,\u201d she posted on Tuesday. Previously, demarcation of indigenous reserves was controlled by the indigenous agency Funai, which has been moved from the justice ministry to a new ministry of women, family and human rights controlled by an evangelical pastor. The decision was included in an executive order which also gave Bolsonaro\u2019s government secretary potentially far-reaching powers over non-governmental organizations working in Brazil. The temporary decree, which expires unless it is ratified by congress within 120 days, mandates that the office of the government secretary, Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz, \u201csupervise, coordinate, monitor and accompany the activities and actions of international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the national territory\u201d. Bolsonaro, who has often criticised Brazilian and international NGOs who he accuses of \u201csticking their noses into Brazil\u201d, defended the measure in a tweet on Wednesday. \u201cMore than 15% of national territory is demarcated as indigenous land and quilombos. Less than a million people live in these places, isolated from true Brazil, exploited and manipulated by NGOs. Together we will integrate these citizens,\u201d he posted. Separately, the incoming health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, suggested on Wednesday that there would be spending cuts on healthcare for indigenous people. \u201cWe have figures for the general public that are much below what is spent on healthcare for the indigenous,\u201d he said, without providing details. During last year\u2019s election campaign, Bolsonaro promised to end demarcation of new indigenous lands, reduce the power of environmental agencies and free up mining and commercial farming on indigenous reserves. His measure also gave the agriculture ministry power over new quilombos \u2013 rural settlements inhabited by descendants of former slaves. After she was sworn in on Wednesday, the new agriculture minister, Tereza Cristina Dias, defended the farm sector from accusations it has grown at the expense of the environment, adding that the strength of Brazil\u2019s farmers had generated \u201cunfounded accusations\u201d from unnamed international groups. Silas Malafaia, an influential televangelist and close friend of Bolsonaro, said developed countries who centuries ago cut down their own forests should pay if they wanted Brazil to preserve the Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to preserve everything because the gringos destroyed what they had?\u201d he said. Former environment minister Marina Silva tweeted: \u201cBolsonaro has begun his government in the worst possible way.\u201d Tux\u00e1, the indigenous leader, said: \u201cWe will go through another colonisation process, this is what they want.\u201d",

A German government source confirmed Angela Merkel had spoken with May on Christmas Eve and again on Wednesday, as part of a series of calls the British prime minister has made to EU leaders over the festive period as she attempts to guide her Brexit deal through the Commons. Downing Street remained silent on the details of the calls and has not revealed the list of EU leaders, but a No 10 source said May had more calls lined up this week.

Ahead of their return, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, will convene a meeting of junior ministers on Thursday to discuss updates to the preparations for a no-deal exit. May has said she is seeking further legal reassurances from EU leaders about the permanence of the backstop agreement, which would keep the whole UK in a single customs territory with the EU until both sides agreed on an alternative solution to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Hunt, who is in Singapore, said May would eventually get her Brexit deal approved. \u201cI think that she will find a way to get this deal through parliament and I know that is what the British people would want,\u201d he told an audience Q&amp;A.

Some of us believe it would be wise to redirect 20% of current reactive spending on this area towards focused preventive programmes such as mental health first aid and other evidence-based interventions. We think this would ameliorate the current reliance on clinic-based and psychiatric medication-based interventions and reap rich rewards and results.</p> <p>We support the rapid expansion of proven approaches such as whole-school wellbeing programmes, cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness to tackle underlying anxieties, along with other evidence-based psychological, talking, physical, art and family therapies to identify the mental distress caused possibly by earlier life trauma. Now is the time for our government to show some new year resolve on this issue.<br><strong>Dave Traxson</strong><em> Chair of Calm (Child-friendly Alternatives to Labelling and psychiatric Medications),</em> <strong>Professor Peter Kinderman</strong><em> Vice-chair of Calm, and chair of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'My beautiful and clever son seems a shell of who he once was and I have gone from being fearful for him to being afraid of him.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u2022 Your article about failing NHS provision for adolescent mental health made distressingly familiar reading. It will soon be the first anniversary of my son\u2019s exposure to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). He has been on a large dose of antidepressants since January. The medicine\u2019s instructions say it is not to be used on children without talking therapy; he has had only five sessions of talking therapy.</p> <p>He shows some symptoms of depression, his only diagnosis. He has become verbally and physically violent; his schoolwork \u2013 already poor \u2013 went off a cliff, as did attendance. He has started to self-harm. His unsupportive school showed him the door; and in the period of having no school, Camhs offered us no additional support despite pleas to manage a crisis. They also seem unwilling to screen for any other conditions, despite various indications that he has conditions other than depression. Never in my professional or personal life have I encountered a service as abject and incurious as that imposed by Camhs. My beautiful and clever son seems a shell of who he once was and I have gone from being fearful for him to being afraid of him.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Your article says NHS England played down the findings on which you report, saying that the survey was based \u201con the view of a tiny fraction of GPs \u2013 roughly 3%\u201d. The margin of error in similar random samples is related to the number of responses, 1,000 in this case, rather than on the fraction of the population.

      "bodyText": "We, as a group of child mental health professionals, academics, campaigners and politicians, agree with the sentiments expressed in your front-page article (Shortage of mental health care is putting children at risk, GPs warn, 31 December). The slogan of requiring \u201ca parity of esteem\u201d between physical and mental health in society, often used by ministers and others, needs to become an urgent future reality if we are to stem the emerging epidemic of mental health problems among young people. Some of us believe it would be wise to redirect 20% of current reactive spending on this area towards focused preventive programmes such as mental health first aid and other evidence-based interventions. We think this would ameliorate the current reliance on clinic-based and psychiatric medication-based interventions and reap rich rewards and results. We support the rapid expansion of proven approaches such as whole-school wellbeing programmes, cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness to tackle underlying anxieties, along with other evidence-based psychological, talking, physical, art and family therapies to identify the mental distress caused possibly by earlier life trauma. Now is the time for our government to show some new year resolve on this issue. Dave Traxson Chair of Calm (Child-friendly Alternatives to Labelling and psychiatric Medications), Professor Peter Kinderman Vice-chair of Calm, and chair of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool \u2022 Your article about failing NHS provision for adolescent mental health made distressingly familiar reading. It will soon be the first anniversary of my son\u2019s exposure to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). He has been on a large dose of antidepressants since January. The medicine\u2019s instructions say it is not to be used on children without talking therapy; he has had only five sessions of talking therapy. He shows some symptoms of depression, his only diagnosis. He has become verbally and physically violent; his schoolwork \u2013 already poor \u2013 went off a cliff, as did attendance. He has started to self-harm. His unsupportive school showed him the door; and in the period of having no school, Camhs offered us no additional support despite pleas to manage a crisis. They also seem unwilling to screen for any other conditions, despite various indications that he has conditions other than depression. Never in my professional or personal life have I encountered a service as abject and incurious as that imposed by Camhs. My beautiful and clever son seems a shell of who he once was and I have gone from being fearful for him to being afraid of him. Name and address supplied \u2022 Your article says NHS England played down the findings on which you report, saying that the survey was based \u201con the view of a tiny fraction of GPs \u2013 roughly 3%\u201d. The margin of error in similar random samples is related to the number of responses, 1,000 in this case, rather than on the fraction of the population. The figures presented are so stark that small sampling errors cannot put the conclusions in any doubt.

Those migrants too were often exploited, reviled and dehumanised. Most people read the novel and sympathise enormously with the Joads and their fellow refugees. Yet we only need to change the time and geography and that understanding and sympathy vanishes. <br><strong>Robin Prior</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 In 1958, aged 10, I stood on the beach in Vlissingen with my Auntie Julie. She talked to me about the day in October 1914 when, as a five-year-old refugee from Antwerp, she had crossed the Channel in \u201ca very small boat\u201d with her mother, brother and sister.

      "bodyText": "Hats off to Monica Bohm-Duchen for the inspired idea of a year-long festival to celebrate the contributions to British culture and public life made by refugees from the Nazis (Report, 31 December). Reading obituaries in the Guardian over recent years, it has been remarkable how often people who greatly enriched British society \u2013 in education, the arts, science, law, social work, architecture, human rights, community development and much more \u2013 came in this wave of refugees. I hope many more around the country will get on board and reflect how their communities have also benefited. We certainly need an antidote to the poison infecting much public comment about asylum seekers and refugees. What can we do to reset our values to ensure a humane response to refugees? Susan Hofsteede Bangor, Gwynedd \u2022 How good to highlight the contribution to culture of wartime refugees. Culture takes many forms. As well as the artists (and let\u2019s not forget Kurt Schwitters), designers and musicians, there were scholars who settled in the UK, transfusing intellectual brilliance into their research and teaching, and enthusiasm into their students. From the 1960s through to the 1980s and 1990s, three historians of the ancient and medieval worlds, Arnaldo Momigliano, Walter Ullmann and Karl Leyser, contributed hugely to their discipline. I and many others will never forget them. Jinty Nelson London \u2022 Your correspondents urging compassion for those attempting to cross the Channel are quite right (Letters, 31 December). I\u2019m reminded of Steinbeck\u2019s great novel The Grapes of Wrath, based on the migration within the United States in the 1930s, in which people were forced to flee a hopeless existence in search of a better life. Those migrants too were often exploited, reviled and dehumanised. Most people read the novel and sympathise enormously with the Joads and their fellow refugees. Yet we only need to change the time and geography and that understanding and sympathy vanishes. Robin Prior Bristol \u2022 In 1958, aged 10, I stood on the beach in Vlissingen with my Auntie Julie. She talked to me about the day in October 1914 when, as a five-year-old refugee from Antwerp, she had crossed the Channel in \u201ca very small boat\u201d with her mother, brother and sister. She had been very scared \u2013 the boat was so small and her father had been left behind. In Britain they were housed, fed and resettled, and my grandfather was able to rejoin them. In 1914, while mobilising for war, Britain took in and helped some 250,000 refugees. In 2018, a few hundred are a \u201ccrisis\u201d.

It just summed up winter: \u201cDecember: A lot of people doing the pub wrong. January: A lot of people doing the gym wrong. February: Pancakes.\u201d Amateurs ruin everything until pancakes, in which we are all amateurs. It\u2019s too late for a discourse on pub etiquette, which is moot, anyway. The main way to do the pub wrong is to get too drunk and sloppy. But the seasoned drinker only pretends to mind: really, we see you as learner drivers, a darned nuisance but necessary, if we want to bring up the next generation of binge drinkers. With gyms, however, there is so much to get wrong. You mix up miles and kilometres and hurl yourself off a treadmill. Everything you pick up will be too heavy, unless it\u2019s tiny, and you look ridiculous \u2013 like a giant exercising. Your kit looks like pyjamas because that\u2019s what it was until this morning, your trainers were made before training was invented and you\u2019re using your arms on a leg machine. And please God tell me you haven\u2019t wandered into a class without checking whether it was pump or zumba. Even in the moments between each egregious error, you have a squirrelly, hunted look, because you can\u2019t stop \u2013 there is nothing more suspicious, more scorned, than inactivity in a gym. But you also know that, whatever you do next, it will involve toning your elbow while improving the flexibility of your arse. Your best hope is that nobody\u2019s watching, but this is the greatest of your vanities. The regulars are scoping your every move, they\u2019re waiting till you get something so wrong they can report you, even if only to one another. They loathe you, but it\u2019s not your fault, except in the sense that the gym is now too full because you are in it. The only way to get a gym right in January is to go at 2am.",

      "body": "<h2>ANOTHER YEAR OVER AND A NEW ONE JUST BEGUN</h2> <p>The last year was one of false promises. England were meant to crash out earlier in the Ethics World Cup and ended up doing rather well. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said in October he had received \u201cenquiries from all of the world\u201d for his services and \u201cwill start work again on 1 January\u201d. Yet here we are, 2 January, and the Frenchman is still paying for his own petrol. Weird Uncle Fiver promised to lay off Purple Tin on Christmas morning. The state of them.</p> <p>A million and one promises were broken, but 2019 is a new dawn. It feels like, should the world somehow not cave in on 29 March, anything could happen. Nineteen is a special number, after all: it was Lionel Messi\u2019s old number, The Fiver\u2019s favourite golf hole and Adele\u2019s debut album. What a banger Chasing Pavements is. And so, with hope in our heart and a scratchcard in our pocket, here is a list of things The Fiver promises will absolutely, categorically happen in 2019:</p> <p><strong>January:</strong> Spurs\u2019 title challenge collapses again just moments after Heung-min Son boards a plane bound for the Asia Cup. It\u2019s the hope that kills you, Spurs fans. When will you learn?</p> <p><strong>February:</strong> Wales manager Ryan Giggs attends a match that has a Welsh person playing in it. Wayne Hennessey concedes five as Crystal Palace lose to \u2013 you guessed it, reader \u2013 Manchester United.</p> <p><strong>March:</strong> The rising cost of convincing electricians to leave their underground bunkers to fit trendy, vintage-style lightbulbs means Tottenham\u2019s first official match at their new stadium is pushed back to 2052. </p> <p><strong>April:</strong> The Fiver is on time for an unprecedented two consecutive days. OK, one.</p> <p><strong>May:</strong> Manchester City win the Premier League. Obviously.</p> <p><strong>June:</strong> The Big Cup final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich is relocated to Buenos Aires on security grounds. Football editors scramble to find anybody connected with the 1999 final for #context and #narrative. Jonathan Greening finds vast media work. Bayern win 2-1 in injury-time and both Samuel Kuffour and Oliver Kahn send Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r smug texts. Kahn spells schadenfreude incorrectly.</p> <p><strong>July:</strong> England romp to a 4-1 victory over Germany in the Women\u2019s World Cup final. Phil Neville is knighted and given Kieran Trippier\u2019s parking space at the Bury Lidl.</p> <p><strong>August:</strong> Having received compensation for the outgoing Rafa Ben\u00edtez, Mike Ashley promises Newcastle United manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u201ca war chest\u201d to buy two much-needed centre-backs for the upcoming Championship season. Said funds never arrive, but Ricardo Carvalho does. Alan Pardew is into the final year of his eight-year contract.</p> <p><strong>September:</strong> Christian Pulisic struggles for form with Chelsea after failing to settle in London, despite a great day out at Madame Tussauds.</p> <p><strong>October:</strong> Geoff Shreeves asks a pertinent question.</p> <p><strong>November:</strong> Manchester City sign Raheem Sterling\u2019s two-year-old son on a pre-contract agreement.</p> <p><strong>December:</strong> Juve\u2019s Aaron Ramsey is second in the Ballon d\u2019Or. Arsenal end the year in the Big Vase places.

      "bodyText": "ANOTHER YEAR OVER AND A NEW ONE JUST BEGUN The last year was one of false promises. England were meant to crash out earlier in the Ethics World Cup and ended up doing rather well. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said in October he had received \u201cenquiries from all of the world\u201d for his services and \u201cwill start work again on 1 January\u201d. Yet here we are, 2 January, and the Frenchman is still paying for his own petrol. Weird Uncle Fiver promised to lay off Purple Tin on Christmas morning. The state of them. A million and one promises were broken, but 2019 is a new dawn. It feels like, should the world somehow not cave in on 29 March, anything could happen. Nineteen is a special number, after all: it was Lionel Messi\u2019s old number, The Fiver\u2019s favourite golf hole and Adele\u2019s debut album. What a banger Chasing Pavements is. And so, with hope in our heart and a scratchcard in our pocket, here is a list of things The Fiver promises will absolutely, categorically happen in 2019: January: Spurs\u2019 title challenge collapses again just moments after Heung-min Son boards a plane bound for the Asia Cup. It\u2019s the hope that kills you, Spurs fans. When will you learn? February: Wales manager Ryan Giggs attends a match that has a Welsh person playing in it. Wayne Hennessey concedes five as Crystal Palace lose to \u2013 you guessed it, reader \u2013 Manchester United. March: The rising cost of convincing electricians to leave their underground bunkers to fit trendy, vintage-style lightbulbs means Tottenham\u2019s first official match at their new stadium is pushed back to 2052. April: The Fiver is on time for an unprecedented two consecutive days. OK, one. May: Manchester City win the Premier League. Obviously. June: The Big Cup final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich is relocated to Buenos Aires on security grounds. Football editors scramble to find anybody connected with the 1999 final for #context and #narrative. Jonathan Greening finds vast media work. Bayern win 2-1 in injury-time and both Samuel Kuffour and Oliver Kahn send Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r smug texts. Kahn spells schadenfreude incorrectly. July: England romp to a 4-1 victory over Germany in the Women\u2019s World Cup final. Phil Neville is knighted and given Kieran Trippier\u2019s parking space at the Bury Lidl. August: Having received compensation for the outgoing Rafa Ben\u00edtez, Mike Ashley promises Newcastle United manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u201ca war chest\u201d to buy two much-needed centre-backs for the upcoming Championship season. Said funds never arrive, but Ricardo Carvalho does. Alan Pardew is into the final year of his eight-year contract. September: Christian Pulisic struggles for form with Chelsea after failing to settle in London, despite a great day out at Madame Tussauds. October: Geoff Shreeves asks a pertinent question. November: Manchester City sign Raheem Sterling\u2019s two-year-old son on a pre-contract agreement. December: Juve\u2019s Aaron Ramsey is second in the Ballon d\u2019Or. Arsenal end the year in the Big Vase places. Everything is right with the world. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Newcastle United 1-2 Manchester United, while Michael Butler will be on hand for the rest of the day\u2019s Premier League action. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe have decided to accept an extremely lucrative bid by Chelsea, given the low contract maturity\u201d \u2013 Borussia Dortmund suit Michael Zorc after the Bundesliga leaders trousered \u00a358m for Christian Pulisic, who will move in the summer. RECOMMENDED LOOKING David Squires fears it\u2019s almost time for another routinely dystopian Home Office information video. He also did this over the festive break.

Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Rollover. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Cardiff City are investigating a complaint made against their Under-18s coach Craig Bellamy. Vegetable sales in south Yorkshire could be due a spike: former Sheffield United boss Steve Bruce is the new manager of Sheffield Wednesday. J\u00fcrgen Klopp reckons Manchester City remain the best team in the world despite their recent slump. And, presumably, for never winning a competition that would render them best team in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s 100% my opinion because of the way they play, the things they achieved, the ability and all that stuff,\u201d he roared. Kevin De Bruyne is back in contention for Manchester City\u2019s Premier League showdown with Liverpool on Thursday. Juventus are fluttering their eyes in the direction of Arsenal\u2019s Aaron Ramsey. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player, we really like him,\u201d purred Juve suit Fabio Paratici.

In May 1954 he agreed to open an office in South Africa, where he and Michael Lewis developed a specialism in tall structures for telecommunications, culminating in the Albert Hertzog tower (now the Sentech tower) in Brixton, a suburb of Johannesburg, an influence on Arup\u2019s later television mast at Emley Moor, Yorkshire (1969-71). However, the political environment worsened all the time and they returned to London in 1961. Within two weeks, Zunz was working on the Sydney Opera House and quickly realised how to make the folding plates work. He was always eager to acknowledge that it was a team effort, in which he encouraged younger engineers such as Peter Rice and Tony Fitzpatrick, who themselves went on to enjoy brilliant careers with Arup. Zunz became chair of Ove Arup and Partners in 1977 and was co-chair of the Arup Partnership from 1984 until 1989. He was knighted in 1989, the year of his retirement and a year after he had received the gold medal of the Institute of Structural Engineers. Marion died in a skiing accident in 1992. Zunz is survived by Babs, Laura and Leslie. \u2022 Gerhard Jacob (Jack) Zunz, civil engineer, born 25 December 1923; died 11 December 2018",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers have received the equivalent of more than \u00a330,000 in total for recycling plastic bottles in the first supermarket trial using \u201creverse vending machines\u201d installed to reduce littering. The machines, introduced last year by the Iceland chain at five UK sites, reward consumers with a voucher worth 10p for every deposit of a bottle purchased at the shops. Iceland, a frozen food specialist, said figures published Wednesday suggested the trial had delivered \u201csignificant results\u201d and strong consumer engagement, with 311,500 plastic bottles recycled so far. In November alone a daily average of 2,583 bottles were recycled across the five sites, with an average of \u00a3250 in coupons refunded each day. Iceland was the first UK supermarket to install such machines in support of the government\u2019s proposed deposit return scheme in England \u2013 which expects retailers to be responsible for properly recycling the containers \u2013 and in line with its own efforts to reduce the impact of single-use plastics on the environment. Its trial involved a machine in each of four stores in Wolverhampton, Mold, Fulham and Musselburgh (covering England, Wales and Scotland) as well as at Iceland\u2019s head office, in Deeside. Richard Walker, Iceland\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cIceland has continually led the way in the fight against the scourge of plastic since making our announcement to eliminate plastic from our own-label product packaging. \u201cThe launch of reverse vending machine trials in our stores is one sign of this.

Pressure is growing on the government, retailers and consumers to increase rates of plastic bottle recycling and so reduce marine pollution. In October the environment secretary, Michael Gove, said he was committed to \u201cworking with industry to see how we could introduce a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles\u201d. The UK\u2019s largest supermarket, Tesco, is also carrying out a trial, as are Morrisons and the Co-op, but none have yet published their results. Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe success of Iceland\u2019s reverse vending machine trial demonstrates that deposit return schemes to boost recycling and tackle plastic pollution are both popular with consumers and eminently doable.

      "bodyText": "Shares have fallen in the US, Europe and Asia as the pre-holiday sell-off resumed following weak Chinese manufacturing data \u2013 renewing the focus on fears that the global economy will weaken in 2019. In London the FTSE 100 has rebounded from steeper losses earlier in the day. The blue-chip index is now down by 0.3%. The mid-cap FTSE 250 is down by 0.1%. Germany\u2019s Dax lost 0.3% as well, but France\u2019s Cac 40 remained down by around 1.3% In the US major indices also fell. The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average both lost 1.3% at the time of writing, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.2%. Tesla was among the biggest fallers in early trading after missing analyst forecasts on product deliveries. US manufacturing survey data just released adds to the negative picture painted by today\u2019s Chinese manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI). US new order growth eased to a 15-month low, IHS Markit said. For the full implications of the Chinese manufacturing weakness, Martin Farrer\u2019s report from earlier today is here: And, in a bumper day for manufacturing data, the UK PMI survey confirmed that stockpiling ahead of Brexit is going full throttle. It may be providing a short-term boost to the British economy, but economists warned that any long-term gain is likely to be illusory. Richard Partington has the story here: Thanks for reading \u2013 and a belated happy new year. JJ In the first few minutes of trading on Wall Street in 2019 the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.4%, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped by more than 350 points, or 1.6%. US markets fell to their biggest annual loss since 2008 during the course of 2018, and started 2019 on a similar footing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped by 1.8%. In case anyone thought that the new year\u2019s eve bounce on US stock markets was a good sign, Allianz\u2019s chief economic adviser: Approaching the US open and futures are still pointing to a painful session for investors in American companies. S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average futures are both down by 1.6%. Nasdaq futures are down by 2.2%. Tesla has disappointed analysts after it reported that production in the final quarter of 2018 \u2013 at nearly 1,000 vehicles per day \u2013 came in lower than market expectations. The electric car maker founded by Elon Musk produced 86,555 vehicles in the three months to the end of the year, up 15% compared to the previous quarter. Shares fell by around 7% in pre-market trading. Tesla is in a race to ramp up production of its cars \u2013 even erecting a giant tent to fit more machines. It increased deliveries by 8% to 90,700. Sterling is now down by more than 1% today \u2013 the holiday has done little to add any festive cheer with Brexit ahead. \u201cThe pound\u2019s cheap, but for excellent reasons,\u201d notes Kit Juckes, chief global foreign exchange strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cFX is [currently] a battle between a host of unloved currencies to see which is worst.\u201d To add to the risk-off sentiment, German bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen to their lowest since November 2019 as investors fly to the safety of Bunds. The yield on the 10-year Bund has fallen by basis points today. Good news for vegans in search of reasonably priced hot snacks: bakery chain Greggs is planning to launch a no-animal-products sausage roll this week. Greggs, the UK\u2019s largest bakery chain, already sells 1.5m pork sausage rolls every week, but now customers will have the option of a Quorn filling and vegetable oil puff pastry, reports Rebecca Smithers. The product will arrive on Greggs\u2019s shelves at the start of Veganuary \u2013 a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. After a painful first morning of 2019, at lunchtime the sell-off has eased somewhat across Europe\u2019s main stock markets \u2013 although there is still a sea of red. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.66%, in line with the mid-cap companies on the FTSE 250. Next and Ocado continue to hold up the top end of the FTSE 100. On Germany\u2019s Dax shares are down by only 0.2%, while the earlier heavy losses on France\u2019s Cac 40 have eased to1.3%. Here\u2019s more detail on manufacturing firms\u2019 Brexit stockpiling: In a sign of mounting stress for the British economy as the impasse in Westminster over Brexit continues, the stockpiling of finished goods increased at the second-fastest rate since 1992, writes Richard Partington. Stockpiling has extended across multiple sectors, from cheesemakers to drugmakers via jet engine manufacturers. Read the full report here: US markets are expected to follow Europe down, according to futures prices an hour and a half before the opening bell. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down by 1.2%. A fall in Chinese demand, as evidenced by the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) reading from earlier in the day, could have significant consequences for the US\u2019s giant multinationals. Investor sentiment in the US has been dented in recent months by the threat of an escalation of a trade war between the US and China as well as rising borrowing costs and political gridlock in Washington. There are few positive signs for stocks going into 2019 on either side of the Atlantic, according to Jeremy Leach, chief executive at investment firm Managing Partners Group. Key drivers of an equities bear market will be Brexit uncertainty, further tightening of monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic, political gridlock and trade tensions \u2013 all forcing equity values lower in the UK, Europe and the USA. John Lewis\u2019s enjoyed a strong finish to a rollercoaster Christmas trading period banking a bumper sales fortnight as shoppers made a late dash to the shops, writes Zoe Wood. Fashion, beauty and leisure and technology all performed well \u2013 although it will be a while yet before the company reveals whether those sales came at the expense of profits if discounting was too heavy. Some nice perspective on the rail fares rises here from Sky\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is the most widely used measure of the cost of living. Particularly since the financial crisis wage growth has stagnated, making these above-inflation increases even more painful for commuters. Gold prices have hit a six-month high as the equity sell-off prompts investors to look for safe havens. Spot prices for the yellow metal hit highs of $1,288.66 per ounce on Wednesday, the highest since June 2018. Economists at Swiss investment bank UBS predict that gold\u2019s value could be dented by a rising dollar in the first half of the year thanks to rising US interest rates. However, they added: \u201cas 2019 proceeds, a weaker dollar, higher equity market volatility, and signs that the Fed is nearing the end of its hiking cycle should act as tailwinds for gold.\u201d The new year festivities always come with a painful hangover: rail fare rises. Commuters across the country have today staged protests as fares rise by 3.1%. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was at Kings Cross station this morning alongside union activists, reiterating his call for the nationalisation of the rail network. Transport secretary Chris Grayling blamed union demands for higher pay for the fare increases. You can find much more detail here: The Brexit stockpiling boost to the manufacturing sector has failed to cheer up currency traders, who have sold off the pound against the US dollar. Sterling is now down by 0.6% today, and has fallen further since the data was released. Much of Britain may have had something of a break from Brexit during the past few days, but \u201cBrexit cannot help but remain the key driving force for sterling\u201d in the next few weeks, with the vote on Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal due in the third week of January, according to Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. Downing Street still appears hopeful it can get the deal through parliament, despite continued opposition from many Conservative party MPs as well as other opposition parties. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt today suggested the deal is still alive after a speech in Singapore. He said: When Theresa May comes back with those reassurances that she has been seeking from the EU that the deal that is on the table is not going to lead to us being permanently trapped in the customs union ... she will find a way to get this deal through parliament. Some more reaction to the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI data. The main verdict? While the headline may look encouraging, be wary. The marked increase was driven by stockpiling of goods and raw materials in preparation for possible disruption if there is no Brexit deal by 29 March. Stocks built now will have to be run down eventually, potentially lowering demand in future months. Stockpiling is \u201cnot necessarily a boon for UK growth\u201d, said James Smith, an economist at ING. He added: It\u2019s worth remembering that the manufacturing sector makes up a relatively limited share of economic output \u2013 around 10% of GDP. More importantly, warehousing is in relatively short supply, leaving firms with fairly limited scope to boost inventories. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: \u201cUK GDP growth is likely to have slowed markedly to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter from 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.\u201d He added: \u201cConditions currently look challenging at home for manufacturers \u2013 notably heightened business caution over investment and expenditure on capital goods amid significant uncertainties, particularly Brexit.\u201d Francesco Arcangeli, economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, said: \u201cWhile the headline figure might suggest industry has out its foot on the accelerator at the start of the year, the detail confirms that the rush to stockpile goods ahead of Brexit and the potential disruption from a no-deal scenario is now in full swing. The absence of any New Year joy from the European PMI data also confirms that the near future holds a bumpy ride for UK manufacturers. Department store chain John Lewis has reported that sales rose by 4.5% in the week to 29 December, while sales at its Waitrose supermarket surged by 19.2%. The firm is one of the first major British retailers to reveal its Christmas performance, at a time when analysts are nervously looking out for more pain on the high street. John Lewis hailed \u201cvery strong sales on Christmas Eve and a confident start to clearance sales both online and in shops\u201d, in its latest sales update. Fashion sales were up 10.7% on last year, with the firm citing strong sales in women\u2019s cashmere, up 10%, and women\u2019s accessories, up 21.5%. The Christmas gift ranges also performed well, with gift cook and dine up 25% and gift food sales more than doubling. The firm had previously reported record sales in the Black Friday week in November. A quick check-up on the FTSE 100 after the manufacturing data beat expectations: the sell-off has slowed slightly, but miners remain under pressure. The benchmark index is now down by around 60 points, or 0.9%, with betting company GVC Holdings and grocery logistics company Ocado vying for the top spot \u2013 both are up by around 2.6%. Next shares are now up by 1.8%. There\u2019s some pain for miners, particularly exposed to lower demand in China, and financials, which are among the most sensitive stocks to the business cyle. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have lost around 2.6% each, but Glencore, Antofagasta, Anglo American and BHP have all lost more than 4%. ITV\u2019s chief financial officer stepped down from the board on new year\u2019s eve. The FTSE 100 broadcaster had announced in June that Ian Griffiths, who also held the role of chief operating officer, would retire within 12 months. Griffiths will leave ITV completely on 31 March 2019. Brexit uncertainty may actually be helping British factories weather slowing global growth \u2013 although it is an irony not many major manufacturers would appreciate. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe pick-up in the PMI in December suggests that preparations for Brexit are helping manufacturers to keep their heads above water during the current global slowdown.\u201d However, he noted that the boost now will likely be matched by slower growth later. December\u2019s PMI doesn\u2019t alter our view that the manufacturing sector will struggle over the coming months and that GDP growth will be well below-trend in Q4 and Q1; we expect quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Factories are stockpiling the raw materials they need for their work as well as the products they sell as they prepare for possible disruption. The overall reading for British manufacturing showed the fastest expansion in six months for the sector. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s Brexit which is seen as the driving force. Growth in new orders rose to a 10-month high, with inflows from domestic and foreign buyers. IHS Markit said: Manufacturers linked increases in both domestic and overseas demand to clients purchasing to build up safety stocks to mitigate potential Brexit disruption. The stockpiling prompted the second fastest increase in the stocks of finished products held by manufacturers since the survey began in 1992. Although the headline reading is encouraging, IHS Markit reported that the fourth-quarter average reading was the weakest since the third quarter of 2016 (immediately after a certain referendum result was announced). It\u2019s also worth noting that IHS Markit revised up their November reading to 53.6, not 53.1 as previously reported. UK manufacturing activity came in significantly higher than expected at the end of 2018 thanks in part to a steep rise in stockpiling ahead of Brexit, according to a closely followed survey. The manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 54.2 in December, up from 53.1 in November, data firm IHS Markit reported. Economists had expected a slowdown to 52.5. IHS Markit said: The rise in the PMI level during December was mainly driven by stronger inflows of new business and a solid increase in stocks of purchases. Movements in both mainly reflected Brexit preparations by manufacturers and their clients. The European Central Bank has been busy celebrating 20 years of the euro this new year, but today it was forced to announce less pleasant news: Italian lender Banca Carige has been put in administration. Three temporary administrators and a three-member surveillance committee will take charge of Banca Carige and replace its board \u2013 who resigned en masse today. The plan will be a \u201ctemporary administration\u201d, the ECB said. The bank last month failed to raise \u20ac400m in emergency cash for a rescue plan. Eurozone manufacturing activity has fallen back from boom time a year ago to \u201cnear stagnation\u201d now, according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. December saw the third consecutive drop in new orders, in an onimous sign for the eurozone economy. Williamson said: The weakness of the recent survey data in fact raises the possibility that the goods producing sector could even act as a drag on the overall economy in the fourth quarter, representing a marked contrast to the growth surge seen this time last year. The last three months of 2018 saw manufacturers report the worst quarterly performance in terms of production since the second quarter of 2013. The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 51.4 in December, the lowest since February 2016. There is likely to be little relief for European stocks from manufacturing figures, with IHS Markit\u2019s barometer coming in at the consensus, but with a notably weak reading for future output. The forward-looking reading fell to its worst in six years. At the other end of the scale, there\u2019s Debenhams. The department store is one of the most shorted shares on the London Stock Exchange. That bet would have paid off handsomely over the last year: shares were worth 35p a year ago; now you\u2019ll pay only 4.8p after another 6% slide today. An interesting and unlikely top gainer amid a steep FTSE 100 sell-off: a British retailer. Next is the second top riser amid London\u2019s blue-chip stocks, with a 0.6% gain. Retailers endured one of the worst years since the financial crisis in 2018, as Brexit uncertainties piled on top of fundamental changes to shoppers\u2019 habits. However, Next has resisted the urge to pile up discounts in search of large volumes. Analysts are split as to whether the strategy will work, with some betting that performance over the crucial Christmas period will surprise on the upside. Next is due to update the market tomorrow. We seem to be set for a bad day across the eurozone as well \u2013 unless manufacturing data can give investors some cause for excitement. It\u2019s a sea of red across European markets, with France\u2019s Cac 40 suffering a particularly nasty 2.3% sell-off. The FTSE 100 is now down by 1.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax index has lost 1.2%. And it\u2019s an unhappy new year from the FTSE 100 too, with more than 100 points knocked off at the open. Here\u2019s more detail on what is already shaping up to be the big story of 2019: whether global growth is dragged back by a slowdown in China. Today\u2019s Chinese data underline concerns that the world\u2019s second largest economy is \u201cheading for a tough 12 months\u201d, writes Martin Farrer in his report. Japan\u2019s markets were closed for a holiday, but the pain has been felt elsewhere, with other Asian markets in the red. The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy, lost 0.6% as it plunged as low as US70.05 cents. It was the currency\u2019s lowest level since January 2016. Happy new year, and welcome to the first business live blog of 2019, with rolling coverage of the world economy, financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe are set to start the year as they finished the last one \u2013 with a slump \u2013 following the lead of Asian markets which were under the cosh. Shares in Hong Kong fell by 2.7%, while those in Shanghai lose 1.2% and the ASX 200 benchmark closed down 1.6% in Sydney. The Caixin purchasing managers index (PMI) fell from 50.2 in November to 49.7 in December, below the 50 no-change mark for the first time since May 2017. New orders also fell, for the first time since June 2016. The data suggest there will be little let-up in the slowdown, according to Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: The report implies deteriorating demand, with production likely to reflect that in coming months. Leading indicators suggest that activity is unlikely to begin a recovery until the second half. The fall in demand has been at least partly blamed on fears that the trade war between the US and China pursued by US President Donald Trump has started to hurt demand. However, trade war aside, markets could be boosted following signs that Trump may be willing to finally act to reopen the US government. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: \u201cNews that Trump was reaching out to Congress to help end the partial government shutdown, provided some optimism to traders overnight.\u201d The British and European manufacturing sectors will also be in the spotlight this morning, with PMI figures due this morning. In the UK economists are expecting a slight slowdown from the relatively strong expansion seen in November, when the index hit 53.1 \u2013 but for the index to show continued expansion in output. The agenda: 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI 9:30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI 3pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI",

But hold on: wouldn\u2019t a dry December app be a better idea than a January one? It\u2019s during that month, after all, that people can far exceed the recommended daily allowance.

And so it came to pass: the season of gorging, gouging and guilting was born. God bless us, every one. But what none of these visionaries foresaw is that January, February and most likely March are at least as dismal weather-wise and otherwise as December. They couldn\u2019t have envisaged that the need for cheering up the populace doesn\u2019t stop at the conclusion of the three most harrowing words in the English language: Jools Holland\u2019s Hootenanny. They couldn\u2019t have known that, in 2019, rail prices would go up 3.1% from 2 January. Still less did the ancients foretell that Theresa May would postpone parliament\u2019s vote on her EU withdrawal agreement until the week of 14 January, almost as if she and her lackeys had planned to maximise already rampant levels of seasonal affective disorder. In such depressing circumstances, what we need is comfort and soothing. Instead, though, we\u2019re exhorted to jump off a dietary cliff, to go cold turkey after weeks of eating cold turkey, to submit to ye venerable ritual of self-administered punishment to atone for ye presumed seasonal sins. We\u2019re enjoined to do ostensibly improving things: give up alcohol; strip down to our pants and get shouted at by British Military Fitness in the park; put the Hobnobs back on the supermarket shelves; enrol for grade 3 bassoon; join a book club reading Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. I\u2019m no doctor \u2013 but surely, just as it\u2019s madness to stop taking antidepressants suddenly rather than weaning oneself off them, so it is folly to give up booze and biscuits in January if you were enjoying them only hours earlier. One in 10 Britons who drink alcohol, though, are expected to give it up this month, many of them having downloaded Alcohol Change UK\u2019s Dry January app that lets you track the units, calories and money saved by not drinking. The charity\u2019s website includes inspiring stories, such as the woman who went on a journey from boozing to dry January to running the New York marathon. If these initiatives help us save money (apparently the average Briton spends \u00a350,000 on alcohol during a lifetime), lose weight, sleep better, reduce the strain on the NHS, improve our complexions and raise money for cancer research, that\u2019s all good. But hold on: wouldn\u2019t a dry December app be a better idea than a January one? It\u2019s during that month, after all, that people can far exceed the recommended daily allowance. Some figures put the average Briton drinking 67 units of alcohol a week, and a recent study found young Brits drank 26 units of alcohol a day over the festive period. It\u2019s then that we need to resist the social pressure to drink \u2013 possibly by means of an app I\u2019m thinking of developing that will administer electric shocks of increasing intensity as your blood-alcohol ratio gets higher. Lauren Booker, author of Try Dry: The Official Guide to a Month off Booze, recommends you clear out your alcohol for January. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to pour it down the drain,\u201d she counsels. \u201cEither lock it away in the shed so you\u2019re not tempted, or ask a friend if you can leave it at their house until the end of the month.\u201d And then what? On 1 February, after the seasonal ceasefire, you can resume the war on your liver. That\u2019s the risk \u2013 that for all those inspired by dry January to give up binge drinking and become marathon runners, many more will undergo a short-term purge that will have negligible long-term benefits. What\u2019s needed is not the crazy switchback from drunk December to dry January, the booze equivalent of yo-yo dieting. We need to learn not the virtue of short-term abstinence, nor to desperately hope that a month off the pop will catalyse a lifestyle revolution, but something much harder \u2013 the way of moderation. But the prevailing rhetoric goes another way. \u201cCan you go dry this January?\u201d asks Cancer Research. \u201cTake on the ultimate test of willpower by going booze-free for a whole 31 days and raise vital funds to help beat cancer.\u201d Like the bushtucker trial, it\u2019s a gauntlet I refuse to pick up. I\u2019ll give money to charity, but not narrow my lifestyle options. Almost a century ago, TS Eliot said, \u201cApril is the cruellest month.\u201d Maybe it was back then, but nowadays it\u2019s January. So it\u2019s time to fight back, and to make this month not the time for sadomasochistic rituals like Cancer Research\u2019s Dryathlon, but for Jaffa Cakes dunked in dessert wine. \u2022 Stuart Jeffries is a freelance feature writer \u2022 This article was amended on 3 and 7 January 2019 to give further information about estimates of alcohol consumption over the festive period.",

This is for you.\u2019\u201d Much of Linton\u2019s work has touched on who she is and where she comes from, with her forthcoming Windrush films a tribute to her mixed British Caribbean heritage. \u201cMy dad is from Guyana, and he sat me and my brother down [as children] and was like, \u2018You are black, the world will see you as black.\u2019\u201d The Windrush scandal is something that has affected her deeply. \u201cI spoke to theatre people, saying, \u2018Why are we not responding to this? Why are we not in the streets marching?\u2019 They\u2019re sending families home. It makes me feel sick.\u201d Linton\u2019s voice shakes a little. \u201cEven now, it chokes me. The people they\u2019re targeting are elders, man. People are having heart attacks and have died because of this.\u201d Still, her films \u2013 which are to be screened at the Royal Court in London \u2013 will have \u201ca massive celebration at the core. It was really important to me that we took over a building and celebrated West Indian culture.\u201d Perhaps the biggest departure for Linton, who has worked almost exclusively in new writing, will be co-directing Richard II at the Globe in February. \u201cI wanted to do Shakespeare because I\u2019m scared of Shakespeare. I was an English student, so I love studying the words on the page, but watching it? I\u2019ve always felt Shakespeare is not for me.\u201d There\u2019s a hope her Richard II will reach out to diverse audiences but also highlight a diversity of talent behind the scenes. Both the cast and crew are all women of colour, a deliberate move. \u201cThere are incredible women of colour stage managers, choreographers, fight directors, designers, photographers, [and] we\u2019ve got them all. But also it\u2019s like someone tweeted about Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 if she can find 50 black women violinists, why can\u2019t everyone? We\u2019re chatting and chatting, but nothing\u2019s happening.\u201d She pauses, corrects herself. \u201cThings are happening! But not fast enough.\u201d On the day we meet, Linton has just finished her first full run of Sweat. She has been working flat out. \u201cOn Monday, I was in rehearsal for Sweat, then at lunchtime did a model box for Richard, then went straight back into Sweat, and had to talk about Bush in the evening. My brain is fried.\u201d Currently, she\u2019s feeling \u201cmuch more excited than terrified \u2026 going into that building [the Bush], I\u2019m going to take risks\u201d. Still, her career as a freelance director and writer has been taking off. Why apply to run the Bush? She quotes Baldwin: \u201cThe place in which I\u2019ll fit will not exist until I make it\u201d, a line she keeps on the front of her notepad. \u201cI went for the building because being an artistic director was my end goal. One of the key things about theatre is making sure the building is welcoming, and that starts with the people that are running it. There\u2019s been so many times in the years I\u2019ve been working in this industry, where I\u2019ve walked into a building and gone: \u2018I\u2019m not supposed to be here.\u2019 That starts at the top. And until we\u2019re running the top \u2026\u201d she trails off. Who is we? \u201cI\u2019m talking about people of colour. I\u2019m talking about people from working-class backgrounds. I\u2019m talking about women. I\u2019m talking about myself.\u201d Sweat is at the Donmar, London, until 26 January. Richard II is at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, London, 22 February-21 April. More on the Royal Court\u2019s Windrush Celebration.",

Takings for the nostalgic sequel declined by a slim 10% from its debut, and have reached a robust \u00a323.2m after 10 days of play. With kids still on holiday, the nanny-themed musical should continue to play strongly every day until schools open again.</p> <p>The only negative for cinema operators and the film\u2019s distributor, Disney, is any comparison with the big release from a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi-review-episode-viii-rian-johnson\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a>. The blockbuster space adventure had grossed \u00a350.7m after two weekends of play, on its way to an \u00a382.7m total. Mary Poppins Returns should enjoy a slower decline, but \u00a350m looks a more realistic target.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcwmDAYt22k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lcwmDAYt22k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>The runner-up: Bumblebee</h2> <p>Paramount enjoyed a strong run at UK cinemas with its Transformers franchise beginning in 2007, but ran into trouble in 2017 when the fifth entry in the series, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/21/transformers-the-last-knight-review-as-tinnitus-inducingly-pointless-as-ever-michael-bay\">Transformers: The Last Knight</a>, grossed less than half of any of the previous films, limping home with a \u00a39.54m UK total.</p> <p>Clearly a refresh was needed, hence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/09/bumblebee-review-transformers-spinoff-that-dumps-bayhem-for-old-school-spirit\">Bumblebee</a>, the first Transformers film not directed by Michael Bay, and the first with a female human protagonist. At first glance, the numbers look encouraging, with a \u00a35.10m debut. However, Bumblebee grossed a slimmer \u00a32.47m for the weekend period, and benefited overall from extensive previews.

      "bodyText": "The winner: Mary Poppins Returns With \u00a37.44m from an ultra-wide distribution to 740 cinemas, Mary Poppins Returns was the clear winner of the UK box office on the final weekend of 2018. Takings for the nostalgic sequel declined by a slim 10% from its debut, and have reached a robust \u00a323.2m after 10 days of play. With kids still on holiday, the nanny-themed musical should continue to play strongly every day until schools open again. The only negative for cinema operators and the film\u2019s distributor, Disney, is any comparison with the big release from a year ago, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The blockbuster space adventure had grossed \u00a350.7m after two weekends of play, on its way to an \u00a382.7m total. Mary Poppins Returns should enjoy a slower decline, but \u00a350m looks a more realistic target. The runner-up: Bumblebee Paramount enjoyed a strong run at UK cinemas with its Transformers franchise beginning in 2007, but ran into trouble in 2017 when the fifth entry in the series, Transformers: The Last Knight, grossed less than half of any of the previous films, limping home with a \u00a39.54m UK total. Clearly a refresh was needed, hence Bumblebee, the first Transformers film not directed by Michael Bay, and the first with a female human protagonist. At first glance, the numbers look encouraging, with a \u00a35.10m debut. However, Bumblebee grossed a slimmer \u00a32.47m for the weekend period, and benefited overall from extensive previews. For comparison, The Last Knight began with \u00a33.89m, and \u00a34.64m including previews. The takeaway is that even if Bumblebee ends up grossing a similar amount to The Last Knight, that\u2019s still better than a sixth Transformers movie would have done, given the trajectory of the franchise. And a reported production budget for Bumblebee of $135m is a significant discount on the $200m-plus cost of Bay\u2019s Transformers films. The disappointment: Holmes and Watson A year ago, the top comedy in the UK market was Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which opened the weekend before Christmas with \u00a38.15m including previews, on its way to a \u00a338.5m total. In 2018, the year has ended with a much weaker comedy: Holmes and Watson, starring Will Ferrell and John C Reilly. Comparisons with the family-friendly Jumanji reboot are perhaps a little unfair, but UK cinema operators will nevertheless be disappointed with Holmes and Watson\u2019s debut numbers: \u00a3864,000 for the weekend period, and \u00a31.42m including takings on December 26 and 27. Hollywood news site Deadline reports that Sony tried to sell off Holmes and Watson to Netflix after poor test scores, but the streaming giant didn\u2019t bite. The indie hit: Free Solo Most films showed strong traction at the weekend, with only modest declines, or even increases, at UK cinemas: Aquaman was up 2%, and animations Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Ralph Breaks the Internet posted rises of 2% and 20%, respectively. Bohemian Rhapsody did even better than that, rising 58%, but it was eclipsed by the documentary Free Solo, up a healthy 87%. Free Solo, which depicts an attempt by climber Alex Honnold to scale the sheer rock face of El Capitan in California\u2019s Yosemite national park without the help of ropes or safety gear, grossed \u00a3164,000 from 83 cinemas for its third weekend of play, delivering a 17-day total of \u00a3830,000. The film is clearly headed for \u00a31m-plus, which is a breakthrough for its modestly resourced UK distributor, Dogwoof. The market Thanks to the strong holds that existing titles have in the market, plus the arrival of Bumblebee, grosses are 25% up overall on the previous session. However, without a Star Wars film to boost numbers, takings are 13% down on the last weekend of 2017. Cinema operators enter 2019 with some trepidation. The flood of titles arriving in January for awards season seems to lack the big commercial hits equivalent to Darkest Hour last year and La La Land the year before. And this period was also boosted a year ago by an incredibly long and sustained run from The Greatest Showman. Instead, hopes are pinned currently on Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s quirky period comedy The Favourite, which opened on New Year\u2019s Day, and should deliver robust numbers for the Oscar and Bafta hopeful.

The ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Joanna Lumley and broadcast \u2013 about 90 minutes after it actually happens \u2013 on BBC ONE.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who votes for the Baftas?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Baftas are voted for by around 6,500 members of the British Film and Television Academy. These are industry workers who have to apply for membership \u2013 and pay an annual subscription of \u00a3450. Each category in the shortlists is decided by a chapter of around 100 specialists in that area. Once the shortlists are announced, all voters can have their say. If they haven't seen a particular film, they are supposed to abstain from voting in that category \u2013 but this is unenforced.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why do they matter? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Baftas matter on their own terms, third only to the Golden Globes and the Oscars as prestige gongs. A Bafta win adds critical kudos \u2013 and, hopefully, box office \u2013 to a film, as well as credibility to an individual's career. They also matter because of their proximity to the Oscars. Until 2001, the Baftas took place in April or May, but since the move to about a fortnight before the Academy Awards, their importance increased. This is because voting for the Oscars closes a few days after the Baftas, meaning it's the final chance for candidates to impress with their speeches - or for Oscar voters to seek to redress apparent miscarriages of justice. The Bafta and Oscar voting bases overlap considerably, too: around 500 people are thought to vote for both.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So do the big winners generally mirror each other?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not necessarily. A recent survey found the Baftas were only the fourth best Oscars bellwether \u2013 after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards. Since 2001, they've predicted the best picture winner eight times out of a possible 17, diverging the past four years running, opting for Three Billboards over The Shape of Water, La La Land over Moonlight, The Revenant&nbsp;over Spotlight and&nbsp;Boyhood&nbsp;over Birdman. Their form is stronger when it comes to the acting categories, though they do consistently favour homegrown talent.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do winners actually get? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A big bronze mask on a marble base, which Bafta reserves the right to buy back for \u00a31 should the recipient give it to anyone other than their children. Plus a certificate, with which the winner can do what they like.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Joanna Lumley will return as host of the British Academy film awards on 10 February.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Joanna has agreed to return as our host for a second year,\u201d said Emma Baehr, Bafta\u2019s director of awards. \u201cShe was fantastic and we\u2019re looking forward to the ceremony with her once again at the helm.\u201d</p> \n<p>The TV presenter and star of Absolutely Fabulous took over last year from Stephen Fry, though her turn at the podium was met with <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/joanna-lumley-bafta-hosting-reviews-mixed-fans_uk_5a8a0c7fe4b00bc49f45610b?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_cs=nxPX37N3O0J5JL2-U8SnZg\">mixed reviews</a>.

And unexpected challenges, such as bereavements or financial pressures, can test a relationship.</p> <p>You need to focus on keeping your relationship alive. As a counsellor, I always say to my clients: \u201cYou need to invest as much energy and time in your relationship as you do for anything else, whether it\u2019s your work, studies, children or friends.\u201d</p> <p>Schedule time together, for just the two of you. That might be date nights or weekends away, or it might be creating new interests together, such as rock climbing or going to gigs. A shared calendar is a good idea, so you are aware of the other person\u2019s schedule. And be considerate. If you\u2019re going out with friends after work, send your partner a message and let them know. It shows you\u2019re thinking of them.</p> <p>Think about how you\u2019re communicating with your partner. Does your partner often misunderstand what you\u2019re saying? Do you tend to leave issues unresolved? Unresolved issues have a tendency to mount up. Something that might not have started as a massive problem \u2013 your partner\u2019s chronic lateness, say \u2013 can become one if you don\u2019t discuss it.</p> <p>If you still end up arguing, try to see things from the other person\u2019s perspective. Most of us find that extremely hard.</p> <p>Ask your partner what makes them feel loved. Is it you cleaning their car? Taking the kids to the park on a Sunday so they can have a lie-in? Do it for them. Often, people need to hear verbal expressions of love. Tell them that you love them, unprompted. Give them a hug or bring them a cup of coffee. Little things like that make a huge difference.</p> <p>You should never try to change your partner\u2019s personality, because it was that personality that you fell in love with. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t identify behaviours you don\u2019t like. For example, if they are very impatient and always interrupt you when you\u2019re speaking, tell them: \u201cWhen you interrupt me, it makes me feel as if what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t important.\u201d You can\u2019t knock the impatience entirely out of their personality, but you can work on the interrupting.</p> <p>Try to recognise the positive things your partner does. You can fall into the habit of expecting them to be good to you, and complaining when they\u2019re not perfect. Take stock of the nice things they do.</p> <p>The main things that kill relationships are criticism, defensiveness, stonewalling and contempt. Defensiveness is often a response to previous criticism, so when you\u2019re communicating with your partner, be very careful that they don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re attacking their character. And vice versa: if your partner is annoyed at you for something you have done, try to hear what they are saying.</p> <p>Although communication is key, sometimes you need to bite your tongue. Perhaps the way your partner makes the bed really annoys you. Is there something wrong with the bed or is it that you have a way of doing things that you prefer? Even if you don\u2019t like how they have made the bed, they have made an effort to do it, so say thanks.</p> <p>Most people hate to schedule sex, but spontaneity doesn\u2019t always work. In the same way that you set aside time for the gym or hobbies, set aside time for sex \u2013 or, if that makes you uncomfortable, some form of physical intimacy. Say: \u201cOn Wednesday night we\u2019re going to get into bed together and just be close, even if it\u2019s only kissing, cuddling or massaging each other.\u201d That can lessen the pressure to perform.</p> <p>And if you\u2019re having sexual difficulties, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/18/erectile-dysfunction-performance-anxiety-truth-modern-malaise\" title=\"\">erectile dysfunction</a>, get some professional help. Don\u2019t think that going to a hotel for a dirty weekend will be a quick fix. If your sex life is basically good and you want to spice it up a little, then a hotel is great. But if you have got issues around sex, or more broadly in your relationship, a dirty weekend won\u2019t help, because you need to work on those issues first.</p> <p>If you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI\u2019d like to have sex with other people,\u201d think about how you can bring those desires into the relationship.

      "body": "<p>My father, Vivian Wyatt, who has died aged 92, was a respected microbiologist and educator.</p> <p>Throughout his career he focused on infectious diseases. In Malta and Gozo, he demonstrated a pattern of genetic susceptibility to the polio virus by matching medical records of historic polio epidemics in rural villages with church records of births, marriages and deaths. Of more practical impact was his campaign, working with doctors in India, against unnecessary placebo injections often given with unclean needles.</p> <p>Born in Plympton, Devon, to Emily (nee Phillips), a teacher, and Fred, a wireless operator during the first world war, Vivian went to Devonport high school before switching to Plymouth technical college, where, in 1944, he was a fire service volunteer during the bombing of Plymouth.</p> <p>A lifelong interest in teaching started in the Royal Army Educational Corps in the final stages of the second world war, when he was assigned, as a sergeant, to lecture soldiers on topics such as how society could be organised more fairly (he later joined the Labour party). Demobbed in 1948, he took a degree in zoology at Queen Mary College, London (now Queen Mary University), followed by a PhD in microbiology at St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>He was then a post-doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore (1957-59) before taking up a fellowship at Leeds University. He became a reader at the new Bradford University in 1962. In 1969 he spent two years at the <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/\" title=\"\">National Institutes of Health</a> in Maryland as a visiting scientist.</p> <p>He took early retirement in 1982, when his department at Bradford closed as part of university cuts.

      "bodyText": "My father, Vivian Wyatt, who has died aged 92, was a respected microbiologist and educator. Throughout his career he focused on infectious diseases. In Malta and Gozo, he demonstrated a pattern of genetic susceptibility to the polio virus by matching medical records of historic polio epidemics in rural villages with church records of births, marriages and deaths. Of more practical impact was his campaign, working with doctors in India, against unnecessary placebo injections often given with unclean needles. Born in Plympton, Devon, to Emily (nee Phillips), a teacher, and Fred, a wireless operator during the first world war, Vivian went to Devonport high school before switching to Plymouth technical college, where, in 1944, he was a fire service volunteer during the bombing of Plymouth. A lifelong interest in teaching started in the Royal Army Educational Corps in the final stages of the second world war, when he was assigned, as a sergeant, to lecture soldiers on topics such as how society could be organised more fairly (he later joined the Labour party). Demobbed in 1948, he took a degree in zoology at Queen Mary College, London (now Queen Mary University), followed by a PhD in microbiology at St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital. He was then a post-doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore (1957-59) before taking up a fellowship at Leeds University. He became a reader at the new Bradford University in 1962. In 1969 he spent two years at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland as a visiting scientist. He took early retirement in 1982, when his department at Bradford closed as part of university cuts. Nonetheless his historical and epidemiological research continued for the next 30 years, funded by his pension and small grants. He published around 300 peer-reviewed articles, chapters, and commentaries. In 1956 Vivian married Joan nee Wilkinson Jones, a teacher and children\u2019s author. They travelled widely for his research, making friends all over the world. He is survived by Joan, their sons, Ben and me, and three grandchildren.",

But when Cathay became aware of the mistake, the airline said it would stand by the fares. \u201cWe do not want to go back on our promise to our customers,\u201d it said. \u201cWe made a mistake but we look forward to welcoming you onboard with your ticket issued.\u201d The airline did not respond to requests for comment about the number of flights sold at the steep discount. Cathay has removed all business and first-class flights for August \u2013 the month of the cut-price fares \u2013 from its website, but the same flights in September are listed for $16,000. Another blog, One Mile at a Time, saw it was possible to buy first-class flights from Hanoi to Vancouver for $988 return. In a blogpost, it said: \u201cWow! Hurry, this won\u2019t last.\u201d There were also first-class return flights from Hong Kong to New York offered for $1,450. The price of those flights in September is more than $31,000. The South China Morning Post tracked down 11 passengers who collectively bought 18 first and business-class tickets at the discounted prices. They paid a total of \u00a321,700 for flights that should have cost \u00a3540,000. It is not the first time airlines have mistakenly offered premium-class flights at economy prices. Singapore Airlines made the error in 2014, as did Hong Kong Airlines last summer, and both honoured the errors. But in 2015, United Airlines cancelled hundreds of tickets it sold for $100 by mistake. United said it would not honour the fares because the error was caused by a \u201cthird-party software provider\u201d. Earlier this year, Cathay had to repaint one of its jets after customers noticed the airline had spelled its name wrong. The Boeing 777-367 was emblazoned with the words \u201cCathay Paciic\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Here are our bold predictions for 2019 in sports. Please note the <em>bold </em>(or should that be <strong>bold?</strong>) in bold predictions: these are to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p> <h2>Tiger Woods will win the US Open</h2> <p>That Woods could compete in illustrious golf company once more was demonstrated by strong performances in the 2018 Open and US PGA Championship. Subsequent victory at the Tour Championship proved a further, notable milestone for a player whose career seemed destined to peter out because of fitness troubles. The US Open\u2019s return to Pebble Beach must have Woods licking his lips; he won the event by 15 shots there in 2000 \u2013 as remains a tournament record \u2013 and was just three adrift of Graeme McDowell in 2010, just months after chaos had engulfed his personal life. The last 12 months proved that Woods can add a 15th major title to his CV. The third of the upcoming year provides ideal opportunity. <em>EM</em></p> <h2>Anthony Davis and LeBron James join forces</h2> <p>Anthony Davis will join LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. OK, maybe this isn\u2019t exactly the boldest possible prediction since James\u2019 wooing of the ridiculously talented New Orleans Pelicans center has reached the point where the NBA has <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25577494/anthony-davis-flattered-lebron-james-comments-says-focus-new-orleans-pelicans\">issued a statement</a> warning teams against tampering. The Pelicans probably won\u2019t be able to hold on to their franchise player and it\u2019s hard to imagine a better situation for Davis, or the league, than having him join James in LA. A LeBron/Davis Lakers team could do damage in the Western Conference, especially if Kevin Durant leaves the Golden State Warriors in the dust, which I\u2019m also predicting will happen. <em>HF</em></p> <h2>Bryce Harper: buyer beware</h2> <p>On the surface, Harper is a free-agent dream. A so-called \u201cgenerational\u201d talent at 26 years old, and one with a career OPS of an even .900. Who would want a player like that? Just about everybody, but everybody doesn\u2019t have pockets deep enough to accommodate the outfielder. That means he\u2019ll land in a big market, meaning greater expectations and pressure that Harper never truly felt in Washington. While DC is the sixth largest television market in the United States, it doesn\u2019t play like a New York or an LA. If Harper lands in a big smoke, Harper will struggle to find his feet with expectations mixing into a formula that\u2019s already produced inconsistent results. For example, Yasiel Puig, who may have been moved from the Los Angeles Dodgers to help accommodate Harper\u2019s would-be budget-busting contract, had a higher WAR than Harper last season: a paltry 1.3, albeit, mostly because of poor defensive numbers. Then again, he\u2019s capable of hanging a 10 on the WAR scale, but that was three full seasons ago. That\u2019s not the consistency you should expect from a \u201cgenerational\u201d player. Buyer beware. <em>DL</em></p> <h2>Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao dance again</h2> <p>Hardened skeptics pooh-poohed Mayweather\u2019s summit meeting with Pacquiao for happening far past its sell-by date and were partially vindicated by a one-sided fight that left customers feeling let down and ripped off. A rematch between now-quadragenarian icons, surely won\u2019t do the record-shattering business of that poorly received 2015 blockbuster, but will no doubt be a money-spinning affair and another nine-figure payday for both men. Pacquiao, who won a secondary welterweight title belt in the summer, signed with longtime Mayweather adviser Al Haymon last month and is due to fight Adrien Broner on 20 January. Should the Filipino senator make it through unscathed, a rematch that nobody asked for will likely be announced for May or June. <em>BAG</em></p> <h2>Aryna Sabalenka wins her first grand slam</h2> <p>Given she is 13 in the world and hits the ball as hard as Serena Williams, picking 20-year-old Aryna Sabalenka to win a slam in 2019 might not appear to be that outrageous. After all, there have been eight different champions in the last eight majors. However, while that statistic alone describes the volatility and promise of the women\u2019s game, Williams, at 37, is in the mood to build on her two 2018 finals in a comeback year of high drama - so Sabalenka and the other contenders will have that considerable obstacle to a breakthrough. None the less, she has more weapons than nearly all of her contemporaries. It could be the start of another era \u2013 even at Williams\u2019s expense. <em>KM</em></p> <h2>Mixed martial arts outside the US gains traction</h2> <p>Mixed martial arts can feel insular or expansive depending on your perspective. The UFC is often regarded as the sun at the center of MMA\u2019s solar system, and the start of its five-year relationship with ESPN in January should only strengthen the promotion\u2019s brand recognition. Heading into 2019, however, MMA outside the United States, particularly Asia\u2019s One Championship, is well positioned to capture American fight fans\u2019 imagination in a way it hasn\u2019t since Pride collapsed more than a decade ago. <em>JG</em></p> <h2>Someone will make curling work on TV</h2> <p>Curling is a quadrennial hit on TV, and waves of people have hit the ice to try for themselves. But US broadcasters simply don\u2019t know how to handle the sport between the Games. NBC\u2019s Curling Night in America broadcasts, recorded en masse early in the season and shown game-by-game over the next several months, simply don\u2019t cut it. They just repeat the same talking points \u2013 especially this year, when they talk ad infinitum about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/24/usa-sweden-curling-gold-medal\">John Shuster\u2019s magical gold-medal run</a> \u2013 instead of giving a breakdown of the tactics behind each shot and whether or not it succeeded, as we can see on the occasional Canadian broadcast picked up by ESPN3. Ironically, the same network that makes curling a personality parade (NBC) proved the Premier League can be a hit on American TV when commentators stop talking down to viewers and start taking it seriously. When someone takes the same approach with curling, viewers will take notice. <em>BD</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Here are our bold predictions for 2019 in sports. Please note the bold (or should that be bold?) in bold predictions: these are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Tiger Woods will win the US Open That Woods could compete in illustrious golf company once more was demonstrated by strong performances in the 2018 Open and US PGA Championship. Subsequent victory at the Tour Championship proved a further, notable milestone for a player whose career seemed destined to peter out because of fitness troubles. The US Open\u2019s return to Pebble Beach must have Woods licking his lips; he won the event by 15 shots there in 2000 \u2013 as remains a tournament record \u2013 and was just three adrift of Graeme McDowell in 2010, just months after chaos had engulfed his personal life. The last 12 months proved that Woods can add a 15th major title to his CV. The third of the upcoming year provides ideal opportunity. EM Anthony Davis and LeBron James join forces Anthony Davis will join LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. OK, maybe this isn\u2019t exactly the boldest possible prediction since James\u2019 wooing of the ridiculously talented New Orleans Pelicans center has reached the point where the NBA has issued a statement warning teams against tampering. The Pelicans probably won\u2019t be able to hold on to their franchise player and it\u2019s hard to imagine a better situation for Davis, or the league, than having him join James in LA. A LeBron/Davis Lakers team could do damage in the Western Conference, especially if Kevin Durant leaves the Golden State Warriors in the dust, which I\u2019m also predicting will happen. HF Bryce Harper: buyer beware On the surface, Harper is a free-agent dream. A so-called \u201cgenerational\u201d talent at 26 years old, and one with a career OPS of an even .900. Who would want a player like that? Just about everybody, but everybody doesn\u2019t have pockets deep enough to accommodate the outfielder. That means he\u2019ll land in a big market, meaning greater expectations and pressure that Harper never truly felt in Washington. While DC is the sixth largest television market in the United States, it doesn\u2019t play like a New York or an LA. If Harper lands in a big smoke, Harper will struggle to find his feet with expectations mixing into a formula that\u2019s already produced inconsistent results. For example, Yasiel Puig, who may have been moved from the Los Angeles Dodgers to help accommodate Harper\u2019s would-be budget-busting contract, had a higher WAR than Harper last season: a paltry 1.3, albeit, mostly because of poor defensive numbers. Then again, he\u2019s capable of hanging a 10 on the WAR scale, but that was three full seasons ago. That\u2019s not the consistency you should expect from a \u201cgenerational\u201d player. Buyer beware. DL Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao dance again Hardened skeptics pooh-poohed Mayweather\u2019s summit meeting with Pacquiao for happening far past its sell-by date and were partially vindicated by a one-sided fight that left customers feeling let down and ripped off. A rematch between now-quadragenarian icons, surely won\u2019t do the record-shattering business of that poorly received 2015 blockbuster, but will no doubt be a money-spinning affair and another nine-figure payday for both men. Pacquiao, who won a secondary welterweight title belt in the summer, signed with longtime Mayweather adviser Al Haymon last month and is due to fight Adrien Broner on 20 January. Should the Filipino senator make it through unscathed, a rematch that nobody asked for will likely be announced for May or June. BAG Aryna Sabalenka wins her first grand slam Given she is 13 in the world and hits the ball as hard as Serena Williams, picking 20-year-old Aryna Sabalenka to win a slam in 2019 might not appear to be that outrageous. After all, there have been eight different champions in the last eight majors. However, while that statistic alone describes the volatility and promise of the women\u2019s game, Williams, at 37, is in the mood to build on her two 2018 finals in a comeback year of high drama - so Sabalenka and the other contenders will have that considerable obstacle to a breakthrough. None the less, she has more weapons than nearly all of her contemporaries. It could be the start of another era \u2013 even at Williams\u2019s expense. KM Mixed martial arts outside the US gains traction Mixed martial arts can feel insular or expansive depending on your perspective. The UFC is often regarded as the sun at the center of MMA\u2019s solar system, and the start of its five-year relationship with ESPN in January should only strengthen the promotion\u2019s brand recognition. Heading into 2019, however, MMA outside the United States, particularly Asia\u2019s One Championship, is well positioned to capture American fight fans\u2019 imagination in a way it hasn\u2019t since Pride collapsed more than a decade ago. JG Someone will make curling work on TV Curling is a quadrennial hit on TV, and waves of people have hit the ice to try for themselves. But US broadcasters simply don\u2019t know how to handle the sport between the Games. NBC\u2019s Curling Night in America broadcasts, recorded en masse early in the season and shown game-by-game over the next several months, simply don\u2019t cut it. They just repeat the same talking points \u2013 especially this year, when they talk ad infinitum about John Shuster\u2019s magical gold-medal run \u2013 instead of giving a breakdown of the tactics behind each shot and whether or not it succeeded, as we can see on the occasional Canadian broadcast picked up by ESPN3. Ironically, the same network that makes curling a personality parade (NBC) proved the Premier League can be a hit on American TV when commentators stop talking down to viewers and start taking it seriously. When someone takes the same approach with curling, viewers will take notice. BD",

A further tweet stated: \u201cJust so in 2019 you know where I stand.\u201d He affirmed, \u201cFrom now on I\u2019m performing with my mutherfucking hat on,\u201d in reference to the Make America Great Again hat associated with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign that he frequently wore in 2018.

John Lewis experienced big swings in trade during November and December, with a record-breaking Black Friday followed by several weeks of declining sales. Fears that the crucial trading period would be a washout for the country\u2019s retailers were heightened by profit warnings from Asos, Bonmarch\u00e9 and Superdry, while the Sports Direct chief executive, Mike Ashley, warned dismal trading in November meant the high street risked being \u201csmashed to pieces\u201d . Retailers are suffering as rising rents, business rates and wages drive up the cost of running physical stores at a time when shoppers are increasingly spending online. Figures due to be published this week by retail research group Springboard are expected to show the number of shoppers that visited the high street to do their Christmas shopping in December was down in the region of 3% on last year. Fewer shoppers was on the list of problems cited by HMV, which last week emerged as the first major Christmas casualty as it collapsed into administration for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. The administration is being handled by the accountancy firm KPMG, which is tasked with finding a buyer or closing the stricken chain down. HMV said it had been unable to withstand the \u201ctsunami of challenges\u201d facing UK retailers at a time when sales of its core range of DVDs and CDs was in freefall.

I had the opportunity to experience music from a young age and I\u2019d love for everyone to have that opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s such an amazing art in expressing yourself and understanding other people\u2019s expression. I play a lot of music by dead composers and through their music we can understand their lives.

The cellist\u2019s debut album, Inspiration, reached No 11 in the pop charts, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/13/royal-wedding-cellist-sheku-kanneh-mason-wins-two-classic-brit-awards\">won two Classic Brit awards</a> and also played the Royal Variety performance. Additionally, he released his first Christmas single, his own arrangement of In the Bleak Midwinter, with his sister Isata Kanneh-Mason \u2013 one of six siblings, all musical \u2013 accompanying him on piano.</p> <p>His growing fame sits easily with the teenager, who says he just loves playing music and sharing it with others, although he is also keen to galvanise interest in the predominately white world of classical music in others from a BAME background.</p> <p>Talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chineke--orchestra\">Chineke!</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/young-musician-sheku-kanneh-mason-classical-music-education\">Chi-chi Nwanoku\u2019s groundbreaking ensemble</a> of young black and minority ethnic musicians, in whose debut concert he played, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s so important because it\u2019s really easy to be inspired by someone you can maybe relate with because they look like you or have a similar background and that\u2019s what the orchestra is trying to do. For me, playing in the orchestra, I was one of the youngest and it was really inspiring. I have always wanted to inspire others.\u201d</p> <p>Kanneh-Mason, whose album includes Bob Marley and Leonard Cohen tracks alongside Shostakovich, has put his money where his mouth is, donating \u00a33,000 to his old school, Trinity Catholic School in Nottingham, to ensure the future of cello teaching there. He is also London Music Masters\u2019 junior ambassador, promoting opportunity and diversity in classical music.</p> <p>There is little doubt his cause has been boosted by his own rise, capped by the cellist\u2019s appearance at the royal wedding, which was watched by 18 million people in the UK alone. He played three tracks chosen by the couple while they signed the register off camera.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/03/sheku-kanneh-mason-state-school-success-cuts-music-alevels-gcse\">Sheku Kanneh-Mason is a state school success story.

      "bodyText": "Having topped the classical music charts and performed before a global TV audience of hundreds of millions at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding, Sheku Kanneh-Mason is spoilt for choice when it comes to picking the highlight of his year. The 19-year-old cellist says far more modest, less public events were just as enjoyable as the headline-grabbing moments. \u201cIt\u2019s all been really, really amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI have just enjoyed each thing but sometimes the really small things, like playing for children in a school, are really special.\u201d Music education is a passion for Kanneh-Mason, who is using his new-found fame to highlight its value amid concerns it is being squeezed out of the national curriculum in England. \u201cI think it\u2019s so, so important,\u201d said Kanneh-Mason, who attended a comprehensive school in Nottingham. \u201cI was very, very lucky that all of the schools I went to were supportive of music. I had the opportunity to experience music from a young age and I\u2019d love for everyone to have that opportunity. \u201cI think it\u2019s such an amazing art in expressing yourself and understanding other people\u2019s expression. I play a lot of music by dead composers and through their music we can understand their lives. Life and music are very connected and that\u2019s a really special thing.\u201d If his star was already in the ascendant before 2018, becoming the first black instrumentalist to win the BBC\u2019s Young Musician of the Year in 2016, it has entered another stratosphere, largely thanks to his moving performance at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s wedding. The cellist\u2019s debut album, Inspiration, reached No 11 in the pop charts, he won two Classic Brit awards and also played the Royal Variety performance. Additionally, he released his first Christmas single, his own arrangement of In the Bleak Midwinter, with his sister Isata Kanneh-Mason \u2013 one of six siblings, all musical \u2013 accompanying him on piano. His growing fame sits easily with the teenager, who says he just loves playing music and sharing it with others, although he is also keen to galvanise interest in the predominately white world of classical music in others from a BAME background. Talking about Chineke!, Chi-chi Nwanoku\u2019s groundbreaking ensemble of young black and minority ethnic musicians, in whose debut concert he played, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s so important because it\u2019s really easy to be inspired by someone you can maybe relate with because they look like you or have a similar background and that\u2019s what the orchestra is trying to do. For me, playing in the orchestra, I was one of the youngest and it was really inspiring. I have always wanted to inspire others.\u201d Kanneh-Mason, whose album includes Bob Marley and Leonard Cohen tracks alongside Shostakovich, has put his money where his mouth is, donating \u00a33,000 to his old school, Trinity Catholic School in Nottingham, to ensure the future of cello teaching there. He is also London Music Masters\u2019 junior ambassador, promoting opportunity and diversity in classical music. There is little doubt his cause has been boosted by his own rise, capped by the cellist\u2019s appearance at the royal wedding, which was watched by 18 million people in the UK alone. He played three tracks chosen by the couple while they signed the register off camera. Meghan called him personally to ask him to perform after Prince Harry saw him play at an event in support of the Antiguan charity the Halo Foundation. He was told to expect a call from her, he said, \u201cotherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t have picked up\u201d. As a result, he says he is now recognised in the street, \u201cparticularly if I\u2019m carrying my cello\u201d. He met the couple again at a Royal Variety performance last month. \u201cThey were happy to see me again and enjoyed the performance and thanked me for performing in May,\u201d he said \u201cIt was really nice to perform for them and this time they were able to watch it.\u201d For other teenagers, the burden of living up to a life-changing 12 months might prove difficult but Kanneh-Mason is unfazed and his ambitions for the future remain modest. \u201cI am still a student [at the Royal Academy of Music],\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy discovering lots of music and learning. I think it\u2019s something that will never stop, that\u2019s one of the exciting things about classical music.\u201d",

According to the latest snapshot survey from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, growing concerns about Brexit disruption from border hold-ups after 29 March led more businesses to build up stocks in December. Factories stockpiled raw materials used in production processes, as well as finished goods, at one of the fastest rates on record, according to the gauge of activity that is closely watched by the Bank of England and the Treasury for early warning signs from the British economy. The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 54.2 in December from 53.6 in November, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, on a scale where a reading above 50 indicates economic growth. In a sign of mounting stress for the British economy as the impasse in Westminster over Brexit continues, the stockpiling of finished goods increased at the second-fastest rate since 1992. The pound\u2019s weakness also helped support export orders, with growth from the US, Europe, China, India, Brazil and Africa. The latest snapshot raises the prospect that Brexit uncertainty may perversely benefit the economy in the short-term by prompting companies to raise their activity levels to prepare for a no-deal scenario. The Bank has previously warned the majority of businesses in Britain have done little to prepare for a no-deal scenario, while the government has started to tell more companies to make preparations as it steps up its own plans.

Hailed at its New York debut in 2014, the play raises fascinating questions about the nature of faith and, with the aid of a community cast, gets a large-scale production from James Dacre. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/whats-on/our-lady-of-kibeho/\">Royal and Derngate, Northampton</a>, from 12 January</em></p> <h2>When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other</h2> <p>Cate Blanchett and Stephen Dillane head the cast of Martin Crimp\u2019s new play offering variations on Samuel Richardson\u2019s 18th-century novel Pamela. The original book is about a virtuous serving-maid\u2019s efforts to resist her predatory master, but Crimp and his director, Katie Mitchell, promise a more modern take on the nature of sexual domination. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/when-we-have-sufficiently-tortured-each-other\">Dorfman, London</a>, from 16 January</em></p> <h2>All About Eve</h2> <p>Gillian Anderson and Lily James star in Ivo van Hove\u2019s adaptation of Joseph Mankiewicz\u2019s classic Oscar-winning movie about backstage bitchery and fame hunger. Previously turned into a Broadway musical, Applause, the story seems made for the stage with its portrait of loyal dressers, waspish critics and aspiring stars from the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/all-about-eve/\">No\u00ebl Coward </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/tickets/all-about-eve/\">theatre, London</a>, </em><em> from 2 February</em></p> <h2>The American Clock</h2> <p>A positive feast of Arthur Miller is on its way. Rachel Chavkin, fresh from Hadestown at the National, directs this little-seen study of the impact of the 1929 stock-market crash on one particular New York family and the wider society. It will be accompanied by the transfer to Wyndham\u2019s (from 5 February) of Jonathan Church\u2019s superb Bath revival of The Price. Then (from 15 April), Sally Field and Bill Pullman star in All My Sons at the Old Vic. But Chavkin gets in first with this neglected panoramic piece. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2019/the-american-clock\">Old Vic, London</a>, </em><em>from 4 February</em></p> <h2>Rutherford and Son</h2> <p>Githa Sowerby, daughter of a Gateshead glassmaker, scored an instant hit with her debut play in 1912. It\u2019s the story of the bull-headed boss of a northern metalworks who dreams of handing on the business to his son, but who manages to alienate his family. When he meets his match in his daughter-in-law, it is as if the drama of Ibsen and Granville-Barker is being rewritten from a feminist perspective.

Julie Hesmondhalgh plays the woman with a cart in Amy Hodge\u2019s production, and it will be fascinating to see how it strikes the balance between emotional empathy and critical evaluation. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/mother-courage-and-her-children\">Royal Exchange, Manchester</a>, </em><em>from 8 February</em></p> <h2>Alys, Always</h2> <p>Lucinda Coxon has adapted Harriet Lane\u2019s acclaimed first novel about a manipulative, books page sub-editor on a posh Sunday paper whose life is radically changed after she witnesses a car-accident. Part psychological study, part suspenseful thriller, the play is directed by Nicholas Hytner and stars Joanne Froggatt of Downton Abbey fame and Robert Glenister from Spooks. <br><em><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/alys-always/\">Bridge </a></em><em><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/alys-always/\">theatre, London</a>, </em><em>from 25 February</em></p> <h2>Richard III</h2> <p>Tom Mothersdale, best known for Peaky Blinders, plays the king in a show directed by John Haidar that sets up a new model for co-production. Jointly presented by Headlong and Bristol Old Vic, it also plays at London\u2019s newly restored Alexandra Palace, as well as in Manchester, Oxford and Northampton. But the excitement will be in seeing how a fast-rising young actor tackles Shakespeare\u2019s satanic ironist. <br><em><a href=\"https://bristololdvic.org.uk/whats-on/richard-iii\">Bristol Old Vic</a>, </em><em>from 1 March</em></p> <h2>Betrayal</h2> <p>Tom Hiddleston, last seen on stage in a Branagh-directed Hamlet, stars in a revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s play about the corrosive nature of betrayal. Jamie Lloyd\u2019s production forms the climax to an invaluable season that has resurrected Pinter\u2019s less familiar one-act pieces, and it will be intriguing to see what new insights Lloyd offers into a study of the painful truths of personal infidelity. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/betrayal/harold-pinter-theatre/\">Harold Pinter </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/betrayal/harold-pinter-theatre/\">theatre, London</a>, </em><em>from 5 March</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20e4c3fa451b17e721ff40c5a0eefde618a06795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20e4c3fa451b17e721ff40c5a0eefde618a06795/0_949_1335_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Painful truths \u2026 Tom Hiddleston stars in Betrayal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Painful truths \u2026 Tom Hiddleston stars in Betrayal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Budd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Interference</h2> <p>Famously without walls, the National Theatre of Scotland takes over a Glasgow office-block to stage three plays set in 2040. The writers are Morna Pearson, Hannah Khalil and Vlad Butucea, and the aim is to show how intimate relationships may be affected by new technology: android carers are at large in an old people\u2019s home, and corporations interfere in their employees\u2019 baby-making. Cora Bissett directs this chilling futuristic trilogy. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/production/interference/\">A Glasgow office block</a>, from 16 March</em></p> <h2>Local Hero</h2> <p>Originally a 1983 Bill Forsyth movie, this Scottish story has now been turned into a musical. Forsyth himself and David Greig have written the book and Mark Knopfler the music and lyrics, and it still focuses on a Texan oil exec who plans to buy up a Scottish seaside village and replace it with a refinery. At a time of resistance to international land-grabbers and growing awareness of local identity, this looks like the perfect musical. <br><em><a href=\"https://lyceum.org.uk/whats-on/production/local-hero\">Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh</a></em><em>, from 19 March and Old Vic, London, </em><em>in June 2020</em></p> <h2>Kunene and the King</h2> <p>What is South Africa like 25 years after the first post-apartheid democratic elections? That is the question posed in this new play by the towering South African actor-writer John Kani, best known for Sizwe Bansi Is Dead and The Island. Kani also acts in the play opposite Antony Sher as one of two men reflecting on a quarter-century of dramatic change. Janice Honeyman directs a joint RSC-Fugard Theatre production.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/kunene-and-the-king/\">Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon</a></em><em>, from 21 March</em></p> <h2>Sweeney Todd</h2> <p>Liam Tobin stars as the demon barber in Nick Bagnall\u2019s production of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s masterpiece. The brilliance of the show lies in its ability to combine a story of personal revenge with a portrait of social cruelty. It also has a strong element of mordant wit as shown in the unforgettable waltz-time number, A Little Priest.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/sweeney-todd\">Everyman, Liverpool</a>, </em><em>from 12 April</em></p> <h2>Orpheus Descending</h2> <p>Tennessee Williams\u2019s take on the classic myth last seen on the UK stage in Hadestown. Here, a footlose guitar-player wanders into a southern town that is a vision of hell on Earth and falls for an ageing Eurydice, whose husband was behind an act of racist violence. Tamara Harvey directs a play that combines Williams\u2019s early romanticism and sweatshirt realism.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatrclwyd.com/en/whats-on/orpheus-descending/\">Theatr Clwyd</a>, </em><em>Mold, from 15 April and Menier Chocolate Factory, London, </em><em>from May</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3c14bcacbb101a19e1cfad05ce352238c8e29b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3c14bcacbb101a19e1cfad05ce352238c8e29b0/0_858_2000_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hell on Earth \u2026 Orpheus Descending\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hell on Earth \u2026 Orpheus Descending</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Morley PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Death of a Salesman</h2> <p>More Arthur Miller, as Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell direct this 1949 classic with a cast to die for. Wendell Pierce, of The Wire and Selma, makes his UK stage debut as Willy Loman. The great Sharon D Clarke plays his wife, Linda, and Arinz\u00e9 Kene, fresh from the West End run of Misty, is his son, Biff. With a team like that, a play once described as \u201ca powerful tragic symphony\u201d will undoubtedly acquire new resonances. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/death-of-a-salesman\">Young Vic, London</a>, </em><em>from 1 May</em></p> <h2>King Hedley II</h2> <p>Lenny Henry heads the cast of a key play by the late, great August Wilson. Set like most of his work in Pittsburgh, it\u2019s the story of a smooth-talking hustler trying to rebuild his life and start a family against the background of Reagan\u2019s America in the 1980s. Nadia Fall, who has made a fine start in her tenure at a historic theatre, directs a play that promises to be one of the year\u2019s highlights. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.stratfordeast.com/whats-on/all-shows/king-hedley-ii\">Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London</a>, </em><em>from 15 May</em></p> <h2>Our Town</h2> <p>Ellen McDougall directs Thornton Wilder\u2019s 1938 hymn to small-town daily life, which seems to have gained new popularity in our fraught, hi-tech age. As Harold Clurman once wrote, \u201cThere is a bit of this play\u2019s snowball purity in the social memory of every American.\u201d It will be fascinating to see how it adapts to an alfresco theatre in an English summer. <br><em><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/our-town\">Open Air </a></em><em><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/our-town\">theatre, Regent\u2019s Park, London</a>, </em><em> from 16 May</em></p> <h2>The Hunt</h2> <p>David Farr has adapted the admired 2012 film by Thomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm. Like Vinterberg\u2019s earlier movie, Festen, it deals with allegations of child abuse in a Danish setting. A key difference is that the milieu this time is a tight-knit, lower-middle-class community, and that the accused is innocent. Rupert Goold directs this chilling Danish morality tale. <br><em><a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/the-hunt/17-jun-2019-3-aug-2019\">Almeida, London</a>, </em><em>from 17 June</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc8504987478123c9aa2a923785b568410d44cca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc8504987478123c9aa2a923785b568410d44cca/0_0_4724_3149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Damned by Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Decadence ...

Like the film, the play is about a decadent family of German industrialists in collusion with the nascent Nazi regime. Archival footage and live recordings blend with the action in a show that puts 30 actors and technicians on stage. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/comedie-francaise-the-damned\">Barbican, London</a>, </em><em>from 19 June</em></p> <h2>The End of History</h2> <p>Jack Thorne as writer and John Tiffany as director have previously collaborated on Hope, Let the Right One In and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Now they are reunited for Thorne\u2019s provocatively titled new play, set in 1997, which deals with a family gathering. Given that the play unfolds in the year of Blair\u2019s electoral triumph and that the hosts have named their children after socialist heroes, it sounds promisingly political.<br><em><a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/theendofhistory/\">Royal Court, London</a>, </em><em>from 27 June</em></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance\">DANCE</a><br></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d526d3c36547284c283afe210e62b8c406859c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d526d3c36547284c283afe210e62b8c406859c70/0_0_7624_5241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queen for a day: Northern Ballet\u2019s Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen for a day: Northern Ballet\u2019s Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Farrow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Northern Ballet: Victoria</h2> <p>The modern narrative ballet could be seen as a form in crisis, but not in the hands of Cathy Marston, whose sensitive handling of storytelling and steps has both clarity and texture.

The six suites are played in their entirety by French cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras, while five dancers, including De Keersmaeker, bring sound into three dimensions. De Keersmaeker\u2019s ascetic aesthetic isn\u2019t instantly gratifying to everyone, but even when she makes you work for it, the rewards are rich. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2019/anne-teresa-de-keersmaeker-jean-guihen-queyras-and-rosas-mitten-wir-im-leben-sind-bach6cellosuiten/\">Sadler\u2019s Wells, London</a>, 24-25 April</em></p> <h2>Matthew Bourne\u2019s Romeo and Juliet</h2> <p>A new Matthew Bourne show is always a major event in the dance calendar.

      "bodyText": "THEATRE Our Lady of Kibeho Katori Hall, who had a big hit with The Mountaintop about Martin Luther King, tackles the story of a Rwandan schoolgirl who in 1981 had divine visions warning of a coming genocide. Hailed at its New York debut in 2014, the play raises fascinating questions about the nature of faith and, with the aid of a community cast, gets a large-scale production from James Dacre. Royal and Derngate, Northampton, from 12 January When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other Cate Blanchett and Stephen Dillane head the cast of Martin Crimp\u2019s new play offering variations on Samuel Richardson\u2019s 18th-century novel Pamela. The original book is about a virtuous serving-maid\u2019s efforts to resist her predatory master, but Crimp and his director, Katie Mitchell, promise a more modern take on the nature of sexual domination. Dorfman, London, from 16 January All About Eve Gillian Anderson and Lily James star in Ivo van Hove\u2019s adaptation of Joseph Mankiewicz\u2019s classic Oscar-winning movie about backstage bitchery and fame hunger. Previously turned into a Broadway musical, Applause, the story seems made for the stage with its portrait of loyal dressers, waspish critics and aspiring stars from the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art. No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, from 2 February The American Clock A positive feast of Arthur Miller is on its way. Rachel Chavkin, fresh from Hadestown at the National, directs this little-seen study of the impact of the 1929 stock-market crash on one particular New York family and the wider society. It will be accompanied by the transfer to Wyndham\u2019s (from 5 February) of Jonathan Church\u2019s superb Bath revival of The Price. Then (from 15 April), Sally Field and Bill Pullman star in All My Sons at the Old Vic. But Chavkin gets in first with this neglected panoramic piece. Old Vic, London, from 4 February Rutherford and Son Githa Sowerby, daughter of a Gateshead glassmaker, scored an instant hit with her debut play in 1912. It\u2019s the story of the bull-headed boss of a northern metalworks who dreams of handing on the business to his son, but who manages to alienate his family. When he meets his match in his daughter-in-law, it is as if the drama of Ibsen and Granville-Barker is being rewritten from a feminist perspective. Caroline Steinbeis directs this terrific, pioneering play. Crucible, Sheffield, from 8 February Mother Courage and Her Children Brecht refuses to lie down. Anna Jordan promises \u201ca sharp new version\u201d of this masterly play about a woman who sacrifices her three children to profit in the wake of a seemingly endless war. Julie Hesmondhalgh plays the woman with a cart in Amy Hodge\u2019s production, and it will be fascinating to see how it strikes the balance between emotional empathy and critical evaluation. Royal Exchange, Manchester, from 8 February Alys, Always Lucinda Coxon has adapted Harriet Lane\u2019s acclaimed first novel about a manipulative, books page sub-editor on a posh Sunday paper whose life is radically changed after she witnesses a car-accident. Part psychological study, part suspenseful thriller, the play is directed by Nicholas Hytner and stars Joanne Froggatt of Downton Abbey fame and Robert Glenister from Spooks. Bridge theatre, London, from 25 February Richard III Tom Mothersdale, best known for Peaky Blinders, plays the king in a show directed by John Haidar that sets up a new model for co-production. Jointly presented by Headlong and Bristol Old Vic, it also plays at London\u2019s newly restored Alexandra Palace, as well as in Manchester, Oxford and Northampton. But the excitement will be in seeing how a fast-rising young actor tackles Shakespeare\u2019s satanic ironist. Bristol Old Vic, from 1 March Betrayal Tom Hiddleston, last seen on stage in a Branagh-directed Hamlet, stars in a revival of Harold Pinter\u2019s play about the corrosive nature of betrayal. Jamie Lloyd\u2019s production forms the climax to an invaluable season that has resurrected Pinter\u2019s less familiar one-act pieces, and it will be intriguing to see what new insights Lloyd offers into a study of the painful truths of personal infidelity. Harold Pinter theatre, London, from 5 March Interference Famously without walls, the National Theatre of Scotland takes over a Glasgow office-block to stage three plays set in 2040. The writers are Morna Pearson, Hannah Khalil and Vlad Butucea, and the aim is to show how intimate relationships may be affected by new technology: android carers are at large in an old people\u2019s home, and corporations interfere in their employees\u2019 baby-making. Cora Bissett directs this chilling futuristic trilogy. A Glasgow office block, from 16 March Local Hero Originally a 1983 Bill Forsyth movie, this Scottish story has now been turned into a musical. Forsyth himself and David Greig have written the book and Mark Knopfler the music and lyrics, and it still focuses on a Texan oil exec who plans to buy up a Scottish seaside village and replace it with a refinery. At a time of resistance to international land-grabbers and growing awareness of local identity, this looks like the perfect musical. Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, from 19 March and Old Vic, London, in June 2020 Kunene and the King What is South Africa like 25 years after the first post-apartheid democratic elections? That is the question posed in this new play by the towering South African actor-writer John Kani, best known for Sizwe Bansi Is Dead and The Island. Kani also acts in the play opposite Antony Sher as one of two men reflecting on a quarter-century of dramatic change. Janice Honeyman directs a joint RSC-Fugard Theatre production. Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 21 March Sweeney Todd Liam Tobin stars as the demon barber in Nick Bagnall\u2019s production of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s masterpiece. The brilliance of the show lies in its ability to combine a story of personal revenge with a portrait of social cruelty. It also has a strong element of mordant wit as shown in the unforgettable waltz-time number, A Little Priest. Everyman, Liverpool, from 12 April Orpheus Descending Tennessee Williams\u2019s take on the classic myth last seen on the UK stage in Hadestown. Here, a footlose guitar-player wanders into a southern town that is a vision of hell on Earth and falls for an ageing Eurydice, whose husband was behind an act of racist violence. Tamara Harvey directs a play that combines Williams\u2019s early romanticism and sweatshirt realism. Theatr Clwyd, Mold, from 15 April and Menier Chocolate Factory, London, from May Death of a Salesman More Arthur Miller, as Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell direct this 1949 classic with a cast to die for. Wendell Pierce, of The Wire and Selma, makes his UK stage debut as Willy Loman. The great Sharon D Clarke plays his wife, Linda, and Arinz\u00e9 Kene, fresh from the West End run of Misty, is his son, Biff. With a team like that, a play once described as \u201ca powerful tragic symphony\u201d will undoubtedly acquire new resonances. Young Vic, London, from 1 May King Hedley II Lenny Henry heads the cast of a key play by the late, great August Wilson. Set like most of his work in Pittsburgh, it\u2019s the story of a smooth-talking hustler trying to rebuild his life and start a family against the background of Reagan\u2019s America in the 1980s. Nadia Fall, who has made a fine start in her tenure at a historic theatre, directs a play that promises to be one of the year\u2019s highlights. Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London, from 15 May Our Town Ellen McDougall directs Thornton Wilder\u2019s 1938 hymn to small-town daily life, which seems to have gained new popularity in our fraught, hi-tech age. As Harold Clurman once wrote, \u201cThere is a bit of this play\u2019s snowball purity in the social memory of every American.\u201d It will be fascinating to see how it adapts to an alfresco theatre in an English summer. Open Air theatre, Regent\u2019s Park, London, from 16 May The Hunt David Farr has adapted the admired 2012 film by Thomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm. Like Vinterberg\u2019s earlier movie, Festen, it deals with allegations of child abuse in a Danish setting. A key difference is that the milieu this time is a tight-knit, lower-middle-class community, and that the accused is innocent. Rupert Goold directs this chilling Danish morality tale. Almeida, London, from 17 June The Damned The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise pay a rare visit to Britain with Ivo van Hove\u2019s spectacular staging of a Luchino Visconti movie. Like the film, the play is about a decadent family of German industrialists in collusion with the nascent Nazi regime. Archival footage and live recordings blend with the action in a show that puts 30 actors and technicians on stage. Barbican, London, from 19 June The End of History Jack Thorne as writer and John Tiffany as director have previously collaborated on Hope, Let the Right One In and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Now they are reunited for Thorne\u2019s provocatively titled new play, set in 1997, which deals with a family gathering. Given that the play unfolds in the year of Blair\u2019s electoral triumph and that the hosts have named their children after socialist heroes, it sounds promisingly political. Royal Court, London, from 27 June DANCE Northern Ballet: Victoria The modern narrative ballet could be seen as a form in crisis, but not in the hands of Cathy Marston, whose sensitive handling of storytelling and steps has both clarity and texture. She has spent much of the last decade working outside the UK, now we\u2019re finally getting to see more of Marston; after her excellent Jane Eyre for Northern Ballet in 2016, she\u2019s now creating another work for the company, based on the life of Queen Victoria. Tour opens at Leeds Grand, 9 March Merce Cunningham Trust \u2013 Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event On what would have been Merce Cunningham\u2019s 100th birthday, 75 dancers across three cities will dance a total of 300 solos by the legendary choreographer. As well as performances in LA and New York, 25 dancers in London, including Siobhan Davies, Jonathan Goddard, Harry Alexander and Royal Ballet dancers Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball, will dance a solo from every world or European premiere that\u2019s been previously presented at the Barbican. A brilliant birthday party. Barbican, London, 16 April Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, Jean-Guihen Queyras and Rosas Few choreographers can excavate and illuminate music in the detailed way of Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, and so this interpretation of Bach\u2019s cello suites is well worth investigating. The six suites are played in their entirety by French cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras, while five dancers, including De Keersmaeker, bring sound into three dimensions. De Keersmaeker\u2019s ascetic aesthetic isn\u2019t instantly gratifying to everyone, but even when she makes you work for it, the rewards are rich. Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 24-25 April Matthew Bourne\u2019s Romeo and Juliet A new Matthew Bourne show is always a major event in the dance calendar. The man who gender-swapped Swan Lake and turned Sleeping Beauty into a vampire tale tackles the ever-popular Romeo and Juliet. Bourne will be putting a contemporary spin on the tragic lovers and aims to keep it fresh by working with young associate choreographer Arielle Smith and drawing on a huge pool of youthful talent found through local auditions and community projects. Tour opens at Curve, Leicester, 13 May San Francisco Ballet You\u2019ll be totally spoiled for choice in this two-week residency from San Francisco Ballet, making their first visit to the UK since 2012. There are four programmes featuring 10 works, all UK premieres, all made in the last few years, including Arthur Pita\u2019s Bj\u00f6rk Ballet, set to Ms Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s music and by all accounts bonkers. Plus, Alexei Ratmansky does Shostakovich, and a chance to see pieces by Justin Peck, Stanton Welch and Trey McIntyre. Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, from 29 May COMEDY The Catherine Tate Show It\u2019s two years since character comic Tate brought her alter egos out of cold storage for a national tour. That show, directed by Sean Foley and delivered with relish and considerable skill, was better than we\u2019d any right to expect from a TV tie-in \u2013 even if a few of the jokes were, like her best-loved character Nan, showing their age. Now, after a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Tate\u2019s stage show is back to bovver the West End. Wyndham\u2019s, London, from 7 January Jessie Cave Among several terrific 2018 shows hitting the road this year (James Acaster\u2019s prominent among them), the latest outpouring of heartsickness and hope from Jessie Cave is not to be missed. Sunrise follows on from 2015\u2019s I Loved Her, bringing us bang up to date with Cave\u2019s efforts to be happy and single while co-parenting with promiscuous fellow comic Alfie Brown. It offers neurotic humour in excelsis, big insights into the human condition, and big laughs. Tour opens at Warwick Arts Centre, 24 February Guz Khan and Mo Amer An intriguing prospect, this: ex-YouTuber Guz Khan \u2013 the man behind one of 2018\u2019s funniest BBC comedies, Man Like Mobeen \u2013 teams up with Palestinian-American act Mo Amer, last seen supporting Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart at the Albert Hall. Fans of Man Like Mobeen, and anyone who\u2019s seen Amer on his Allah Made Me Funny tours, can expect caustic but playful comedy about membership of a maligned minority. Tour opens at Leicester Square theatre, London, 28 March Ben Elton The standup silverbacks are out in force later in 2019: Eddie Izzard and Jerry Seinfeld both take to the stage with new shows. So too \u2013 for the first time in almost 15 years \u2013 one of comedy\u2019s most divisive figures, Ben Elton. Is he alternative comedy\u2019s biggest sell-out? Or a great entertainer whose talent spans novels and musicals, sitcom and live comedy? Answers (perhaps) on the UK\u2019s standup stages, this autumn. Tour opens at Cheese &amp; Grain, Frome, from 14 September Tim Minchin Tim Minchin spent four years making an animated movie, Larrikins \u2013 only for it to collapse when DreamWorks studio changed hands. Awful news for the Matilda composer, but good news for fans of musical comedy \u2013 of which Minchin is, with Flight of the Conchords, the world\u2019s funniest and most talented exponent. Subtitled Old Songs. New Songs. Fuck You Songs, the show tours his native Australia before hitting our shores in the autumn. Tour opens at Regent theatre, Ipswich, 15-16 October",

No longer pedestrian or merely functional, it gets burnished with symbolism. In looking at how we\u2019ve made a fetish of sleep, then, everything points to the bedroom. Wright\u2019s old-fashioned history, chronological and dutiful, describes every kind of bed you can imagine; palette beds, bunks and box beds; beds that are curtained, pillared and hoisted up on mounts, kingly beds, merchant\u2019s beds and pauper\u2019s beds, dormitory beds, hospital beds and modern mattresses. Wright finds it incredible that so simple an invention as the modern mattress was such a long time coming: attendant on the coil spring, invented in 1857.

Samuel Pepys emerges as a star in recording his nocturnal escapades (a lot of banter and disputation; sometimes reading, sometimes getting a haircut, sometimes consuming victuals with a friend). Ekirch\u2019s book is notable for busting the myth of the eight-hour solid stretch of sleep. His discussion of the pre-modern habit to take a first, then a second sleep, bedding down as darkness fell, but then rising at dawn for a couple of industrious hours before a much-needed top-up, swiftly began to look to my tired eyes like some pre-capitalist nirvana.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.museumofdreams.org/third-reich-of-dreams/\">The Third Reich of Dreams: The Nightmares of a Nation 1933-1939 by Charlotte Beradt</a><br></strong>Beradt was an unlikely sociologist.

It led her to wonder if her fellow countrymen and women, living in fear of the totalitarian Nazi regime, were similarly troubled in their sleep. So she began collecting their dreams. What emerges in this strange collection are the shared nighttime hauntings of a nation driven to paranoid self-doubt \u2013 and self-blame \u2013 by rigid intolerance and oppression.

Sacks worked with survivors of this epidemic 40 years later, after neurologists found that administering the drug levodopa could jolt the long-slumbering victims into periods of manic wakefulness. Some of them turned from real-life Rip Van Winkles into insomniacs, becoming enervated and hyper-alert, overly loquacious, overly familiar and, in one case, messianic.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fall-of-sleep.html\">The Fall of Sleep by Jean-Luc Nancy</a></strong><strong><br></strong>You require a taste for French academic writing, with its circular, self-referential and unremittingly highbrow language to get on with this book. It reads like a reverie \u2013 as if the logic and vistas of dreaming had taken up residence in Nancy\u2019s thinking mind. He had me, though, when he wrote that \u201cinsomnia is a kind of occupation of night\u201d. It is \u2013 a trespass and presumption, an infiltration and colonisation. In fact, Nancy\u2019s book is full of sharp little insights that chimed with me. I\u2019ll give you another: \u201c[In insomnia] I can\u2019t sing or make a noise.

Because what insomniacs lack is community; twisting awake in our own beds, we confront only ourselves. And what a collection this is. Russ Spaar places Plath next to Pushkin, Auden next to Bishop.

Bronfen is especially interested in the moral dimensions of night: its temptations, what it veils, its reckonings and revelations. In a wonderful chapter on film noir, she examines the way providence manifests itself in our lives (and our stories) \u2013 providence being a dark art, because its ways are unknown and cannot be seen, as opposed to the artificially lit world of noir, which illuminates the antihero\u2019s desire to manipulate events. This book delights in the potency of border-crossing and trespass, the wiles of nocturnality.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-poetics-of-sleep-9781441124760/\">The Poetics of Sleep, from Aristotle to Nancy by Simon Morgan Wortham</a><br></strong>The title of this book nods at Gaston Bachelard\u2019s The Poetics of Space \u2013 space, like sleep, being a quality we cannot grasp; another absence. Wortham asks how we can speak of a philosophy of sleep, given that philosophy studies consciousness: the very thing sleep forces us to relinquish. The book is full of heavyweights: Kant and Freud, Merleau-Ponty, Levinas, Bergson, Blanchot. It asks what kind of thinking dreaming is, and what kind of absence sleep represents.

The other three \u2013 I think two men and a woman \u2013 were stuck on the route and were clearly very shocked.\u201d A statement posted on the Lochaber mountain rescue team Facebook page said: \u201cThe team had to recover a young climber who unfortunately lost her life following an accident on C\u00e0rn Dearg on Ben Nevis. We pass on our sincere condolences to her family and friends. A very sad start to 2019.\u201d The team went on to thank the coastguard helicopter crew, adding: \u201cWe witnessed another example of exceptional flying getting the team into location to evacuate the casualty and in recovering her colleagues from a very difficult location.\u201d Bristol University said: \u201cIt is with great sadness that we can confirm that on 1 January 2019 one of our students died in an accident whilst on a hiking trip to Ben Nevis in Scotland. The student was part of a larger group of students who had organised this new year trip to the Highlands. \u201cOur hearts go out to the family and friends of this student. This tragic accident will be deeply felt across our university community, and we will make sure we have support available to all those affected.\u201d",

I didn\u2019t think I could do it. But, in 2005, due to ill health, I moved with my husband and daughter to Pett Level in East Sussex, to a white A-frame house perched on top of a cliff in a fairly isolated spot between Hastings and Rye.</p> <p>The grey Channel coursed and crashed relentlessly outside the back windows.

But its wellspring can be found in Australia, and it\u2019s worth joining the dots \u2013 there are lessons for the UK government as it flirts with exploiting a \u201cmigrant crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Let\u2019s step back to 1901, when the Immigration Restriction Act was passed in Australia. The law formed the basis of the \u201cWhite Australia\u201d policy, intended to exclude all non-Europeans from immigrating to the country. Support for this policy, in subsequent years, delivered electoral success.</p> <p>In the 1903 election campaign Alfred Deakin, leader of the Protectionist party \u2013 and one of the architects of the White Australia policy \u2013 argued for <a href=\"https://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches/1903-alfred-deakin\" title=\"\">the preservation of Australia\u2019s \u201ccomplexion\u201d</a>: Deakin was elected. Stanley Bruce, in the 1925 federal election, supported White Australia: he was re-elected, with an increased majority.</p> <p>But the policy came under scrutiny after indigenous soldiers defended the nation in the second world war and, after several changes in immigration law since 1947, White Australia was legally ended in 1973. </p> <p>In the following decade the nation\u2019s ethnic and cultural diversity increased, and it suited Australia. Until it didn\u2019t.</p> <p>In 1988, as leader of the Liberal opposition, John Howard called for a curb on Asian immigration. Later he publicly apologised, and <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/asian-influence-spices-up-contest/news-story/97b8077825a4a8c15a9fa2127a6207e4\" title=\"\">admitted in 2002 that he had been wrong</a>. </p> <p>Six months earlier, though, in November 2001, Howard had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/11/theobserver\" title=\"\">re-elected as prime minister</a>, in the wake of 9/11 \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/29/1\" title=\"\">the Tampa episode</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f26e26de02ad22f2c15eeac65b56e9e1f68c4a57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f26e26de02ad22f2c15eeac65b56e9e1f68c4a57/0_117_1526_916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescued asylum seekers on board the Norwegian cargo ship MS Tampa, August 2001\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescued asylum seekers on board the Norwegian cargo ship MS Tampa, August 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wallenius Wilhelmsen/PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-boat-that-changed-it-all-20110819-1j2o2.html\" title=\"\">August 2001</a>, the captain of the Norwegian freighter Tampa defied Canberra\u2019s instruction to stay outside Australian waters with his cargo of 433 asylum seekers who had been rescued from a sinking Indonesian boat, and headed for Australian waters. SAS troops seized control of the ship, and Howard introduced legislation to remove the Tampa and future unwelcome vessels. The opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley, having initially supported the government, opposed the new law and accused Howard of \u201cwedge politics\u201d. The bill was defeated.</p> <p>But the \u201cPacific solution\u201d was born: islands were cut from the Australian migration zone; detention centres were established on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/24/the-shame-of-the-evil-being-done-on-manus-will-outlive-us-all\" title=\"\">Manus Island</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/nauru-files\" title=\"\">Nauru</a>; the navy was deployed to intercept vessels carrying asylum seekers. Howard declared: \u201cWe will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.\u201d He was elected for a third term. It was ugly but effective, and supported by the opposition. The die was cast, and it is shaping events today.</p> <p>Fear of immigration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/voting-details-show-immigration-fears-were-paradoxical-but-decisive\" title=\"\">worked for the leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum</a>, and now it appears Britain is returning to the theme. On Monday the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/30/uk-and-france-pledge-drive-to-tackle-people-smuggling-in-channel\" title=\"\">accused the government</a> of exploiting the issue in the lead-up to the parliamentary Brexit vote this month.</p> <p>Still, while the UK government flirts with an old Australian electoral trope, history shows it\u2019s possible to do the right thing. In 1989, while Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke made a tearful promise to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. He had not consulted the cabinet. \u201cI was told: \u2018You cannot do that, Prime Minister.\u2019 I said to them, \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/01/cabinet-papers-1988-89-bob-hawke-acted-alone-in-offering-asylum-to-chinese-students\" title=\"\">I just did. It is done</a>.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The core principle of <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10\" title=\"\">the 1951 refugee convention</a> states that \u201crefugees should not be penalised for their illegal entry or stay\u201d and recognises \u201cthat the seeking of asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/31/this-is-the-only-way-now-desperate-iranians-attempt-channel-crossing\" title=\"\">Desperate people will take desperate measures</a> to secure safety.

Last week the home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared the number of people attempting to cross the Channel a \u201cmajor incident\u201d, though the numbers don\u2019t support such a claim. But that didn\u2019t deter the newspapers. \u201cHome secretary brings back two Border Force cutters to tackle migrant crisis,\u201d says the Metro. \u201cSajid Javid recalls two Border Force boats to patrol English Channel amid migrant crisis,\u201d the Evening Standard reports. \u201cMigrant crisis,\u201d the Sun shouts in capitals. \u201cTwo Border Force boats redeployed from the Med to patrol the Channel for migrants.\u201d The Daily Express joined in: \u201cMigrant crisis: 12 migrants detained at Kent beach ahead of Sajid Javid talks.\u201d And the Times: \u201cMigrant crisis: Sajid Javid sends extra boats to Channel.\u201d Scapegoating people fleeing violence and poverty is an all-too-familiar political sport in Europe and the US. But its wellspring can be found in Australia, and it\u2019s worth joining the dots \u2013 there are lessons for the UK government as it flirts with exploiting a \u201cmigrant crisis\u201d. Let\u2019s step back to 1901, when the Immigration Restriction Act was passed in Australia. The law formed the basis of the \u201cWhite Australia\u201d policy, intended to exclude all non-Europeans from immigrating to the country. Support for this policy, in subsequent years, delivered electoral success. In the 1903 election campaign Alfred Deakin, leader of the Protectionist party \u2013 and one of the architects of the White Australia policy \u2013 argued for the preservation of Australia\u2019s \u201ccomplexion\u201d: Deakin was elected. Stanley Bruce, in the 1925 federal election, supported White Australia: he was re-elected, with an increased majority. But the policy came under scrutiny after indigenous soldiers defended the nation in the second world war and, after several changes in immigration law since 1947, White Australia was legally ended in 1973. In the following decade the nation\u2019s ethnic and cultural diversity increased, and it suited Australia. Until it didn\u2019t. In 1988, as leader of the Liberal opposition, John Howard called for a curb on Asian immigration. Later he publicly apologised, and admitted in 2002 that he had been wrong. Six months earlier, though, in November 2001, Howard had been re-elected as prime minister, in the wake of 9/11 \u2013 and the Tampa episode. In August 2001, the captain of the Norwegian freighter Tampa defied Canberra\u2019s instruction to stay outside Australian waters with his cargo of 433 asylum seekers who had been rescued from a sinking Indonesian boat, and headed for Australian waters. SAS troops seized control of the ship, and Howard introduced legislation to remove the Tampa and future unwelcome vessels. The opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley, having initially supported the government, opposed the new law and accused Howard of \u201cwedge politics\u201d. The bill was defeated. But the \u201cPacific solution\u201d was born: islands were cut from the Australian migration zone; detention centres were established on Manus Island and Nauru; the navy was deployed to intercept vessels carrying asylum seekers. Howard declared: \u201cWe will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.\u201d He was elected for a third term. It was ugly but effective, and supported by the opposition. The die was cast, and it is shaping events today. Fear of immigration worked for the leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and now it appears Britain is returning to the theme. On Monday the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the government of exploiting the issue in the lead-up to the parliamentary Brexit vote this month. Still, while the UK government flirts with an old Australian electoral trope, history shows it\u2019s possible to do the right thing. In 1989, while Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke made a tearful promise to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. He had not consulted the cabinet. \u201cI was told: \u2018You cannot do that, Prime Minister.\u2019 I said to them, \u2018I just did. It is done.\u2019\u201d The core principle of the 1951 refugee convention states that \u201crefugees should not be penalised for their illegal entry or stay\u201d and recognises \u201cthat the seeking of asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules\u201d. Desperate people will take desperate measures to secure safety. But an individual\u2019s dignity is denied when a government resorts to posturing against weak opposition. Amid the political bluff and bluster, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of what\u2019s real. Humanity. \u2022 Russell Cunningham is a production editor on sport for the Guardian",

Now, with a federal election looming, he is gambling his parliamentary majority and political future on them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/justin-trudeau-canada-climate-change-fossil-fuels\">Canada: Trudeau on back foot as frustration builds over PM's climate strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Canadians cast their votes next October, they will do so amid standard electoral issues: jobs, the economy and foreign policy. But in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, a pair of politically fractious additions have risen to the top: carbon taxes and pipelines.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news for the prime minister is that when you ask Canadians who they think would make the best prime minister, he still has a comfortable advantage over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer,\u201d said Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster. \u201cThe bad news is that leading up to the next federal election right now, it\u2019s basically a coin toss between the Liberals and Conservatives.\u201d</p> <p>Canadians have shown an increasing concern for the environment, but in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, the results are often messy.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, as part of its pan-Canadian climate change strategy, the federal government required all provinces have a minimum level of carbon pricing. For those that fail to do so, the government will implement its own carbon tax, set to begin in July 2019.

      "bodyText": "In his four years leading Canada, the Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has gone to great lengths \u2013 at home and abroad \u2013 to bolster his environmental credentials. Now, with a federal election looming, he is gambling his parliamentary majority and political future on them. When Canadians cast their votes next October, they will do so amid standard electoral issues: jobs, the economy and foreign policy. But in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, a pair of politically fractious additions have risen to the top: carbon taxes and pipelines. \u201cThe good news for the prime minister is that when you ask Canadians who they think would make the best prime minister, he still has a comfortable advantage over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer,\u201d said Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster. \u201cThe bad news is that leading up to the next federal election right now, it\u2019s basically a coin toss between the Liberals and Conservatives.\u201d Canadians have shown an increasing concern for the environment, but in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, the results are often messy. Earlier in the year, as part of its pan-Canadian climate change strategy, the federal government required all provinces have a minimum level of carbon pricing. For those that fail to do so, the government will implement its own carbon tax, set to begin in July 2019. Already, the levy has fired up Trudeau\u2019s political opponents \u2013 at both the provincial and federal level. But the prime minister had been forced to fend off barbs from critics \u2013 including the left-of-centre New Democratic party and Indigenous communities, that any environmental goodwill he might have earned through his carbon tax has been sullied by the support for \u2013 and subsequent nationalisation of \u2013 an oil pipeline. \u201cThe only true test of a climate change plan, after all, is whether carbon is going up or down,\u201d said the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, in a statement about his frustrations with the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs from Alberta to the British Columbia coast. The result for Trudeau is a tricky path forward as he heads off attacks that he has done too little on the environment \u2013 or too much. \u201cTrudeau has moved from having an environment that was friendly and pliant to one that is more combative and hostile,\u201d said Nanos, pointing to a string of shifts to Conservative \u2013 or right-of-centre \u2013 provincial governments across the country since Trudeau was elected in 2015. Doug Ford, Ontario\u2019s premier, has repeatedly called carbon pricing \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d and at least five provinces have banded together to fight the tax in the courts, a battle legal experts believe they will lose.

This fight comes amid reports that Canada is not on pace to meet its 2030 climate goals. \u201cThe opposition or the politicians will convince people that the carbon price is hurting them, even though that\u2019s a lie,\u201d said Mark Jaccard, professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University.

With trembling and sometimes overloaded colour, and a touch that always seems nervous, there\u2019s anxiety and disquiet in his interiors and portraits of his wife, Marthe de M\u00e9ligny, taking her endless baths. Sometimes he catches himself in the bathroom mirror. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/press/press-releases/pierre-bonnard-colour-memory\">Tate recommends slowing down to appreciate Bonnard</a>, but you may feel a panic coming on. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/cc-land-exhibition-pierre-bonnard-colour-memory\">Tate Modern, London</a>, 23 January-6 May</em></p> <h2>Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing</h2> <p>Forget Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s paintings.

Just when you think he\u2019s the emptiest artist ever, he\u2019ll suddenly reveal a sly satirical insight into our time. He is also a fan of art history who refers wittily to Botticelli, Rubens and Giotto.

He worked in series, documenting people and places \u2013 beaches, parks and streets \u2013 in small but formally concise compositions.

In 1956, having suddenly decided to quit doing commercial work for magazines like Glamour and Vogue, Arbus began wandering the streets of New York photographing people whose otherness caught her eye. The show traces the formation of a visual style: part voyeuristic, part intimate documentary, that remains singular and still has the power to unsettle.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/diane-arbus-beginning\">Hayward Gallery, London</a>, 13 February-6 May</em></p> <h2>Irwin Blumenfeld</h2> <p>Born in Germany in 1897, Irwin Blumenfeld trained in the Netherlands and made his name as a fashion photographer in Paris in the 1930s. Initially shooting only in black and white, he experimented with double exposure, distortion and solarisation. In 1941, he relocated to New York and quickly established himself as one of the most acclaimed fashion photographers of the time, shooting in colour and using techniques borrowed from the surrealists. <a href=\"https://www.foam.org/museum/programme/erwin-blumenfeld\">This exhibition</a> focuses on the work he made in America between 1941 and 1960.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.foam.org/museum/programme/erwin-blumenfeld\">Foam Amsterdam</a>, 15 February-14 April</em></p> <h2>Milan Triennale: Broken Nature</h2> <p>Set in the newly restored galleries of the 1930s Palazzo dell\u2019Arte, <a href=\"http://www.brokennature.org/\">next year\u2019s Milan Triennale </a>will tackle our fraught relationship with the planet, going beyond the past two decades of \u201csustainable design\u201d to look at fundamental approaches of \u201crestorative design\u201d to avert our current collision course with environmental catastrophe.

The geniuses of the Renaissance put their passions into the art of the nude. Michelangelo gave some of his steamiest drawings to a young nobleman he adored. Titian, like his admirer Lucian Freud, slept with the women he painted.

In 1959, he studied under the great W Eugene Smith, and in 1963, his exhibition A Dialogue With Solitude established him as one of the first photographers to explore <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/arts/dave-heath-photographer-of-isolation-dies-at-85.html\">the sense of alienation and isolation</a> that many young people felt in postwar America. For this exhibition, his images are presented alongside three American cult films of the 1960s, each of which deal with the theme of solitude: Portrait of Jason by Shirley Clarke; Salesman by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Mitchell Zwerin; and The Savage Eye by Ben Maddow, Sidney Meyers and Joseph Strick.<br><em>Photographers Gallery, London, 8 March-9 June</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beafb69b58c4b742a65e1a9f98e1dadd9189e706\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beafb69b58c4b742a65e1a9f98e1dadd9189e706/340_578_3185_2446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MK Gallery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MK Gallery</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MK Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>New MK Gallery</h2> <p>It is always good to have a new art space outside London.

Eliasson thinks of his art as a progressive social experiment, but it is also just gorgeous and sublime. Fountains of light, mind-fooling shadowplays, kinetic conundrums and appropriated icebergs are among his astonishing spectacles. At the centre of his imagination is a fascination with light that makes him the JMW Turner of installation art.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson\">Tate Modern, London</a>, 11 July-5 January 2020</em></p> <h2>William Blake</h2> <p>The art of Blake rejects the observation of nature that fascinated his contemporary Constable and strives instead for an inner truth of cosmic light and galaxy-spanning drama. He wanted to paint like Michelangelo. The mythic characters he portrays, which come from his own poetry, are colossal nudes scaled down to the pages of illuminated books. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/william-blake-artist\">The sheer intensity to his vision</a> makes him a toweringly great artist.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/william-blake-artist\">Tate Britain, London</a>, 11 September-2 February 2020</em></p> <h2>Cars at the V&amp;A</h2> <p>Love them or hate them, cars have shaped the world around us like few other inventions.

They are full of symbolism and a bold abstract vision that anticipates Picasso.

However restrained and methodical her approach is, there is joyousness in her painting as well as formal innovation, pleasure as well as rigour.

Freud, catching his image in a shaving mirror or one above a mantelpiece, depicted what he saw as if it was someone else, or just a fleshy object. This disturbing way of seeing himself goes to the heart of the cold, ruthless truth-telling that makes him a genius of modern art. <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/lucian-freud-self-portraits\">This intimate encounter with a giant</a> will reveal his truly radical eye.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/lucian-freud-self-portraits\">Royal Academy, London, 27 October-26 January 2020</a></em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 2 January 2019 to correct the spelling of Rijksmuseum.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory More unsettling than they first appear, Pierre Bonnard\u2019s paintings are often thought of as celebrations of domestic tranquility. With trembling and sometimes overloaded colour, and a touch that always seems nervous, there\u2019s anxiety and disquiet in his interiors and portraits of his wife, Marthe de M\u00e9ligny, taking her endless baths. Sometimes he catches himself in the bathroom mirror. Tate recommends slowing down to appreciate Bonnard, but you may feel a panic coming on. Tate Modern, London, 23 January-6 May Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing Forget Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s paintings. Whatever people pay for them, it is in his drawings that you see his genius. Anatomy, flying machines, caricatures and visions of the deluge \u2013 it\u2019s all here in some of the greatest human artistic creations. The Queen is sending her unrivalled collection of these sublime sketches to 12 British cities for a simultaneous show that marks the 500th anniversary of the genius\u2019s death. Twelve museums across the UK, 1 February-6 May Don McCullin Comprised of more than 250 photographs, all printed by McCullin himself in his own darkroom, this retrospective features many of his iconic images of conflict from Vietnam, Biafra, Northern Ireland and, more recently, Syria. It also gathers a selection of his groundbreaking early documentary photographs of postwar London and the industrial north-east, as well as the more reflective later landscapes he has made in Somerset, where he now lives. Tate Britain, London, 5 February-6 May Tracey Emin The most outrageous of the 1990s Young British Artists continues her metamorphosis into an expressionist painter with an epic show of new canvases, drawings and sculpture that descend into dark depths of grief and loss. Emin, who recently won a commission to build a naked statue outside Oslo\u2019s new Munch museum, continues to find inspiration in northern artists from Munch to Rogier van der Weyden. Strong, honest confessions by an artist of soul and courage. White Cube Bermondsey, London, 6 February-7 April Jeff Koons The pop exuberance of Jeff Koons is a constantly unexpected funfair of banality and brilliance. Just when you think he\u2019s the emptiest artist ever, he\u2019ll suddenly reveal a sly satirical insight into our time. He is also a fan of art history who refers wittily to Botticelli, Rubens and Giotto. So it makes a surprising amount of sense that he is showing among the Ashmolean\u2019s Old Master paintings and Greek statues. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 7 February-9 June Luigi Ghirri: The Map and the Territory A retrospective of the work of a European pioneer of colour photography, who died in 1992 and has only recently been afforded the recognition he deserves. Having trained as a surveyor, Italian-born Ghirri\u2019s quiet, understated landscapes often approach the deadpan, but also possess a distinctive sense of place and time. He worked in series, documenting people and places \u2013 beaches, parks and streets \u2013 in small but formally concise compositions. The exhibition, the first to travel outside his native Italy, will bring together 200 early images from the 1970s. Jeu de Paume, Paris, 12 February-2 June Diane Arbus: In the Beginning First shown at the Met Breuer in New York in 2016, this must-see exhibition features more than 100 early works made by Diane Arbus from 1956\u201362, the majority of which have never been shown in Europe before. In 1956, having suddenly decided to quit doing commercial work for magazines like Glamour and Vogue, Arbus began wandering the streets of New York photographing people whose otherness caught her eye. The show traces the formation of a visual style: part voyeuristic, part intimate documentary, that remains singular and still has the power to unsettle. Hayward Gallery, London, 13 February-6 May Irwin Blumenfeld Born in Germany in 1897, Irwin Blumenfeld trained in the Netherlands and made his name as a fashion photographer in Paris in the 1930s. Initially shooting only in black and white, he experimented with double exposure, distortion and solarisation. In 1941, he relocated to New York and quickly established himself as one of the most acclaimed fashion photographers of the time, shooting in colour and using techniques borrowed from the surrealists. This exhibition focuses on the work he made in America between 1941 and 1960. Foam Amsterdam, 15 February-14 April Milan Triennale: Broken Nature Set in the newly restored galleries of the 1930s Palazzo dell\u2019Arte, next year\u2019s Milan Triennale will tackle our fraught relationship with the planet, going beyond the past two decades of \u201csustainable design\u201d to look at fundamental approaches of \u201crestorative design\u201d to avert our current collision course with environmental catastrophe. It promises a provocative range of projects, from living root bridges in India to a future of \u201cabove ground mining\u201d of electronic waste. Various venues, Milan, 1 March\u20131 September The Renaissance Nude Naked art never loses its edge. Nudes made 500 years ago can still provoke. And that\u2019s what makes this blockbuster such an exciting prospect. The geniuses of the Renaissance put their passions into the art of the nude. Michelangelo gave some of his steamiest drawings to a young nobleman he adored. Titian, like his admirer Lucian Freud, slept with the women he painted. This is the Renaissance without a fig leaf. Royal Academy, London, 3 March-2 June Hito Steyerl The Berlin-based artist\u2019s technological, post-internet art is often as funny as it is acute, in its critiques and parodies of power. Guided neighbourhood walks and digital animation, artificial intelligence and human thinking are all in there somewhere in a new collectively produced digital commission. Unscrambling her art is often as entertaining as it is dark and full of foreboding. Steyerl is an artist and documentarist of our times. Serpentine Sackler Gallery, London, 6 March-6 May Dave Heath Dave Heath served as a soldier in the Korean war before turning to photography. In 1959, he studied under the great W Eugene Smith, and in 1963, his exhibition A Dialogue With Solitude established him as one of the first photographers to explore the sense of alienation and isolation that many young people felt in postwar America. For this exhibition, his images are presented alongside three American cult films of the 1960s, each of which deal with the theme of solitude: Portrait of Jason by Shirley Clarke; Salesman by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Mitchell Zwerin; and The Savage Eye by Ben Maddow, Sidney Meyers and Joseph Strick. Photographers Gallery, London, 8 March-9 June New MK Gallery It is always good to have a new art space outside London. The MK Gallery has struggled a bit with inadequate exhibition space. A new development, designed by terrific architects 6a, in collaboration with artists Nils Norman and Gareth Jones, doubles the size of the current building, and it opens with a group exhibition, including Yinka Shonibare and Jeremy Deller, about the relationship between changing patterns of leisure and land ownership. Can\u2019t complain there\u2019s nothing to do in a new town now. Milton Keynes, opens 16 March Amager Resource Centre, Copenhagen by BIG &amp; SLA Architects A great metallic mountain for a country starved of hills, the ARC waste-to-energy incinerator will be the ultimate embodiment of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels\u2019 philosophy of \u201chedonistic sustainability\u201d \u2013 saving the planet while having fun doing so. Billed as the world\u2019s cleanest waste incinerator, the facility will be topped with a 600-metre-long ski slope, hiking trails and a climbing wall, while the chimney is planned to blow cheeky smoke rings of water vapour. Opens spring Windermere Jetty by Carmody Groarke Standing as a cluster of pitched-roof cabins huddled on the edge of Windermere in Cumbria, the new Museum of Boats, Steam and Stories will provide a window on to a world of steam launches, sailing yachts, motorboats and record-breaking speedboats. Designed by Carmody Groarke, the copper-clad buildings will include a wet dock, allowing the display of boats on water, and a boatyard where visitors will be able to see conservation in action. Opens in the spring Van Gogh and Britain More than simply recounting Van Gogh\u2019s years as a young man living in Stockwell, London, this exhibition looks at the artist\u2019s British influences \u2013 from John Constable to John Everett Millais, Charles Dickens and the Illustrated London News, and the engravings and other British graphic art he collected. Van Gogh in turn influenced Walter Sickert and David Bomberg, Matthew Smith and Francis Bacon. Tate Britain, London, 27 March-11 August National Museum of Qatar by Jean Nouvel Having only recently unveiled his huge celestial dome for the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, Jean Nouvel will be opening another colossal cultural beacon for its Gulf rival, Qatar. The sprawling complex takes the form of a series of interlocking discs, inspired by the blade-like petals of a desert rose crystal formation. It is a spectacularly strange thing, looking like a pileup of flying saucers at rush hour. Opens 28 March The Weston, Yorkshire Sculpture Park by Feilden Fowles Set into a hillside in a former quarry, the new Weston visitor centre promises to be a delightful addition to the bucolic Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Designed by up-and-coming young architects Feilden Fowles, the walls are constructed from layered pigmented concrete, evoking the strata of sandstone bedrock, while the roof is crowned with saw-tooth skylights, bringing filtered light into the gallery, restaurant and shop below. Opens 30 March The Shed, Hudson Yards, New York by Diller Scofidio + Renfro Nestled in the centre of the largest real estate development in American history, looking like a quilted Chanel handbag, the Shed will be an arts venue like no other. It will house two expansive galleries and a black-box theatre, along with a telescoping outer shell covered in a skin of translucent inflatable pillows, which will be able to extend out into a plaza to form a gaping hangar of a performance space. Opens April Alys Tomlinson: Ex Voto/Jan Wang Preston: Forest Young British photographer Alys Tomlinson won first prize in the Discovery category of the 2018 Sony World photography awards for her black and white series Ex Voto, which was shot at religious pilgrimage sites in France, Ireland and Poland. This exhibition gathers her austere but powerfully evocative landscapes, portraits and still lifes from the series. Also on show will be Yan Wang Preston\u2019s ambitious series Forest, which moves between rural areas and newly created cities to explore the often dismal reality behind the Chinese government\u2019s vast programme of conservation and urbanisation. Side Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, April AI: More than Human What does it mean to be human? Will machines outsmart us? These existential questions will be explored in an exhibition staged across a range of the Barbican\u2019s spaces. It will tell the rapidly evolving story of artificial intelligence, from its ancient roots in Japanese Shintoism, to Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage\u2019s early experiments in computing, to AI\u2019s major leaps from the 1940s to the present day. Featuring Lawrence Lek, Massive Attack, Neri Oxman and more. Barbican, London, 16 May-26 August Lee Krasner The cliche that American abstract expressionism is a peculiarly male art movement probably started with the critic Clement Greenberg\u2019s comparison of Jackson Pollock to a cowboy \u201classooing\u201d paint. This survey of the epic, energy-filled canvases of Pollock\u2019s wife, Lee Krasner, reveals not just her brilliance, but the way fields of colour liberated women as well as men to make a new kind of art. High time this terrific painter got her due. Barbican, London, 30 May-1 September Michael Rakowitz Rakowitz\u2019s extremely popular life-size replica of one of the gigantic monumental winged bulls that once guarded the gates of Nineveh in Iraq currently stands on Trafalgar Square\u2019s Fourth Plinth. Made from date syrup cans, it is part of the Iraqi-American artist\u2019s project to recreate all 7,000 objects looted from the Iraq Museum in 2003. This first European survey show presents the artist\u2019s depth and range. Middle Eastern Beatles fans, visionaries in Hungary and Afghan stone-carvers all get a look-in. Whitechapel Gallery, London, 3 June-25 August Keith Haring Full of life, bounce and vim, Keith Haring\u2019s art was funny and angry, vital and urgent. Everything came with an exclamation mark. Always accessible, his unmistakable art was never slight. Haring died aged 31, a victim of the 1980s Aids epidemic. A gay activist and agitator, educator and performer, Haring went from making chalk drawings on the New York subway to working with Madonna, Grace Jones and Vivienne Westwood, and opening pop-up shops filled with crawling babies, barking dogs, flying saucers and dancing condoms. Tate Liverpool, 14 June-10 November Urban Impulses: Latin American Photography 1962\u20132016 This survey of Latin American photography spans half a century and looks at the changing nature and contradictions of Latin American urban life. Featuring several hundred images from the collection of Leticia and Stanislas Poniatowski, it is a conceptually ambitious show that \u201cconsiders the real and imaginary life of the cities on the Latin American continent through works carried out by photographers involved in the creation of the conflicted Latin American identity.\u201d Includes work by Jos\u00e9 Moreno, Juan Enrique Bedoya and Jesus Ruiz Duran. Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London, 20 June-October Goldsmith Street social housing, Norwich, by Mikhail Riches After a long dearth of new social housing, 2019 will see a wave of council-led developments being completed across the country. One of the most impressive is Goldsmith Street, by Mikhail Riches architects, a scheme of 100 new homes designed as brick terraces along a traditional street pattern. Boldly led by Norwich city council, without a developer or housing association, the homes have been designed to Passivhaus energy standards \u2013 and will all be for social rent. Yorkshire Sculpture International Based on Phyllida Barlow\u2019s assertion that \u201csculpture is the most anthropological of the art forms\u201d, the so-called Yorkshire sculpture triangle comes alive, with sculptors from Yorkshire, German artist Wolfgang Laib and Jamaican-Canadian Tau Lewis at the Hepworth; American artist Rashid Johnson at the Henry Moore Institute, the great American sculptor David Smith at Yorkshire Sculpture Park and Nobuko Tsuchiya at Leeds Art Gallery. Including site-specific and newly commissioned works by Ay\u015fe Erkmen and Huma Bhabha in Leeds and Wakefield, you won\u2019t need to be an anthropologist to trip over a sculpture wherever you go. The Hepworth, Wakefield, Yorkshire Sculpture Park and Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, 22 June-29 September Cindy Sherman Cindy Sherman is an artist of multiple guises and dozens of roles. Taking us from her Untitled Film Stills 1977-80, with their central-casting Hollywood girls about town, feisty screwball bit-players, passers-by and vamps, to the frightening grotesqueries of her later clowns, wizened matriarchs, her sex pictures and her centrefolds, this promises a feast of fun and fear. Never was the dressing-up box used to greater effect. The real Cindy is in there somewhere, playing with her public images. National Portrait Gallery, London, 27 June-15 September Olafur Eliasson The artist famous for creating Tate Modern\u2019s indoor sun has plenty more tricks up his sleeve. Eliasson thinks of his art as a progressive social experiment, but it is also just gorgeous and sublime. Fountains of light, mind-fooling shadowplays, kinetic conundrums and appropriated icebergs are among his astonishing spectacles. At the centre of his imagination is a fascination with light that makes him the JMW Turner of installation art. Tate Modern, London, 11 July-5 January 2020 William Blake The art of Blake rejects the observation of nature that fascinated his contemporary Constable and strives instead for an inner truth of cosmic light and galaxy-spanning drama. He wanted to paint like Michelangelo. The mythic characters he portrays, which come from his own poetry, are colossal nudes scaled down to the pages of illuminated books. The sheer intensity to his vision makes him a toweringly great artist. Tate Britain, London, 11 September-2 February 2020 Cars at the V&amp;A Love them or hate them, cars have shaped the world around us like few other inventions. Over its short 130-year history, the car has revolutionised manufacturing, transformed the way we move and dramatically altered our environment. This major exhibition will take a broad look at the impact of car culture, with objects ranging from a 1900s driving coat by Burberry to Le Corbusier\u2019s Maison Citrohan, alongside a range of rare vehicles and futuristic concept cars. V&amp;A, London, 5 October-19 April 2020 Gauguin Portraits The strangeness and sharpness of Gauguin\u2019s modern world still make it utterly contemporary. In the globalised 21st century, his paintings of the end of traditional ways of life in rural France and the Pacific have greater depth than ever. This exhibition focuses on his portraits, but none of his images of people are straightforward. They are full of symbolism and a bold abstract vision that anticipates Picasso. This haunting artist is full of dark poetic insight. National Gallery, London, 7 October-26 January 2020 Rembrandt\u2013Vel\u00e1zquez In a unique collaboration between Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum and the Prado in Madrid, Rembrandt and Vel\u00e1zquez will be among the pairings of 17th-century paintings from the Netherlands and Spain, also including Zurbar\u00e1n and Vermeer, Hals and Ribera. This sounds like a killer show, a confrontation as much as a conversation between artistic cultures and sensibilities. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 11 October-19 January 2020 Bridget Riley It barely feels like 16 years since Riley\u2019s 2003 Tate Britain retrospective. Her art always feels as if it was made yesterday, or perhaps even tomorrow. She always refreshes the eye. However restrained and methodical her approach is, there is joyousness in her painting as well as formal innovation, pleasure as well as rigour. She delights in the erotics of abstract vision. Hayward Gallery, London, 23 October-26 January 2020 Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits Artists have long used mirrors to portray themselves. Freud, catching his image in a shaving mirror or one above a mantelpiece, depicted what he saw as if it was someone else, or just a fleshy object. This disturbing way of seeing himself goes to the heart of the cold, ruthless truth-telling that makes him a genius of modern art. This intimate encounter with a giant will reveal his truly radical eye. Royal Academy, London, 27 October-26 January 2020 This article was amended on 2 January 2019 to correct the spelling of Rijksmuseum.",

Eddie Jones has reminded us often enough that everything else is just sparring; that all that matters is the date of the final \u2013 2 November \u2013 and ensuring England are at their peak when the latest four-year cycle comes to an end. Except 2019 seems different, not least because there is so much uncertainty as to what will come next.

Consider that there were no northern hemisphere teams involved in the final two weeks of the 2015 World Cup and then that three of the top four positions in the world rankings are currently occupied by Ireland, Wales and England.</p> \n<p>New Zealand remain the team to beat but there was a wobble towards the end of 2018, raising questions as to whether the All Blacks are in decline, or at least approaching that stage. Which brings us back to the rugby landscape post-2019 and all its uncertainty. Four of the top six teams in the world will have a new head coach \u2013 including New Zealand \u2013 and there is a fair chance England and Australia will join them. The San Francisco agreement \u2013 hammered out in January last year \u2013 is due to begin in 2020 but precisely what the longer-term global calendar will look like remains unclear as talk of a World League continues.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/dec/02/rugby-union-world-cup-groups-stack-up\">Pools of intrigue: how the Rugby World Cup groups stack up | Paul Rees</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The argument in favour of it is financial, a response to the centralisation of power in the hands of the Premiership and French clubs. For it is naive to think that the rise in player salaries is going to slow down, as much as the Premiership claims its \u00a3230m windfall will not go on wages, and that will only weaken the southern hemisphere nations. The most fascinating subplot of the World Cup is whether New Zealand, South Africa and Australia can still prevail over market forces. Even if they do you wonder if they are just holding back the tide.</p> \n<p>But if there is uncertainty as to what will happen on the field, it is matched by the sense of a step into the unknown off it. The tournament\u2019s director, Alan Gilpin, has described this year\u2019s World Cup as the most challenging and it is easy to see why. To put it mildly the climate in Japan in September is changeable and the threat of earthquakes is only too apparent, not to mention that of typhoons that would also cause major disruption.

      "bodyText": "World Cups always feel like watersheds. Eddie Jones has reminded us often enough that everything else is just sparring; that all that matters is the date of the final \u2013 2 November \u2013 and ensuring England are at their peak when the latest four-year cycle comes to an end. Except 2019 seems different, not least because there is so much uncertainty as to what will come next. Put simply, no one really knows what the international landscape beyond Japan 2019 will look like and that only adds to the intrigue. There is plenty of intrigue already surrounding the first World Cup to be staged in Asia, away from the sport\u2019s traditional strongholds. Throw in the fact that Ireland have mounted a genuine challenge to New Zealand, the creeping sense that the balance of power is shifting from south to north and the narrative of Jones\u2019s return to Japan \u2013 sure to follow England\u2019s campaign every step of the way \u2013 and it is quite the melting pot. If it is too strong to say a new world order was established last year, it was certainly shaken. Consider that there were no northern hemisphere teams involved in the final two weeks of the 2015 World Cup and then that three of the top four positions in the world rankings are currently occupied by Ireland, Wales and England. New Zealand remain the team to beat but there was a wobble towards the end of 2018, raising questions as to whether the All Blacks are in decline, or at least approaching that stage. Which brings us back to the rugby landscape post-2019 and all its uncertainty. Four of the top six teams in the world will have a new head coach \u2013 including New Zealand \u2013 and there is a fair chance England and Australia will join them. The San Francisco agreement \u2013 hammered out in January last year \u2013 is due to begin in 2020 but precisely what the longer-term global calendar will look like remains unclear as talk of a World League continues. The argument in favour of it is financial, a response to the centralisation of power in the hands of the Premiership and French clubs. For it is naive to think that the rise in player salaries is going to slow down, as much as the Premiership claims its \u00a3230m windfall will not go on wages, and that will only weaken the southern hemisphere nations. The most fascinating subplot of the World Cup is whether New Zealand, South Africa and Australia can still prevail over market forces. Even if they do you wonder if they are just holding back the tide. But if there is uncertainty as to what will happen on the field, it is matched by the sense of a step into the unknown off it. The tournament\u2019s director, Alan Gilpin, has described this year\u2019s World Cup as the most challenging and it is easy to see why. To put it mildly the climate in Japan in September is changeable and the threat of earthquakes is only too apparent, not to mention that of typhoons that would also cause major disruption. There are a number of cultural differences too for players, coaches and spectators to overcome, including the need for tattoos to be covered up in public swimming pools and baths. Infrastructure is no longer the problem it once was and while Gilpin, concerned by the lack of progress with training facilities, was forced to give the organising committee a few reminders in late 2017, he is satisfied they are again on track. Problems with the host venues have been surpassed too, after the final was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama because the showpiece new stadium would not be ready in time. Instead it will be opened for the 2020 Olympics, which has the potential to act as either a distraction or added motivation to impress. Meanwhile, ticket sales are always a concern when major events enter new territory and the worry is that there will be plenty of empty seats at the less glamorous fixtures, hence the drive to encourage the 400,000-plus visitors to mix tourist pursuits with matches \u2013 come for rugby, stay for the ryokan. \u201cWe like to think of it as the most challenging because of the extent of the opportunity it gives us,\u201d said Gilpin. \u201cGoing somewhere as different in rugby terms as Japan, using this as we are trying to grow rugby in Asia, creates challenges we have not faced before.\u201d Much will depend on the success of the host nation and ultimately the Japanese public loves to get behind a winner.

Please do not doubt my passion, determination and my 110% commitment to the team, right until the last ball is kicked this season. We all feel that this is \u2018our year\u2019 and we are determined to achieve the best possible results in all competitions.\u201d He becomes the most expensive American player in history, with Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia stating her delight to have signed \u201cone of Europe\u2019s most sought-after young players\u201d. \u201cChristian has shown his quality during a fantastic spell in Germany and at just 20, we believe he has the potential to become an important Chelsea player for many years to come,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming him to Stamford Bridge in the summer and wish him and Dortmund every success for the remainder of the season.\u201d",

Its main point was that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/04/peterloo-massacre-bloody-clash-that-changed-britain\" title=\"\">massacre in Manchester in 1819</a> of campaigners for the reform of parliament, and in particular for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/03/perilous-question-antonia-fraser-review\" title=\"\">universal manhood suffrage</a>, had been more or less forgotten, even in the city itself. The claim provoked a rustle of dissent in the small provincial cinema where the film was showing, and expressions of disbelief in the pub afterwards. No one in either place claimed to be an expert, but plenty seemed to know something about the occasion when members of the 15th regiment of hussars and of the Manchester and Salford and Cheshire yeomanries charged into a crowd of unarmed protesters from Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale and other Lancashire towns as well as from Stockport, killing and wounding numbers of men and women who had been peacefully demonstrating.</p> <p>The protesters, indeed, had done all they could to make clear their peaceful intentions. About one in eight of them were women, many wearing white. They and the men they accompanied, dressed in their Sunday best, were conspicuously respectable, and making a display, as instructed, of their \u201cCleanliness, Sobriety, Order and Peace\u201d. They were unarmed, and though for weeks they had been learning military discipline under the instruction of former soldiers, using broom handles and walking sticks in lieu of muskets, they had surrendered their sticks without fuss as they marched into Manchester. The point of their drills was not to teach them how to resist the military, but to ensure that the civic authorities would have no reason to regard them as a disorganised rabble, a mob, and no excuse, therefore, to suppress the demonstration by force of arms. Yet in an attempt to justify the massacre, the Manchester magistrates claimed the meeting had been summoned for \u201cSeditious and Treasonable purposes\u201d.</p> <p>Some 16 of the protesters, among them women and children, were killed by the cavalry, who had sharpened their sabres before the fight they seemed determined to provoke. A further 650 or more were wounded \u2013 sabred or trampled by horses. By the end of the brief engagement, St Peter\u2019s Field, from which anything that could possibly be used as a missile had been carefully tidied away, was transformed from an orderly parade ground to a scene of bloody chaos. Samuel Bamford, the radical silk weaver, described it as follows: \u201cOver the whole field, were strewed caps, bonnets, hats, shawls, and shoes and other parts of male and female dress; trampled, torn, and bloody. The yeomanry had dismounted \u2013 some were easing their horses\u2019 girths, others adjusting their accoutrements; and some were wiping their sabres. Several mounds of human beings still remained where they had fallen, crushed down, and smothered.

Eight are adults, working long hours in low-paid jobs so they can send money home to their families. The ninth is a six-year-old boy.</p> <p>His name is Jerry and he shares a tiny bed with his mother, Neng. Jerry loves dancing, Peppa Pig and doughnuts. This small dark room is the only home he has known, as he\u2019s spent his life in hiding as a stateless child. Growing up without a birth certificate or any other identification means he has no access to education and has never visited a doctor. Officially, this little boy does not exist.</p> <p>Of the UAE\u2019s <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL\">9.4 million</a> inhabitants, about 70% are low-paid migrant labourers. As a vital part of the economy, they normally work in construction or retail, or as maids and taxi drivers.</p> <p>Neng was one of them. A decade ago she came to the UAE from the Philippines to work as a domestic maid but ran away because her employers were abusive, she says. Having no job meant losing her visa and living in the country illegally. She got involved with a man who took her into his home but then he threw her out after she got pregnant.</p> <p>Now pregnant outside of marriage, Neng knew she had broken the law in the UAE for a second time. Having sex outside of marriage is a crime under the country\u2019s Islamic laws, with convictions resulting in prison terms of up to one year.</p> <p>\u201cThe moment that you get pregnant, and you cannot tell anyone and you don\u2019t know what to do, it\u2019s a very big torture,\u201d says Neng.</p> <p>The legislation <a href=\"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/south-african-arrested-in-the-united-arab-emirates-because-his-fiancee-is-pregnant/\">prohibiting sex outside</a> marriage in the UAE is known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/hundreds-of-women-prosecuted-for-extramarital-sex-in-uae-finds-bbc\">Zina law</a> and is often rigorously enforced.

To them, deportation is like the end of their life,\u201d says Barney Almazar, a lawyer at Gulf Law, who provides legal aid to migrant workers in UAE.</p> <p>After carrying her baby to term having accessed no healthcare services, Neng gave birth to Jerry in a friend\u2019s apartment with the help of an informal midwife and without any pain relief.</p> <p>Unable to find a job through official channels, Neng eventually managed to find work as a housekeeper and nanny for a fellow Filipino family, who live in a house 10 minutes\u2019 walk from her home. Her employers know she\u2019s illegal and can therefore get away with paying her just AED 1,000 per month (\u00a3216) for working 10 hours a day, five days a week. Often she is not paid on time. But she has no rights and cannot complain to the authorities.</p> <p>With rent for their bed costing AED 500, the mother and son struggle to make ends meet. When she can, Neng tries to send AED 190 home to her family, who live in Zamboanga Sibugay, one of the Philippines\u2019 poorest provinces. This small amount of money is enough to compel her to stay in Dubai.</p> <p>Neng and Jerry\u2019s bed is a lower bunk, just under a metre wide. Makeshift curtains made of bedsheets hang over the front of the bunks to provide a little privacy. Meals are eaten in the room, and cockroaches and other bugs scuttle across the floor.</p> <p>These living conditions have blighted Jerry\u2019s childhood. He is often overwhelmed with worry, which makes him ill. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019m sick but I can\u2019t get better,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Neng is preparing to surrender to the authorities, which will allow her to leave after serving a jail sentence, and obtain exit visas for herself and Jerry. Despite her difficult life in Dubai, she is reluctant to return home. The future there seems even more bleak to her. Her extended family don\u2019t have room to accommodate them and extreme poverty in her province will make life difficult.</p> <p>Fearful of being caught by the police and unable to look after their children while working, many of these unmarried new mothers resort to abandoning their babies, leaving others in the community to look after them.</p> <p>One such informal adoptive mother is Joanna*. She is a Filipina nurse and has been living in Dubai for 10 years. For the past 15 months she\u2019s been bringing up a baby girl called Rosamie*.</p> <p>Joanna lives in a room with five other women in the Al-Karama area of Dubai. A year-and-a-half ago a newborn baby girl appeared in the room. The mother was a friend of her roommate and, after leaving the baby, she became uncontactable. \u201cIt was 1am and [the baby] was crying and had been left alone,\u201d says Joanna.

She is also very well looked after. The talkative little girl can sing her ABCs and speak English in sentences. She loves wearing dresses and her favourite toy is a doll that she calls Baby Princess. Each night Rosamie and Joanna sing You Are My Sunshine to each other before going to sleep.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of being her mother. I always tell her that I love her very much,\u201d Joanna says. \u201cShe\u2019s so very sweet, she\u2019s lovely. I want her to have a normal future, not like this.\u201d</p> <p>Joanna is very aware she could be jailed for keeping a baby that is not legally hers. She is desperate to find a way to legally adopt Rosamie but only Emirati nationals are permitted to adopt children in the UAE.</p> <p>Other women looking after abandoned children in Dubai have approached Joanna, looking for advice. \u201cSo many kids here don\u2019t have documents,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is almost impossible to know how many parents and children are in the same position as Neng and Jerry across the country. Each month, about 40 mothers with children born out of wedlock seek advice and assistance from the Philippines Consulate in Dubai and the embassy in Abu Dhabi, according to a spokesperson for the consulate. This figure is likely to be a fraction of the number of mothers who are living in hiding in the country with their children, Almazar says.</p> <p>At present, child and baby facilities in Dubai\u2019s jails are full, because of the high number of mothers who have come forward to surrender, so that they could leave the country after completing a custodial sentence. This has created a backlog of cases, the spokesperson says.</p> <p>Yet there are signs of hope for these families. The <a href=\"https://www.dfwac.ae/\">Dubai Foundation for Women and Children</a> is a government-run charity and shelter, which, in addition to rehabilitating human trafficking victims and caring for abandoned or orphaned children, deals with \u201ctens\u201d of cases of mothers who have had babies out of wedlock a year, says Ghanima Hassan Al-Bahri, its care and social services director. In all of the cases the foundation has worked on, the courts have been flexible and the mother has not served a jail term.

Michael Barker was quick to suggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/englische-woche/2016/feb/26/hoffenheim-bundesliga-germany-julian-nagelsmann\">Hoffenheim</a>. \u201cTechnically, it\u2019s a village of under 3,500 people, while the area as a suburb has a population of 35,439. The Rhein-Neckar-Arena holds 30,150. This comes out as either 861% (village) or a more reasonably speaking 85% (suburb).\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s Graeme Coleman: \u201cZeleziarne Podbrezova play in the Slovakian Fortuna League at the Zelpo Ar\u00e9na (capacity 4,061) in the town of Podbrezov\u00e1 (population 4,171). This means that just over 97% of the population can fit inside.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/19/what-is-longest-boxing-day-away-trip-football-team-has-made-the-knowledge\">What is the longest Boxing Day away trip a football team has made? | The Knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHow about Stade Bollaert-Delelis,\u201d suggests Tabascu Radu. \u201cThe home of Lens has a capacity of 38,058 and can fit the whole city (population 31,398) in it and have just shy of 7,000 seats left open for travelling fans. So, 122% of the population.\u201d</p> <p>Guffen Helleve has a worthy offering in Sogndal: \u201cThey have been yoyo-ing between the two top tiers in Norway since 1982. Their hometown of Sogndalsfj\u00f8ra has a population of 3,943. Their ground, Fosshaugane Campus, has a capacity of 5,523. That\u2019s 140%.\u201d Staying in Scandinavia, William Jansen throws Herf\u00f8lge Boldklub into the mix. \u201cThey won the Danish championship in 2000 with their ground having a capacity of 8,000. Herf\u00f8lge is tiny, population 7,000, and their team has long since been relegated from the top flight. The stadium holds 114% of the population.\u201d</p> <p>Honourable mentions go to Ross County of Dingwall, population 5,491, capacity 6,541. \u201cThat\u2019s 119% of the population at Victoria Park,\u201d writes Adam Harcus. And Adam Rodriques throws Pusk\u00e1s Acad\u00e9mia, of the Hungarian top flight, into the mix. \u201cThey\u2019re from the town of Felcs\u00fat (population 1,800) and play in a stadium that seats 3,800. So that\u2019s 211% of the population.\u201d</p> <p>But we think we have a more wholesome winner than Hoffenheim. Step forward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/feb/07/nieciecza-the-speck-on-a-map-mixing-it-with-polish-footballs-heavy-hitters\">Bruk-Bet Termalica Nieciecza</a>, the Polish side from the village of Nieciecza (population around 700), who spent a couple of seasons in the top flight in 2016 and 2017 and who play in a newly-built 4,595-capacity stadium. That means there is room for 656% of the village population. Not as great a percentage as Hoffenheim, but with the ground being in the village itself, perhaps the crown belongs to them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Derby nicknames</h2> <p><strong>\u201cThe recent Port Vale v Stoke City U21s Checkatrade Trophy match has been jokingly referred to as \u2018</strong><em><strong>El Cer\u00e1mico</strong></em><strong>\u2019,\u201d</strong> begins Derrick Cameron. <strong>\u201cAlong with more famous examples such as the \u2018Old Firm\u2019, \u2018</strong><em><strong>El Cl\u00e1sico</strong></em><strong>\u2019 and the \u2018</strong><em><strong>Supercl\u00e1sico</strong></em><strong>\u2019, what other derby games are known by their nicknames rather than by a location?\u201d</strong></p> <p>Let\u2019s get the ball rolling by heading to the fertile flatlands of East Anglia where Norwich v Ipswich is referred to as the Old Farm.

      "bodyText": "\u201cKilmarnock has a population of 46,350. Rugby Park holds 17,899. My maths makes that their stadium can hold 38% of the town,\u201d writes Paul Savage. \u201cAre there any other high-flying clubs that dominate their respective populace?\u201d We received loads of suggestions. Michael Barker was quick to suggest Hoffenheim. \u201cTechnically, it\u2019s a village of under 3,500 people, while the area as a suburb has a population of 35,439. The Rhein-Neckar-Arena holds 30,150. This comes out as either 861% (village) or a more reasonably speaking 85% (suburb).\u201d Here\u2019s Graeme Coleman: \u201cZeleziarne Podbrezova play in the Slovakian Fortuna League at the Zelpo Ar\u00e9na (capacity 4,061) in the town of Podbrezov\u00e1 (population 4,171). This means that just over 97% of the population can fit inside.\u201d \u201cHow about Stade Bollaert-Delelis,\u201d suggests Tabascu Radu. \u201cThe home of Lens has a capacity of 38,058 and can fit the whole city (population 31,398) in it and have just shy of 7,000 seats left open for travelling fans. So, 122% of the population.\u201d Guffen Helleve has a worthy offering in Sogndal: \u201cThey have been yoyo-ing between the two top tiers in Norway since 1982. Their hometown of Sogndalsfj\u00f8ra has a population of 3,943. Their ground, Fosshaugane Campus, has a capacity of 5,523. That\u2019s 140%.\u201d Staying in Scandinavia, William Jansen throws Herf\u00f8lge Boldklub into the mix. \u201cThey won the Danish championship in 2000 with their ground having a capacity of 8,000. Herf\u00f8lge is tiny, population 7,000, and their team has long since been relegated from the top flight. The stadium holds 114% of the population.\u201d Honourable mentions go to Ross County of Dingwall, population 5,491, capacity 6,541. \u201cThat\u2019s 119% of the population at Victoria Park,\u201d writes Adam Harcus. And Adam Rodriques throws Pusk\u00e1s Acad\u00e9mia, of the Hungarian top flight, into the mix. \u201cThey\u2019re from the town of Felcs\u00fat (population 1,800) and play in a stadium that seats 3,800. So that\u2019s 211% of the population.\u201d But we think we have a more wholesome winner than Hoffenheim. Step forward Bruk-Bet Termalica Nieciecza, the Polish side from the village of Nieciecza (population around 700), who spent a couple of seasons in the top flight in 2016 and 2017 and who play in a newly-built 4,595-capacity stadium. That means there is room for 656% of the village population. Not as great a percentage as Hoffenheim, but with the ground being in the village itself, perhaps the crown belongs to them. Derby nicknames \u201cThe recent Port Vale v Stoke City U21s Checkatrade Trophy match has been jokingly referred to as \u2018El Cer\u00e1mico\u2019,\u201d begins Derrick Cameron. \u201cAlong with more famous examples such as the \u2018Old Firm\u2019, \u2018El Cl\u00e1sico\u2019 and the \u2018Supercl\u00e1sico\u2019, what other derby games are known by their nicknames rather than by a location?\u201d Let\u2019s get the ball rolling by heading to the fertile flatlands of East Anglia where Norwich v Ipswich is referred to as the Old Farm. Over in Ireland, Gary Keating writes: \u201cIn this year\u2019s edition of the FAI Cup, two non-league sides whose roots lay in public transport were drawn to play each other. Dublin Bus (bus drivers, unsurprisingly) v CIE Ranch (train drivers). The match was dubbed \u2018El Traffico\u2019 \u2013 cue many jokes about gaining entry with your travel card, the match not going to start on time, etc.\u201d And a bus being parked. More than 5,000 miles west, when LA Galaxy and LAFC meet in MLS, the same nickname is used, owing to the heavily congested highways between the grounds. \u201cWest Ham v Millwall is known as the Dockers\u2019 Derby, due to the origins of both teams spawning from rival docking firms,\u201d writes Jack Hart. \u201cThe rural setting for Forest Green Rovers v Cheltenham means that it is known, round these parts at least, as \u2018El Glossico\u2019,\u201d adds Rudy Carroll. Rory Macpherson writes: \u201c\u2018El Kessocko\u2019 is the affectionate name given to the derby between Inverness Caledonian Thistle v Ross County. So named because the Kessock Bridge spans the Moray Forth, which separates the Highland teams.\u201d Serie A is great for nickname derbies. Here\u2019s Eoin Byrne: \u201cThere\u2019s the Derby della Madonnina in Milan, in honour of the statue in the Duomo, the Derby della Lanterna between Sampdoria and Genoa, in honour of Genoa lighthouse and the Derby del Sole (derby of the sun) between Roma and Napoli, because of their climates.\u201d There are \u201ceternal derbies\u201d in eastern Europe and Greece, owing to the length of the Red Star v Partizan and Panathinaikos v Olympiakos rivalries, while sticking with Greece, AEK v PAOK is known as the Derby of the Two-Headed [Eagles] as both clubs share the same emblem.

Alternatively, it may mark the point where prestige TV finally overreaches itself. We\u2019ll find out this year. <br><em>Summer</em></p> <h2>Beecham House</h2> <p><strong>(ITV)</strong> ITV has so far struggled to find a ratings-winning replacement for Downton Abbey, but might this new period drama fit the bill?

All we know at the moment is that Graham will be a balaclava man, part of the murky group of criminals whose MO is killing someone you have been intimate with, smearing your DNA on the body, putting the cadaver in a freezer and threatening to ruin your life by framing you unless you obey their instructions. The last season dangled the prospect that the corruption that AC-12 has been sniffing out could be very close to home.

What we do know is that it will see Ross (Aidan Turner) ditch Westminster to return to Cornwall, though the arrival of a friend in need will force him to once again take on the forces of the establishment, not least \u2013 one suspects \u2013 the nefarious George Warleggan.

And, from what little information exists, it may be a bumpy ride. \u201cWe got to the last scene of the sixth episode and really, really embarrassingly, I kind of lost my shit a little bit,\u201d Sharon Horgan revealed back in September. Start date: 7 January Brexit: The Uncivil War (Channel 4) AKA Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Brexit film. Playwright James Graham has written this two-hour drama based on firsthand accounts of both the Remain and Leave movements. Cumberbatch plays the latter\u2019s campaign director, Dominic Cummings. Co-starring Rory Kinnear, Richard Goulding and Oliver Maltman, Brexit: The Uncivil War promises to tell the tale of an epic game of cat and mouse \u2013 albeit a game where the cat eats the mouse and then poops all over your living room carpet. See Mark Lawson\u2019s feature on Brexit TV. 7 January True Detective series 3 (Sky Atlantic/Now TV) True Detective season 1 was a game-changing piece of drama that existed at the meeting point between incredible writing, beautiful acting and sublime direction. True Detective 2 also existed. Hopefully, next year\u2019s third series will be a return to form. The trailers \u2013 featuring Moonlight\u2019s Mahershala Ali hopping backwards and forwards in time \u2013 look like vintage True Detective. Even more excitingly, one episode counts Deadwood creator David Milch as a co-writer. January Fleabag series 2 (BBC Three) At this point, Phoebe Waller-Bridge can basically write her own cheques. For any other writer, Killing Eve would have been an all-time career highlight, but Fleabag remains her masterpiece. The first series was so perfectly self-contained, hinging on a flawlessly executed final-episode revelation, that it\u2019s hard to know where a second series could go. But doubt Waller-Bridge at your peril. The woman can even fart on command. This will be unmissable. February This Time \u2026 with Alan Partridge (BBC One) Incredibly, Alan Partridge has been away from the BBC for 15 years. He\u2019s been no slouch in the meantime, making films, writing books and starring in several perplexingly underwatched Sky specials, but this still feels like a homecoming. Not a vast amount is known about This Time \u2026 with Alan Partridge, except that it seems to be an extended One Show riff that will at least momentarily see Partridge standing inside a giant petri dish. This cannot come soon enough. February Game of Thrones series 8 (Sky Atlantic/Now TV) Finally, winter is here. After years of interpersonal squabbling, the rulers of Westeros must finally face the full force of the Night King and his White Walkers, and by all accounts it will be spectacular. Playing out across six ludicrously expensive feature-length episodes that utilise more SFX than ever, this looks set to become the high watermark of everything that television as spectacle can accomplish. April Home (Channel 4) After last year\u2019s well-received Comedy Blap (Channel 4\u2019s fancy name for a short, if you were wondering), Rufus Jones\u2019s sitcom about a family who unknowingly return from a holiday in France with a Syrian refugee (Youssef Kerkour) in their boot receives a full series. Its tone is gentle rather than stridently satirical \u2013 understandable given the subject matter \u2013 but the gags are strong, the performances are likeable and the issues depicted could not be more timely. April The Virtues (Channel 4) Shane Meadows projects are usually funny until they\u2019re not. Punks and skinheads are all having a laugh, until they\u2019re infiltrated by fascists. That creepy guy who is trying to woo your sister is harmless, until he turns out to be unhinged. But with The Virtues, Meadows seems to have reversed the formula. It tells the story of a labourer (played by Stephen Graham) \u2013 born in Ireland, put into care and then escaped to England \u2013 who goes back to deal with his demons. It\u2019s bracing stuff, but in true Meadows fashion there\u2019s humour interspersed with the grit. Told partly in flashback scenes filmed on handheld VCR cameras, it is visually ambitious \u2013 and Graham is magnetic as a man trying to overcome a painful history.

This retelling of the biggest manmade disaster ever will focus on the people who tried to deal with immediate aftermath: in some cases to cover it up, and in others to ensure it could never happen again. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Boris Shcherbina, the Soviet official charged with handling the fallout, Emily Watson is a nuclear scientist who wants to find out why the disaster happened and Jared Harris plays Valery Legasov, the Soviets\u2019 man on the ground after the crisis. May Derry Girls series 2 (Channel 4) The first series of Lisa McGee\u2019s Derry Girls was a monster of a show \u2013 Channel 4\u2019s biggest new comedy in five years. A classic sitcom premise married to some timely 1990s nostalgia, where all the teens-go-mad action was flanked by the constant shadow of the Troubles. It\u2019s such a perfect formula that a second series cannot feasibly disappoint. Spring Gentleman Jack (BBC One) Sally Wainwright stays in West Yorkshire, but swaps Hebden Bridge for Halifax as she tells the story of Anne Lister, the 19th-century figure often referred to as the \u201cfirst modern lesbian\u201d. Suranne Jones plays Lister, who became the head of a powerful family after the death of her four brothers in 1826. The eight-part series tells the story of her rise and eventual marriage to Ann Walker, an heiress of a neighbouring estate. It looks set to be one of the highlights of 2019. Spring MotherFatherSon (BBC Two) The headline of MotherFatherSon is that it stars Richard Gere in the first major television role of his career, playing a Rupert Murdoch figure in a series that sounds thematically similar to last year\u2019s Succession. But the real draw is its writer: Tom Rob Smith wrote the breathtaking American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and if he can bring even a fraction of that show\u2019s claustrophobic tension to MotherFatherSon, it\u2019ll be incredible. Spring Catch-22 (Channel 4) Long regarded as unfilmable \u2013 despite Mike Nichols\u2019 perfectly serviceable 1970 adaptation \u2013 Joseph Heller\u2019s black comedy is now coming to TV. Starring Christopher Abbott as Yossarian and co-starring Hugh Laurie and George Clooney (who also directs some episodes), Catch-22 has the potential to finally nail what was so special about Heller\u2019s novel. Alternatively, it may mark the point where prestige TV finally overreaches itself. We\u2019ll find out this year. Summer Beecham House (ITV) ITV has so far struggled to find a ratings-winning replacement for Downton Abbey, but might this new period drama fit the bill? Created by Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) it follows residents of a 19th-century Delhi mansion owned by John Beecham, a former soldier haunted by the misdeeds he witnessed working for the East India Company. Set during the era when the British were battling for dominance over India, it should provide a pointed corrective to the dewy-eyed empire reminiscence being peddled as Brexit looms. Date tbc Big Little Lies series 2 (Sky Atlantic/Now TV) HBO\u2019s whodunnit was one of 2017\u2019s standouts with its tense thriller aspect butting up against a tale of small-town myopia and rivalry. The second season sees Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e try to repeat the feat while upping the stakes, as Meryl Streep joins Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon as Perry\u2019s mother. She\u2019s in town to find out what happened to her departed son, and she\u2019ll need all her sleuthing to get past southern California\u2019s scheming elementary-school parents. Black Mirror series 5 (Netflix) After a mixed fourth series full of more needless baby murders than anyone could ever really want, Charlie Brooker\u2019s tech-horror anthology is back for another run. Everyone is keeping tight-lipped about what this new series has in store, but we got a festive sneak preview in the form of Bandersnatch \u2013 the Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive episode where you pick the fate of the protagonist from a number of different but equally harrowing options. Date tbc Catherine the Great (Sky/Now TV) Following in the regal wake of The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots comes the story of the Russian monarch who reigned in the 18th century. Helen Mirren stars as the titular ruler in a show which looks as if it has all the hallmarks of a prestige drama (big-name star, large budget, co-production with HBO). The four-parter will focus on the end of Catherine\u2019s reign and her affair with Grigory Potemkin, which promises to be salacious and shocking. Date tbc The Crown series 3 (Netflix) The second regal performance of the year from Olivia Colman, though one that\u2019s a world away from her gout-ridden, lobster-racing Queen Anne of The Favourite. She takes over from Claire Foy as Elizabeth II, as Peter Morgan\u2019s monarchical saga moves into the mid-60s \u2013 a turbulent time for the house of Windsor, with Princess Margaret (now played, in a note-perfect piece of casting, by Helena Bonham Carter) attracting column inches for her affair with baronet Roddy Llewellyn. Also joining the cast this time around are Tobias Menzies as a now middle-aged Prince Philip, and Jason Watkins, playing Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Date tbc Good Omens (Amazon/BBC2) Fantasy credentials don\u2019t come much better than those of this Amazon series, which has been adapted by Neil Gaiman from the novel he co-wrote with the late Terry Pratchett. It stars David Tennant as a raffish demon who has formed an unlikely 6,000-year friendship with Michael Sheen\u2019s buttoned-down angel. When a looming apocalypse threatens their bromance, the pair team up to save the world. Psychedelic visuals, epic set-pieces and some wild hairpieces sported by Tennant suggest this could be a blast. If that doesn\u2019t sate your appetite, there\u2019s season two of Gaiman\u2019s other epic fantasy, American Gods, which comes back in March. Date tbc Line of Duty series 5 (BBC One) Stephen Graham has been lined up as the latest villain in Jed Mercurio\u2019s police corruption saga, Line of Duty. All we know at the moment is that Graham will be a balaclava man, part of the murky group of criminals whose MO is killing someone you have been intimate with, smearing your DNA on the body, putting the cadaver in a freezer and threatening to ruin your life by framing you unless you obey their instructions. The last season dangled the prospect that the corruption that AC-12 has been sniffing out could be very close to home. In true Mercurio fashion, Graham\u2019s suspect may be a classic bit of misdirection. Date tbc Poldark series 5 (BBC One) Series four of everyone\u2019s favourite chest-baring period drama ended with a jolting death that suggested the cosy Sunday-night staple still has the capacity to shock. Might more surprises be in store for its fifth and final run? What we do know is that it will see Ross (Aidan Turner) ditch Westminster to return to Cornwall, though the arrival of a friend in need will force him to once again take on the forces of the establishment, not least \u2013 one suspects \u2013 the nefarious George Warleggan. A final reckoning between the two surely awaits. Date tbc \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2019 to reflect the fact that Black Mirror released the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure episode, Bandersnatch, on 28 December 2018.",

Some of the country\u2019s leading Muslim religious leaders \u2013 Kosovo is 95% Muslim \u2013 say dozens of mosques that were destroyed still haven\u2019t been rebuilt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac089752860f01556963e501e2606bf05c13f619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac089752860f01556963e501e2606bf05c13f619/187_0_5625_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Six years after it was laid, the cornerstone of Pristina\u2019s planned central mosque is covered with graffiti in an overgrown parking lot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Six years after it was laid, the cornerstone of Pristina\u2019s planned central mosque is covered with graffiti in an overgrown parking lot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Colborne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn Europe they don\u2019t have a single village without a church, but here in Kosovo are at least 50 villages without a mosque,\u201d remarks chief mufti Naim T\u00ebrnava in his offices near the city\u2019s Imperial Mosque. On Islamic holidays, the throng of worshippers at this Ottoman-era mosque, built in 1461, often spills on to the street outside. T\u00ebrnava is taken aback by the heated debate over Pristina\u2019s new mosque \u2013 for him, it is a practical necessity, \u201cfor the worship of God, and nothing else\u201d.</p> <p>Kosovo is still struggling to carve out a place for itself in a restive part of Europe amid poor economic prospects.

Kosovo plays no small role in Turkey\u2019s imperial history: the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 saw the defeat of the medieval Kingdom of Serbia and the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of south-eastern Europe.

Some locals resent what they see as a symbol of Turkey\u2019s overbearing influence, while others are suspicious of the creeping return of faith to a secular, post-socialist public space. <br><br>Among the project\u2019s most vocal opponents are local architects. Even though the public tender stressed the need for an original building, the design chosen is classical Ottoman. The project is being overseen by the Turkish state\u2019s directorate for religious affairs, Diyanet, which has built dozens of other mosques across the Islamic world in recent years, in a move some describe as a key vehicle of Turkey\u2019s power play.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tdv.org/Media/files/Tan%C4%B1t%C4%B1m%20Kataloklar%C4%B1/Camilerimiz_EN.pdf\">Diyanet says</a> the mosque will be based on the famous 16th-century Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, north-western Turkey. In short, Pristina\u2019s new mosque will more closely resemble the hundreds built across the Balkans under Turkish rule \u2013 only much larger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/XaaWTbSOIB/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "It is six years since Islamic leaders and government officials laid the cornerstone of Pristina\u2019s new central mosque \u2013 a slab of stone now hidden beneath weeds in a parking lot. Pulling back the weeds reveals it is covered with bright red graffiti \u2013 death threats to Kosovo\u2019s chief mufti, along with the words: \u201cNo Turkish mosque or there will be blood.\u201d There has been controversy over the design, including rejection of plans drawn by esteemed architects including Zaha Hadid in favour of a hulking carbon copy of any number of centuries-old, Ottoman-style mosques. But now it seems this spot in the city\u2019s Dardania district will finally get its new mosque. Construction is to begin in spring. The mosque is a gift from Turkey to this Balkan state of 1.8 million, which celebrated its 10th anniversary of independence this year. The decade has been fraught. Twenty years after the war with neighbouring Serbia that killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands more, Serbia still considers Kosovo its territory. Some of the country\u2019s leading Muslim religious leaders \u2013 Kosovo is 95% Muslim \u2013 say dozens of mosques that were destroyed still haven\u2019t been rebuilt. \u201cIn Europe they don\u2019t have a single village without a church, but here in Kosovo are at least 50 villages without a mosque,\u201d remarks chief mufti Naim T\u00ebrnava in his offices near the city\u2019s Imperial Mosque. On Islamic holidays, the throng of worshippers at this Ottoman-era mosque, built in 1461, often spills on to the street outside. T\u00ebrnava is taken aback by the heated debate over Pristina\u2019s new mosque \u2013 for him, it is a practical necessity, \u201cfor the worship of God, and nothing else\u201d. Kosovo is still struggling to carve out a place for itself in a restive part of Europe amid poor economic prospects. The young state needs all the friends it can get. Among its suitors is Turkey, which has made huge investments there and been a firm advocate for its international recognition and eventual accession to Nato and the EU. As the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, put it in a 2013 visit to the country: \u201cTurkey is Kosovo, and Kosovo is Turkey.\u201d Those words resonate in a Turkey whose assertive foreign policy has been characterised as \u201cneo-Ottomanism\u201d. Kosovo plays no small role in Turkey\u2019s imperial history: the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 saw the defeat of the medieval Kingdom of Serbia and the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of south-eastern Europe. The empire went on to rule Kosovo for nearly 500 years, bringing with it Islam and many other cultural influences. A large mosque wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in Pristina, so why the controversy? When the then mayor of Pristina, Isa Mustafa, laid the foundation stone, land had already been donated by the local municipality. Mustafa went on to become Kosovo\u2019s prime minister, a position he held until last year, but the mosque was never built. The city\u2019s Islamic community claims it took a long time to select the winning design and make sure it would \u201cfit the location\u201d. Pristina\u2019s municipal government dragged its feet in approving the mosque, but this year finally granted permission, subject to a construction permit. Opposition to many new mosques across Europe is rooted in fear of Islam, but with 19 of every 20 people here Muslim, resistance to Pristina\u2019s new mosque does not fit neatly into that trend. Some locals resent what they see as a symbol of Turkey\u2019s overbearing influence, while others are suspicious of the creeping return of faith to a secular, post-socialist public space. Among the project\u2019s most vocal opponents are local architects. Even though the public tender stressed the need for an original building, the design chosen is classical Ottoman. The project is being overseen by the Turkish state\u2019s directorate for religious affairs, Diyanet, which has built dozens of other mosques across the Islamic world in recent years, in a move some describe as a key vehicle of Turkey\u2019s power play. Diyanet says the mosque will be based on the famous 16th-century Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, north-western Turkey. In short, Pristina\u2019s new mosque will more closely resemble the hundreds built across the Balkans under Turkish rule \u2013 only much larger. \u201cOver 30 designs were submitted just months after the call for designs was made in 2012. Even Zaha Hadid proposed a design,\u201d says the architect Arb\u00ebr Sadiki. \u201cBut before the competition closed, interviews started appearing in the press in which the mufti described what the new mosque would look like. \u201cDesigns were supposed to be original, but the chosen one is just a copy of an Ottoman mosque. The decision looks more political than architectural to me. I know amazing architects doing work on contemporary mosques in Turkey. Why can\u2019t we put Pristina on the map with something similar?\u201d Under Josip Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia, Pristina\u2019s old bazaar and many historical buildings in its Ottoman-era downtown were destroyed as part of a modernisation campaign that secularised public space. As a result, explains Sadiki, modern Pristina is mostly a postwar city, and little constructed since the 1970s has been distinctive. Pristina\u2019s most notable building today is its modernist, domed national library, built in 1982. But some Kosovar Muslims are bitter, and have protested against the lack of space to accommodate them at prayer. They see double standards at work, given that a massive Catholic cathedral was constructed without issue in 2007, even though Christians comprise just 3% of Kosovo\u2019s population. Pristina isn\u2019t the only city in Kosovo where ostentatious Turkish-funded mosque construction has taken place. In Mitrovica, about 20 miles north, clashes in the 2000s led to the city\u2019s division into southern (Albanian and Muslim) and northern (Serb and Orthodox Christian) halves. The smaller northern district flaunts its Serb identity, with a new Orthodox cathedral and a much-photographed mural proclaiming \u201cKosovo is Serbia, Crimea is Russia\u201d. The larger southern part of town is festooned with Albanian flags and monuments to fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army \u2013 as well as Kosovo\u2019s largest mosque, which opened in 2014 and is named after the Istanbul district Bayrampa\u015fa that funded its construction. Inside it is a riot of colour and ostentatiously Ottoman. There was no mosque like it in the city before \u2013 between 150 and 200 were destroyed in Kosovo during its vicious war of secession from Yugoslavia, many of them simple and modestly designed. For Mitrovica\u2019s Muslims, the Bayrampa\u015fa mosque is a symbol of redemption, if not reconciliation. Back in Pristina there is a sense Turkey has taken advantage of western disinterest to expand its influence in a place Ankara treats like part of its backyard. \u201cExternal actors here have an interest in making the Kosovo conflict one of faith rather than politics \u2013 for example, [the former Serb leader] Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played on European Islamophobia and fears of extremism to delegitimise our struggle for independence,\u201d says Xhabir Hamiti, professor of Islamic studies at Pristina University. \u201cPeople ask: why aren\u2019t western investors coming here? Is it because we are Muslim? The sense is that the only door open to us leads to Turkey \u2013 and some want to walk through it.\u201d Una Hajdari contributed to this report, which was enabled by Reporters in the Field, a Robert Bosch Foundation programme hosted with media development network n-ost.

That\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p> <p>This is brought into focus with opener Aaron Finch, who could easily be a middle-order batsman by tomorrow but will be up against it for a spot in England tour where the Dukes ball will be hooping. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to changing it a little bit,\u201d Paine replied when asked if he could be shuffling down. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be changing too much. We want to try and settle guys who we think will play long-term in their positions looking forward into the next series and then into the Ashes, we want to settle guys in their positions so as little a disruption as we can have to that or the better in that sense, but at the same time we\u2019ve got to find the best XI to win this Test as well. It\u2019s a bit of a balancing act.\u201d</p> <p>If Finch does drop down or drop out, Usman Khawaja will return to the top of the list. As the Queensland captain has said consistently this summer, he is equally relaxed starting the innings or coming in at the loss of the first wicket having made two career-defining centuries as an opener when circumstances demanded it, averaging in excess of 100 in the spot.</p> <p>For Paine, that might require stepping up too. Could it be that he leads the side, keeps wicket for sessions on end then walks out to bat at No 3? Don\u2019t rule it out. \u201cI\u2019ve had some discussions around that,\u201d he said of a potential batting promotion. \u201cIt may happen it may not, but I certainly haven\u2019t been setting the world on fire, I need to cash in on my starts as well.\u201d</p> <p>At six, Marnus Labuschagne is set to make his return having lost his spot after two busy Tests against Pakistan in the UAE. Paine likes the Queenslander\u2019s versatility on the field and vitality around the group. \u201cAt the end of a long series his energy has been great the last few days,\u201d he said. \u201cHis leg spin\u2019s improved out of sight, and you\u2019re almost leaning towards him at Test level now as a bit of an all-round option.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1c0cbeb8836b3fb9fa5dd599cd60d06f425f470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1c0cbeb8836b3fb9fa5dd599cd60d06f425f470/0_191_4371_2623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marnus Labuschagne preparing for a possible home Test debut during nets at the SCG.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marnus Labuschagne preparing for a possible home Test debut during nets at the SCG.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason McCawley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prospect of a turning Sydney track increases the chances that Pete Handscomb will also be recalled after missing out in Melbourne for Mitchell Marsh. \u201cWe think it will spin here so if India were to play two spinners Pete can be a really important player for us.

National guidance recommends no more than five or six sugar cubes (20g-24g) a day for children aged four to 10.</p> <p>One-third of children are overweight or obese at the age of 10 and 4.2% are severely obese in year six at school.

      "bodyText": "The average 10-year-old has consumed as much sugar in their lifetime as the recommended limit for an 18-year-old, according to Public Health England (PHE), which is warning of serious implications for obesity and health. Children are consuming the equivalent of eight excess sugar cubes a day, or 2,800 a year, says PHE, which has launched a new healthy eating campaign under its Change4Life scheme. National guidance recommends no more than five or six sugar cubes (20g-24g) a day for children aged four to 10. One-third of children are overweight or obese at the age of 10 and 4.2% are severely obese in year six at school. Obese children often become obese adults, at risk of heart attacks, strokes and type 2 diabetes. The healthy eating campaign will urge parents to cut the amount of sugar in their families\u2019 diet by switching to lower-sugar drinks, cereals and yoghurts. PHE attempts to persuade the food industry to reformulate the products available in supermarkets have had limited success. The organisation had called for a 20% reduction in sugar content by 2020, and a 5% cut in the first year, ending April 2018, but a report in May said manufacturers and supermarkets had managed only 2%. Yoghurts, breakfast cereals and sweet spreads were the only food groups to achieve a 5% reduction. The campaign emphasises breakfast cereals and yoghurts, together with sugary drinks, where reformulation is happening because of the sugar tax. But not all products in those categories have had their sugar content lowered. PHE wants families to switch to those that have, and it rewarded some of the companies that have made significant sugar cuts with a mention. Nestl\u00e9 Shredded Wheat, Nestl\u00e9 Low Sugar Oat Cheerios, Petits Filous and Soreen malt loaf are some of the brands that will carry a Change4Life \u201cgood choice\u201d badge in shops. \u201cChildren are consuming too much sugar, but parents can take action now to prevent this building up over the years,\u201d said Dr Alison Tedstone, PHE\u2019s chief nutritionist. \u201cTo make this easier for busy families, Change4Life is offering a straightforward solution \u2013 by making simple swaps each day, children can have healthier versions of everyday foods and drinks, while significantly reducing their sugar intake.\u201d The Obesity Health Alliance, an umbrella group that includes charities and medical organisations, said more urgent action than messages on swapping high-sugar foods for low-sugar alternatives was needed. \u201cToday\u2019s children are growing up in obesogenic environments, bombarded by adverts and promotions for junk food online, on TV and in our supermarkets,\u201d said Caroline Cerny, the alliance lead. \u201cGovernment proposals to restrict junk-food marketing, tackle price- and place-based promotions and ensure calorie labelling in cafes and restaurants will, if fully implemented, make progress towards reversing our current worrying obesity trends.

Swapping chocolate, puddings, sweets, cakes and pastries for healthier options such as malt loaf, sugar-free jellies, lower-sugar custards and rice puddings would reduce their intake further, the organisation says. Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cEncouraging parents to halve their children\u2019s sugar intake from everyday food and drink products is applaudable and we fully support the campaign. \u201cHowever, if we are to curb the UK\u2019s escalating childhood obesity epidemic then the government must enforce more hard-hitting tactics such as mandatory uniform coloured coded labelling on front of packs, product reformulation with a 50% reduction in sugar across all products, a tax on confectionery and ensure that only healthy products are marketed and advertised.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I once made the mistake of going on a Tinder date with an aspiring comedian. By the time our main courses arrived he had shared his full sexual history, including a graphic description of a foursome with some travellers he had met on a couchsurfing site. I had always assumed these were meant for people who needed a cheap place to stay, but apparently at least one doubles as a hook-up app for casual-sex enthusiasts who hate hotel room charges. Eventually, after a long speech on female independence, he told me that he only paid for dinner when the girl was \u201cvery attractive\u201d, so I plotted my escape while we split the bill. I thought he would be happy to call it a night, but no such luck. As I scrambled to find an emergency Uber, he grabbed hold of my foot, asking if he could lick my \u201csexy\u201d toes all night. I declined his offer and spent my journey home wondering if it\u2019s possible to shower your own skin off.</p> <p>There have been plenty of other disappointing dates over the years, including Andy the monosyllabic advertising consultant, Will the food thief who wouldn\u2019t let me finish a sentence, and a Greek racist who would only eat white dairy products. Other encounters have felt more like the icebreaker at a banking conference than the start of a Romeo and Juliet remake.</p> <p>Online dating is useful for older singles like me (I\u2019m 34), whose married friends are too busy cleaning up toddler poo to act as wing woman. These days, everyone I meet in real life is already in a committed relationship. Yet, after 18 months on the scene, I\u2019m struggling to develop any excitement about people I\u2019ve never seen in the flesh. I often end up ghosting people after exchanging a handful of messages. When 90% of dates lead to disappointment, revulsion or a vague sense of doom about the future of the human race, dancing to Taylor Swift in your bedroom and rehearsing an imaginary Oscars speech seems like more fun.</p> <p>We all know a bad workman blames his tools, so I decide to speak to my friends about my dating patterns. Never ones to hold back, they tell me that I am too judgmental, writing off good men for all the wrong reasons. Instead of giving someone a chance, I\u2019ll leave after the first date because he can\u2019t use apostrophes or doesn\u2019t turn my stomach into a butterfly-filled frenzy of passion. They also tell me I\u2019m too forgiving of narcissists and commitment-phobes, willing to make excuses for \u201ccomplicated\u201d blokes who frequently lose the ability to send text messages.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.persialawson.com/\" title=\"\">Persia Lawson</a>, dating coach and author of The Inner Fix, says that if you are repeatedly drawn to emotionally unavailable people, it is probably a defence mechanism. \u201cPeople say they\u2019re looking for a committed relationship, but when an available person comes along, they dismiss them due to lack of \u2018spark\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cIn reality, they\u2019re terrified of real commitment. There\u2019s a sadomasochistic pleasure that comes with dating emotionally unavailable men.\u201d</p> <p>As a dreamy flibbertigibbet who grew up with Disney movies as her primary source of spiritual guidance, it is tempting to wait for a prince to climb my hair and carry me off to an all-you-can-eat cheese restaurant. But instead of going 100mph or avoiding people who don\u2019t take your breath away the second you meet, Persia recommends taking it slow. \u201cTry rotational dating, where you meet different people for coffee, walks or a trip to the cinema or a museum. Anything that doesn\u2019t involve late nights and alcohol is good, as drinking can influence your dating decisions in an unhealthy way and give you false confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Her advice makes perfect sense. You wouldn\u2019t expect to develop a close friendship overnight, so why do we expect so much from the people we date?

Provided you don\u2019t turn up to a first date with wedding dress patterns and a list of possible names for your as-yet-unconceived child, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t be upfront about what you want.</p> <p>But when you have spent 15 years chasing players who have the emotional intelligence of a toothbrush, how do you change your ways and start choosing better men? Lawson says that rather than looking for the person I fancy the most, I should focus on shared values. \u201cYou need to have standards for yourself, but don\u2019t be unrealistic or superficial. It doesn\u2019t matter if a man isn\u2019t three inches taller than you or a woman isn\u2019t a certain weight. You can have preferences, but focusing on them too much is part of love avoidance and you keep people out by having strict specifications. The only thing you need to ask is how your date makes you feel about yourself as person. Do you feel comfortable? Do you share the same values? Do you want the same things?\u201d</p> <p>Taking Lawson\u2019s advice, I refresh my dating profile on Bumble and get swiping. After exchanging messages with a web developer called James, we agree to meet after work at a local pub. There will be booze involved, but I have set myself a deadline to come home at 9pm and finish some work. This also doubles as the perfect escape plan in case he turns out to be a homicidal maniac who collects human hair in jam jars. Although I have zero expectations, the date is a success and it is the most comfortable I have felt with a man in months. He is laid-back and has a good sense of humour, the kind of guy you could introduce to your friends without having to get them drunk first. When we say goodnight, he\u2019s reserved and polite, a stark contrast to the men who have kissed me, declared their undying passion and then disappeared into the sunset in a cloud of sexy cologne. There was no instant chemistry, but we exchange a few messages the next day and he\u2019s keen for us to have dinner together when we\u2019re both free.</p> <p>In the meantime I arrange a coffee date with Luke, who works in advertising. Within the hour it\u2019s clear that, while he\u2019s a perfectly nice guy, there\u2019s very little common ground and we don\u2019t share the same sense of humour. I\u2019m grateful I took Lawson\u2019s advice to arrange a coffee date rather than dinner or drinks, where we might feel compelled to spend longer in each other\u2019s company. We exchange a few messages afterwards, but it soon fizzles out.</p> <p>After a second successful date with James at an Indian restaurant, I arrange to meet up with an actor outside the V&amp;A museum. Usually I would be wary of flamboyant men, but he seems chatty and outgoing, totally different from the dry-humoured type of guy I usually go out with. I\u2019m not sure if I fancy him, but I\u2019m so impressed by his encyclopedic knowledge of Britney Spears albums that I am up for another date.</p> <p>The next week, James and I enjoy a few more PG get-togethers, before agreeing to meet up at the London Wetland Centre to see the otters. To his credit, he doesn\u2019t complain when I insist we queue up in the cold for a good view at feeding time, and we spend the rest of the day sharing newly acquired trivia about mustelids. He also gets bonus points for not pretending to be with someone else when I jump up and down, squealing: \u201cLook how cute the otters are!\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if my refreshed approach to dating will lead to happily ever after, but keeping an open mind is helping me to enjoy the process again. For now I\u2019m ready to forget the fairytale myth and enjoy online dating for what it is: a chance to meet interesting people and explore new parts of town. If something doesn\u2019t work out I will, in the wise words of Dory the fish, \u201cjust keep swimming\u201d until I find what I\u2019m looking for.

Each of the addicts who pass through her shelter are good people who\u2019ve gone astray, she adds, and they deserve a second chance.</p> <p>Afghanistan\u2019s drug problem is not a secret. The country is the world\u2019s largest producer of opium. In November 2017, the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2017/November/afghan-opium-production-jumps-to-record-level--up-87-per-cent_-survey.html\">UN reported</a> that opium production had increased by 87% over the previous 12 months to a record high, despite almost two decades of counter efforts by the US.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/14/us-anti-narcotic-afghanistan-opium-costly-failure-official-report\">Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction</a> (Sigar), since 2001 the US has spent $8.6bn on disrupting the illicit drugs trade, yet the country still produces about 80% of the world\u2019s opium.</p> <p>Afghans remain among the worst victims of the failed war on drugs. According to the <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/afghanistan/UNODC-DRUG-REPORT15-ONLINE-270116_1.pdf\">2015 Afghanistan national drug use survey</a>, in a country of 35 million people, an estimated 2.9 million are addicts. But there aren\u2019t enough government-run shelters to meet the growing needs. Kabul has 27 government shelters and there are about 115 across Afghanistan \u2013 all <a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/homeless-and-unwanted-how-kabuls-drug-addicts-are-driven-like-a-flock\">of which are over capacity</a>.</p> <p>Mother Camp, named by the first drug addicts Haidari took in, was established in 2010. \u201cI used to look after them, clean them, cook for them and sometimes even feed the weaker ones. That is when they started to call me \u2018mother\u2019,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>Using her own savings, Haidari, once an aspiring filmmaker, rented a small space in the west of Kabul to open the shelter. It was basic, with furniture donated by friends and family.</p> <p>This year alone the shelter has admitted 117 new addicts<strong>, </strong>most of whom were rescued from under Kabul\u2019s Pul-e-Sokhta bridge, known for the homeless community that lives there. The shelter has a capacity of 25 residents at one time, but it has hosted up to 40. Haidari and her team try to keep track of residents after they leave, but since many of them are homeless it\u2019s not easy. About 20% of people who leave the centre will drop off the radar, while some will have relapses and return. So far this year, everyone who\u2019s been in the shelter is accounted for and in various stages of recovery.</p> <p>\u201cThe addicts normally stay 30 to 40 days at the camp. Once they are admitted to the shelter, volunteers clean, shave and wash them, explains Jalil Pa\u017ewak, a young Afghan media professional, who volunteers at Mother Trust, the NGO that runs Mother Camp. The shelter takes the \u201ccold turkey\u201d approach to recovery \u2013 a common approach in the country, where resources and access to other medication and expertise is limited. Doctors are on hand if any problems occur. \u201cCutting them off completely from drugs is the main step and the important one. In our experience it has never had a negative effect. But it helps them become determined in their mission of getting rid of addiction,\u201d Haidari believes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31389063b5e84f62d9904d78436e9f19e26ec7d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31389063b5e84f62d9904d78436e9f19e26ec7d1/0_0_3899_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laila Haidari stands alongside one of the Mother Camp residents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laila Haidari stands alongside one of the Mother Camp residents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Residents are encouraged to join in group counselling and attend meetings, and eventually help with cooking and cleaning.</p> <p>It costs between $1,500 and $3,000 every month to run the shelter, depending on how many residents it hosts.

      "bodyText": "Aladdin: the landscapes of Jordan A live-action remake of Aladdin, directed by Guy Ritchie, comes to the big screen next year, with Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Will Smith as the Genie. It is set in the fictional kingdom of Agrabah, and was filmed in Wadi Rum in Jordan, where the protected desert landscape, sandstone and basalt mountains, canyons and otherworldly rock formations \u2013 such as Burdah Rock Bridge, one of the highest natural arches in the world \u2013 create a dramatic landscape. Exploring by 4x4 is recommended, and visitors can also stay in a Bedouin desert camp, go camel riding, and visit the 4,000-year-old rock drawings at Khazali Canyon. Booking directly with the Jordan visitor centre on arrival is advised, or with a tour company in advance (such as Jordan Tracks, 1 day 1 night, camel/jeep tour from \u00a390). \u2022 Released May 2019 Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: vintage Los Angeles Quentin Tarantino\u2019s ninth (and supposedly penultimate) film has a stellar cast including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino. Full details of the crime drama have yet to be unveiled, but last April the director told the CinemaCon convention: \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture, hippy revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, we\u2019ll transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.\u201d Photos and videos have surfaced showing a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, between Las Palmas and Cherokee, transformed with period cars, shop fronts and cinemas. But while most of the sets are temporary, it is possible to visit some permanent fixtures featured in the film, including Hollywood\u2019s oldest restaurant, Musso &amp; Frank Grill, which opened in 1919 and whose reputation was set during the golden age of Hollywood, visited by stars such as Charlie Chaplin. Other Hollywood locations for reliving the retro vibe include Dan Tana\u2019s Italian in West Hollywood, the city\u2019s first late-night restaurant, where stars would dine in anonymity: it celebrated 50 years last year. Next to the art deco Pantages Theater, there\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s oldest dive bar, Frolic Room (which originally opened as a speakeasy in 1930, was a bolthole for Barfly writer Charles Bukowski, and featured in LA Confidential). And the Hollywood Museum in the restored art deco Max Factor building, has tons of memorabilia and a historic pink lobby. \u2022 Released July 2019 The Lion King: Kenya\u2019s Hell\u2019s Gate national park Almost 25 years after the animated classic hit the screens, a CGI version featuring the voices of Beyonc\u00e9, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Seth Rogen is being released. Research trips for the original animated film took place in Kenya\u2019s Hell\u2019s Gate national park in Kenya \u2013 though Pride Rock was a fictitious element added by the animators. Hell\u2019s Gate national park,90km from Nairobi, is named for the intense geothermal activity within its boundaries. The spectacular landscape includes deep, twisting gorges, volcanic rock towers and plumes of steam. ABig cat numbers here are low, which means that, uniquely in Kenyan parks, pedestrians are allowed full access. But other wildlife is abundant, with more than 103 species of birds, buffalos, zebras, gazelles, hyenas, antelopes and baboons. Hire bikes and local guides (for hiking and walking safaris) are available at the entrance; those wanting to explore by car can hire 4x4s at Nairobi airport). If a distant hyena lullaby sounds appealing, there are three campsites in the park (Endachata, Naiburta and Oldubai) and more options at nearby Lake Naivasha. \u2022 Released July 2019 Downton Abbey: Highclere Castle and more Following on from the finale of the television series in December 2015, the film continues to chart the lives of the Crawley family, their friends and servants. Although set in Yorkshire, filming largely took place at Highclere Castle in Hampshire (where Jeeves &amp; Wooster, starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, was also shot). The 17th-century Jacobethan castle, with landscaped grounds by Capability Brown, offers special winter tours (January-March, \u00a3120), tours with afternoon tea (daily April-September, from \u00a351), and a live Downton concert by the chamber orchestra of London with narration by Carson (Jim Carter) on 22 June 2019. Scenes in the fictional Yorkshire village of Downton were filmed in Bampton in Oxfordshire, including at 11th-century St Mary\u2019s Church. Further scenes were shot in Lacock in Wiltshire, a village owned almost entirely by the National Trust, including many of the historic cottages and Lacock Abbey, which has featured in Harry Potter and Pride and Prejudice. \u2022 Released September 2019 Wild Rose: Glasgow\u2019s country music scene Jessie Buckley stars as a Glaswegian ex-con and single mum who dreams of breaking into the country music scene in Nashville. But Glasgow has its own Grand Ole Opry, a country and western club started in 1974 in a former cinema and still putting on gigs every Friday and Saturday. In March, the city, along with London and Dublin, will co-host Europe\u2019s biggest country music festival C2C: Country to Country (8-10 March at SSE Hydro) with Keith Urban and Lyle Lovett on the bill. Glasgow is also a Unesco city of music, putting on more than 150 gigs a week in around 40 venues across the city. Music hotspots include King Tut\u2019s Wah Wah Hut, Broadcast, Bloc+, SWG3, Stereo, Maggie Mays, and Mono, which is also a record store and vegan cafe. \u2022 Released April 2019 Abominable: walking in the Himalayas The original film title \u2013 Everest \u2013 might have given a clue to the location of this animated film from DreamWorks. Although story details have yet to be disclosed, it is thought to follow a group from the streets of Shanghai who trek 3,000 miles to reunite the mythical Yeti with his family at the highest point on Earth, in the Himalayas. Since the first successful ascent to the summit of Everest in 1953, the Himalayas have become more accessible, with walking routes across Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, and varied options depending on season, budget and ability. Trekking in China more specifically includes a multitude of routes around Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan province, taking in deep ravines, snow-capped ranges, rivers, forests and remote rice terraces. Alternatively, there are routes at Sichuan\u2019s Gongga Shan, the King of Mountains, passing glaciers, temples and views over the Tibetan meadows; or in the far north-west of China in Kanas national park, in the Altai mountains that creep in from Siberia. Tours of the Himalayas in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, range from self-guided trekking suitable for families (World Expeditions, \u00a3990pp, 11 days B&amp;B), to trekking up to an altitude of 5,364 metres to Everest Base Camp (\u00a31,740, 17 days, including all meals and accommodation). \u2022 Released September 2019 The House by the Sea (La Villa): Coastal Provence Calanque de M\u00e9jean, an picturesque inlet near Marseille in southern France, was the location for this family drama by veteran director Robert Gu\u00e9diguian.

Abduction, threats and former lovers (namely Paco, played by Javier Bardem) play out in this Spanish drama filmed in the village of Torrelaguna 40 miles from the capital. Torrelaguna has a beautiful traditional plaza, atmospheric 15th-century church, a Roman bridge, a 10th-century watchtower, and other historic buildings mixing gothic, baroque and neoclassical architectural styles. Restaurants serving Spanishspecialities include Alfoli de la Sal and Casa Moraleda; there are horse riding and walking routes in the surrounding meadows and hills; and the views from the nearby black-slate village of Patones de Arriba are worth a trip too. \u2022 Released March 2019 Fisherman\u2019s Friends: Port Isaac, Cornwall Set in Port Isaac, Cornwall, this feelgood British comedy drama is based on the true story of a group of fishermen who were given a record deal after singing sea shanties in their local pub.

      "bodyText": "While Victorian government has ruled out a shift towards pill testing at music festivals the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has softened her stance. Pill testing is likely to become a NSW election issue, with the state\u2019s opposition opening the door to supporting the measure. Late last year Berejiklian, ruled out introducing pill testing after a 19-year-old\u2019s death at dance party at Sydney Olympic Park. But on Wednesday she appeared to soften her stance and said she would consider it if her government was shown evidence it saved lives. \u201cIf there was a way in which we could ensure that lives were saved through pill testing we would consider it \u2013 but there is no evidence provided to the government on that,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters. The premier convened an expert panel into festival safety in September 2018 after two people died at the Defqon.1 event in western Sydney. The political reluctance is frustrating for heartbroken parents like Adriana Buccianti who lost her son to an overdose. Buccianti is still haunted by memories of the January morning the police knocked at her door with news her son had died. It was 8.30am and she was babysitting her granddaughter when officers arrived with news that Daniel had been found after taking a drug at a festival. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re having this out-of-body experience, you\u2019re watching your body walk around really slow.

Your kids are not supposed to go before you.\u201d Her 34-year-old son\u2019s body had been found in his tent after his drug overdose at the Rainbow Serpent festival in western Victoria in 2012. \u201cHe never imagined that he would have taken something that he\u2019d never taken before, so if the [pill-testing] service was available he would have used it,\u201d Buccianti said. \u201cNobody wants to come out of there in a body bag.\u201d Buccianti said pill testing would provide a safety net to help protect youngsters \u201cfrom themselves\u201d. \u201cHow many body counts do they want before somebody does something about it?\u201d she said. The Victorian mental health minister, Martin Foley, said the government had no plans to allow pill testing as the state reeled from another death. A 20-year-old Victorian man died in hospital on Tuesday, days after suffering a suspected drug overdose at the Beyond the Valley festival south-east of Melbourne. Victorian police said six people had been arrested for drug trafficking and 26 had received a caution and drug diversion notice during the four-day event. Foley said Victoria police had advised that pill testing could give people \u201ca false, and potentially fatal, sense of security about illicit drugs\u201d. Earlier this week, organisers of the Falls festival sent out a warning to ticket holders of a \u201cdangerous orange pill\u201d in circulation, following the suspected drug death of a 22-year-old man on the New South Wales central coast. NSW police on Wednesday charged six people with drug supply offences after they were allegedly caught carrying illicit drugs, including MDMA and ketamine, at a music festival in Sydney\u2019s Domain. The Australian Capital Territory emergency department doctor David Caldicott is adamant a new approach is needed and overdoses need to be treated as a public health issue. For hospitals and paramedics all over the country, the summer music festival calendar has the same sense of inevitability and dread as bushfire season, Caldicott said. \u201cThere is no part of the emergency medical response that wouldn\u2019t be delighted to never have to deal with this ever again,\u201d Caldicott said. Often unconscious patients have no identification and hospital staff have to try to unlock mobile phones with fingerprints to find a next of kin. \u201cThat never becomes easy, it\u2019s one of the worst aspects of the jobs \u2013 contacting parents about severe harm that\u2019s happened to their children which up until that point they were blissfully unaware of,\u201d he said. He said 12 to 15 years ago doctors knew what people were overdosing on because there weren\u2019t as many options. But these days they are flying blind. The executive director of Unharm, Will Tregoning, is optimistic momentum for pill testing is building and it will be harder and harder for authorities to continue to drag their heels. \u201cMartin Foley\u2019s comment was essentially a go-away-I\u2019m-on-holidays-type comment. I am not unhopeful about this current Victorian Labor government being able to see the benefits,\u201d he said. The ACT last year became the first jurisdiction to trial pill testing at the Groovin the Moo festival and organisers said it was a huge success and should be rolled out nationally. While the Australian Bureau of Statistics counts drug-related deaths, it does not give a breakdown on those that happen at music festivals. Some medical professionals estimate there could be three deaths a year on average. An ABC Triple J survey of 11,000 young people found 83% would use pill testing if it was available and and 55% have taken drugs into a festival.",

      "bodyText": "Labor and the university sector have blasted a push by a Liberal senator to scrap tertiary student amenity fees, while the deputy prime minister has warned the Nationals will prevent any move that hurts regional universities. In December the Liberal senator James McGrath quietly gave notice in the Senate that when parliament returns in February he will introduce a bill to prevent higher education providers charging a mandatory student services and amenities fee, the last vestige of compulsory student unionism. Tertiary education institutions raise more than $100m a year by charging students a fee of up to $303 which they then distribute to bodies such as student representative councils, student unions and sports clubs. Although McGrath\u2019s is a private senator\u2019s bill, the fresh push could spark tension in the Coalition between Liberals, who have have consistently opposed amenities fees, and the Nationals. The acting education minister, Simon Birmingham, and the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, both distanced themselves from McGrath\u2019s position, noting the \u201cproposed legislation is a private member\u2019s bill\u201d. McCormack told Guardian Australia: \u201cMy position remains unchanged and as with all other members of the Nationals, I will always stand and fight against any proposed change which would see regional Australians disadvantaged or short-changed.\u201d The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, urged McGrath to reconsider, arguing that universities \u2013 especially in regional Australia - would \u201cwant common sense to prevail\u201d. \u201cThese fees fund crucial student services across the country including medical and counselling facilities, online and in-person study support to help students at risk of dropping out, and crucial student career preparation and advice services,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also fund essential sports, recreation and cultural facilities and events that foster campus life.\u201d Labor\u2019s education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Liberals to grow up \u2013 they think they\u2019re back in student politics. \u201cLabor believes students deserve good support services and representation at uni.\u201d National Union of Students\u2019 outgoing president Mark Pace said the peak representative body is \u201cvery much against any attempt to cut or reduce [the student amenities fee]\u201d. He said the fee \u201cprovides vital services to Australia\u2019s one million university students\u201d including emergency loans, student welfare officers and free legal services such as tax help. \u201cThe fee supports clubs and broader student life \u2013 it funds a wide range of facilities and student representation, because students have a right to quality, equitable and accessible education.\u201d Higher education is set to be one of the key battlegrounds of the 2019 election, after Labor promised to reverse cuts to universities worth more than $2bn. The Morrison government has also announced a review of freedom of speech on Australian campuses lead by former high court chief justice Robert French and is considering how to introduce performance funding for universities. The Howard government abolished compulsory student unionism in 2005 despite the opposition of then senator Barnaby Joyce, but it was partially revived in 2011 by the Gillard government in the form of amenities fees.

After a couple of milder days in parts of southern Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a resurgence of the high temperatures seen throughout the Christmas period, with possible severe to extreme fire danger over the next two days. A broad area of the country will have temperatures 10 to 16 degrees above average for January. Adelaide is expected to reach 41C on Thursday and Melbourne 42C on Friday. Parts of inland Victoria will have temperatures that climb into the mid 40s over the next two days: Mildura in the state\u2019s northwest is forecast to reach 41C on Thursday and 46C on Friday. Hobart is expected to reach 35C on Friday and above-average temperatures in Tasmania could be accompanied by extreme fire danger for parts of that state. The Bureau said the heat in South Australia and Victoria could trigger warnings of severe fire danger over the next two days. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a couple of cooler days for southern Australia, still above average for this time of year but cooler than we\u2019ve seen,\u201d meteorologist Sarah Fitton said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve still just had that heat sitting through central Australia which hasn\u2019t gone away. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see north-westerly winds again and that\u2019s going to drive that heat that\u2019s been sitting in central Australia back across the southern states.\u201d Melbourne\u2019s extreme highs on Friday are expected to be followed by a drop of 18C to a top of 24C on Saturday, before warming up again into next week. New South Wales, which has experienced a long stretch of warm days, has no forecast relief from above-average temperatures. The heatwave follows a year of above-average temperatures for the country. The BOM, which will release its final data sometime in January, expects 2018 will register as one of the five warmest years on record for Australia overall and one of the third warmest in terms of maximum temperatures. It said nighttime minimum temperatures were also warmer than average for most of the country through 2018. On Wednesday, ex-tropical cyclone Penny was moving eastwards back over the Coral Sea after bringing heavy rains and some flooding when it made landfall in Queensland on Tuesday. But Fitton said it could redevelop into a category 1 or 2 cyclone again and the bureau was monitoring whether it would move back towards the coast. \u201cOver the next few days, it\u2019s not expected to affect mainland parts of Queensland but as we head into Friday and Saturday it might start to re-curve towards the Queensland coast in a south-westerly direction,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom late on the weekend and into early next week, there\u2019s a chance it could reach the central Queensland coast.\u201d She said there was still a lot of uncertainty about the system\u2019s movements. \u201cIt may only be a tropical low when it reaches the coast but despite that, there\u2019s an increasing chance of some heavy rainfall, damaging rains and flooding,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The Favourite Dir: Yorgos Lanthimos Olivia Colman excels as an emotionally wounded Queen Anne in a bizarre black comedy of the English Restoration court, directed by the Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos. It is based on the true story of two noblewomen creating a horribly dysfunctional love triangle by competing for the queen\u2019s favours: Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail, Baroness Basham \u2013 played by Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. UK release date: 1 January RBG / On the Basis of Sex Dirs: Julie Cohen, Betsy West / Mimi Leder These films count as one choice! It feels like an especially fraught moment to contemplate the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose forthright liberal judgments have made her a pop culture legend. RBG is a documentary directed by Julie Cohen and Betsy West; On the Basis of Sex is a feature starring Felicity Jones as RBG. RBG: 4 January; On the Basis of Sex: 8 February An Impossible Love Dir: Catherine Corsini The fierce and passionate direction of Catherine Corsini is applied to this French melodrama of love and sexism, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Christine Angot. In the 1950s, a young secretary (Virginie Efira) has a passionate affair with a wealthy young man (Niels Schneider); she bears a child whom he refuses to acknowledge, so she must bring up their daughter alone. 4 January The Front Runner Dir: Jason Reitman It sounds so quaint in the brazen era of Donald Trump: the story of how, in 1988, the smoothly plausible Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart had all his hopes sunk by accusations of an extramarital affair. Hugh Jackman plays the presentable Hart, the estimable Vera Farmiga is his wife Oletha, and Sara Paxton is the other woman, Donna Rice, who endured the full misogynistic force of the press coverage. 11 January Colette Dir: Wash Westmoreland Keira Knightley plays the great French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who as a young woman in belle \u00e9poque Paris was married to the notorious womaniser and rackety journalist Henry Gauthier-Villars (played here by Dominic West), who insisted on putting his name on the novels she wrote at first \u2013 and getting all the money. The director is Wash Westmoreland, who directed Still Alice; he co-wrote the screenplay with his partner, the late Richard Glatzer. 11 January Stan &amp; Ollie Dir: Jon S Baird Steve Coogan and John C Reilly give wonderfully observed performances as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in this sad, sweet, true-life movie about the British tour they undertook after the second world war, in dire need of money. They endure miserable digs, second-rate theatres, terrible weather and the fact that their local promoter seems more excited about a new young comic called Norman Wisdom. 11 January Beautiful Boy Dir: Felix Van Groeningen There can hardly be anyone hotter right now than Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; here he plays a teenage meth abuser, Nic, whose addiction causes agony to his dad David, played by Steve Carell. The film is based on parallel father-and-son memoirs of this same experience. 18 January Mary Queen of Scots Dir: Josie Rourke Screenwriter Beau Willimon, an old hand at American political thrillers, transfers his skills to scripting English and Scottish history with this tale of Mary, Queen of Scots, played by Saoirse Ronan. Margot Robbie plays her nemesis, Queen Elizabeth I, and David Tennant is the gloweringly suspicious churchman John Knox. Read our interview with the film\u2019s director, Josie Rourke. 18 January The Mule Dir: Clint Eastwood At 88 years of age, Clint Eastwood is showing no signs of slowing down. He directs this film based on a startling true-life story, and also stars as Earl, a second world war veteran who, in 2011, was discovered by astonished law enforcement officials to be the oldest drug mule in America, smuggling substances over the border into the US. Bradley Cooper plays the cop on his case. 25 January Destroyer Dir: Karyn Kusama Nicole Kidman\u2019s self-transformation in this brutally tough crime thriller has been much acclaimed on the festival circuit. She plays Erin Bell, an FBI agent who has lost it, psychologically and physically, after going deep undercover with mobsters, and cuts a tortured figure as her life falls apart. Now she gets the chance to reckon with the people who damaged her. 25 January Vice Dir: Adam McKay The former US vice-president, big oil nabob and waterboarding enthusiast Dick Cheney squats like a latex-inflated toad at the ear of power in this flashy political comedy from Adam McKay about the power behind the throne of George W Bush. It\u2019s a scarily plausible impersonation from Christian Bale, whose bald-capped head has been enlarged to the size of a pale pink, bespectacled beachball. Amy Adams is on great form as Cheney\u2019s formidable wife Lynne, with Sam Rockwell as Dubya and Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld.. 25 January Can You Ever Forgive Me? Dir: Marielle Heller With a screenplay by that great and underrated film-maker Nicole Holofcener, this tragicomic true-life story of fakery looks mouthwatering. Melissa McCarthy plays Lee Israel, a once bestselling biographer who fell on hard times and turned to counterfeiting literary manuscripts. 1 February Burning Dir: Lee Chang-dong This superbly subtle mystery thriller from Korean auteur Lee Chang-dong is for many people the film of the year. It is a love triangle which turns into a fear triangle and a hate triangle, based on a short story by Haruki Murakami. A young man falls in love with a beautiful young woman who dumps him in favour of a rich smoothie who has a creepy obsession with setting things on fire. Then she disappears. What has happened? 1 February The Kindergarten Teacher Dir: Sara Colangelo Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an unhappy woman in this American indie drama, remade from a 2014 film by Israeli director Nadav Lapid. She is naggingly unfulfilled in her family life and professional career as a teacher and then becomes obsessed with the idea that one of her kids is a genius. 8 February If Beale Street Could Talk Dir: Barry Jenkins Barry Jenkins, whose Moonlight won the best picture Oscar two years ago, returns with this impassioned adaptation of the 1974 James Baldwin novel. It is a story of love and injustice in 1970s Harlem, when a young man is falsely accused of rape and his pregnant girlfriend has to prove his innocence. 8 February Border Dir: Ali Abbasi This bizarre Swedish film, adapted from a story by horror-fiction author John Ajvide Lindqvist, has comprehensively weirded out all who have seen it. A young customs officer has what amounts to a professional superpower: she can smell fear. But when she applies that skill to a guilty-looking person who resembles her, a strange story unfolds. 8 February Fighting With My Family Dir: Stephen Merchant Stephen Merchant directs this British comedy about wrestling, effectively remade from a documentary about a WWE wrestler in the US. Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden play Saraya and Zak, a brother and sister who are both talented wrestlers, but have a terrible sibling rivalry when they audition for WWE. 1 March Captain Marvel Dirs: Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck This is Marvel Studios\u2019 first female-led superhero film and its first with a female director: Anna Boden. Brie Larson plays Carol Danvers, a former US air force fighter pilot whose DNA becomes fused with that of a Kree \u2013 a militaristic alien being \u2013 giving her superpowers. 8 March Happy as Lazzaro Dir: Alice Rohrwacher One of the most gorgeous and beguiling films on the festival circuit now gets a release. It is a lovely magic-realist fable set among an exploited peasant community who appear to be living in the 19th century \u2013 yet this is misleading. Among them is the happy idiot boy Lazzaro, who, like his namesake, is destined to be mysteriously reborn. 15 March Us Dir: Jordan Peele Jordan Peele\u2019s satirical horror movie about racism, Get Out, made him a hot property, and now we have a movie about which little is known, other than that the director is calling it a \u201csocial-horror thriller\u201d. It stars Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Winston Duke and Elisabeth Moss. 15 March Girl Dir: Lukas Dhont This is a much admired Belgian movie about trans issues \u2013 though it has been criticised for using a cisgender actor in the lead. Lara, played by Victor Polster, is a 15-year-old transitioning to female, yearning to be a ballerina, and facing incomprehension and transphobia along with all the other hurdles a dancer must endure. 15 March Out of Blue Dir: Carol Morley Here is a movie straight out of left field: a metaphysical noir starring Patricia Clarkson as a tough New Orleans cop investigating the mysterious death of an astrophysicist \u2013 based on the Martin Amis novel Night Train. Director Carol Morley is such a restlessly creative film-maker. 22 March The White Crow Dir: Ralph Fiennes David Hare scripts this handsomely appointed drama starring Oleg Ivenko as the young Rudolf Nureyev as he prepares to defect to the west in the early 60s, while remaining enigmatic about his exact motives. Real-life dance star Sergei Polunin plays his Kirov roommate, Yuri Soloviev. 22 March What Men Want Dir: Adam Shankman A cheeky gender-inverting remake of Nancy Meyers\u2019s 2000 comedy What Women Want, which starred Mel Gibson as an adman who suddenly finds he can read women\u2019s minds. Now it\u2019s Taraji P Henson as a sports agent who gets the edge when she gains telepathic access to guys\u2019 thought processes. 22 March Dumbo Dir: Tim Burton Just when you\u2019d recovered from the tearful trauma of the 1941 Disney animated classic, there comes a new live-action version. Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito star. 29 March Pet Sematary Dirs: Kevin K\u00f6lsch, Dennis Widmeyer Stephen King\u2019s brand identity in the horror world is as strong as ever, and here is the second movie version of his 1983 novel. It is the exquisitely horrible and obscene story of a doctor whose son is killed in an accident and who takes the corpse to the supernatural burial ground nearby \u2013 with grotesque results. 5 April The Sisters Brothers Dir: Jacques Audiard French director Jacques Audiard has mastered the western with terrific elan. It is 1850s Oregon, and John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play quarrelsome brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters, who are on a mission to assassinate a certain individual in San Francisco, and have to work with a prissy private detective, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. 5 April Loro Dir: Paolo Sorrentino It was only a matter of time before Paolo Sorrentino made a film about Silvio Berlusconi. Sorrentino\u2019s longtime star Toni Servillo plays the Italian politician and media magnate, and the film is about Loro (that is: them), the group of hideously complicit businessmen and hangers-on who enabled his rule. 12 April Red Joan Dir: Trevor Nunn Theatrical heavyweight Trevor Nunn makes a rare sortie into the movies for this period drama inspired by the life and times of the KGB\u2019s veteran British spy Melita Norwood. Here she is transformed into \u201cRed\u201d Joan Stanley, and played as a young woman by Sophie Cookson and in later years by Judi Dench. 19 April Eighth Grade Dir: Bo Burnham A hyper-contemporary comedy-drama from first-time writer-director Bo Burnham (and veteran producer Scott Rudin) that has been much admired. It is about an eighth-grader (ie around 13 years old) who is obsessed with social media and keeps making self-help and self-esteem videos on YouTube which, by getting hardly any views, undermine her self-esteem. 26 April",

Pretty much every day one or both journeys are heavily delayed or cancelled. Trains are packed. The number of services from my local Bath station have been reduced despite massive housebuilding in the area meaning, presumably, more commuters.

Thankfully I only have to commute three days a week, but that\u2019s still a good six hours spent on the disastrous service. Poor souls who go the full five.</p> <p>\u201cThere are delays nearly every day which is not helped by the fact I get three separate trains. If any one of them are delayed then my journey is considerably longer. Trains are frequently overcrowded. It\u2019s practically inhumane how crowded they can get. God help you if you want to reach the bathroom. Since the new timetable came in the Brighton to London service is less frequent and there are no direct trains to Clapham at peak times \u2013 what madness is that?\u201d</p> <h2>Case study</h2> <h2><strong>Woking to Waterloo \u2013 </strong><strong>South Western Railway</strong></h2> <p><strong>Lesley Ferrando, an employment regulatory specialist, commutes at peak times from Woking to Waterloo which costs \u00a321 per day, \u00a3400 per month.</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, a rip-off. I dread the two hours [travelling time] that it\u2019s become. The service is completely unreliable, and there\u2019s been a massive decline over the last 18 months. Trains are delayed every single day. It affects my job, my health and my social life. It drains me, stresses me and prevents me from doing other things because I can\u2019t plan anything.</p> <p>\u201cTrains are mostly overcrowded and getting a seat is a mission.

They are expensive * * * Case study Bath to London \u2013 GWR Molly Conisbee, 46, a researcher, commutes from Oldfield Park in Bath to Bristol for work and also cares for an elderly relative in London, regularly travelling from Bath Spa to Paddington \u2013 \u201cpaying anything \u00a350 to \u00a3150 depending on time of day and urgency with which I need to travel\u201d. \u201cI have done the Bath-Bristol commute for nigh on 13 years and it has never been so poor. Pretty much every day one or both journeys are heavily delayed or cancelled. Trains are packed. The number of services from my local Bath station have been reduced despite massive housebuilding in the area meaning, presumably, more commuters. Often toilets don\u2019t work and the trains are filthy. \u201cThe staff seem ground down and sometimes are understandably pissed off with customers because they are the front line of the service and bear the brunt of our complaints. I have written to GWR to complain and what is frustrating is that you get a response that could have been written by a robot. There is zero-accountability for the terrible service, and the frontline staff are left to bear the brunt of all of our frustrations as travellers.\u201d 2. They are overcrowded Case study Southern Courtenay Blench, 27, an account manager, commutes at peak times from Brighton to Wimbledon with an annual season ticket costing \u00a34,000. She has two changes, at Haywards Heath and Clapham Junction. \u201cI\u2019m commuting on a Southern train so it\u2019s like being in the seventh circle of hell \u2013 a never-ending limbo of delayed trains, strikes, cancellations, reduced services, overcrowding and seats so small you\u2019re sat on top of your neighbour. Thankfully I only have to commute three days a week, but that\u2019s still a good six hours spent on the disastrous service. Poor souls who go the full five. \u201cThere are delays nearly every day which is not helped by the fact I get three separate trains. If any one of them are delayed then my journey is considerably longer. Trains are frequently overcrowded. It\u2019s practically inhumane how crowded they can get. God help you if you want to reach the bathroom. Since the new timetable came in the Brighton to London service is less frequent and there are no direct trains to Clapham at peak times \u2013 what madness is that?\u201d Case study Woking to Waterloo \u2013 South Western Railway Lesley Ferrando, an employment regulatory specialist, commutes at peak times from Woking to Waterloo which costs \u00a321 per day, \u00a3400 per month. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, a rip-off. I dread the two hours [travelling time] that it\u2019s become. The service is completely unreliable, and there\u2019s been a massive decline over the last 18 months. Trains are delayed every single day. It affects my job, my health and my social life. It drains me, stresses me and prevents me from doing other things because I can\u2019t plan anything. \u201cTrains are mostly overcrowded and getting a seat is a mission. It\u2019s often uncomfortable, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to pass out. I can often only get on the second or third train.\u201d 3.

      "body": "<p>In December I travelled to Minsk for a seminar with a <a href=\"https://www.koerber-stiftung.de/en/how-can-europes-history-be-disarmed-1515\">group of European historians</a>. A few miles outside the capital of Belarus, we visited places where both the Nazis and Stalin\u2019s secret police had committed some of the worst crimes of the 20th century. During those few days, I also spoke with some young locals who offered glimmers of hope as to what a truly united Europe could one day look like.</p> <p>It was the most instructive trip I\u2019ve made in years: a deep dive into conflicting European memories, highlighting the difficulty of overcoming stereotypes and ideological narratives, as well as the legacy of the cold war in people\u2019s minds.</p> <p>It may sound odd, but for anyone trying to keep abreast of what Europe means, the best view could arguably be found right there, in those flatlands of marshes, pine trees and spruce, dotted with towns and villages on which the past weighs heavily.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>14 million people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in an area that stretches from the Baltic sea to the Black sea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Minsk is, of course, outside the European Union, in a nation where a dictator rules, in something of a grey zone between Europe and Russia. Few people in western Europe know about Belarus, let alone have been there. Yet it should be prominent in our consciences. \u201cBelarus was the worst place to be in world war two,\u201d the historian Timothy Snyder once noted. In his book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/09/bloodlands-stalin-timothy-snyder-review\" title=\"\">Bloodlands</a>, Snyder recounts how 14 million people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in an area that stretches from the Baltic sea to the Black sea, with Belarus worst affected: a quarter of its population were killed as a result of both Stalin\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s policies.</p> <p>We ignore much about our continent\u2019s history if we overlook the plight of this region, where the two totalitarian systems converged with horrific consequences \u2013 at once plotting together and competing as they laid claim to territory and exterminated those living there, or deported people there to die.</p> <p>Of all the places I\u2019ve visited in Europe, nowhere is that complex history more poignant than in the forests outside Minsk, where three sites of mass carnage, only a few miles apart, are commemorated in very different ways.</p> <p>A fork in the road in <a href=\"http://www.auschwitzstudygroup.com/56-english/projects/the-forgotten-camps/501-maly-trostenets\" title=\"\">Maly Trostenets</a> is where tens of thousands of Jews, many from Germany and Austria, were shot over pits by SS commandos, their corpses later burned. Construction of a monument has recently started there, but strikingly it doesn\u2019t indicate the victims\u2019 names. This is because Belarusian officials are uneasy with commemorating the Holocaust \u2013 much as the Soviet authorities were. Instead, on trees nearby, families of victims have placed small yellow posters bearing the details of those who perished.</p> <p>Not far from there, in the forest of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurapaty\" title=\"\">Kuropaty</a>, lies a place where Stalin\u2019s men shot thousands during the 1930s. Wooden crosses of Orthodox Christianity have been planted by Belarusian civil groups and opposition activists as a way of honouring the victims. But there again, no names. And there is no official monument at all. The cult of Stalin remains untouched in Belarus, much like it has been restored in Putin\u2019s Russia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/18/belarus-president-fires-prime-minister-after-corruption-scandal\">Belarus president fires prime minister after corruption scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And a little further, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatyn_massacre\" title=\"\">Khatyn</a>, is a clearing in the forest where a village once stood. The Nazis massacred its entire population, pushing families into a barn and setting it on fire. They decimated hundreds of villages in Belarus this way. And here the full spectrum of Soviet\u2011era commemorations is deployed: a monument with names, a museum, tour guides. Khatyn symbolises the persecution of an entire nation \u2013 but it is an exclusive emblem, sitting alongside huge omissions. In Belarus the crimes of Stalinism are left largely untold, as are those perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jews.</p> <p>These places should rank prominently in our European minds, yet they don\u2019t. Dealing with the full dimensions of what happened is hard enough for Belarusians dominated by autocracy and propaganda. But it is just as difficult for many of us elsewhere, because we tend to remember the 20th century from a western point of view, not from a fully continental perspective. The iron curtain, which lifted three decades ago, still lingers in our heads.</p> <p>Yet I took back another, much more uplifting message from this trip: young people I met privately shared their hopes of breaking down barriers and connecting with their generation in other parts of Europe. Far from our constant debates about populism, Brexit, Donald Trump and the EU\u2019s struggles, they asked: \u201cWhat do the young British want? Or the French?\u201d; \u201cDo they worry like us about the environment?\u201d; \u201cHow can we share more with them?\u201d</p> <p>In this part of Europe, which experienced the worst of 20th-century nightmares, I found signs of a positive energy, a striving for the basics of democracy and dialogue. It\u2019s a quest no doubt hampered by a regime that likes to lock up dissidents. All the same, which energy seemed to want to burst out of the cold ground like budding flowers in spring. With crucial tests for Europe looming (not least the Brexit endgame, and European parliament elections in May), it was in Belarus that I found more reasons to hope than to wallow in gloom.

      "bodyText": "In December I travelled to Minsk for a seminar with a group of European historians. A few miles outside the capital of Belarus, we visited places where both the Nazis and Stalin\u2019s secret police had committed some of the worst crimes of the 20th century. During those few days, I also spoke with some young locals who offered glimmers of hope as to what a truly united Europe could one day look like. It was the most instructive trip I\u2019ve made in years: a deep dive into conflicting European memories, highlighting the difficulty of overcoming stereotypes and ideological narratives, as well as the legacy of the cold war in people\u2019s minds. It may sound odd, but for anyone trying to keep abreast of what Europe means, the best view could arguably be found right there, in those flatlands of marshes, pine trees and spruce, dotted with towns and villages on which the past weighs heavily. Minsk is, of course, outside the European Union, in a nation where a dictator rules, in something of a grey zone between Europe and Russia. Few people in western Europe know about Belarus, let alone have been there. Yet it should be prominent in our consciences. \u201cBelarus was the worst place to be in world war two,\u201d the historian Timothy Snyder once noted. In his book Bloodlands, Snyder recounts how 14 million people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in an area that stretches from the Baltic sea to the Black sea, with Belarus worst affected: a quarter of its population were killed as a result of both Stalin\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s policies. We ignore much about our continent\u2019s history if we overlook the plight of this region, where the two totalitarian systems converged with horrific consequences \u2013 at once plotting together and competing as they laid claim to territory and exterminated those living there, or deported people there to die. Of all the places I\u2019ve visited in Europe, nowhere is that complex history more poignant than in the forests outside Minsk, where three sites of mass carnage, only a few miles apart, are commemorated in very different ways. A fork in the road in Maly Trostenets is where tens of thousands of Jews, many from Germany and Austria, were shot over pits by SS commandos, their corpses later burned. Construction of a monument has recently started there, but strikingly it doesn\u2019t indicate the victims\u2019 names. This is because Belarusian officials are uneasy with commemorating the Holocaust \u2013 much as the Soviet authorities were. Instead, on trees nearby, families of victims have placed small yellow posters bearing the details of those who perished. Not far from there, in the forest of Kuropaty, lies a place where Stalin\u2019s men shot thousands during the 1930s. Wooden crosses of Orthodox Christianity have been planted by Belarusian civil groups and opposition activists as a way of honouring the victims. But there again, no names. And there is no official monument at all. The cult of Stalin remains untouched in Belarus, much like it has been restored in Putin\u2019s Russia. And a little further, in Khatyn, is a clearing in the forest where a village once stood. The Nazis massacred its entire population, pushing families into a barn and setting it on fire. They decimated hundreds of villages in Belarus this way. And here the full spectrum of Soviet\u2011era commemorations is deployed: a monument with names, a museum, tour guides. Khatyn symbolises the persecution of an entire nation \u2013 but it is an exclusive emblem, sitting alongside huge omissions. In Belarus the crimes of Stalinism are left largely untold, as are those perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jews. These places should rank prominently in our European minds, yet they don\u2019t. Dealing with the full dimensions of what happened is hard enough for Belarusians dominated by autocracy and propaganda. But it is just as difficult for many of us elsewhere, because we tend to remember the 20th century from a western point of view, not from a fully continental perspective. The iron curtain, which lifted three decades ago, still lingers in our heads. Yet I took back another, much more uplifting message from this trip: young people I met privately shared their hopes of breaking down barriers and connecting with their generation in other parts of Europe. Far from our constant debates about populism, Brexit, Donald Trump and the EU\u2019s struggles, they asked: \u201cWhat do the young British want? Or the French?\u201d; \u201cDo they worry like us about the environment?\u201d; \u201cHow can we share more with them?\u201d In this part of Europe, which experienced the worst of 20th-century nightmares, I found signs of a positive energy, a striving for the basics of democracy and dialogue. It\u2019s a quest no doubt hampered by a regime that likes to lock up dissidents. All the same, which energy seemed to want to burst out of the cold ground like budding flowers in spring. With crucial tests for Europe looming (not least the Brexit endgame, and European parliament elections in May), it was in Belarus that I found more reasons to hope than to wallow in gloom. I also came back more convinced than ever that Europe\u2019s travails will only be addressed once we show a greater curiosity for other peoples\u2019 memories. The historian Tony Judt once said: \u201cGetting history right can require a new generation coming along.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is probably a limit to how much you can break taboos.\u201d It is at a human level, through exchanges, contacts, dialogue, and more awareness of history (especially in the media), that we can bring down some of those walls in our heads. Accepting differences, after shedding light on them, is surely as important to Europe\u2019s future as trade deals or deficit targets.

It would see the mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/great-barrier-reef-forecast-warns-entire-system-at-risk-of-bleaching-and-coral-death-this-summer\">die-off</a> of coral <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/30/us-coral-reefs-global-warming-climate-change\">reefs</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">extinction</a> of some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2018/sep/17/endangered-species-on-a-train\">species</a>, rising sea levels, wet areas of the world becoming wetter and dry areas drier, and the decline of agricultural productivity across swaths of the globe.</p> <p>That is a future we should obviously try to avoid.

Instead, countries discussed a \u201crulebook\u201d for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice, including such arcane matters as how countries measure and verify their emissions, and how often they should report on them, and rows over carbon credits.</p> <p>In Poland, there were no firm commitments to ramp up countries\u2019 national targets in line with scientific advice, and this is unlikely to happen before 2020 at the earliest. On current national emissions-cutting targets, we are in for about 3C of warming. Yet the IPCC warned that if we want to avoid 1.5C of warming, we have about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">12 years</a> to bring global emissions under control and swiftly move to just half of their current level. That represents a massive shift needed in the global economy, and yet emissions worldwide look to be moving upward again slightly after a decade in which they showed signs of stabilising.</p> <p>There was also bad news from the US at the talks, which played little part as Donald Trump prepares to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-confirms-us-will-quit-paris-climate-deal\">withdraw</a> from the Paris agreement, except to hold a side event at the conference celebrating a bright future for coal.</p> <p>Looked at this way, the omens from 2018 were not good. Fortunately, however, 2019 may indeed be a breakthrough year. Public opinion is mobilising around the world and politicians and businesses are paying attention.

      "bodyText": "Extreme weather hit the headlines throughout 2018, from the heatwave across much of the northern hemisphere, which saw unprecedented wildfires in Sweden, drought in the UK and devastating wildfires in the US, to floods in India and typhoons in south-east Asia. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, last year was the fourth hottest on record and confirms a trend of rising temperatures that is a clear signal that we are having an effect on the climate. Droughts, floods, fiercer storms and heatwaves, as well as sea level rises, are all expected to increase markedly as a result. Late in the year there was also the starkest warning yet from scientists of what our future will be if we allow climate change to take hold. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, which has been producing regular reports on the state of climate science since 1988, produced its latest comprehensive overview examining what the future will look like if we undergo 1.5C (2.7F) of warming. That does not sound like a lot \u2013 most people would be hard put to notice a temperature difference of 1.5C \u2013 but in climate terms, 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is enough to take us into the danger zone. It would see the mass die-off of coral reefs, the extinction of some species, rising sea levels, wet areas of the world becoming wetter and dry areas drier, and the decline of agricultural productivity across swaths of the globe. That is a future we should obviously try to avoid. But the UN climate conference in Poland that ended the year\u2019s climate-related events in December showed little sign that the urgency of the scientists\u2019 warnings had been heeded. Instead, countries discussed a \u201crulebook\u201d for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice, including such arcane matters as how countries measure and verify their emissions, and how often they should report on them, and rows over carbon credits. In Poland, there were no firm commitments to ramp up countries\u2019 national targets in line with scientific advice, and this is unlikely to happen before 2020 at the earliest. On current national emissions-cutting targets, we are in for about 3C of warming. Yet the IPCC warned that if we want to avoid 1.5C of warming, we have about 12 years to bring global emissions under control and swiftly move to just half of their current level. That represents a massive shift needed in the global economy, and yet emissions worldwide look to be moving upward again slightly after a decade in which they showed signs of stabilising. There was also bad news from the US at the talks, which played little part as Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Paris agreement, except to hold a side event at the conference celebrating a bright future for coal. Looked at this way, the omens from 2018 were not good. Fortunately, however, 2019 may indeed be a breakthrough year. Public opinion is mobilising around the world and politicians and businesses are paying attention. There will be a series of high-profile events that will engage the public and governments and may provide a better way forward than was managed last year. Chief among them is the promise of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, to hold a summit for world leaders that will require them to face up to the dangers of climate change head on. Guterres is uncompromising, warning in Poland that it would be \u201cimmoral and suicidal\u201d not to take firm and urgent action commensurate with the scale of the problem. Leaders will be put on the spot, and will come under very public pressure as coalitions of civil society groups seek to put their case around the summit and in the lead-up to it. The role of women, who are among the most vulnerable to climate change, will be highlighted, and the role of young people, who will have to live with the consequences of their elders\u2019 mistakes in a warming world. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is also holding a One World Summit, planned for the summer, at which the focus will be on persuading businesses to take a leading role, investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and changing the way they use energy. There are clear signs of hope on climate change also in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy technology, which is now competitive with fossil fuels. And the Keep it in the ground campaign has succeeded in encouraging many investors to move their money out of fossil fuel stocks. But most of all the civil society campaigns which have ramped up in 2018 and look set to increase their momentum in the coming year are taking effect. Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue. This can be seen in some unexpected ways, such as the rise of veganism and flexitarian eating, as people seek to reduce their impact on the climate from eating meat. Through well-publicised and effective movements and actions, more and more people are refusing silently to acquiesce in ignoring the dangers to the climate.",

He said the account should have been transcribed in a separate post. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing actually wrong with the contents of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were just some typos in it, things like that.\u201d In 2015, a similar incident occurred in Sydney when police attended a house to find a \u201cquite embarrassed\u201d man throwing furniture at a spider, alone.",

      "bodyText": "A diplomatic disagreement was developing between Australia and Fiji as Peter Dutton insisted on Wednesday afternoon that Islamic State fighter, Neil Prakash, was a Fijian citizen. On Friday it was revealed Australian authorities had revoked the Australian citizenship of 27-year-old Prakash over his association with offshore terrorism groups, on the understanding he also held citizenship in Fiji. Under Australian law a dual national can be stripped of their Australian citizenship if they have committed terrorists acts, but international law prohibits rendering a person stateless. However on Tuesday Fijian immigration authorities said they have no record of Prakash, who was born in Australia but has Fijian-Indian and Cambodian background. Dutton called a press conference on Wednesday afternoon to insist the legal advice given by the government solicitor \u201cwas clear\u201d. \u201cThe advice to the government based on all the intricate detail and fact of this particular matter is that Mr Prakash is, by operation of law, a citizen of Fiji,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cAs I say the Fijians were advised some time ago and we\u2019ve been working with the Fijians and will continue that relationship.\u201d The director of the Fijian immigration department, Nemani Vuniwaqa, told Guardian Australia unequivocally the 27-year-old Prakash had never held or sought Fijian citizenship. He also said no Australian government representative had contacted him. \u201cThe law states that if you are born outside of Fiji, the father has to apply for citizenship for the child,\u201d Vuniwaqa said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t applied for it, his father hasn\u2019t applied for it.\u201d Prakash was born in Australia and is of Fijian-Indian and Cambodian background, and the government\u2019s understanding was that he held Fijian citizenship, the Australian reported on Saturday. \u201cDual citizens who choose to be involved in terrorism forfeit the privileges of Australian citizenship, and I remain committed to enforcing the legal provisions that remove them,\u201d the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said on Saturday. First reported by the Fiji Sun, Vuniwaqa said he had searched through Fijian immigration records and confirmed Prakash had not entered the country, or applied for citizenship. Nor had his father apply on his behalf, the official said. \u201cHe was born in Australia and has acquired Australian citizenship since birth,\u201d he told the paper. Vuniwaqa told Guardian Australia he learned of the Australian government\u2019s claim that Prakash was Fijian through the media, and no one had spoken to his department. \u201cWe should be consulted on that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut [now] we wouldn\u2019t be speaking in the same language in the first place because he\u2019s not a Fijian citizen.\u201d While the government maintains Prakash is indeed a Fijian citizen, under proposed terrorism legislation it would not need to be as definitive. The new laws, if passed, would allow a minister to strip a convicted terrorist of Australian citizenship regardless of the severity of the conviction and need only be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that the person would have another citizenship. Asked on Tuesday for clarification on Prakash, a spokesman for the Department of Home Affairs said only that a person may only lose their Australian citizenship under Australian law \u201cif they are a national or citizen of a country other than Australia\u201d. \u201cAustralia is committed to upholding our international legal obligations, including our obligation not to render a person stateless.\u201d He refused to comment further. On Wednesday Dutton released a further statement distancing himself from the citizenship cancellation. \u201cMr Prakash\u2019s case was brought to my attention after careful consideration by the Citizenship Loss Board that Mr Prakash\u2019s Australian citizenship had ceased by virtue of his actions in fighting for Islamic State from May 2016,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cNeither the Citizenship Loss Board nor I make decisions on whether an individual ceases to be an Australian citizen, as the provisions operate automatically by virtue of a person\u2019s conduct.\u201d Dutton said the Citizenship Loss Board had examined the requirements for cessation of Prakash\u2019s citizenship, including that he was the citizen of another country. He maintained the government had been in \u201cclose contact\u201d with the Fijian government since Prakash lost his citizenship, and \u201cwill continue our close cooperation with Fiji on this issue\u201d. Labor\u2019s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, accused Dutton of apparent \u201cChristmas headline grabbing\u201d without providing explanation. He questioned what due diligence Dutton had done before announcing the revocation of Prakash\u2019s citizenship. \u201cNational security is too important an issue to be played with flippantly, and Labor supports the right of any government to strip dual nationals of their Australian citizenship to protect the Australian people.\u201d However he said serious questions remained about \u201ctiming, activity and process\u201d, including whether Dutton sought advice from his department before making the announcement, and whether he\u2019d spoken to the Fijian authorities. \u201cIf you leave someone stateless in those circumstances there are real problems in terms of risk,\u201d Neumann said. Prakash\u2019s Australian passport was cancelled in 2014 and he was added to a sanctions list the following year. He was captured in Turkey in 2016, and is now in a maximum security prison facing terrorism charges with potential sentences of up to 15 years in jail. He is wanted by Australian authorities over his alleged role in two terrorism plots, including one to target Anzac Day services in Melbourne in 2015, and over his travel to Syria to fight with Isis. He faces a potential life sentence if extradited and convicted in Australia.",

Taiwan also saw a contraction in manufacturing in December while official data in Singapore showed that gross domestic product grew more slowly than forecast in the fourth quarter as the city-state\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted on a quarterly basis. The Asia data made it more difficult for traders and investors to ignore what looks like \u201ca genuine global economic slowdown\u201d, said Australian market strategist Greg McKenna. \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult to be strongly positive given all the uncertainties,\u201d said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. With business conditions expected to get worse before they get better, China is expected to roll out more support measures in coming months on top of a raft of initiatives in 2018. \u201cThis data confirms our view that the economy is weak and that stimulus needs to arrive quickly,\u201d said analysts at ING in a note. The position of the US Federal Reserve remains the key to market sentiment over the next 12 months, along with talks between the US and China to end their trade standoff. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, signalled that there could be two more rate hikes this year, adding to the four he oversaw in 2018.

The treasury market also assumes the Fed is done and dusted with bond yields \u2013 a key indicator of real interest rates \u2013 now beginning to fall after rising during 2018. Powell will have the chance to comment on the economic outlook when he participates in a joint discussion with his predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday. Also looming is a closely-watched survey on US manufacturing due on Thursday, followed by the December payrolls report on Friday. \u201cWhat is clear is that the global synchronised growth story that propelled risk assets higher has come to the end of its current run,\u201d analysts at OCBC Bank wrote in a note.

Bestjet going into administration is unfortunate for its customers and creditors alike.\u201d</p> <p>It prompted Neil Hall to contact Etihad, who confirmed a hold had been placed on their spot but that the ticket had not been paid for. Their booking was eventually cancelled by the airline on 31 December.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never flown business and it was sort of a once-in-a-lifetime thing to celebrate the start of something new for us,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously quite a large amount of money and not an everyday purchase, put it that way.

A creditors\u2019 report lists him as both a secured creditor and former employee of the company.</p> <p>In a statement to the creditor, Robert Bruce McVicker, the director of the new owners McVicker Investment Group, said the company had been placed into administration after representations to the former owners \u201cfailed to materialise\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince we acquired Bestjet in November, we have worked with the former owners to improve the business and customer service experience,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cRepresentations made to the company failed to materialise and, unfortunately, we have been left with no choice but to place the business into voluntary administration to determine the best course of action for customers and suppliers, and to see whether Bestjet can continue to trade.\u201d</p> <p>Creditors will hope for answers at a meeting held by the administrators, Pilot Partners, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Kate Ryder set up a Facebook group for customers to share information after she lost $3,150 on a flight to Paris for the Fifa women\u2019s world cup final.

Neil Hall and his wife, Annette, paid $10,600 for two business class flights from Brisbane to Milan with Etihad on 11 December. They received a tax receipt and assumed the flight had been paid for. The couple had never flown business class before, and decided to splash out after Neil was made redundant. \u201cIt was really to celebrate 38 years of work, and just spoil ourselves on an overseas trip,\u201d he said. They had no idea Bestjet had gone into administration until 22 December, when they received an email which \u201cset off alarm bells\u201d. Littered with spelling errors, the email, purporting to be from Bestjet, accused airfare ticketing consolidator CVFR Travel Group, of \u201cacting illegally\u201d with the support of some airlines, and claimed bookings made prior to 11 December had been paid for. \u201cCVFR has worked with airlines to cancel your booking so they can get a full refund but the WON\u2019T refund the money to you, they are also covered by insurance,\u201d the email read. \u201cCVFR will keep your funds and make you submit a chargeback even though your booking is confirmed, e-tickets have been issued and the airline has received your funds.\u201d The bizarre screed purported to include the email addresses of top travel industry executives, including the chief executive of Virgin Australia, John Borghetti. After email was sent, the company\u2019s administrator, Pilot Partners, sent an email to customers advising them to ignore \u201cunauthorised information\u201d. \u201cThe administrators have no control over notices and statements issued from the company\u2019s server, bestjet.com, and customers are advised to ignore them,\u201d Nigel Markey of Pilot said in the statement. CVFR also issued an emailed statement calling the claims \u201cfalse\u201d. \u201cThe claims made on the email are false and designed to distract affected passengers from contacting Bestjet and deflecting blame for your loss away from Bestjet,\u201d the email read. \u201cIf you received the email then you were a Bestjet customer and they are responsible for your loss. Bestjet going into administration is unfortunate for its customers and creditors alike.\u201d It prompted Neil Hall to contact Etihad, who confirmed a hold had been placed on their spot but that the ticket had not been paid for. Their booking was eventually cancelled by the airline on 31 December. \u201cWe\u2019ve never flown business and it was sort of a once-in-a-lifetime thing to celebrate the start of something new for us,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously quite a large amount of money and not an everyday purchase, put it that way. It\u2019s certainly hit us pretty hard.\u201d The circumstances around the company\u2019s collapse are still unclear. Bestjet was sold to McVicker International on 2 November. Australian Securities and Investments Commission records show that business was only registered in October. Bestjet\u2019s previous owner, Rachel James, is the wife of the former boss of Air Australia, Michael James. Michael James was banned from managing corporations for three years after Air Australia\u2019s collapse in 2012, which left thousands of passengers stranded overseas and creditors almost $100m out of pocket. Bestjet lost its accreditation with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents after it came to suspect Michael James was an employee of the company. A creditors\u2019 report lists him as both a secured creditor and former employee of the company. In a statement to the creditor, Robert Bruce McVicker, the director of the new owners McVicker Investment Group, said the company had been placed into administration after representations to the former owners \u201cfailed to materialise\u201d. \u201cSince we acquired Bestjet in November, we have worked with the former owners to improve the business and customer service experience,\u201d he said. \u201cRepresentations made to the company failed to materialise and, unfortunately, we have been left with no choice but to place the business into voluntary administration to determine the best course of action for customers and suppliers, and to see whether Bestjet can continue to trade.\u201d Creditors will hope for answers at a meeting held by the administrators, Pilot Partners, on Wednesday. Kate Ryder set up a Facebook group for customers to share information after she lost $3,150 on a flight to Paris for the Fifa women\u2019s world cup final. The group now has 700 members, and Ryder estimates that the losses of its members alone could amount to about $2.4m. Ryder, who works casually as a registered nurse, said the discovery that the tickets had not been paid for was \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to lose that sort of money, I\u2019ve had to rebook our seats and pay an extra $1,200,\u201d she said. \u201cI was furious, it seems like a scam to me. The government needs surely needs to close a loophole to stop these sorts of things happening in the future.\u201d Neil Hall, too, would like something positive to come out of his loss. \u201cThe thing for me is that, obviously it\u2019s bad for me, but I would like to see some sort of assurance we don\u2019t have companies doing this to make sure people aren\u2019t put in this position. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about us but I\u2019m also concerned for others in the future.\u201d",

The industrial revolution would literally poison the well, as drinking water became a vector for diseases like typhus and cholera. The rich could afford to have unspoiled water delivered from remote sources; poor people simply died until municipal chlorination in the early 20th century helped people live longer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">Avoiding meat and dairy is \u2018single biggest way\u2019 to reduce your impact on Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bottled or otherwise, there are now more people on earth consuming more water than ever before, and <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/is-australias-current-drought-caused-by-climate-change-its-complicated-97867\">climate change just might be contributing</a> to an increasing dearth of it with longer and more intense droughts.</p> <p>The story of water, then, is the story of the world \u2013 and the luxury industry is cashing in.</p> <p>Hinton\u2019s frequency-infused industry darlings are just the tip of the iceberg.

In 2005, \u201cwater sommelier\u201d Martin Riese caught the attention of the media when he created a water menu at Berlin\u2019s First Floor restaurant after a guest complained about the taste of the water on offer. By 2008 he\u2019d published Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Water); in 2010 he<em> </em>was certified by the German water trade association; and in 2013 he landed in Los Angeles, after receiving an O-1 visa for his \u201cextraordinary knowledge of water\u201d.</p> <p>As the country\u2019s first certified water sommelier, he launched a 45-page water menu at Ray\u2019s &amp; Stark Bar. Two days later, he was a national curiosity, covered on Good Morning America, Fox News and CNN, and even interviewed by television science presenter Bill Nye. He opened a $100,000 bottle of water for a tasting with Diplo and 2Chainz. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX6QvVAD1oM\">He appeared on late night host Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s</a> show in September 2013.</p> <p>\u201cPretty much every day, I have people rolling their eyes when they hear the words \u2018water sommelier,\u2019 and when I even tell them that I can match water to food, more eye-rolling starts,\u201d Reiss says. But, he stresses, he is driven by a loftier goal. \u201cI want to give value to water. When people understand that water is not just water, they might rethink their use of water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3e0889afc9a70c6826e83c2dd5c6af1aebbc4f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3e0889afc9a70c6826e83c2dd5c6af1aebbc4f7/0_0_5518_3679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Riese holds up a glass of water to the light to look at it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water sommelier Martin Riese has recently established his own water school in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Doornkaat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHere in America, people do not even know anymore where the water is coming from. They think that a purified water is the same as spring water. Purified water finds mostly its origin in the municipal water system, so it\u2019s actually tap water, which is already processed then filtered and with very small amounts of minerals added. The end product is a highly processed beverage from a factory. On the other hand, you have waters which are coming from a natural occurring source, like a spring, glacial, aquifer and so on. These waters are barely treated and you can actually taste the water\u2019s origin. In wine terms, you would call it terroir.\u201d</p> <p>There had been five schools around the world where it was possible to become a certified water sommelier: two in Germany (one being the prestigious and original <a href=\"https://www.doemens.org/en/savour-academy/watersommelier.html\">Doemens</a>), one in Italy, one in China and one in South Korea. On 1 August last year, Riese <a href=\"https://www.martin-riese.com/social\">established a sixth</a> in the United States with his business partner and <a href=\"http://www.finewaters.com/\">Fine Water Society</a> founder, Michael Mascha. They recently certified their first water sommelier in Myanmar after three months of online courses, a verbal examination and a final project.</p> <p>Mascha says most people in the industry would consider him an early catalyst for what the market now considers fine water. His own origin story has a familiar flavour: like Hinton, water saved him. In 2002, he says, his doctor told him \u201cyou can live or continue drinking alcohol\u201d. He founded the Fine Water Society that same year, a sprawling, invite-only index of fine water from around the world that serves to define, explain and promote the ever-swelling industry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here in America, people do not even know anymore where the water is coming from</p> <footer> <cite>Martin Riese</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe water we are drinking is actually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/science/the-water-in-your-glass-might-be-older-than-the-sun.html\">older than our planet,</a>\u201d Mascha says \u2013 and that in-built cosmic intrigue lends itself to all kinds of stories.</p> <p>\u201cWe see a lot of claims around water.

From super light, airy, and smooth like Svalbar\u00f0i, to creamy textures, to very mineral-heavy waters that start to almost have a tangible, \u2018solid\u2019 feel in the mouth.

Though he claims to have invested $100,000 in its development, Hinton is unwilling to discuss the unique device he claims he designed (\u201cIt\u2019s not like Coke is going to give up their trade secret.\u201d) that produces his water by harnessing \u201cthe incredible natural alchemy of energised molecules\u201d. He does acknowledge this nebulous air of naturopathy is central to its appeal. That and the trending but increasingly dubious belief that alkaline water is better for you than regular tap water. In the luxury water business, a free good is repackaged and resold as aspirational. \u201cI think it\u2019s like the most marketable thing ever invented,\u201d Hinton says. The core of this concept of \u201cfine water\u201d might seem like a new phenomenon, but in fact it dates back to the Roman empire, where certain aqueducts were preferred, or even considered divine, and natural carbonated water was imported from Germania in earthen jars. The industrial revolution would literally poison the well, as drinking water became a vector for diseases like typhus and cholera. The rich could afford to have unspoiled water delivered from remote sources; poor people simply died until municipal chlorination in the early 20th century helped people live longer. Bottled or otherwise, there are now more people on earth consuming more water than ever before, and climate change just might be contributing to an increasing dearth of it with longer and more intense droughts. The story of water, then, is the story of the world \u2013 and the luxury industry is cashing in. Hinton\u2019s frequency-infused industry darlings are just the tip of the iceberg. Some premium waters such as Svalbar\u00f0i, sold locally for A$115 per 750ml bottle, are literally made from icebergs harvested on expeditions to the Arctic Ocean. Water bottles with crystals in them and crystal-infused water like that of Australia\u2019s Madam Dry (A$49.99 per 12 pack) are trends within a trend, inspired by Instagram\u2019s wilderness of \u201cwellness\u201d, the regimens of Miranda Kerr and there\u2019s that naturopathy again: Madam Dry lists what astrological sign the moon was traveling through when \u201cbrewing\u201d commenced. Premium, luxury or fine water has even co-opted much of the wine industry\u2019s terminology \u2013 \u201cvarietal\u201d, \u201cmouthfeel\u201d \u201cterroir\u201d \u2013 as well as introducing some of its own. \u201cTotal dissolved solids\u201d, for instance, is a measurement scale unique to understanding why and how a water tastes and even feels the way it does. Water from the Fiji Islands, with its TDS of 222, is said to be smooth and velvety. Water like Vichy Catalan from Spain, with its TDS of 3054, is said to be extremely salty and complex. The phenomenon isn\u2019t particularly new. In 2005, \u201cwater sommelier\u201d Martin Riese caught the attention of the media when he created a water menu at Berlin\u2019s First Floor restaurant after a guest complained about the taste of the water on offer. By 2008 he\u2019d published Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Water); in 2010 he was certified by the German water trade association; and in 2013 he landed in Los Angeles, after receiving an O-1 visa for his \u201cextraordinary knowledge of water\u201d. As the country\u2019s first certified water sommelier, he launched a 45-page water menu at Ray\u2019s &amp; Stark Bar. Two days later, he was a national curiosity, covered on Good Morning America, Fox News and CNN, and even interviewed by television science presenter Bill Nye. He opened a $100,000 bottle of water for a tasting with Diplo and 2Chainz. He appeared on late night host Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s show in September 2013. \u201cPretty much every day, I have people rolling their eyes when they hear the words \u2018water sommelier,\u2019 and when I even tell them that I can match water to food, more eye-rolling starts,\u201d Reiss says. But, he stresses, he is driven by a loftier goal. \u201cI want to give value to water. When people understand that water is not just water, they might rethink their use of water. \u201cHere in America, people do not even know anymore where the water is coming from. They think that a purified water is the same as spring water. Purified water finds mostly its origin in the municipal water system, so it\u2019s actually tap water, which is already processed then filtered and with very small amounts of minerals added. The end product is a highly processed beverage from a factory. On the other hand, you have waters which are coming from a natural occurring source, like a spring, glacial, aquifer and so on. These waters are barely treated and you can actually taste the water\u2019s origin. In wine terms, you would call it terroir.\u201d There had been five schools around the world where it was possible to become a certified water sommelier: two in Germany (one being the prestigious and original Doemens), one in Italy, one in China and one in South Korea. On 1 August last year, Riese established a sixth in the United States with his business partner and Fine Water Society founder, Michael Mascha. They recently certified their first water sommelier in Myanmar after three months of online courses, a verbal examination and a final project. Mascha says most people in the industry would consider him an early catalyst for what the market now considers fine water. His own origin story has a familiar flavour: like Hinton, water saved him. In 2002, he says, his doctor told him \u201cyou can live or continue drinking alcohol\u201d. He founded the Fine Water Society that same year, a sprawling, invite-only index of fine water from around the world that serves to define, explain and promote the ever-swelling industry. \u201cThe water we are drinking is actually older than our planet,\u201d Mascha says \u2013 and that in-built cosmic intrigue lends itself to all kinds of stories. \u201cWe see a lot of claims around water. Microstructured, wetter, smaller molecules, alkalinity, frequency \u2026 those are all marketing messages created as there is no other story to tell,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no source or history to the water. It comes from a factory and the stories are made up to confuse. \u201cMichael Pollan, a USA-based food writer, famously believes: \u2018When it says \u201chealthy\u201d on the package, it is probably not.\u2019 Great water,\u201d Mascha continues, \u201ccomes from unspoiled sources and they are usually remote.\u201d Jamal Qureshi\u2019s Svalbar\u00f0i water, for instance, is made of ice gathered from the glaciers in Kongsfjorden, part of the titular Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. That A$115 bottle might seem exorbitant to the layperson but it is far from the most expensive fine water on the market. That honour goes to Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani, a bottle of which sold for the jawdropping sum of \u00a339,357 for 750ml in 2010, making it the most expensive bottle of water in the world according to Guinness, thanks in no small part to the bottle itself being 24-carat gold. Svalbar\u00f0i, meanwhile, has drawn an incredible amount of attention to itself with a fable of production the envy of any winemaker. Qureshi stumbled over the Svalbard region when he was young and travelling; obtaining water from it is \u201can extreme logistical and cost challenge\u201d which he saw as marketing potential for a \u201cbrand that stands out to consumers\u201d. \u201cHaving a bottle that could match the story and be worth a purchase almost in and of itself was also critical. People have a \u2018wow\u2019 moment when they see it. Then when they see pictures of the ice gathering it is always a second \u2018wow\u2019 moment.\u201d Qureshi, who holds regular water tastings, explains that as with anything we put in our mouths, smell, taste and feel are vital. \u201cProper water should generally not have smell, which tends to be a sign of taint that is not good. Odourless is best. Mouthfeel is the other major component. From super light, airy, and smooth like Svalbar\u00f0i, to creamy textures, to very mineral-heavy waters that start to almost have a tangible, \u2018solid\u2019 feel in the mouth. Carbonation obviously has a huge impact on mouthfeel as well, from very gentle bubbles to big and bold ones.\u201d Qureshi sees a social responsibility in his work too. \u201cWe aren\u2019t gathering sea ice,\u201d he says of Svalbar\u00f0i. \u201cThe icebergs are carved off of freshwater glaciers. Obviously we are gathering them from the sea and as such we are constantly reminded of the problems of rising sea levels and plastic pollution in particular.\u201d Because of the latter, they use glass bottles; because of the former, they are carbon neutral, and are \u201cnow going carbon negative, so that each bottle will help actually preserve a piece of the Arctic ice cap.\u201d Qureshi recently moved his family from the States to Svalbard, close to where the whales now sing more deeply to hear each other over the noise of melting icebergs. \u201cLiving in Svalbard these issues have become very personal. I walk on the beach here in the middle-of-nowhere Arctic and pass by discarded plastic fishing nets that have washed in from the middle of the Atlantic. We live daily with freakishly warm temperatures, for this part of the world anyway, and I watch how the glacier fronts are retreating. I talk to old-timers and see their pictures of how the fjords used to freeze and no one could get a ship in here for five months in the winter. Now the local fjord hasn\u2019t frozen in a decade and it rained this past January when it should have been -20C.\u201d Water sommelier Reise also sees himself as an advocate for a vital resource. \u201cBy promoting fine water, I hope I can do my part to protect areas around the world and open people\u2019s mind that water is so much more than just a commodity.\u201d He cites his involvement with Viva Con Agua, a charity in Hamburg that seeks to improve drinking water in developing nations. \u201cI fight for people who don\u2019t have access to clean and safe drinking water. I hope I can spark conversations with my water menu about the topic of water in general. The more we know about water the more we will protect it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has closed a Victorian immigration detention centre, and plans to partially close another in Sydney, saying its efforts to stop people seeking asylum by boat has reduced the number of people in detention. The last of Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre\u2019s detainees were transferred on Monday, emptying the controversial facility and adding it to the list of 19 closed or put into contingency since September 2013. It comes amid security upgrades and new wings across the network to accommodate a growing number of medium- and high-risk detainees whose visas were cancelled on character grounds. The immigration minister, David Coleman, also announced the Blaxland compound inside Villawood detention centre would close in mid-2019. It follows the closure of the Christmas Island facility in October. The federal government said the closures were a sign of the success of its military-led response to the large number of people seeking asylum in Australia by boat under the previous Labor government. \u201cAt its peak in July 2013, there were more than 10,000 people held in immigration detention facilities in Australia, including 2,000 children,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThis government has stopped the boats, got the children out of detention and closed the once full immigration detention facilities.\u201d At 30 November last year, more than 1,300 people were detained in Australia\u2019s inshore detention network, down from 1,715 at 30 June. More than one in five had spent longer than 730 days in detention. Across all detention centres there were 405 people held on 501 visa cancellations. The bulk of those in onshore detention at November were held in Villawood (450) and Yongah Hill detention centre, outside of Perth (229). More than 16,000 people were living in the community on bridging visas. The government\u2019s claim there are no children in detention is disputed. It maintains that those housed in a \u201cresidential-style facility\u201d, such as nine-month-old Isabella who has spent her entire life inside Melbourne Immigration Transit Accomodation centre (Mita) with her mother Huyen, and the young daughters of a Tamil couple facing deportation, are not strictly in detention. People transferred from Nauru to Australia for medical care \u2013 including children \u2013 have also been housed in detention centres or guarded hotels for weeks or months before being allowed to live in the community. While the Coalition government has worked to reduce the number of asylum seekers held in detention, it has simultaneously sought an increasing number of deportations on character grounds, prompting the building of new, higher security sections at other facilities, and increasingly tough security restrictions. In 2017 the federal government began construction of a new wing at Mita, to accommodate the growing number of medium- and high-risk detainees facing deportation under section 501 of the Migration Act. In 2017-18 more than 900 visas were cancelled on character grounds, including members of outlaw motorcycle gangs, drug traffickers and sex offenders, who the department said posed an ongoing risk. \u201cThe department has significantly changed the way it manages detention and status resolution, with the safety and security of the Australian community at its centre,\u201d it said in its annual report. \u201cImproved risk-based assessments support the appropriate placement and management of individuals while their status is being resolved, while places in held detention is reserved for those individuals who pose a risk to the safety and security of the Australian community.\u201d Amid the toughening of conditions, the legality of indefinite administrative detention is facing a court challenge this year, on the basis it has become punitive. Mainland centres have been the subject of multiple complaints of detainee mistreatment by security staff, and overzealous visitor restrictions. There have also been several violent incidents and deaths. Internal movement of detainees across the onshore network has also concerned legal groups and advocates. The family of 22-year-old Sarwan Aljhelie, who took his own life at Yongah Hill, said he had recently been transferred without explanation from Villawood centre in Sydney, which was near his family and children.

      "bodyText": "Drownings in Australia are up 51% compared with the same time last year, after five men drowned on New Year\u2019s Day. Preliminary figures compiled by Royal Life Saving Australia show that 47 people drowned from 1 December to 1 January, compared with 31 last summer. The number of people who drowned at beaches or in the ocean has reached 21, higher than the 14-year average for December of 13 drowning in coastal waterways but below last year\u2019s toll of 23. The majority of the deaths have been in Victoria, where a 45-year old Bairnsdale man drowned while swimming with his wife and family at Paynesville, just 15 minutes from his hometown on the Gippsland Lakes, at 4.50pm on Tuesday. About an hour-and-a-half earlier, a 66-year-old man was pulled from the water at the northern Tasmanian resort town of Hawley Beach. In both cases paramedics and members of the public attempted to revive the men, but were unsuccessful. Earlier that afternoon a 35-year-old man drowned off Clovelly Beach in Sydney, and a man in his 40s died after being rescued from the surf at Frenchman\u2019s Beach on North Stradbroke Island in Queensland. A fifth man, aged in his 20s, drowned while free diving along the Rockingham wreck trail, which has been set up for divers just south of Perth, about 12pm Western Australian time. All five deaths will be subject to coronial investigations. The Royal Life Saving Australia national operations manager, Craig Roberts, said heatwaves and unusually hot weather, which is forecast to be repeated across much of Australia on Friday, had drawn more people to both inland and coastal waterways, as well as backyard pools, to escape the heat. Roberts said an analysis of the last 10 years of drownings showed that a number of those who died were people, particularly men, who were familiar with the area where they were swimming but overestimated both their knowledge and their fitness. He said that trend had continued this summer. \u201cWe have seen a large number of adult males who have drowned not only this summer, but over the last five or six years at an increasing rate, and that\u2019s largely due to a number of people going into the water without realising they are not as fit as they used to be,\u201d he said. While 27% of those who drowned in Australia in the past 10 years were born overseas, more than half of those people had lived in Australia for a decade or more. Roberts said people drowning while trying to rescue a friend or loved one was also a significant risk, and urged people, particularly parents, to take first aid and surf life-saving courses so they are able to help if their children get into trouble.

He had been assessed by specialist medical staff, Greater Manchester police added.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, armed officers raided a property in the Cheetham Hill area of the city, where the suspect, who is being held on suspicion of attempted murder, lived with his parents and four siblings.</p> <p>A police spokesman said: \u201cThe counter-terrorism investigation remains ongoing. There is nothing to suggest the involvement of other people in this attack, but confirming this remains a main priority for the investigation. The search of the address in Cheetham Hill continues.\u201d</p> <p>Neighbours had earlier been told by officers to go into their homes as they descended on the man\u2019s house, a mile north of the city centre.</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon, tactical aid unit vans were stationed outside the property, with a police officer guarding the door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/manchester-zip/giv-3902th6oqPNvzk8Q\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/manchester-zip/giv-3902th6oqPNvzk8Q\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Neighbour Alim Obeadlugh said he was out walking near the property when he saw armed officers. He said: \u201cThey just told me to go back inside. They did not even give me a chance to ask what it is about they just said, \u2018go in.\u2019 I thought it must be a serious problem and I asked them what was going on and they said it was a terrorism incident.\u201d</p> <p>Nousha Babaakachel said the man\u2019s family came to live in the street about 12 years ago from the Netherlands.</p> <p>A man was seen leaving the property shortly after the police raid, with his face covered in a black cloth and a hat covering his head. Neighbours said the blue VW Jetta in which he drove away belonged to the brother that worked at Manchester airport.</p> <p>The incident, classified as critical, was being investigated by counter-terrorism police officers after the perpetrator was allegedly heard shouting Islamist slogans during the attack just before 9pm at Victoria station in the city.</p> <p>Footage of the aftermath of the attack showed a man being held down by five police officers, with blood stains on the pavement. Another video showed the suspect shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as he was put in the back of a police van. He was also heard screaming \u201clong live the caliphate\u201d.</p> <p>Russ Jackson, an assistant chief constable with Greater Manchester police (GMP), described the attack on the officer and a couple in their 50s as frenzied and random in nature. It took place near the scene of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.</p> <p>Jackson said there was nothing to suggest others were involved and that officers were keeping an open mind and taking into consideration the attacker\u2019s mental health.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning forensic officers were seen scouring the station and police were examining CCTV footage. Security officials in the government, police and the intelligence services were helping the investigation.</p> <p>The BTP officer was stabbed in the shoulder, while the man and woman both sustained abdominal injuries, and the woman also received wounds to her forehead.</p> <p>Jackson said the couple, who were in the city celebrating the new year, could be in hospital for some time after sustaining \u201csignificant injuries\u201d during the attack. The officer, a sergeant in his 30s, had been discharged.</p> <p>During a press conference, the GMP chief constable, Ian Hopkins, said: \u201cLast night we experienced a horrific attack on people out to simply enjoy the New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations in Manchester. My thoughts are with the couple who are still being treated in hospital for their serious injuries and with the brave British Transport Police officer who was also stabbed during the attack.</p> <p>\u201cI know that the events last night will have affected many people and caused concern. That the incident happened so close to the scene of the terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 makes it even more dreadful.\u201d</p> <p>Hopkins confirmed the incident was being treated as a terrorist investigation and that officers had been working throughout the night to piece together the details of what happened.</p> <p>As Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the emergency services, police said the incident was one of several \u201cserious crime incidents\u201d in the city centre overnight, with 15 arrests being made and a total of 120 incidents recorded since 7pm on Monday.

      "bodyText": "Police have detained a suspect under the Mental Health Act as counter-terrorism officials raced to discover what led to the stabbing of three people, including a British Transport Police officer, at a Manchester railway station on New Year\u2019s Eve. Police said the suspect, a 25-year-old man who had been living in the UK for about a decade, remained in custody and was refusing to cooperate. He had been assessed by specialist medical staff, Greater Manchester police added. On Tuesday morning, armed officers raided a property in the Cheetham Hill area of the city, where the suspect, who is being held on suspicion of attempted murder, lived with his parents and four siblings. A police spokesman said: \u201cThe counter-terrorism investigation remains ongoing. There is nothing to suggest the involvement of other people in this attack, but confirming this remains a main priority for the investigation. The search of the address in Cheetham Hill continues.\u201d Neighbours had earlier been told by officers to go into their homes as they descended on the man\u2019s house, a mile north of the city centre. On Tuesday afternoon, tactical aid unit vans were stationed outside the property, with a police officer guarding the door. Neighbour Alim Obeadlugh said he was out walking near the property when he saw armed officers. He said: \u201cThey just told me to go back inside. They did not even give me a chance to ask what it is about they just said, \u2018go in.\u2019 I thought it must be a serious problem and I asked them what was going on and they said it was a terrorism incident.\u201d Nousha Babaakachel said the man\u2019s family came to live in the street about 12 years ago from the Netherlands. A man was seen leaving the property shortly after the police raid, with his face covered in a black cloth and a hat covering his head. Neighbours said the blue VW Jetta in which he drove away belonged to the brother that worked at Manchester airport. The incident, classified as critical, was being investigated by counter-terrorism police officers after the perpetrator was allegedly heard shouting Islamist slogans during the attack just before 9pm at Victoria station in the city. Footage of the aftermath of the attack showed a man being held down by five police officers, with blood stains on the pavement. Another video showed the suspect shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as he was put in the back of a police van. He was also heard screaming \u201clong live the caliphate\u201d. Russ Jackson, an assistant chief constable with Greater Manchester police (GMP), described the attack on the officer and a couple in their 50s as frenzied and random in nature. It took place near the scene of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Jackson said there was nothing to suggest others were involved and that officers were keeping an open mind and taking into consideration the attacker\u2019s mental health. On Tuesday morning forensic officers were seen scouring the station and police were examining CCTV footage. Security officials in the government, police and the intelligence services were helping the investigation. The BTP officer was stabbed in the shoulder, while the man and woman both sustained abdominal injuries, and the woman also received wounds to her forehead. Jackson said the couple, who were in the city celebrating the new year, could be in hospital for some time after sustaining \u201csignificant injuries\u201d during the attack. The officer, a sergeant in his 30s, had been discharged. During a press conference, the GMP chief constable, Ian Hopkins, said: \u201cLast night we experienced a horrific attack on people out to simply enjoy the New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations in Manchester. My thoughts are with the couple who are still being treated in hospital for their serious injuries and with the brave British Transport Police officer who was also stabbed during the attack. \u201cI know that the events last night will have affected many people and caused concern. That the incident happened so close to the scene of the terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 makes it even more dreadful.\u201d Hopkins confirmed the incident was being treated as a terrorist investigation and that officers had been working throughout the night to piece together the details of what happened. As Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the emergency services, police said the incident was one of several \u201cserious crime incidents\u201d in the city centre overnight, with 15 arrests being made and a total of 120 incidents recorded since 7pm on Monday. They said in a tweet just after 6am on Tuesday that officers had \u201cdone a great job of looking after people in the city\u201d. GMP said a large police presence would remain in place at the station but this was \u201cnot as a result of any increased threat. Please follow directions from officers on the ground and speak to them if you have any concerns.\u201d The North West ambulance service said it sent three vehicles to the incident and took all three victims to hospital for treatment. While the station was closed after the attack, the city\u2019s fireworks display in Albert Square went ahead under increased security. There have been no major terrorist attacks in the UK for the past year but MI5 and the police say they are dealing with 700 investigations into suspected terrorism. In 2017, there were five terrorist attacks \u2013 four in London and one in Manchester. The terrorism threat level for the UK remains at severe, meaning an attack is deemed to be highly likely.",

      "body": "<p>When Pita Taufatofua began the walk towards the stadium at the 2016 Rio Olympics opening ceremony, he was an unknown, unrated athlete from an obscure Pacific island. He would walk back out a global celebrity. Had it not been for a vat of coconut oil and his flair for flag bearing, he could have passed through the Olympic Games unnoticed and unreported.</p> <p>As it was he went rogue, flagrantly disobeying officials who said \u201cplease just wear the suit\u201d, hid a ta\u2019ovala (Tongan mat which is wrapped around the waist) in his backback, nipped out the back and put it on just before the show got started, covered himself in oil, and by the time he had passed the thousands of people lining the streets on the way to the stadium he was going viral. When he stepped into the lights of the stadium waving his flag, articles were already being written about the distractingly shiny Tongan flag bearer and Twitter was melting down. \u201cThe internet came to a grinding halt,\u201d reported Entertainment Tonight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ba1ad2edc5c917f5993719749219d916b8c25b55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1ad2edc5c917f5993719749219d916b8c25b55/0_0_2048_3000/683.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua leads his delegation during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pita Taufatofua leads his delegation during the Rio Olympics opening ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afterwards, when he was standing on the bus \u201cin my oil\u201d, things \u201cjust went crazy\u201d, he recalls. \u201cYou look at your phone and you can\u2019t keep up with it.\u201d</p> <p>He was, he says, completely unprepared. There was no management, no sponsors, no money, no products, just him and his coach, Paul Sitapa. \u201cIt was the first time I heard about what a manager is, what a publicist is, what an agent is. It was just me and my coach trying to manage all this. Two people who didn\u2019t know anything. No one had ever heard of Tonga. We were like, how is this even possible?\u201d</p> <p>Taufatofua says he was just trying to represent his country by wearing its traditional costume. \u201cI was representing 1,000 years of history. We didn\u2019t have suits and ties when we traversed the Pacific Ocean.\u201d</p> <p>If he is being disingenuous (his ancestors probably weren\u2019t oiled up), if he was seeking attention, he got it. He now had the eyes of the world on him for his taekwondo tournament which was right at the end of the Games. \u201cI had to try to stay focused. That was very hard. Now there was more pressure because everyone was watching. They wanted this guy out of nowhere who had this moment to win gold.\u201d </p> <p>He was knocked out in the first round \u2013 16-1 to the Iranian Sajjad Mardani \u2013 but it didn\u2019t really matter because he had already won.</p> <p>By the end of the week there would be 230 million Google searches for \u201cwhere is Tonga?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose were the stats that were given to us by Google trends,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There would be appearances on US talk shows as he became a darling of the American media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"397f47d55c3a54d187becccbbe5d7cbaddb0790f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/397f47d55c3a54d187becccbbe5d7cbaddb0790f/0_0_3543_2519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taufatofua training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there would be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/06/tongas-olympic-flag-bearer-turns-hand-to-cross-country-skiing\">run at the 2018 Korean winter Olympics in another sport \u2013 cross-country skiing</a>. He had barely even seen snow when he announced this, and it involves an even more dramatic story than the taekwondo tilt. But we will get to that.</p> <h2>\u2018Everything was going wrong\u2019</h2> <p>We meet in Suva where Taufatofua is on duty as the Unicef Pacific ambassador. He has just spent a day <a href=\"http://time.com/5436446/prince-harry-tonga-flag-bearer-pita-taufatofua/\">with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Tonga</a> and is here to appear on the reality TV show Pacific Island Food Revolution, which is being filmed at the Grand Pacific hotel. Taufatofua wishes the Unicef budget stretched to this luxurious hotel, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me</p> <footer> <cite>Pita Taufatofua</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In person, Taufatofua, 34, is very far from his shirtless beefcake image. He is polite, well-spoken, an educated man with a degree in engineering from the University of Queensland, and a Christian who worked with homeless kids for 15 years at Brisbane Youth Service. The perfect teeth are fairly shiny and the now-famous torso is encased in a blue Unicef T-shirt. But man, does he have a story to tell. He had already won simply by getting to the Olympics. There was no overnight sensation about that. It had taken 15 years and a world of pain. \u201cFrom memory, six broken bones, three torn ligaments, one-and-a-half years on crutches, three months in a wheelchair and just hundreds and hundreds of hours of physiotherapy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While he is humble, there is no mistaking the strength and self-belief that Taufatofua carries. That and the extraordinary perseverance comes, he says, from \u201cgetting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength. Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me.\u201d Tenacity comes, he says, \u201cfrom not having anything as a kid\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0abab04131fbcdcbb6698599d4b5b3cb066bc73d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0abab04131fbcdcbb6698599d4b5b3cb066bc73d/0_0_2362_3543/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Getting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother, who is Australian, was a nurse and is now a sanitation consultant in the South Pacific; his Tongan father has a PhD in agricultural science and worked in government research. He was born in Brisbane but went to school in Tonga. There were seven children and not much money; a one-bedroom house, scarce electricity and no hot water. \u201cThey had no money because they paid for us to have the best education. Between us there are eight degrees and two masters.\u201d</p> <p>In Tonga he was seen as physically smaller than anyone else. He was benched for the entire four years he played football, even though \u201cI never missed a training session. I trained every day,\u201d he says, The only time he got on to the field was to give the other footballers oranges and water. \u201cThe coaches never believed in me. In my head I was the little dog that barked and no one saw the little dog.\u201d</p> <p>When he was five his mother put him into taekwondo for \u201cself-defence, to look after myself. My whole family did it. My brother got his black belt\u201d.</p> <p>When he was 12 the streets from the airport to town were lined with people cheering Paea Wolfgramm, the first Tongan to win an Olympic medal, a silver in boxing at Atlanta in 1996.</p> <p>\u201cThat was when I thought \u2018I am going to the Olympics\u2019. And it just never left,\u201d Taufatofua recalls. \u201cI was working full-time, studying full-time, I was training full-time. It was always \u2018you will be an Olympian\u2019. It is quite an interesting thing.\u201d</p> <p>And so began the years of pain and crushing disappointment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every four years there is one shot at the Olympics with a qualifying tournament. \u201cI have to be number one in Oceania to qualify for Tonga.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008 he went to the qualifier in New Caledonia and left in a wheelchair.</p> <p>He had been up one point when he sprained an ankle and fractured a bone in his foot, but kept fighting another two rounds until it burst. He was unable to walk for six months.</p> <p>There are no elite sports institutes for Tongan athletes, no vast reserves of government funds for Olympic dreams.</p> <p>In the darkest days he would draw on the homeless kids he worked with. \u201cI saw just what true strength was. We had kids who had been abused in every way possible but were brave enough to get good outcomes. It was just a competition, I didn\u2019t have the right not to believe in myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56da2cd25d9398e94317040d3245b7f45108d499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56da2cd25d9398e94317040d3245b7f45108d499/0_0_1981_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The room he slept in for six months while training for the Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The room Taufatofua slept in for six months while training for the Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pita Taufatofua</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, getting ready for the London Olympics, he went to train with the taekwondo masters in South Korea, desperately short of funds. \u201cWe slept in a preschool for six months. We slept underneath the desk. Because it was a preschool for church they let us sleep there but in the morning we had to pack up our bags before the kids came in and then go out for the day. We had no money. It was as uncomfortable as anything.\u201d</p> <p>At the world championship in Azerbaijan, which was an Olympic qualifier, he tore a knee ligament, normally a six-month injury. Eight weeks later, not wanting to wait another four years, he made it through to Oceania Olympic qualifier, fighting on one leg. \u201cWe wrapped it as thick as we could. I changed my stance. I fought all the way through to the final. Then I fought against a guy from Samoa who had beaten me before. I was beating him and then in the last round his coach had seen that I was only using one leg and he got up on me and beat me.\u201d This time Taufatofua left New Caledonia on crutches, unable to walk for another three months, while the Samoan went to the Olympics.</p> <p>He kept competing across the Pacific, winning and losing, injury after injury. Surely people were telling him to stop punishing himself. \u201cDoctors, lots of people, told me not to go on. It is really hard to describe just how clear it was in my mind that I will become an Olympian. There was a confidence there that I didn\u2019t create, I believe it was God-given. I can\u2019t explain it other than I just knew it would happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cfd2f74c7d571afd0e76fac23b349c2f8603c9e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfd2f74c7d571afd0e76fac23b349c2f8603c9e1/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Doctors, lots of people told me not to go on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so to 2016 and Rio. \u201cEverything was going wrong. I was running out of money, my car was breaking down, my relationship was breaking down. Paul calls up and says the [qualifying] competition is in two days we have to get to Papua New Guinea. I am ready but I have no money. Paul called up a lady he knew in Tonga and she funded my first ticket ever. We got there the day before the competition.\u201d</p> <p>Up against a New Zealander who had consistently beaten him, the score was three all at the end of three rounds and went into golden points; the first to get a point wins and becomes an Olympian. And he kicked at exactly the right time. \u201cThat was my moment. It was the most emotional time. Rio, oil, that wasn\u2019t my moment \u2013 that was the reward for all the work.\u201d</p> <p>Four months before the Olympics he was broke. He and Paul did fundraisers and rented a house in Brisbane.

      "bodyText": "When Pita Taufatofua began the walk towards the stadium at the 2016 Rio Olympics opening ceremony, he was an unknown, unrated athlete from an obscure Pacific island. He would walk back out a global celebrity. Had it not been for a vat of coconut oil and his flair for flag bearing, he could have passed through the Olympic Games unnoticed and unreported. As it was he went rogue, flagrantly disobeying officials who said \u201cplease just wear the suit\u201d, hid a ta\u2019ovala (Tongan mat which is wrapped around the waist) in his backback, nipped out the back and put it on just before the show got started, covered himself in oil, and by the time he had passed the thousands of people lining the streets on the way to the stadium he was going viral. When he stepped into the lights of the stadium waving his flag, articles were already being written about the distractingly shiny Tongan flag bearer and Twitter was melting down. \u201cThe internet came to a grinding halt,\u201d reported Entertainment Tonight. Afterwards, when he was standing on the bus \u201cin my oil\u201d, things \u201cjust went crazy\u201d, he recalls. \u201cYou look at your phone and you can\u2019t keep up with it.\u201d He was, he says, completely unprepared. There was no management, no sponsors, no money, no products, just him and his coach, Paul Sitapa. \u201cIt was the first time I heard about what a manager is, what a publicist is, what an agent is. It was just me and my coach trying to manage all this. Two people who didn\u2019t know anything. No one had ever heard of Tonga. We were like, how is this even possible?\u201d Taufatofua says he was just trying to represent his country by wearing its traditional costume. \u201cI was representing 1,000 years of history. We didn\u2019t have suits and ties when we traversed the Pacific Ocean.\u201d If he is being disingenuous (his ancestors probably weren\u2019t oiled up), if he was seeking attention, he got it. He now had the eyes of the world on him for his taekwondo tournament which was right at the end of the Games. \u201cI had to try to stay focused. That was very hard. Now there was more pressure because everyone was watching. They wanted this guy out of nowhere who had this moment to win gold.\u201d He was knocked out in the first round \u2013 16-1 to the Iranian Sajjad Mardani \u2013 but it didn\u2019t really matter because he had already won. By the end of the week there would be 230 million Google searches for \u201cwhere is Tonga?\u201d \u201cThose were the stats that were given to us by Google trends,\u201d he says. There would be appearances on US talk shows as he became a darling of the American media. And there would be a run at the 2018 Korean winter Olympics in another sport \u2013 cross-country skiing. He had barely even seen snow when he announced this, and it involves an even more dramatic story than the taekwondo tilt. But we will get to that. \u2018Everything was going wrong\u2019 We meet in Suva where Taufatofua is on duty as the Unicef Pacific ambassador. He has just spent a day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Tonga and is here to appear on the reality TV show Pacific Island Food Revolution, which is being filmed at the Grand Pacific hotel. Taufatofua wishes the Unicef budget stretched to this luxurious hotel, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t. In person, Taufatofua, 34, is very far from his shirtless beefcake image. He is polite, well-spoken, an educated man with a degree in engineering from the University of Queensland, and a Christian who worked with homeless kids for 15 years at Brisbane Youth Service. The perfect teeth are fairly shiny and the now-famous torso is encased in a blue Unicef T-shirt. But man, does he have a story to tell. He had already won simply by getting to the Olympics. There was no overnight sensation about that. It had taken 15 years and a world of pain. \u201cFrom memory, six broken bones, three torn ligaments, one-and-a-half years on crutches, three months in a wheelchair and just hundreds and hundreds of hours of physiotherapy,\u201d he says. While he is humble, there is no mistaking the strength and self-belief that Taufatofua carries. That and the extraordinary perseverance comes, he says, from \u201cgetting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength. Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me.\u201d Tenacity comes, he says, \u201cfrom not having anything as a kid\u201d. His mother, who is Australian, was a nurse and is now a sanitation consultant in the South Pacific; his Tongan father has a PhD in agricultural science and worked in government research. He was born in Brisbane but went to school in Tonga. There were seven children and not much money; a one-bedroom house, scarce electricity and no hot water. \u201cThey had no money because they paid for us to have the best education. Between us there are eight degrees and two masters.\u201d In Tonga he was seen as physically smaller than anyone else. He was benched for the entire four years he played football, even though \u201cI never missed a training session. I trained every day,\u201d he says, The only time he got on to the field was to give the other footballers oranges and water. \u201cThe coaches never believed in me. In my head I was the little dog that barked and no one saw the little dog.\u201d When he was five his mother put him into taekwondo for \u201cself-defence, to look after myself. My whole family did it. My brother got his black belt\u201d. When he was 12 the streets from the airport to town were lined with people cheering Paea Wolfgramm, the first Tongan to win an Olympic medal, a silver in boxing at Atlanta in 1996. \u201cThat was when I thought \u2018I am going to the Olympics\u2019. And it just never left,\u201d Taufatofua recalls. \u201cI was working full-time, studying full-time, I was training full-time. It was always \u2018you will be an Olympian\u2019. It is quite an interesting thing.\u201d And so began the years of pain and crushing disappointment. Every four years there is one shot at the Olympics with a qualifying tournament. \u201cI have to be number one in Oceania to qualify for Tonga.\u201d In 2008 he went to the qualifier in New Caledonia and left in a wheelchair. He had been up one point when he sprained an ankle and fractured a bone in his foot, but kept fighting another two rounds until it burst. He was unable to walk for six months. There are no elite sports institutes for Tongan athletes, no vast reserves of government funds for Olympic dreams. In the darkest days he would draw on the homeless kids he worked with. \u201cI saw just what true strength was. We had kids who had been abused in every way possible but were brave enough to get good outcomes. It was just a competition, I didn\u2019t have the right not to believe in myself.\u201d In 2011, getting ready for the London Olympics, he went to train with the taekwondo masters in South Korea, desperately short of funds. \u201cWe slept in a preschool for six months. We slept underneath the desk. Because it was a preschool for church they let us sleep there but in the morning we had to pack up our bags before the kids came in and then go out for the day. We had no money. It was as uncomfortable as anything.\u201d At the world championship in Azerbaijan, which was an Olympic qualifier, he tore a knee ligament, normally a six-month injury. Eight weeks later, not wanting to wait another four years, he made it through to Oceania Olympic qualifier, fighting on one leg. \u201cWe wrapped it as thick as we could. I changed my stance. I fought all the way through to the final. Then I fought against a guy from Samoa who had beaten me before. I was beating him and then in the last round his coach had seen that I was only using one leg and he got up on me and beat me.\u201d This time Taufatofua left New Caledonia on crutches, unable to walk for another three months, while the Samoan went to the Olympics. He kept competing across the Pacific, winning and losing, injury after injury. Surely people were telling him to stop punishing himself. \u201cDoctors, lots of people, told me not to go on. It is really hard to describe just how clear it was in my mind that I will become an Olympian. There was a confidence there that I didn\u2019t create, I believe it was God-given. I can\u2019t explain it other than I just knew it would happen.\u201d And so to 2016 and Rio. \u201cEverything was going wrong. I was running out of money, my car was breaking down, my relationship was breaking down. Paul calls up and says the [qualifying] competition is in two days we have to get to Papua New Guinea. I am ready but I have no money. Paul called up a lady he knew in Tonga and she funded my first ticket ever. We got there the day before the competition.\u201d Up against a New Zealander who had consistently beaten him, the score was three all at the end of three rounds and went into golden points; the first to get a point wins and becomes an Olympian. And he kicked at exactly the right time. \u201cThat was my moment. It was the most emotional time. Rio, oil, that wasn\u2019t my moment \u2013 that was the reward for all the work.\u201d Four months before the Olympics he was broke. He and Paul did fundraisers and rented a house in Brisbane. They trained in the garage to save money, yelling a lot. \u201cI had my coach, we had prayer, I was happy, I had qualified, I was going,\u201d he says. \u2018I chose to learn from the failure\u2019 Perhaps it was all the attention, perhaps that kind of energy is addictive, but a few months after Rio he announced that he would attempt the Winter Olympics at Pyeongchang as a cross-country skier. As a person who had spent his entire life in the tropics, this seemed hilariously bonkers, up there with the Jamaican bobsledders. \u201cI chose it because it made no sense,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI love these challenges.\u201d He watched YouTube videos of professional races and at 5am every morning he would put on rollerskis and train in the park. \u201cThe amount of concrete I ate. But I had one year to qualify,\u201d he says. But then he had to qualify on actual snow. And it got real \u2013 on rented skis. \u201cWe had to get to all these countries to try and get the races. I think it was 15 countries in eight weeks. The problem was we had to go to races which were not the hardest races where the world cup winners would be, it would be too hard. At this stage every single athlete from every country was getting ready for the Olympics. I came last in four out of nine races.\u201d He would run up $40,000 in credit card debt. By then he had buddied up with Chilean Yonathan Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez and Mexican German Madrazo, whose prospects were as farcically bad as his were. None of the ski companies wanted Taufatofua to be seen on their skis. \u201cI was asking for a good price and they looked at me and said \u2018I suggest you wear other skis\u2019. That happened through the whole qualification process, to me and my friends from South America.\u201d In Poland a ski fell off and went flying down a hill and into trees. \u201cI had to go down a hill I had already climbed up, spend 20 minutes looking for it, fix and tape it back on. They were shutting off the lights when I came in,\u201d he recalls. He wasn\u2019t even close to a qualifying time and he was running out of races. \u201cI get across to Armenia. I thought it would be the last race. Two or three thousand metres up. Normally you go there two weeks before to acclimatise. We got there the day before. I got destroyed in the race again. I was devastated. There wasn\u2019t any more time left to qualify.\u201d They found out there was a race in Croatia the next day. But it would be almost impossible to get there in time. \u201cWe looked at every country around Armenia to get a flight. Every country around Croatia. I then end up in an eight-hour taxi ride through Armenia, through the Georgia border, with no sleep. I called the race officials and said I was coming in late. They said they could put me in at the end of the race and then I would start last. I fly across to Istanbul to get a flight to Croatia, and missed the gate by five minutes. I am there pressing all the buttons in the airport, maybe I was a bit crazy by that time. And it didn\u2019t work. I am stuck in Turkey with no money and no flight out of there. I have missed the race in Croatia.\u201d His brother, who is a lawyer, used his points to get him on a flight to London, where he lives. With four days left in the Olympic qualification period, they found out there was one more race \u2013 in Iceland on a fjord in the Arctic Circle. The three amigos bought one-way tickets to Reykjavik, Fern\u00e1ndez and Madrozo flying from Armenia and Taufatofua going courtesy of his brother\u2019s air miles. \u201cWe land, snowstorm. There is no flight from Reykjavik to Eskifj\u00f6r\u00f0ur fjord. So we rented a car. Normally a 10-hour drive. But because of the snowstorm it took us three days,\u201d he says.

He came in just under 23 minutes behind the gold medal winner Dario Cologna from Switzerland and waited at the finish line for his friends. Today there is something slightly messianic about Pita Taufatofua. \u201cI always chose to learn from the pain and the failure,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt is not special to me, it is something that is transferable to anyone if they have the right mindset. The alternative is to sit down and do nothing with your life and to always feel that there is something else that you should be doing. Everyone has potential.

He has written a motivation book, The Motivation Station, and another one on depression. \u201cI have my faith and I believe my purpose is bigger than myself.

      "bodyText": "Labour members are significantly more opposed to Brexit than Jeremy Corbyn is, with 72% of them thinking their leader should fully support a second referendum, according to a study of attitudes in the party. The polling, part of an ongoing wider academic study into attitudes in various parties, found that only 18% opposed Labour campaigning for a second referendum, while 88% would then opt for remain if such a vote was held. Official Labour policy is that a second referendum could potentially be considered if there is not a general election. However, Corbyn is publicly lukewarm on the idea, and prompted dismay among some party activists last month by saying he expected Brexit to happen even if Labour won a snap election. Corbyn is facing intense pressure from some in the party to change course, with one pro-remain party group pushing for a motion that Labour would guarantee a referendum if there was a general election. The study, part of the Party Members Project led by Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, found that while Labour members still strongly supported their leader overall, they appear both distanced from his views on Brexit and, for some, sceptical about his motives on the subject. The polling of 1,034 party members shortly before Christmas found that almost two-thirds believed Corbyn was doing very well or fairly well as leader, and 58% believe he could get a better Brexit deal than Theresa May as prime minister. But asked why they felt Corbyn had not campaigned for a second referendum, 23% of those asked said it was because the Labour leader backed leaving the EU. Another 34% put the decision down to not wanting to alienate Labour voters. If a new referendum was held, 88% of members would back remain, both in a two-way vote against either May\u2019s plan or no deal, or in a three-way poll between all of them. The findings \u201cincrease the pressure on Labour\u2019s leader to get off the fence\u201d, Bale said. \u201cIf Jeremy Corbyn genuinely believes, as he has repeatedly claimed, that the Labour party\u2019s policy should reflect the wishes of its members rather than just its leaders, then he arguably has a funny way of showing it \u2013 at least when it comes to Brexit,\u201d he said. There was, he noted, some difference between the views of Labour voters and members. While a parallel poll of 1,675 voters found 73% of the party\u2019s supporters believed the Brexit decision was a mistake, for members that rises to 89%. On the impact of a no-deal departure, 89% of members said this would harm the economy in the medium to long term, against 65% of current Labour voters and 45% of all voters. Of the near-third of members who said they oppose Labour\u2019s current Brexit policy, 56% said the issue could make them quit the party \u2013 a potential loss of 88,000 people. Bale said Corbyn \u201cdoes need to think carefully about whether his ambiguity on the issue is quite as cunningly clever as many commentators seem to believe\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is because, if Corbyn carries on like this, then Labour risks losing some of the members on whom it\u2019s relying to give it the activist edge over the Conservatives at the next general election.\u201d A Labour spokesman said: \u201cAs unanimously agreed at Labour party conference, if Theresa May\u2019s botched Brexit deal is voted down in parliament then a general election should be called.
