As a lifelong member of the Labour party I had a sense of shame on both occasions. The fact that a Labour government took us into the Iraq war will for ever be a stain on the history of the party. When it comes to Brexit, the failure of the current leadership to realise that it should be at the forefront of the campaign for an open and inclusive Britain is equally distressing.

The prime minister\u2019s few remaining allies were engaged on Saturday night in a desperate battle to shore up her position, warning MPs that forcing May out would \u201ctip the country into a general election and tear the party apart\u201d. Downing Street is also warning hardline Tories that parliament is so against a no-deal Brexit the government would be brought down before it could implement such an outcome. However, Tory MPs were this weekend examining ways of ousting May, and cabinet ministers on both sides of the Brexit debate made clear they were ready to quit if necessary. Tory insiders described the party\u2019s atmosphere as \u201cend of days\u201d. May was in her Chequers retreat on Sunday, talking tactics to colleagues. On Saturday night the Conservative MP George Freeman, a former policy adviser to May, said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s all over for the PM. She\u2019s done her best. But across the country you can see the anger.\u201d May faces resignations from both wings of her cabinet should her Brexit deal be voted down this week, as expected.
