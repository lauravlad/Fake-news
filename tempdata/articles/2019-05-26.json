Now that fragmentation has hit the European parliament. Much of the focus in the 2019 European elections has been on the rise of the far-right populists, bent on exploding the parliament\u2019s decades-long centre-right/centre-left consensus and rolling back the EU\u2019s remit in an attempt to return power to member states. Matteo Salvini, of Italy\u2019s League, is trying to forge an alliance of nationalist parties, such as Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally in France, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), Austria\u2019s Freedom party, the Danish People\u2019s party (DPP) and Finland\u2019s True Finns party, to do just that. The Italian deputy prime minister\u2019s putative putsch expands one existing group of rightwing Eurosceptics by poaching members from the other two. Add in conservative nationalists and far-left forces, and the \u201cless EU\u201d camp looks \u2013 according to provisional results \u2013 like it has perhaps a third of the parliament\u2019s 751 seats. This has led to reports of a Eurosceptic tidal wave sweeping the European parliament. But it is not the equivalent of Donald Trump storming the White House or Brexit blowing up British politics. Pro-EU forces still hold a comfortable majority. The work of the parliament, which has acquired significant extra powers in recent years and now plays a major part in the EU legislative process, will undoubtedly become more complicated, but that isn\u2019t just down to the populists\u2019 advance. Ever since the first European elections in 1979, the parliament has been run by the two main centre-right and centre-left groups, reflecting the fact that the vast majority of EU citizens lived in countries governed by parties belonging to one of them. But with the steady decline of centrist parties across Europe, that is now the case for fewer than 40% of the EU\u2019s voters. Major member states, such as Italy, Greece, Poland and France, are all ruled by parties that belong to neither the European People\u2019s party (EPP) nor the Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D).

      "body": "<p>Sadly the Guardian, along with other newspapers, has demonstrated in John Crace\u2019s article that it does not understand the gender issues that so damage our society (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/theresa-may-end-resignation-speech-politics-sketch-maybot\" title=\"\">The day the Maybot cracked</a>, 25 May). No male prime minister would be nicknamed a robot for being single-minded and resilient. They would just be admired. But a woman who does not cry? She is a threat to the grey suits. \u201cShe should have cried more,\u201d they shouted.</p> <p>When at last she resigned and was emotional for a moment \u2013 every newspaper took the opportunity to find a picture of those tiny tearful seconds to slam on their front pages. At last she could be labelled as a weak and emotional woman. The grey-suited Tories win in the end and many others seem to enjoy the spectacle.<br><strong>Allan Watson</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Theresa May could still leave a pivotal and positive legacy. I believe it is still in her power to revoke article 50; to announce that the world has changed since 2016, and that as the WTO has been made toothless by Trump et al, and European economies are under attack from China and the US, it is now in the UK\u2019s national interest to collaborate inside the EU as the alternatives have become untenable. <br><strong>Kimon Roussopoulos</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 While correspondents are right to call for the future of the country to be decided by democracy rather than the 0.2% who are Tory party members, and to call for returning power to the people (eg Stuart Noyes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/what-to-make-of-theresa-may-and-her-possible-successor\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 25 May), let\u2019s also remember that the Westminster establishment has spent the last three years obstructing the decision of 17.4 million voters in the biggest vote in Britain\u2019s democratic history.<br><strong>Christopher Clayton</strong><br><em>Waverton, </em><em>Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I never vote Conservative and would not normally leap to the defence of a Tory prime minister. But I am appalled at the spectacle of those MPs most responsible for May\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to deliver Brexit deposing her and blaming her for what is the consequence of their own intransigence.</p> <p>At least her diligently negotiated deal had the merit of being a compromise and was driven by a genuine sense of public duty and the national interest. So much for pious claims about democracy when her party cynically schemes to change their own rules in order to banish her. I am sickened at the unseemly rush with which, long before May had announced her resignation, numerous careerists were busy setting out theirs stalls in gleeful anticipation of her fall. <br><strong>Peter Bell</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Martha Gill (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/24/next-tory-leader-panel-theresa-may-conservatives\" title=\"\">Who should be the next Tory leader?</a> theguardian.com, 25 May) picks Rory Stewart as her choice. Many of us beyond Tory ranks and therefore voteless, like myself, will agree. But I differ from her reason, choosing him because he is \u201cclever\u201d. Yes, he is that, but more; he has shown a kind of character and courage, a bit Churchillian, in fields other than politics. If in doubt, read his account of a solo midwinter walk from west to east through the centre of Afghanistan in The Places in Between.</p> <p>We will need that kind of integrity, which Mrs May also showed, and a dash of imagination, to hold things together in the time ahead.</p> <p>I can\u2019t imagine any of the others causing me to switch from a Lib Dem identity, but he could.<br><strong>John Ray</strong><br><em>Hook, </em><em>East Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In Dominic Raab\u2019s announcement of his leadership bid he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want a WTO Brexit.\u201d That can only be because he believes it would leave the UK in a worse position with regard to international trade than now. But he says he is nevertheless prepared to go down that route. So there you have it: a candidate to be prime minister who in his own words is willing to lead his country into a decline of international trade.<br><strong>Michael Green</strong><br><em>Winnersh, </em><em>Berkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Amid the extensive coverage of the views about Brexit expressed by the actual and potential candidates for the Tory leadership, I can find no evidence of them being called to account on the overwhelmingly most important issue facing this and other countries today.</p> <p>When are the candidates going to be examined on their policies for addressing climate change? If the Guardian does not initiate this, who is going to?<br><strong>Jenny Clemens</strong><br><em>Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 The last four Tory prime ministers have all been destroyed by Europe: Thatcher (Geoffrey Howe); Major (Maastricht); Cameron (EU referendum) and May (Brexit). What are the odds on May\u2019s successor being the fifth?<br><strong>Derrick Cameron</strong><br><em>Stoke-on-Trent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Many of your correspondents (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/what-to-make-of-theresa-may-and-her-possible-successor\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 25 May) assume that the next Tory leader will automatically become prime minister, whereas such a person will have to demonstrate that s/he has the support of the Commons.</p> <p>It is most unlikely that a hardline Brexiteer would be able to command such support, prompting either an immediate general election or an invitation from the monarch to Jeremy Corbyn to try to form a government. What chance Johnson then?<br><strong>Roy Boffy </strong><br><em>Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands</em></p> <p>\u2022 If Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister, our sole consolation will be Marina Hyde\u2019s ensuing column.<br><strong>Helen Hughes</strong><br><em>Rutherglen, </em><em>South Lanarkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I likewise object to Mr Johnson being called just Boris (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/24/what-to-make-of-theresa-may-and-her-possible-successor\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 25 May).

Kimon Roussopoulos Cambridge \u2022 While correspondents are right to call for the future of the country to be decided by democracy rather than the 0.2% who are Tory party members, and to call for returning power to the people (eg Stuart Noyes, Letters, 25 May), let\u2019s also remember that the Westminster establishment has spent the last three years obstructing the decision of 17.4 million voters in the biggest vote in Britain\u2019s democratic history. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire \u2022 I never vote Conservative and would not normally leap to the defence of a Tory prime minister. But I am appalled at the spectacle of those MPs most responsible for May\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to deliver Brexit deposing her and blaming her for what is the consequence of their own intransigence. At least her diligently negotiated deal had the merit of being a compromise and was driven by a genuine sense of public duty and the national interest. So much for pious claims about democracy when her party cynically schemes to change their own rules in order to banish her. I am sickened at the unseemly rush with which, long before May had announced her resignation, numerous careerists were busy setting out theirs stalls in gleeful anticipation of her fall. Peter Bell York \u2022 Martha Gill (Who should be the next Tory leader? theguardian.com, 25 May) picks Rory Stewart as her choice. Many of us beyond Tory ranks and therefore voteless, like myself, will agree. But I differ from her reason, choosing him because he is \u201cclever\u201d. Yes, he is that, but more; he has shown a kind of character and courage, a bit Churchillian, in fields other than politics. If in doubt, read his account of a solo midwinter walk from west to east through the centre of Afghanistan in The Places in Between. We will need that kind of integrity, which Mrs May also showed, and a dash of imagination, to hold things together in the time ahead. I can\u2019t imagine any of the others causing me to switch from a Lib Dem identity, but he could. John Ray Hook, East Yorkshire \u2022 In Dominic Raab\u2019s announcement of his leadership bid he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want a WTO Brexit.\u201d That can only be because he believes it would leave the UK in a worse position with regard to international trade than now. But he says he is nevertheless prepared to go down that route. So there you have it: a candidate to be prime minister who in his own words is willing to lead his country into a decline of international trade. Michael Green Winnersh, Berkshire \u2022 Amid the extensive coverage of the views about Brexit expressed by the actual and potential candidates for the Tory leadership, I can find no evidence of them being called to account on the overwhelmingly most important issue facing this and other countries today. When are the candidates going to be examined on their policies for addressing climate change? If the Guardian does not initiate this, who is going to? Jenny Clemens Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex \u2022 The last four Tory prime ministers have all been destroyed by Europe: Thatcher (Geoffrey Howe); Major (Maastricht); Cameron (EU referendum) and May (Brexit). What are the odds on May\u2019s successor being the fifth? Derrick Cameron Stoke-on-Trent \u2022 Many of your correspondents (Letters, 25 May) assume that the next Tory leader will automatically become prime minister, whereas such a person will have to demonstrate that s/he has the support of the Commons. It is most unlikely that a hardline Brexiteer would be able to command such support, prompting either an immediate general election or an invitation from the monarch to Jeremy Corbyn to try to form a government. What chance Johnson then? Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands \u2022 If Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister, our sole consolation will be Marina Hyde\u2019s ensuing column. Helen Hughes Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire \u2022 I likewise object to Mr Johnson being called just Boris (Letters, 25 May). And anyway his real first name is Alexander. So perhaps the Guardian should call him \u201cBoris, also known as Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson\u201d. Clare Addison Marston, Oxfordshire \u2022 As Nigel Farage seems to have been in control of the Conservative party for some years now and can be said to have determined policies on both the EU and immigration, perhaps he should put his name forward for the leadership contest. He already knows he can rely on the support of the party faithful. Mandy Jackson Maastricht, Netherlands \u2022 Saturday\u2019s front page had a photo of Theresa May in tears with the caption \u201cBroken by Brexit\u201d. Aren\u2019t we all?

We need to be absolutely resolute in a way that weren\u2019t last time.</p> \n   <p>One of the reasons [that the EU says they won\u2019t budge on the withdrawal agreement] is that we were not resolute enough and we took no-deal off the table. I don\u2019t want a WTO Brexit but unless you are willing to keep our promises as politicians we put ourselves in a much weaker position in terms of getting a deal, because if you are not willing to walk away from the negotiation it doesn\u2019t focus the mind of the other side. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Raab called for a united cabinet:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My experience was of being undermined by some others in government so we would need to have a very well organised number 10 operation and a united cabinet. </p> \n   <p>I resigned on principle because I tried very hard to fight for the deal that I\u2019m still fighting for now. And when my advice wasn\u2019t taken by the prime minister or indeed by the cabinet. I did the honourable thing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>On voting for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal bill on the third time of asking, Raab said:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I voted to avoid the European elections and any further extension. I only voted only to avoid an extension which was bad idea and I think I have been proved right about that. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Raab ruled out an extension to article 50:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no case for a further extension. We have got to bring some finality to this. I will not asks for an extension. Of course if parliament legislates then we would be in a difficult position, but as the Institute for Government points out it would be very difficult for parliament to legislate against no deal or in favour an extension unless resolute prime minister is willing to acquiesce in that. And I would not. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Raab did not rule out working with </strong><strong>Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cI always listen to all sides of this debate, from Nigel Farage to others.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if as leader he would enter an electoral pledge with Farage he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I would be aiming for. My aim is not to cosy up with other parties, my aim is to keep Conservative promises, present an optimistic, aspirational vision of the future, then go and beat Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Raab insisted his proposed tax cuts could be paid for:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019ve talked about raising the National Insurance threshold and I\u2019ve talked about taking a penny off the basic rate of income tax. Overtime my ambition would be to get the basic rate down from 20p to 15p. </p> \n   <p>Taking penny off and [raising] the National Insurance threshold would come to around \u00a315bn. We have got \u00a326bn worth of headroom within our deficit target. I would cut down the number of Whitehall departments, cut out the bureaucracy. I would have a special commission looking at public sector procurement particularly in the NHS and the MoD. And then I would recycle roughly half of that into front line services and half into the tax cuts.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cea65a38f0807b455f887ac\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-26T10:13:18.337Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hammond warns against no-deal Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Chancellor Philip Hammond has refused to rule out backing a no confidence vote in the government if the new leader went for a no-deal Brexit. </p> \n  <p>Speaking to the Marr programme he said he had never voted against the Conservative whip, and did not want to start now.</p> \n  <p>But he added: \u201cA prime minister has to command the confidence of the House of Commons.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today. Attention now switches to the European parliamentary elections. You can follow the latest on the Tory leadership race here. The Independent\u2019s commentator John Rentoul points out that at least 118 Tory MPs, or 37% of the parliamentary party, have already declared their voting intentions, according to lists compiled by Guido Fawkes and Conservative Home. If the contest finished now Johnson would not make the final two candidates to be put to the wider membership. But it\u2019s early days and this Matt cartoon reminds us that Tory MPs are not a reliable bunch when it comes to leadership voting intentions. One more for Boris Johnson? The Conservative MP, Sheryll Murray, says Johnson will make an excellent PM, but will she be voting for him? The recriminations in the Labour party about the European election campaign are getting increasingly bitter even before the results are known. According to ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston, Labour MEP, John Howarth, said: \u201cHad Labour\u2019s \u2018high command\u2019 set out to lose an election they could not have gone about it in a more convincing way\u201d. Even before the results of the European elections are in Even before the results of the European elections are in Jeremy Hunt is winning the race for the number of MPs willing to express backing for a single candidate, according to Conservative Home. It reckons 27 Tory MPs have come out in favour of the foreign secretary, with his predecessor Boris Johnson second on 20 MPs. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is hot on Johnson\u2019s heals with the backing of 19 MPs. Raab is currently in fourth on 17 and Javid fifth with 10 MPs. No MPs have yet publicly backed Stewart, according to Conservative Home. An earlier tally by the Guido Fawkes site had Gove and Raab neck and neck on 18 each, with Johnson third on 15. The bookies Betway say the odds on favourite Johnson have lengthened slightly from evens to 13-8. Betway\u2019s Alan Alger said: \u201cThe Tory leadership race is taking shape, albeit with no fewer than eight candidates so far, and Michael Gove is the latest to throw his hat into the ring. \u201cGove, previously at double-figure odds up until Sunday morning, is now a clear third in the betting at 5-1, behind Dominic Raab, 11-4, and 13-8 favourite Boris Johnson. Johnson has been eased out from evens in the wake of reports that he could attempt to push through a no deal Brexit.\u201d The odds on Stewart have shortened from 14-1 to 11-1 despite the lack of MPs willing to express backing for the international development secretary. Rory Stewart is keeping up the attacks on the hard-Brexiters over no deal. The Independent focuses on the battle between the hard-Brexit front runners Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson. It counted that in his Marr interview, Raab said three times that he was \u201cdetails-oriented man\u201d and stressed his background as a lawyer. As the Indy notes this was \u201cless-than subtle jab at his rival Boris Johnson\u201d. Here\u2019s how things currently stand: Philip Hammond has warned Conservative leadership candidates they will not be prime minister for long if they pursue a no-deal Brexit, hinting that he and other Tories could be prepared to vote down the government in a confidence motion to prevent that outcome. The chancellor reminded the hardline Brexit candidates \u2013 Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey \u2013 that parliament was \u201cvehemently opposed\u201d to leaving the EU without a deal. Environment secretary, Michael Gove, has confirmed he has entered the Tory leadership race and has pitched himself as a \u201cunity candidate\u201d. Gove is the eighth candidate to enter the race for the Tory leadership after Johnson, Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart. Andrea Leadsom has confirmed her candidacy and like Johnson, Raab and McVey said she is prepared to leave the EU without a deal. \u201cIn order to succeed in a negotiation you have to be prepared to leave without a deal, but I have a three point plan for Brexit,\u201d she said. Former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has set out his case to become leader claiming he would be prepared to leave without a deal and would not seek an extension to article 50. He told the BBC: \u201cI would fight for a fairer deal in Brussels with negotiation to change the backstop arrangements and if not, I would be clear we would leave on WTO terms in October.\u201d Former work and pension secretary, Esther McVey, has also said that if elected she would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. \u201cOctober 31 is the key date and we are coming out then, and if that means without a deal then that\u2019s what it means,\u201d she told Sky News. International development secretary, Rory Stewart, has not ruled out voting down a government that pursues a no-deal Brexit. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t understand how Boris, or anybody, thinks they are going to get a no deal through parliament. There simply aren\u2019t the votes for that. I certainly would vote against a no-deal in Parliament.\u201d He also pitched himself as the candidate for the \u201cradical centre ground\u201d. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell says Labour expects a \u201cgood kicking\u201d in the European Parliament election result tonight. Asked about a call by deputy leader Tom Watson for Labour to back a second referendum, McDonnell said Labour had been right to \u201ctread a really difficult road\u201d of trying to bring Leave and Remain supporters back together. Change UK leader, Heidi Allen, said her party could merge with the Liberal Democrats. She conceded that this a \u201cstep further\u201d than the position taken by Change UK\u2019s spokesman Chuka Umunna. Len McCluskey, the leader of the powerful Unite union, appears to be in no mood to accept Tom Watson\u2019s argument about the need for Labour to back a second referendum. Michael Gove is due to be set out his case to become Tory leader in an interview at 7pm for Nick Robinson\u2019s podcast Political Thinking. In the meantime here are the remarks he made to PA outside his home. And here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s story on Gove\u2019s bid. Stewart has added this cryptic tweet to his 5 Live interview: Presumably he means swallowing a compromise on Brexit now, however divisive, rather than falling for the unrealistic promising of his opponents. The international development secretary, Rory Stewart, has joined Hammond and Greening, in not ruling out voting no confidence in a government that pursues a no-deal Brexit. On Saturday Stewart, said he could not serve under Boris Johnson, after the former foreign secretary said he would take the UK out of the EU in October with or without a deal. On Sunday Stewart was asked on Radio 5 Live whether he would back a no confidence motion to avoid no deal. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t understand what that scenario would be. I can\u2019t understand how Boris, or anybody, thinks they are going to get a no deal through parliament. There simply aren\u2019t the votes for that. I certainly would vote against a no-deal in Parliament.\u201d Stewart added: \u201cI want to say to Boris: \u2018let\u2019s be practical, let\u2019s be realistic, let\u2019s be truthful.\u2019 That slogan of no-deal is closing opportunities not opening them.\u201d Asked if Johnson had lied to him about opposing a no-deal Brexit, Stewart said: \u201cBoris is an incredibly charming person, but it is sometimes quite difficult to be certain what\u2019s going on. I called him out and said I was against him because he seemed to advocating for something that I thought would damage us. And he called me and said \u2018no, no, no I\u2019m not doing that\u2019, and it seems I think he is doing that.\u201d He added: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a majority in parliament for a no-deal Brexit. And what parliament would do in that situation is request an extension from the EU. But it doesn\u2019t need to that, we can get Brexit done a long time before that if we can begin to explain to the public, to the Tory party members, that no-deal isn\u2019t going to happen, that no-deal is a route to a general election.\u201d Stewart said the key to securing a deal that all sides of the Commons would accept was negotiation and communication. He said: \u201cI\u2019m talking about holding the vast majority of my party, and reaching out to moderate Labour MPs [and] talking to the trade unions. We are about a quarter of an inch apart within the House of Commons of getting a deal that people can sign up to and get Brexit done. I believe that if you were to elect me as prime minister I would be able to deliver that deal by October and the way I would do it is by communicating.\u201d Stewart also pitched his case for centre ground Conservatism. I would like to create an entire new department, secretary of state for the union, whose job would be to take the European structural funds and use them to regenerate the United Kingdom. All of us [candidates] our playing for 150/200 MPs who have not yet declared for anyone. What I think they want to hear is that they have a candidate who can reunite the United Kingdom, reunite young people with old people, by talking about issues that matter to people: health, education, climate and the environment. And basically make us into the radical party of the centre ground, not try to out Farage Farage, or compete with Corbyn. Here\u2019s video of Raab\u2019s pitch for the Tory leadership on Marr show. Change UK leader, Heidi Allen, said her party could form a single centrist party with the Liberal Democrats, PA reports. On Saturday Change UK MP and spokesman Chuka Umunna said it should form a pact not to stand against LibDems in the next general election. Allen, who left the Conservatives to join other breakaway Tory and Labour MPs, said she would go \u201cone step further\u201d than her party spokesman. \u201cI would like us to be in the same vehicle,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live. Asked if she meant the same party, Allen replied: \u201cYeah, probably, I don\u2019t know. This partisan thing completely passes me by and when I look across Europe, they seem to do pretty well with coalitions. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the format will be, but will we be singing from the same hymn sheet? I would hope as a collective, let\u2019s call us a collective, somewhere in the middle with other like-minded colleagues. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s sensible to be too prescriptive at the moment.\u201d Allen said to be a \u201creal insurgent force\u201d, the alliance needs to be \u201cbrand new\u201d rather than a larger Liberal Democrat Party. Last week, she admitted she had threatened to quit in an internal row over tactical voting to maximise the pro-Remain challenge to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. But on Sunday she indicated all MPs within the party are moving towards a closer relationship with the Liberal Democrats. \u201cI think we are sensible enough to know we can\u2019t do it on our own,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we at different stages on the continuum? Of course we are, because everybody\u2019s different. \u201cBut do we all agree that the long goal is something centrist together? Then, yes, we are all on that same path.\u201d Allen said she thinks more Tory MPs could desert the party if Boris Johnson becomes prime minster, while Labour MPs may also defect if Jeremy Corbyn continues to refuse to commit to a second referendum. Andrea Leadsom has confirmed she\u2019ll be standing too and like Raab, Johnson and McVey, is prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Speaking to Sky News, Leadsom who resigned as leader of the Commons on Wednesday, said: \u201cI can confirm I will be standing for the leadership of my party and as the next prime minister. I do believe I am the decisive and compassionate leader who can reunite our great country.\u201d \u201cIn order to succeed in a negotiation you have to be prepared to leave without a deal, but I have a three point plan for Brexit, for how we get out of the European Union. I\u2019m very optimistic about it. My role as leader of the Commons means that I have had a very good insight into what needs to be done and I look forward to setting that out once the campaign starts.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: Philip Hammond has warned Conservative leadership candidates they will not be prime minister for long if they pursue a no-deal Brexit, hinting that he and other Tories could be prepared to vote down the government in a confidence motion to prevent that outcome. The chancellor reminded the hardline Brexit candidates \u2013 Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey \u2013 that parliament was \u201cvehemently opposed\u201d to leaving the EU without a deal. Environment secretary, Michael Gove, has confirmed he has entered the Tory leadership race and has pitched himself as a \u201cunity candidate\u201d. Gove is the eighth candidate to enter the race for the Tory leadership after Johnson, Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart. Former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has been setting out his case to become leader claiming he would be prepared to leave without a deal and would not seek an extension to article 50. He told the BBC: \u201cI would fight for a fairer deal in Brussels with negotiation to change the backstop arrangements and if not, I would be clear we would leave on WTO terms in October.\u201d Former work and pension secretary, Esther McVey, has also said that if elected she would take the UK out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. \u201cOctober 31 is the key date and we are coming out then, and if that means without a deal then that\u2019s what it means,\u201d she told Sky News. International development secretary, Rory Stewart, has not ruled out voting down a government that pursues a no-deal Brexit. Former education secretary, Justine Greening, took a similar stance. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell says Labour expects a \u201cgood kicking\u201d in the European Parliament elections. Asked about a call by deputy leader Tom Watson for Labour to back a second referendum, McDonnell said Labour had been right to \u201ctread a really difficult road\u201d of trying to bring Leave and Remain supporters back together. Hammond\u2019s comments suggests this leadership race is going to be very feisty if not hostile. And the key battleground in this blue-on-blue war is the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Here\u2019s some reaction: In his Marr interview Hammond seemed determined to derail candidates, including Raab, Johnson and McVey, who have advocated leaving the EU without a deal. He said: I hear a lot of my colleagues wanting to do a deal with the EU, but actually many of them only want to do a deal that is entirely on their terms. They are not really proposing to negotiate with the EU, they are simply proposing to go to Brussels once again and tell the EU once again what it is they don\u2019t like about the withdrawal agreement. The EU will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. I\u2019m quite clear about that. There is also a contradiction between saying that we are going to leave on 31 October and we should try to renegotiate yet again with the European Commission. There isn\u2019t going to be time. People who say \u2018I\u2019m going to go and have one last go at negotiating the backstop away and then we\u2019ll have to leave on no-deal terms\u2019, in fact the negotiation is a fig leaf for what is actually policy of leaving on no-deal terms. That policy has a major flaw in it, a part from the fact that it would have serious implications for our country, that is that parliament has voted very clearly to oppose a no-deal exit. Hammond repeatedly ducked Marr\u2019s questions about whether he would back a no confidence motion against a leader who pursued no-deal. But he said: \u201cThis is a parliamentary democracy. A prime minister who ignores parliament cannot expect to survive very long.\u201d He warned that daring Parliament to except a no-deal Brextit s a \u201cdangerous strategy\u201d. And the chancellor repeated the outgoing prime minister\u2019s plea for compromise on Brexit. Theresa May standing down hasn\u2019t changed anything. I would urge all of my colleagues who are standing in this contest to embrace the concept of compromise. The only way forward on Brexit is compromise. Compromise in parliament, compromise in the country. Hammond also had barbed comments about the tax cuts being proposed by Raab and Jeremy Hunt. He said: \u201cWe have some fiscal headroom which at the moment we need to retain because of the possibility of a no-deal exit which will have very significant economic and fiscal impact on the country. \u201cI would strongly urge my colleagues to recognise that fiscal responsibility is a core Conservative brand and spraying spending and tax cutting commitments around is playing fast and loose with the value of that brand.\u201d Here are the key points and passages from Raab\u2019s interview with Marr. Raab wants to renegotiate the withdrawal bill with a threat of walking out without a deal: I would fight for a fairer deal in Brussels with negotiation to change the backstop arrangements and if not I would be clear we would leave on WTO terms in October. There is a clearly a reasonable ask that we can make, one that had the approval of the House of Commons around the so-called Brady amendment, in particular making sure we have to an exit from the backstop. We need to be absolutely resolute in a way that weren\u2019t last time. One of the reasons [that the EU says they won\u2019t budge on the withdrawal agreement] is that we were not resolute enough and we took no-deal off the table. I don\u2019t want a WTO Brexit but unless you are willing to keep our promises as politicians we put ourselves in a much weaker position in terms of getting a deal, because if you are not willing to walk away from the negotiation it doesn\u2019t focus the mind of the other side. Raab called for a united cabinet: My experience was of being undermined by some others in government so we would need to have a very well organised number 10 operation and a united cabinet. I resigned on principle because I tried very hard to fight for the deal that I\u2019m still fighting for now. And when my advice wasn\u2019t taken by the prime minister or indeed by the cabinet. I did the honourable thing. On voting for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal bill on the third time of asking, Raab said: I voted to avoid the European elections and any further extension. I only voted only to avoid an extension which was bad idea and I think I have been proved right about that. Raab ruled out an extension to article 50: There is no case for a further extension. We have got to bring some finality to this. I will not asks for an extension. Of course if parliament legislates then we would be in a difficult position, but as the Institute for Government points out it would be very difficult for parliament to legislate against no deal or in favour an extension unless resolute prime minister is willing to acquiesce in that. And I would not. Raab did not rule out working with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party: \u201cI always listen to all sides of this debate, from Nigel Farage to others.\u201d Asked if as leader he would enter an electoral pledge with Farage he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I would be aiming for. My aim is not to cosy up with other parties, my aim is to keep Conservative promises, present an optimistic, aspirational vision of the future, then go and beat Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d Raab insisted his proposed tax cuts could be paid for: I\u2019ve talked about raising the National Insurance threshold and I\u2019ve talked about taking a penny off the basic rate of income tax. Overtime my ambition would be to get the basic rate down from 20p to 15p. Taking penny off and [raising] the National Insurance threshold would come to around \u00a315bn. We have got \u00a326bn worth of headroom within our deficit target. I would cut down the number of Whitehall departments, cut out the bureaucracy. I would have a special commission looking at public sector procurement particularly in the NHS and the MoD. And then I would recycle roughly half of that into front line services and half into the tax cuts. Chancellor Philip Hammond has refused to rule out backing a no confidence vote in the government if the new leader went for a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to the Marr programme he said he had never voted against the Conservative whip, and did not want to start now. But he added: \u201cA prime minister has to command the confidence of the House of Commons. How will they govern if they have defied parliament on such an important issue?\u201d And he said if there was a no confidence vote on the issue of no-deal he said: \u201cIt would challenge not just me but very many of my colleagues\u201d Raab said if elected as leader he would listen to the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage. He refused to rule out an electoral pact with the Brexit Party, but said it was not what he was aiming for. Former Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has confirmed he is running and he is prepared to leave the EU on WTO rules. Appearing on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, he said he wanted to renegotiate the backstop or leave without a deal in October. Marr pointed out that he was not liked in Brussels. Raab said that showed he was doing a good job. He also said he would not ask for an extension beyond 31 October. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s no case for a further extension in October. I will not ask for one\u201d. Labour is braced for a \u201cgood kicking\u201d in the European Parliament elections, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said, PA reports. His comments come after deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party must \u201cfind some backbone\u201d and fully commit to a second referendum on Brexit to have any chance of winning the next general election. McDonnell said he understood Mr Watson\u2019s frustration, but that the party had been right to \u201ctread a really difficult road\u201d of trying to bring Leave and Remain supporters back together. The shadow chancellor said Labour would pay an electoral price for that stance when European Parliament results begin to be announced late on Sunday. McDonnell told Sky News: \u201cI think we most probably will get a good kicking in the election results tonight. We\u2019ll see. We are braced for that.\u201d He added: \u201cBut, you know, we had to do the responsible thing. \u201cIt was a hard road to follow. But someone had to be there and say \u2018Can we bring the country back together again?\u2019 \u201cAnd it would have been easy to go to one side, go to the Remain side and ignored all those people who voted Leave - that\u2019s not the nature of our party. \u201cWe are the party that is trying to bring people back together again. \u201cThat\u2019s been difficult electorally for us in these elections, of course it has. \u201cBut now we have got to move on.\u201d The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has refused to say whether he would be prepared to serve in a Boris Johnson government. Returning from a run to his official residence in central London on Sunday morning, Hunt would not answer questions about his predecessor, after Johnson had said that UK should leave the EU on 31 October deal or no deal. Asked if he was running to get fit for the Tory leadership race, Hunt said: \u201cI\u2019m already fit.\u201d Damian Green, the former de facto deputy prime minister is backing Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Speaking to Sky News, Green said: \u201cI think the next leader should be Matt Hancock. \u201cI do think we need a fresh start.\u201d Former education secretary, Justine Greening, has suggested she would be prepared to back a vote of no confidence in the government if the new leader goes for a no-deal Brexit. Greening, confirmed that she will not be standing the contest and refused to say who she will back. Asked by Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge about the prospect of the new leader taking the UK out of the EU without a deal, Greening said: \u201cParliament will stop government doing that. Parliament has voted against no-deal several times. It is clear that communities for the most part do not want to leave the European Union with no deal.\u201d Asked if she was prepared to bring down the government to stop a no deal, Greening said: \u201cThe danger is that a government with an unviable strategy on Brexit is destabilising itself. The choice is going to be quite simple ... either we end up with a general election which Jeremy Corbyn would likely win. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll win it with a majority. He\u2019s likely to have a coalition partner who is likely to demand some kind of a second referendum. Or we can chose to break the Brexit deadlock through giving people a vote. We are going to have to bite the bullet.\u201d Esther McVey has said there will be no further extensions and the UK will leave the EU on 31 October 31, with or without a deal. The former work and pensions secretary told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the UK must start preparing for a no-deal exit straight away. She said: \u201cOctober 31 is the key date and we are coming out then, and if that means without a deal then that\u2019s what it means. \u201cWe won\u2019t be asking for any more extensions. \u201cIf Europe wants to come back to us, the door is open if they want a better deal. \u201cTime is limited, we have to make sure we are ready to leave.\u201d McVey also said she would use the growth in the international aid budget to boost school and police funding. She said the aid budget has grown from \u00a38bn to \u00a314bn and while that would remain high under her leadership, she would use the growth to fund \u201cradical changes\u201d. She told the programme she would invest an extra \u00a34bn for schools and also said there needs to be an extra \u00a33bn for policing. She added: \u201cObviously we have to live within our means, that will come from the extra amount that has gone into foreign aid. \u201cWe are going to leave it at high levels, however we have got to look after people at home, particularly safety on the streets, particularly in schools and transport and the NHS. \u201cThat\u2019s the vision we have got to set out and unite the country and our party.\u201d Michael Gove has confirmed he will formally enter the Conservative leadership race, PA reports. Speaking from his London home, the prominent Brexiteer said he will join an already crowded field after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and ex-Cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom threw their hats into the ring. He said: \u201cI can confirm that I will be putting my name forward to be prime minister of this country. \u201cI believe that I\u2019m ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country.\u201d Gove\u2019s intervention is likely to cause concern to current front-runner Boris Johnson. A spectacular fall out between the two former allies in the 2016 leadership contest helped destroy both men\u2019s chances of the top job. Gove is posing as a self-styled \u201cunity candidate\u201d. With the Tory leadership contest now in full swing, the Sunday papers are awash with the possibilities, with early pitches from the Raab and Gove camps, as well as an interview with Nigel Farage. The Sunday Times focuses on the prospect of a leadership rematch between Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, using the visual aide of Gove stroking a dog in presumed anticipation of setting it upon his rival. The headline is \u201cGet Boris! Gove challenges his rival again.\u201d The environment secretary says he has a better track record and is more capable of delivering Brexit, the newspaper reports. \u201cHis entry into the race will revive memories of the psychodrama of 2016 when he was Johnson\u2019s campaign chairman,\u201d it says. Welcome to a special Sunday edition of Politics Live to cover the first round of Sunday interviews in the Tory leadership contest. There is already a crowded a field in the race to succeed Theresa May and it\u2019s getting bigger. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is expected to enter the contest to challenge the front runner Boris Johnson, his former Vote Leave ally who he betrayed in the last contest. The issue of whether the UK leaves the EU with no deal is emerging as the key issue in the campaign. One of the candidates, international development secretary, Rory Stewart, is so opposed to the idea that he has said he would not serve in a government led by Johnson after the said the former foreign secretary said the UK must leave on the 31 October with or without a deal. Two other candidates who have said they would be prepared to leave without a deal are due to present their leadership pitches in TV interviews today. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is due to appear on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. And Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, is due on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge programme. Here\u2019s taster: Later, Rory Stewart is due to appear on the BBC Radio 5 live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics.",
