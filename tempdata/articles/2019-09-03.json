      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced that he will ask parliament to support plans for a snap October general election after suffering a humiliating defeat in his first House of Commons vote as prime minister. Former cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond and David Gauke were among 21 Conservative rebels who banded together with opposition MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on a dramatic day in Westminster. The move was aimed at paving the way for a bill tabled by the Labour backbencher Hilary Benn, which is designed to block a no-deal Brexit by forcing the prime minister to request an extension to article 50 if he cannot strike a reworked deal with the EU27. Johnson lost the vote by 328 to 301, a convincing majority of 27 for the rebels. The PM had earlier described the legislation, drawn up by a cross-party coalition including the senior Tories Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, as \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s surrender bill\u201d. After his defeat, Johnson said he would never request the delay mandated in the rebels\u2019 bill, which he said would \u201chand control of the negotiations to the EU\u201d. If MPs passed the bill on Wednesday, he said, \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election that he would seek to schedule for 15 October. The prime minister will need a two-thirds majority to secure a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for the motion unless and until the anti no-deal bill had passed. \u201cGet the bill through first in order to take no deal off the table,\u201d the Labour leader said. The rebels hope to push the legislation through all its parliamentary stages by the end of the week \u2013 though they face a fierce battle in the Lords, where scores of Conservative peers are lining up to table wrecking amendments. Johnson held a series of meetings with potential rebels on Tuesday seeking to reassure them he was determined to strike a fresh Brexit deal with the EU27 and that MPs would be given plenty of time to debate and approve it. But several Tories appear to have been emboldened rather than deterred by the threat of losing the party whip for the remainder of the parliament \u2013 and by Johnson\u2019s decision last week to suspend parliament. They expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s failure to show any evidence of concrete progress in the negotiations with the EU27.

After a three-hour emergency debate that ended just before 10pm and was most notable for Jacob Rees-Mogg lying horizontal on the benches and howling for nanny while MPs responded to his sneers with icy contempt, the vote had been a formality.</p> \n<p>Twenty-one Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond and Nicholas Soames, who had served their country with an honour and integrity to which Boris could only aspire, had been as good as their word and put country before self: their political careers ended by backing a motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit their party had always said it didn\u2019t want. Johnson had played one, lost one. A 100% record.</p> \n<p>\u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d yelled Johnson, after the defeat had been declared by Obi Wan Bercow, the Rebel Alliance\u2019s Jedi knight. His mouth opened and closed but only empty words emerged. The merest hint of bravado for a deal that didn\u2019t exist. Scraps for his crestfallen troops, many of whom looked shell-shocked.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson blustered. It\u2019s now a default setting. After a three-hour emergency debate that ended just before 10pm and was most notable for Jacob Rees-Mogg lying horizontal on the benches and howling for nanny while MPs responded to his sneers with icy contempt, the vote had been a formality. Twenty-one Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond and Nicholas Soames, who had served their country with an honour and integrity to which Boris could only aspire, had been as good as their word and put country before self: their political careers ended by backing a motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit their party had always said it didn\u2019t want. Johnson had played one, lost one. A 100% record. \u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d yelled Johnson, after the defeat had been declared by Obi Wan Bercow, the Rebel Alliance\u2019s Jedi knight. His mouth opened and closed but only empty words emerged. The merest hint of bravado for a deal that didn\u2019t exist. Scraps for his crestfallen troops, many of whom looked shell-shocked. History first as tragedy, then as hubris. He pleaded for the election he said he didn\u2019t want, but none of the opposition leaders obliged. Thanks, but no thanks. The prime minister could go whistle. If it was all the same to Boris, they\u2019d wait until Her Maj had signed off the bill before going to the polls. His reputation for dishonesty preceded him.

The Lib Dems and the SNP should support Corbyn only in order for him to call a second referendum. After that, they do not commit to support him and further negotiations would be required.

The City watchdog was responding to MPs\u2019 concerns that polling firms provided surveys to broadcasters and also sold data privately to hedge funds that could use the information to make trades during the 2016 EU referendum.</p> <p>An imminent election looks increasingly likely, meaning polling firms are poised to spring into action.</p> <p>Official figures published on Tuesday appeared to show sterling\u2019s decline this year had been a boon for foreign investors, who were able to snap up British businesses more cheaply.</p> <p>The value of mergers and acquisitions of UK companies by overseas businesses was \u00a318.4bn in the three months from April to June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, more than double the \u00a37.6bn recorded in the first three months of the year.</p> <p>At the same time, UK companies spent \u00a31.5bn buying overseas businesses, compared with \u00a36bn in the first three months of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One major acquisition \u2013 the \u00a35bn buyout of insurer Jardine Lloyd Thompson by US rival Marsh &amp; McLennan \u2013 accounted for much of the jump in foreign purchases.

The currency, which has lost 20% of its value since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, dropped to as low as $1.1959 earlier on Tuesday, sliding by about 1% before rallying as the prime minister faced humiliation in the Commons. After the government was defeated by MPs backing a motion to allow a debate on a bill on Wednesday that would prevent a no-deal Brexit, sterling was trading around the same level it began the day, at about $1.2084. Although recovering the losses, the pound had not traded below $1.20 since 1985 \u2013 apart from very briefly during the \u201cflash crash\u201d in October 2016, when sterling momentarily plunged to as low as $1.15. Despite City investors betting on the rising chance of Britain either agreeing a Brexit deal or staying in the EU, some City analysts suggest the risk of the UK crashing out remains relatively high. Goldman Sachs has raised its odds of a no-deal Brexit from 20% to 25% and said the odds on Britain staying in the EU had declined. Ranko Berich, the head of market analysis at Monex Europe, predicted the pound would fall below parity with the euro if there was a no-deal Brexit. He said the \u201cfragile support\u201d for the currency created by Johnson\u2019s trips to Paris and Berlin last week had been eradicated by the political drama in Westminster. \u201cNo-deal risk remains the be all and end all for sterling. Given that sterling\u2019s fall over the past six months has been driven by an increase in the no-deal risk, from an outside possibility to approximately 50% chance today, we estimate that the pound is likely to weaken by around a further 7% if no deal actually happens \u2013 taking [the pound against the dollar] to around $1.12 and [the pound against the euro] to just below parity,\u201d Berich said. On Tuesday, \u00a31 was worth \u20ac1.096, meaning \u20ac1 was worth 91.2p, close to the 10-year low recorded last month. The Financial Conduct Authority warned that trading currencies using information taken from unpublished polls could breach market abuse rules. The City watchdog was responding to MPs\u2019 concerns that polling firms provided surveys to broadcasters and also sold data privately to hedge funds that could use the information to make trades during the 2016 EU referendum. An imminent election looks increasingly likely, meaning polling firms are poised to spring into action. Official figures published on Tuesday appeared to show sterling\u2019s decline this year had been a boon for foreign investors, who were able to snap up British businesses more cheaply. The value of mergers and acquisitions of UK companies by overseas businesses was \u00a318.4bn in the three months from April to June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, more than double the \u00a37.6bn recorded in the first three months of the year. At the same time, UK companies spent \u00a31.5bn buying overseas businesses, compared with \u00a36bn in the first three months of the year. One major acquisition \u2013 the \u00a35bn buyout of insurer Jardine Lloyd Thompson by US rival Marsh &amp; McLennan \u2013 accounted for much of the jump in foreign purchases. But the trend for foreign companies seeing UK assets as bargains appears likely to continue, with Hong\u2019s Kong\u2019s richest family on course to buy the pub and beer business Greene King for \u00a32.7bn and a US private equity firm making a successful \u00a34bn bid for the defence supplier Cobham. Earlier this month, Hasbro, the US toy company behind My Little Pony and Play-Doh, agreed to buy the owner of Peppa Pig for \u00a33.3bn. Much of the interest in UK assets has come from China, with 15 major acquisitions by Chinese companies valued at a combined \u00a36.75bn completed already this year.",

You will recall however that our private education was paid for largely by the state in the form of the assisted places scheme. There is therefore something of a grim irony \u2013 possibly even hypocrisy \u2013 in you going on to threaten the life chances of others through support for a government that is actively pursuing a policy of economic ruin and a regressive attack on democracy. I used to joke that your degree in Swahili and Hindi made you \u201cperfectly qualified to be an army officer \u2013 in the 1840s\u201d. As you now serve in a government with alarmingly backward intentions, that no longer seems quite so funny. I must therefore beg you, as your brother, to resign your post in the whips\u2019 office and speak out in defence of democracy. How important is your own job when something as priceless as parliamentary democracy is under threat? I was once proud and impressed as you entered parliament \u2013 that was just two years ago. Now I am simply appalled that this government, of which you are sadly a part, has become the principal threat to the lives and liberties of the people. Please do the decent thing, and resign. Many thanks, yours aye, Paddy \u2022 Paddy Docherty is a historian of empire and anticolonial resistance \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Their opportunity lies in the chasm between this week\u2019s protests and the millions of people who either avert their eyes or see them as so much liberal, remainer nonsense; it is also our side\u2019s greatest challenge, whose urgency, even now, has yet to sink in.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>A well-known actor delivers his verdict on Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HackedOffHugh/status/1166740030947287040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You will not fuck with my children\u2019s future.

If you\u2019d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories It\u2019s all kicking off \u2013 and a snap election is looking more likely than ever. Boris Johnson launched his bid to break the Brexit deadlock in brutal fashion, suspending parliament for five weeks from next week and so cutting the time available to MPs to prevent a no-deal exit. The prime minister\u2019s move drew heavy criticism from the EU (which called it \u201csinister\u201d), the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow (\u201ca constitutional outrage\u201d), and MPs from across the political spectrum (\u201creckless\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d). It also triggered three distinct legal challenges from the campaigner Gina Miller (backed by Sir John Major); the Scottish National party\u2019s justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry; and Raymond McCord, a campaigner in Northern Ireland. A petition calling on the government not to suspend parliament passed 1.7m signatures, two senior Conservative figures \u2013 Ruth Davidson, the leader of the party in Scotland, and George Young, the Tory whip in the Lords \u2013 resigned, and protesters took to the streets across the UK and even in continental Europe. Undeterred, Johnson said he wanted to \u201cstep up the tempo\u201d of Brexit talks (his envoy David Frost will head to Brussels twice a week) and he demanded rebel MPs stop undermining the government\u2019s negotiating position. Ministers who had previously opposed the idea of suspending parliament rowed back on their earlier comments. But while Jeremy Corbyn warned that this week would be the last chance to stop a no-deal Brexit, rebel MPs said they were confident they would have the parliamentary time to do so \u2013 and more than 50 pledged to occupy an alternative House of Commons if Johnson did go ahead with the suspension. Michael Gove threw more fuel on the fire, refusing to rule out ignoring any anti-no-deal law, while general election speculation went into overdrive when the PM cancelled a Monday meeting with Tory rebels, threatened to blow up his majority by withdrawing the whip from any who vote against the government, and called a cabinet meeting for Monday afternoon. One leading rebel, David Gauke, said a Commons vote planned for Tuesday to block no deal could be \u201cvery tight\u201d but that the government\u2019s deselection threats may actually be counterproductive, boosting rebel numbers. Corbyn confirmed Labour would back an early election as long as it came before 31 October and as soon as anti-no-deal legislation had been passed, and Downing St said it would treat the vote to prevent no deal as \u201can expression of confidence\u201d. In a brief speech outside No 10, the prime minister threatened to ignore MPs if they vote against no deal, insisting that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d would he ask the EU to delay beyond 31 October. A government source said if the rebels\u2019 efforts were successful, Johnson planned to call a general election for 14 October. On the continent, meanwhile, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, reiterated that it was up to the UK to come up with workable alternatives to the Irish backstop, a message Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, repeated. As the EU said it was considering whether to categorise a no-deal Brexit as a major natural disaster akin to flooding, fires or earthquakes, releasing emergency funds to member states most affected, the government unveiled a \u201cGet ready for Brexit\u201d information blitz with advice for citizens and businesses. What next This looks set to be one of the biggest weeks in UK politics in decades: it could decide how the UK leaves the EU, trigger a general election, end more than one political career, and leave an impact on Britain that will last for generations. Concretely, MPs return on Tuesday and the Speaker will respond to the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. The rebels will request an emergency debate, which Bercow is likely to grant, in a bid to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. Assuming they win that debate, they can table a new short bill that will order the prime minister to seek an extension to article 50 until 31 January to prevent no deal \u2013 although it is unclear how they can ensure Johnson will request it. Also on Tuesday, a court in Edinburgh will rule on one of the three legal challenges to the suspension (the others are due on Thursday). The latter stages of the week are likely to be taken up with the passage of the rebels\u2019 bill \u2013 if it passes the Commons \u2013 through the House of Lords, with peers possibly sitting through the weekend. Johnson has not confirmed how the government will respond if the rebels succeed. But many observers believe a snap \u201cwill of the people\u201d election would be inevitable, most likely in mid-October \u2013 and that it may be called as early as Wednesday. Best of the rest EU will not cave in to Johnson threats, says senior MEP. Rees-Mogg calls doctor \u201cshameful\u201d for raising no-deal drug concerns.

Top comment In the Guardian, John Harris argues that Johnson\u2019s reckless confrontation with parliament is just what millions of voters want: That this is a moment of huge importance and Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament is outrageous are beyond doubt. But in the resulting noise about an alleged coup and the need to take to the streets, too much of the country remains uninterested, and plenty of other people have concluded that Johnson has done the right thing \u2026 To paraphrase the 20th-century communist Antonio Gramsci, it is not so much that the old world is dying and the new cannot be born: it is that the only vivid and coherent vision of the future of power and politics on offer is currently being offered by irresponsible chancers, whose chief concern is not the ghouls they are letting loose, but their own survival. Their opportunity lies in the chasm between this week\u2019s protests and the millions of people who either avert their eyes or see them as so much liberal, remainer nonsense; it is also our side\u2019s greatest challenge, whose urgency, even now, has yet to sink in.
