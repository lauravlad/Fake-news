So there was this sort of Eurosceptic-generating machine that we were all part of, and Boris was driving harder than anyone else,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Johnson did not invent British Eurosceptic reporting, Guilford said, but \u201ctook it to new heights. It delivered him the profile and publicity that he craved.\u201d</p> \n<p>Guilford later became spokesman for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/22/lord-brittan-of-spennithorne\">Leon Brittan</a>, one of two British European commissioners in the early 1990s. He recalled Johnson was often trying to stand up stories of \u201ca German plot against a British commissioner; he was always playing off second world war themes\u201d.Bruno Dethomas, spokesman for the then European commission president, Jacques Delors, said Johnson\u2019s stories were not very different from those of his tabloid rivals. \u201cBoris was of course exaggerating, but more smartly than the others,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Dethomas discovered this when he invited the young reporter to his house in Brussels for drinks. The soiree<em><strong> </strong></em>later provided inspiration for a Johnson report that Dethomas lived in a castle. \u201cHe knew perfectly well that I lived in a normal house with a small garden,\u201d he said. \u201cI was surprised; I found it not absolutely fair, but I knew Boris.\u201d</p> \n<p>In those pre-internet days, the Brussels press corp was tight knit. Journalists spent hours together, either in the underground commission press briefing room or in nearby pubs, such as Kitty O\u2019Shea\u2019s and the Old Hack. Johnson also played squash and tennis and went skiing. Guilford said: \u201cHe played squash like he does everything: very powerful, not always very accurate \u2013 and he skis the same way.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his later years in Brussels, Johnson moved closer to the commission headquarters, taking a modest terrace house<em> </em>on Rue Van Campenhout. By coincidence, Neil Kinnock bought the property when he moved to Brussels to become Britain\u2019s European commissioner. \u201cWe had no need for contact,\u201d Kinnock said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8146c4e9735d43905ae00f303fe15e79e68d56e9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8146c4e9735d43905ae00f303fe15e79e68d56e9/0_18_1904_1142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Max Hastings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson with Max Hastings, who was his editor at the Daily Telegraph.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Howard/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rolf-Dieter Krause, a former correspondent for Germany\u2019s ARD public broadcaster, recalled Johnson slumped in his chair at the European commission\u2019s daily midday briefings. \u201cIf he asked a question, it was to create a laugh \u2026 When we read his articles, we always felt he had been to a different event from the one we were at,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>This approach came to a head with a narrow rejection of the EU by angry voters in a referendum, stoked by fears of rule by Brussels and fuelled by Johnson\u2019s writing in the Daily Telegraph. This was 1992 and \u2013 almost 25 years before the Brexit vote \u2013 Denmark voted down the Maastricht treaty with a majority of 50.7%. Johnson would later claim his front-page story \u201cDelors plans to rule Europe\u201d had helped swing the result.</p> \n<p>Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark\u2019s then foreign minister, thinks Johnson\u2019s writing \u2013 picked up by the Danish press \u2013 helped influence the result. \u201cIt definitely had an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story was that once the Danes had voted yes then we would have much more Europe, much more union and all that stuff.

But he feels Johnson misrepresented changes proposed by Delors. \u201cThe way it was presented is that he had found some secret Delors plan \u2013 that was the absurdity of it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Many in Brussels found Johnson funny. One British official spoke of a \u201chilarious exchange\u201d between Johnson and the agriculture commissioner\u2019s spokesman about how bent a banana had to be. Another said: \u201cHe was great company, he was great fun, but I used to be very angry with the way he just wanted to ridicule the institution and was clearly misleading people.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Daily Telegraph was delighted. Guilford said there were enthusiastic letters from the Telegraph\u2019s then editor, Max Hastings \u2013 now a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\">fierce critic</a> \u2013 pinned to Johnson\u2019s office wall. For the Telegraph foreign desk, he was \u201cas exasperating as he was brilliant\u201d, Wade said in an unpublished memoir. \u201cOn many nights, I would be on the phone begging Boris for the piece he had promised to deliver an hour ago. There was a lot of \u2018oh gosh Nigel, golly Nigel\u2019 and \u2018for godsakes Boris!\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Nobody imagined where Johnson\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d stories would lead, said one of the British officials: \u201cHe was more seen as a colourful buffoon figure.

He recalled Johnson was often trying to stand up stories of \u201ca German plot against a British commissioner; he was always playing off second world war themes\u201d.Bruno Dethomas, spokesman for the then European commission president, Jacques Delors, said Johnson\u2019s stories were not very different from those of his tabloid rivals. \u201cBoris was of course exaggerating, but more smartly than the others,\u201d he said. Dethomas discovered this when he invited the young reporter to his house in Brussels for drinks. The soiree later provided inspiration for a Johnson report that Dethomas lived in a castle. \u201cHe knew perfectly well that I lived in a normal house with a small garden,\u201d he said. \u201cI was surprised; I found it not absolutely fair, but I knew Boris.\u201d In those pre-internet days, the Brussels press corp was tight knit. Journalists spent hours together, either in the underground commission press briefing room or in nearby pubs, such as Kitty O\u2019Shea\u2019s and the Old Hack. Johnson also played squash and tennis and went skiing. Guilford said: \u201cHe played squash like he does everything: very powerful, not always very accurate \u2013 and he skis the same way.\u201d In his later years in Brussels, Johnson moved closer to the commission headquarters, taking a modest terrace house on Rue Van Campenhout. By coincidence, Neil Kinnock bought the property when he moved to Brussels to become Britain\u2019s European commissioner. \u201cWe had no need for contact,\u201d Kinnock said. Rolf-Dieter Krause, a former correspondent for Germany\u2019s ARD public broadcaster, recalled Johnson slumped in his chair at the European commission\u2019s daily midday briefings. \u201cIf he asked a question, it was to create a laugh \u2026 When we read his articles, we always felt he had been to a different event from the one we were at,\u201d he said. This approach came to a head with a narrow rejection of the EU by angry voters in a referendum, stoked by fears of rule by Brussels and fuelled by Johnson\u2019s writing in the Daily Telegraph. This was 1992 and \u2013 almost 25 years before the Brexit vote \u2013 Denmark voted down the Maastricht treaty with a majority of 50.7%. Johnson would later claim his front-page story \u201cDelors plans to rule Europe\u201d had helped swing the result. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark\u2019s then foreign minister, thinks Johnson\u2019s writing \u2013 picked up by the Danish press \u2013 helped influence the result. \u201cIt definitely had an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story was that once the Danes had voted yes then we would have much more Europe, much more union and all that stuff. When I said it was nonsense, I was called a bloody liar.\u201d The former minister acknowledged he was quoted accurately in Johnson\u2019s story. But he feels Johnson misrepresented changes proposed by Delors. \u201cThe way it was presented is that he had found some secret Delors plan \u2013 that was the absurdity of it,\u201d he said. Many in Brussels found Johnson funny. One British official spoke of a \u201chilarious exchange\u201d between Johnson and the agriculture commissioner\u2019s spokesman about how bent a banana had to be. Another said: \u201cHe was great company, he was great fun, but I used to be very angry with the way he just wanted to ridicule the institution and was clearly misleading people.\u201d The Daily Telegraph was delighted. Guilford said there were enthusiastic letters from the Telegraph\u2019s then editor, Max Hastings \u2013 now a fierce critic \u2013 pinned to Johnson\u2019s office wall. For the Telegraph foreign desk, he was \u201cas exasperating as he was brilliant\u201d, Wade said in an unpublished memoir. \u201cOn many nights, I would be on the phone begging Boris for the piece he had promised to deliver an hour ago. There was a lot of \u2018oh gosh Nigel, golly Nigel\u2019 and \u2018for godsakes Boris!\u2019\u201d Nobody imagined where Johnson\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d stories would lead, said one of the British officials: \u201cHe was more seen as a colourful buffoon figure. But we didn\u2019t realise it was going to set the tone of the British debate.\u201d Tomorrow: Johnson the MP and writer",

As criticism mounted steadily over the Met\u2019s warning to editors that they faced prosecution if they published leaked government documents, assistant commissioner Neil Basu issued a statement clarifying that the force did not want to stop the press from publishing stories. His reassurance appeared to represent a U-turn from a statement Basu had issued less than 24 hours earlier in which he warned the \u201cmedia not to publish leaked government documents that may already be in their possession, or which may be offered to them, and to turn them over to the police or give them back to their rightful owner, Her Majesty\u2019s government\u201d. On Saturday, following accusations from senior politicians including the Tory leadership contenders Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt that Scotland Yard was attempting to inhibit press freedom, Basu stated: \u201cThe Metropolitan Police respect the rights of the media and has no intention of seeking to prevent editors from publishing stories in the public interest in a liberal democracy.\u201d As counterterrorism officers continue to investigate who leaked Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s diplomatic cables, Basu\u2019s climbdown was interpreted as an attempt to dampen down the row. Darroch quit his position as British ambassador in Washington on Wednesday after his critical dispatches of Trump\u2019s administration were published in the Mail on Sunday. After a Whitehall investigation failed to identify the source of the leak, Scotland Yard announced on Friday it had launched a criminal investigation, suggesting the government believed the Official Secrets Act had been breached.

Rejoice.</p> <p>The prevailing cult of optimism reinforces the belief that Britain\u2019s institutions \u2013 parliament, the civil service and that jumble of conventions and archaic procedures that are what passes for a constitution \u2013 will inevitably weather any future storm.</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not been a great week for the civil service; a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/12/met-police-open-investigation-into-leaked-kim-darroch-cables\" title=\"\">police investigation</a> has been launched into a leak apparently designed to bring down our ambassador to the most powerful nation on earth, followed by his public defenestration by the PM-in-waiting. Month by month our constitution has been proved unfit for purpose and parliament\u2019s physical decay is increasingly turning it into a vast, scaffold-covered metaphor.</p> <p>A musty, chintzy kitschness lingers about the Palace of Westminster. A cabbagey, care-home smell wafts along its neo-gothic corridors. With Johnson refusing to rule out bypassing parliament (with his threatened prorogation and his opponents discussing setting up a rival assembly across the road, you have to really want to see the \u201cmother of parliaments\u201d cup as half full.</p> <p>The unlikely patron saint of this form of optimistic, national exceptionalism is Winston Churchill, a man who suffered bouts of depression and spent a decade in the political wilderness for pessimistically predicting a global catastrophe. Hardly the ideal poster boy for the breezy optimism of Johnson and his cabal. And to go by run of form, optimism is on a losing streak. Optimists confidently predicted Trump would mature in office and they have repeatedly administered the last rites to Nigel Farage\u2019s political career and failed utterly to identity the risks that led us into our current age of anger and chaos.</p> <p>Whether we like it or not, there are moments in history when pessimism is the appropriate response. Times when, as the German philosopher Oswald Spengler said, \u201coptimism is cowardice\u201d. What is needed now is not a \u201cnameless, unreasoning, unjustified\u201d form of pessimism that \u201cparalyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance\u201d, to quote Franklin D Roosevelt, but a sobering and energising pessimism. It is necessary because the cult of optimism, the original source of our national complacency, is in itself a clear and present danger.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Optimists predicted Trump would mature in office and have repeatedly administered the last rights to Nigel Farage\u2019s political career</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Brexit project exploited our cultural predilection for optimism. Leave was painted as the optimistic choice. Now, when the Brexiteers are not promising us \u201cadequate food\u201d, they are peddling another brand of optimism. No matter what happens at the end of October, they tell us, we\u2019ll be all right. After all, if we can make it through the Second World War we can survive Brexit. One of the many holes in this \u201cthere\u2019ll always be an England\u201d line of argument is, of course, that half a million British people didn\u2019t make it through the Second World War.</p> <p>That reality is perhaps why the support for Remain was high among a demographic that is rarely mentioned. The simplistic belief that the old voted Leave and the young voted Remain ignores the fact that the most elderly, the people who actually remember the Second World War, who fought and suffered in it, were \u201cfar more likely to oppose Brexit\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/over-65s-brexit/\" title=\"\">some research</a>, than the baby boomers \u2013 a generation brought up watching war films rather than cowering in Anderson shelters.</p> <p>And is it that surprising that the most privileged generation to have ever lived harbour less pessimism than their parents or their children and grandchildren?</p> <p>It is true that Britain and its institutions have survived past crises, but often this was because those in charge, at a certain point, snapped out of the stupor of latent optimism, recognised the dangers circling the nation and acted.

To describe someone as a pessimist is to issue an insult, whereas to be labelled an optimist is to get a pat on the back. To dismiss someone\u2019s argument as pessimistic is to suggest it is the product of a personality disorder, rather than careful analysis. This lazy stance is easy to adopt and often highly effective in debate. It is what Boris Johnson clumsily and desperately attempted last week, while floundering against Andrew Neil: \u201cWhy this defeatism? Why this negativity?\u201d he blustered, in a pitiful effort to draw attention away from his demonstrable ignorance of his own Brexit \u201cplan\u201d. Don\u2019t analyse, stop identifying flaws and inconsistencies, just be optimistic. Rejoice. Rejoice. The prevailing cult of optimism reinforces the belief that Britain\u2019s institutions \u2013 parliament, the civil service and that jumble of conventions and archaic procedures that are what passes for a constitution \u2013 will inevitably weather any future storm. Well, it\u2019s not been a great week for the civil service; a police investigation has been launched into a leak apparently designed to bring down our ambassador to the most powerful nation on earth, followed by his public defenestration by the PM-in-waiting. Month by month our constitution has been proved unfit for purpose and parliament\u2019s physical decay is increasingly turning it into a vast, scaffold-covered metaphor. A musty, chintzy kitschness lingers about the Palace of Westminster. A cabbagey, care-home smell wafts along its neo-gothic corridors. With Johnson refusing to rule out bypassing parliament (with his threatened prorogation and his opponents discussing setting up a rival assembly across the road, you have to really want to see the \u201cmother of parliaments\u201d cup as half full. The unlikely patron saint of this form of optimistic, national exceptionalism is Winston Churchill, a man who suffered bouts of depression and spent a decade in the political wilderness for pessimistically predicting a global catastrophe. Hardly the ideal poster boy for the breezy optimism of Johnson and his cabal. And to go by run of form, optimism is on a losing streak. Optimists confidently predicted Trump would mature in office and they have repeatedly administered the last rites to Nigel Farage\u2019s political career and failed utterly to identity the risks that led us into our current age of anger and chaos. Whether we like it or not, there are moments in history when pessimism is the appropriate response. Times when, as the German philosopher Oswald Spengler said, \u201coptimism is cowardice\u201d. What is needed now is not a \u201cnameless, unreasoning, unjustified\u201d form of pessimism that \u201cparalyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance\u201d, to quote Franklin D Roosevelt, but a sobering and energising pessimism. It is necessary because the cult of optimism, the original source of our national complacency, is in itself a clear and present danger. The Brexit project exploited our cultural predilection for optimism. Leave was painted as the optimistic choice. Now, when the Brexiteers are not promising us \u201cadequate food\u201d, they are peddling another brand of optimism. No matter what happens at the end of October, they tell us, we\u2019ll be all right. After all, if we can make it through the Second World War we can survive Brexit. One of the many holes in this \u201cthere\u2019ll always be an England\u201d line of argument is, of course, that half a million British people didn\u2019t make it through the Second World War. That reality is perhaps why the support for Remain was high among a demographic that is rarely mentioned. The simplistic belief that the old voted Leave and the young voted Remain ignores the fact that the most elderly, the people who actually remember the Second World War, who fought and suffered in it, were \u201cfar more likely to oppose Brexit\u201d, according to some research, than the baby boomers \u2013 a generation brought up watching war films rather than cowering in Anderson shelters. And is it that surprising that the most privileged generation to have ever lived harbour less pessimism than their parents or their children and grandchildren? It is true that Britain and its institutions have survived past crises, but often this was because those in charge, at a certain point, snapped out of the stupor of latent optimism, recognised the dangers circling the nation and acted. Call it pessimism, realism or pragmatism: we urgently need exactly that sort of awakening now. \u2022 David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster",
