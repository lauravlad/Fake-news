A mechanism to ensure this was agreed. The EU system would apply in Northern Ireland. For businesses, it is logical to have consistency, as with the single market for goods.</p> \n  <p>On consent, he says the new protocol would be supported democratically. At the end of the transition period there would be a four-year period for the new arrangements to be in force. At the end of that the members of the Northern Ireland assembly would vote, on the basis of a simple majority, for the arrangement to continue for another four years. If there were a cross-community vote in favour, it would continue for eight years. If there were a vote to end the arrangements, there would be a two-year cooling off period. </p> \n  <p>He says this new approach has nothing to do with the old backstop.

That risk exists. That is why both sides have come up with a mechanism to assess this risk. The assessment will be based on a number of criteria, overseen by a joint committee.

This should not be a surprise - Jeremy Corbyn has been saying for some time that if the country is facing either a no-deal Brexit or what he terms a damaging Tory Brexit, there should be a referendum \u2013 but in recent days there has been some uncertainty about what the party would do, because it also wants a general election ahead of a referendum.</p> \n  <p>But Lloyd said the party would back moves to subject Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If there is a majority for that deal, and if in turn there is an amendment moved, and that\u2019s put to a confirmatory vote, a public vote, then, consistent with what Labour is saying that any deal ought to go back to the public, then we are almost bound to vote for that amendment ...</p> \n   <p>It would be very hard for us to support a deal [along the lines proposed by Johnson, with employment rights in the UK potentially falling behind EU standards]. Labour doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a blocking minority in parliament. And on that basis if Prime Minister Johnson is able to push through a deal, even a deal that we don\u2019t like, if an amendment were moved to subject that to the test of public opinion, that would be the right thing to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>With Labour backing a plan to put Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum, it is possible, although not yet certain, that such an amendment could pass.</p> \n  <p>But what would happen then? It is almost impossible to imagine circumstances in which the government would agree to put the proposal to a referendum. Inside No 10, a no-deal Brexit is seen as preferable to a second referendum. And legislating for a referendum, and then having a campaign, would <a href=\"https://constitution-unit.com/2018/08/30/how-long-would-it-take-to-hold-a-second-referendum-on-brexit/\">probably take several months. </a>This suggests that, for any referendum on Johnson\u2019s plan to actually happen, opposition MPs would have to vote for some sort of interim government to replace Johnson\u2019s.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"626861d551fac2f8cdc5f0f32161977990d3fec9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/626861d551fac2f8cdc5f0f32161977990d3fec9/0_853_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Lloyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Lloyd.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T08:32:28.918Z\">at 9.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da81f348f0804be727991d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-17T07:59:39.047Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson speaks to Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of summit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from <strong>Mina Andreeva</strong>, the European commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mina_Andreeva/status/1184736780320464896\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Contacts between <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EU</a> and UK teams are continuing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JunckerEU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JunckerEU</a> just spoke to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>.

However with three meetings in three days in Downing Street, it is unclear whether Downing Street can cede any more and ruins the prospect of a deal.</p> \n  <p>2. The EU yields to the DUP\u2019s demands. Given the EU\u2019s deep concern about how it can protect the single market from rogue goods on a border, with no border checks, it is difficult to see the EU cede further on customs.</p> \n  <p>3. The DUP folds at the last minute. Note its statement: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom\u201d.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: Downing Street and Brussels announced they had reached a Brexit deal to put to the UK and European parliaments. While many Tories are expected to back the deal, the DUP has said it will not and Boris Johnson faces a fight to get it through a Commons vote. The prime minister predicted MPs would back it, despite the lack of support from the DUP. There was an effort to frame the choice facing parliamentarians as being between the prime minister\u2019s deal and no deal at all, with the European commission president seeming to rule out any delay. But the door was left ajar when EU leaders later refused to rule out a delay. The Labour leadership indicated it would not back the deal, denouncing it as worse than that negotiated by Theresa May and rejected three times by parliament. It remains to be seen whether some pro-Brexit Labour MPs will side with the prime minister. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator said there would be enough time to ratify the deal by the 31 October deadline. You can read a summary of Michel Barnier\u2019s speech here. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin have the full story: Mark Field, the Tory MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, has announced he will not stand in the next general election, blaming a \u201cfractious and febrile\u201d political atmosphere. Field, who has held the seat since 2001, said in a statement to his local association he was proud of his reputation as a \u201cmoderate, consensual MP, invariably keen to work effectively across party lines to the benefit of constituents and communities alike\u201d. However, such a pragmatic, cooperative approach to public service has been tested to destruction in the fractious, febrile and deeply divisive aftermath to the EU referendum in 2016. I had dearly hoped that by the time of the next general election these issues would have been resolved. However, it is increasingly clear that divisions over Brexit and our future relationship with the EU-27 will dominate and define domestic politics for many years to come. Field was condemned by many this summer after he was filmed manhandling an environmental protester at the chancellor\u2019s Mansion House speech. The EU legislature will take its full time to carefully examine and approve any divorce deal for the UK, the European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit official has said. Guy Verhofstadt has said the process could spill past 31 October, when the UK is currently scheduled to leave the EU. He has said MEPs will only start their work once the UK\u2019s parliament has passed a fully binding Brexit deal. If that slips past the European plenary session next week, it could well have to be picked up in the session that begins on 13 November. Any EU-UK Brexit withdrawal deal needs the official backing of both the British and European Parliaments. Verhofstadt said the parliament \u201cwill only start its work from the moment that we are 100% sure that the British Parliament will adopt this deal\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has been addressing his party\u2019s amendment to Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, saying other opposition parties need to \u201cquit dithering ... and finally act to bring this appalling Tory government down and stop Brexit\u201d. Boris Johnson\u2019s appalling Brexit deal is even worse than Theresa May\u2019s. It would be devastating for Scotland \u2013 dragging us out of the EU, single market and customs union against our will, and singling Scotland out, alone of UK nations, for a raw deal, with our votes and voice ignored. The SNP will never vote for this deal, which would inflict lasting harm on jobs, living standards, public services and the economy. It is clearer than ever that the best future for Scotland is as an equal, independent European nation and the people of Scotland must be given that choice. My colleagues, Jennifer Rankin and Rowena Mason, have just published this comprehensive look at how the deal was struck and what could happen next: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has labelled the Brexit agreement Johnson\u2019s \u201csell-out deal\u201d: Here\u2019s a little more reaction from Labour MPs: Of course, it is to the likes of Sir Kevin Barron, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint and John Mann \u2013 Labour MPs who have previously backed a Brexit deal in the Commons \u2013 that Johnson will look for support. It seems clear that the DUP will not only decline to support the deal, they will vote against it. This from Sky News\u2019 David Blevins and Antonello Guerrera, of Italy\u2019s la Repubblica newspaper: My colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, has put together this handy explainer on what, exactly, Johnson\u2019s deal entails. The key sentence: Overall, the backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. Besides the motion seeking MPs\u2019 approval for the Brexit deal, a separate no-deal Brexit motion has also been tabled. But, the Press Association reports, it\u2019s understood the government did this as a contingency measure as the talks were still taking place in Brussels. Also, my colleague Rowena Mason has this: The Labour MP, Hilary Benn, has asked government to release impact assessments for Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal ahead of Saturday\u2019s vote, in a letter to the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. And the wheels are starting to turn in Westminster: It\u2019s perhaps interesting to note that Johnson spent a not insignificant proportion of his time talking about policies one would expect to see in an election manifesto, as well as deploying the language of such a campaign, rather than about Brexit. \u201cTake back control\u201d makes an appearance, as does \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He also refers to the planned recruitment of more police officers (though that might not be all it seems), as well as the government\u2019s living wage plans, which he says represent the \u201cbiggest expansion\u201d. Without Johnson setting out what he\u2019s actually measuring that against, it\u2019s impossible to determine whether or not it\u2019s an accurate claim. Furthermore, it\u2019s worth putting Johnson\u2019s claims about increased education funding into context. We reported back in March, for example, that teachers have been covering for canteen staff and cleaners in English schools under Tory government policy, while essential funds are raised by parent donations and \u201ccharity\u201d non-uniform days: Here\u2019s the full text of the prime minister\u2019s speech: This has been a very productive day for the UK in the sense that the European Council has approved the deal that has been negotiated over the last couple of months and I thank them very much again for their work. I particularly thank Michel Barnier and his team, I thank Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the commission, for all the personal effort that he has put into getting this deal done. I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK. I also believe it\u2019s a very good deal for our friends in the EU. And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom \u2013 England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together. And it means we can decide our future together. We can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together. And we will be able to do free trade agreements around the world. And we can also build now, after three and a half years, on our relations with our friends and partners in the EU and it will be a very exciting period now, as it were, to get to the positive side of that project; the extraction having been done, the building now begins. I am very confident that, when my colleagues in Parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday and then in succeeding days. This is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done and come out on 31 October. This is our chance to focus on our priorities, the people\u2019s priorities: the NHS; putting 20,000 police on the streets; lifting up funding of education across the country; the biggest expansion of the living wage. Those are the things I think the people of our country want us to be focusing on, in addition to Brexit. We\u2019ve been at this now, as I say, for three and a half years. It hasn\u2019t always been an easy experience for the UK. It\u2019s been long, it\u2019s been painful, it\u2019s been divisive. And now is the moment for us, as a country, to come together. Now is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done. And, as I say, to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends, with whom of course we share so many priorities. It\u2019s suggested that, without the support of the DUP, his predicament is similar to that of his predecessor, Theresa May. Is he not simply repeating her mistakes? Johnson replies again that it\u2019s a good deal that MPs should back. He had earlier told MPs he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that, when MPs study the Brexit deal, they would want to vote for it. The prime minister declines to say whether he\u2019ll withdraw the whip from Tory MPs who do not vote for the deal. And he avoids a question on whether he\u2019ll restore it to those from whom it was withdrawn last month. Asked how the deal will help heal Brexit divisions within the UK, Johnson says that moving on from the \u201cextraction\u201d process will allow the country to begin working on determining the nature of the relationship with the EU. The prime minister is saying that tying up the deal allows him to focus on other priorities, including putting 20,000 police officers on the streets. He has, of course, been accused of misleading the public over this policy. He says Brexit has \u201cbeen long, it\u2019s been painful and divisive\u201d and says he believes MPs will back it. Boris Johnson is starting his press conference, claiming the deal allows the whole of the UK to leave the EU together. And he says it allows the \u201cbuilding\u201d of a future relationship to begin. Here is an important point flagged up by the political commentator and broadcaster Steve Richards. Boris Johnson is about to hold a press conference. But I am finished for the day. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over. Q: What compromises has the EU made? And what will happen if the UK votes against the deal? Tusk says the EU has been willing to consider compromises. He says the EU intends to work towards ratification. This was a clear decision. He says the EU is prepared for ratification, logistically and politically. He has \u201cno idea\u201d what will happen in the debate. He goes on: If there is a request for an extension, I will contact member states to see how to react. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. He says, after the UK leaves, the work on a new partnership will have to start. He thanks his team. He thanks his most senior officials by name. He says this deal will provide legal certainty. He says he worked on the unity of the EU27 and of the European parliament. He says he very much regrets Brexit. But he respects it. It was a sovereign choice of the UK. He says he has a Gaullist tendency. He has great respect for the UK, and he remembers what the UK did in Europe\u2019s darkest hour. He has infinite respect for the UK. In the future the UK will be there. Varadkar says the transition will last \u201cat least\u201d until the end of 2020. It could get extended. He says Ireland and the EU\u2019s objectives have been met. Citizens\u2019 rights have been protected. There will be a financial settlement. There will be no hard border. And the all-island economy will continue. He says the European council has backed this agreement unanimously. He hopes the UK parliament will now back it. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) is speaking now. He says he has learnt two things about the EU in his two years as taoiseach. He has seen the unity of the EU, and what it can achieve if it stands together. This is a lesson for the future, he says. And he says he has felt, as leader of a small country, \u201cenormous solidarity\u201d from the EU. Sometime small states like Ireland think they will be swallowed up by an organisation like the EU. But Ireland has felt respected. He says he feels sad about Brexit. It is like an old friend going on a journey. He hopes it works out for them. But there will always be a place for the UK if it wants to come back. Varadkar says the UK will always be welcome back in the EU. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, is speaking now. He says the agreement protects the rights of citizens. The EU has always put people first, he says. He says this agreement would not have been possible without the taoiseach. He says the political declaration provides for a free trade agreement. He says he is happy they have reached a deal, but sad Brexit is happening. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is speaking at his press conference now. He says the EU has endorsed the deal and \u201cit looks like we are very close to the final stretch\u201d. Why has a deal that looked impossible yesterday been approved? First, because it has been positively assessed by Ireland. And, second, it has been positively assessed by the European commission. He says the main change has been Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to allow customs checks between Britain and Ireland. Now we are waiting for the vote in parliament. Tusk says he feels sadness. Personally he is a remainer, and he hopes that if the UK decides to rejoin, the EU\u2019s door will be open. Tusk says he hopes one day the UK will decide to rejoin the EU. The division lists for the vote on the Letwin amendment earlier (see 1.49pm) are on the Commons website here. Only one Tory MP rebelled and supported the amendment, Dame Caroline Spelman. But nine of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip over a Brexit rebellion last month and who now sit as independents also voted for the amendment. Only one DUP MP voted with the government. The other nine did not. We don\u2019t know if that was a protest against the Brexit deal, but if the other nine DUP MPs had voted with the government would have lost by three, not nine. The EU27 have finished their discussion on Brexit, according to Preben Aamann, a spokesman for Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. A draft of the conclusions was leaked earlier. (See 4.14pm.) Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are due to hold a press conference within the next half an hour. Here is one take on how the voting could go on Saturday, under various scenarios. From AFP\u2019s Dave Clark Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, devotes most of his campaigning energy at the moment to complaining that Brexit has not yet been delivered. But now that Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is saying the EU would not allow a further Brexit deal, Farage is complaining that Juncker is overriding the Benn Act, which requires the PM to ask for an extension if his deal does not get approved. EU ministers are starting to query Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s claim that the EU would not allow a further Brexit extension. (See 2.37pm.) This is from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley, quoting the Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam, quoting Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister. And these are from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who has been studying the revised political declaration (see 12.17pm) in detail. These are from my colleague Rowena Mason. Politico Europe\u2019s Jacopo Barigazzi has posted on Twitter a copy of a draft of the summit conclusions on Brexit. It does not say anything about whether the EU would or would not approve an extension if MPs were to vote down the deal. Instead it just invites the European commission, parliament and council \u201cto take the necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on 1 November 2019, so as to provide for an orderly withdrawal\u201d. Here is the latest story from the summit from my colleagues Daniel Boffey, Jennifer Rankin and Heather Stewart, focusing on Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments. And this is how it starts. Jean-Claude Juncker has tried to help sell the new Brexit deal in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party by pouring doubt on a further Brexit extension in the event of it being rejected. With Boris Johnson facing an uphill struggle to secure a majority in the Commons when it sits on Saturday, the European commission president piled pressure on MPs who fear a no-deal Brexit into giving their support. Juncker said he was \u201cruling out\u201d a prolongation, although the issue is solely the remit of the heads of state and government. \u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation,\u201d he added. The claim was not repeated by any EU leaders. Donald Tusk, the European council president, confined himself to saying that \u201ca deal is always better than a no deal\u201d. Sources in Brussels suggested that previous comments from Juncker in which he had said the bloc would never choose a no-deal Brexit were a \u201cbetter reflection\u201d of the EU\u2019s position. Campaigning anti-Brexit QC Jolyon Maugham has now lodged his petition at the court of session in Edinburgh, which essentially tries to ban parliament from debating the new Brexit deal, on the basis that it is illegal, and which he anticipates will be heard tomorrow. Maugham believes that the deal contravenes s55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, which states that it is \u201cunlawful for Her Majesty\u2019s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain\u201d. With the detail of Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal still emerging, lawyers insist that s55 is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d and that any form of differentiated deal for Northern Ireland will contravene it. So buckle up for a weekend of constitutional hijinks in Edinburgh. Remember that if Johnson refuses to sign an extension letter to the EU (should he fail to get the deal through on Saturday AND provided the court doesn\u2019t blow the whole debate out of the water) then Maugham will be back in court on Monday ... this time with his fellow petitioners, Joanna Cherry, Dale Vince, who are notably absent from today\u2019s petition. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing in the court of session at noon on Monday 21 October, where he could issue court orders forcing Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension to article 50 until 31 January as per the Benn act. This is from Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s former communications chief. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, welcomed the Brexit deal as he arrived at the EU summit earlier, but stressed that it still had to get through the UK and EU parliaments. \u201cBased on past experience we have to be reasonably cautious,\u201d he said. From Reuters\u2019 Luke Baker Here is Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, on Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments. Manufacturing Northern Ireland has given a \u201cguarded welcome\u201d the Brexit agreement saying it \u201cremoves the risk of a catastrophic no deal\u201d but raises concerns about the administrative and financial burden on the new arrangements that will apply on some trade into Northern Ireland. If it is approved, expect Northern Ireland business to be looking for substantial help on both points \u2013 the paperwork and costs \u2013 from London. Stephen Kelly, Manufacturing NI\u2019s chief executive, said: What is good is that a deal is struck, we can move on to the more positive conversation about the future relationship and regardless Northern Ireland can continue to have tariff free, quota free access to both the UK and the EU\u2019s single market. More on the significance of Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments about the EU not agreeing to a further Brexit extension. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith. This is what Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, said about ruling out a Brexit extension. He was speaking to reporters on the \u201cred carpet\u201d where leaders speak to journalists as they arrive for the summit. Asked if he thought the deal would pass parliament, he said: \u201cIt has to.\u201d Then he added: Anyway, there will be no prolongation. He went on: We have concluded a deal. So there is not an argument for delay. It has to be done now. Asked by another journalist if he would rule out an extension if Boris Johnson asked for that, Juncker replied: I gave a brief doorstop with Boris Johnson ... half an hour ago and I was ruling out that there will be any kind of prolongation. If we have a deal, we have a deal, and there is no need for prolongation. That is not only the British view; that is my view too. Asked again if he would officially rule out an extension, he replied: Yes. We have a deal. So why should we have a prolongation? But, as my colleague Jennifer Rankin points out, it is questionable whether, in practice, the EU27 would rule out another extension if the alternative were no deal. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has said the EU will not grant another Brexit extension. This is hugely significant because, if the EU27 agree \u2013 and it is not clear yet whether he is speaking on their behalf \u2013 it means MPs will effectively be faced with a choice between this deal and no deal. Sinn Fein has welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. In a statement its president, Mary Lou McDonald, said: I welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached between the European Union and the British government. There is no such thing as a good Brexit. Brexit is being foisted on the north of Ireland against the democratic wishes of the people. As a party, Sinn F\u00e9in has worked to defend Irish interests from the worst impacts of Brexit. It was Sinn F\u00e9in who first made the case for a \u2018designated special status for the north within the EU\u2019 and it was Sinn F\u00e9in who insisted on the protection of the Good Friday agreement and no hard border on the island of Ireland as bottom lines. We have also insisted that no veto can be given to unionism. But she also said any deal was a \u201cleast worst option\u201d that would \u201conly mitigate the worst effects of Brexit\u201d. Boris Johnson has just given a brief statement to the press at the EU summit alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. Juncker said the deal was fair and balanced. He said: This is a fair, a balanced agreement. It is testament to our commitment to finding solutions. It provides certainty where Brexit creates uncertainty. And Johnson said this was a very good deal for both sides. He said: I do think this deal represents a very good deal for the EU and the UK. I think it is a reasonable, fair outcome and reflects the large amount of work undertaken by both sides ... I agree very much with Jean-Claude about what he said about protecting the peace process on the island of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Of course, for us in the UK it means we can deliver a real Brexit that achieves our objectives. It means the UK leaves whole and entire on 31 October and it means that Northern Ireland and every part of the UK can take part in not just free trade deals, offering our tariffs, exporting our goods around the world, but it also means we can take, together as a single United Kingdom, decisions about our future - our laws, our borders, our money and how we want to run the UK. Those decisions will be taken in the UK by elected representatives of the people in the UK. The government has lost the first vote on the Saturday sitting. Sir Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment (see 1.29pm) was passed by 287 votes to 275 \u2013 a majority of 12. Explaining his amendment in the debate Letwin said this would allow the government motion on Saturday to be amended. He implied it would allow MPs to insist on Boris Johnson requesting an extension anyway, and only withdrawing that request when the legislation for his deal has passed. The purpose of the amendment here is very simple, it is to permit amendments to be moved, if selected by [the Speaker], on Saturday, and be voted upon. And that will enable those of us, like me, who wish to support and carry through and eventually see the ratification of this deal, not to put us in the position of allowing the government off the Benn act hook on Saturday, but only at a time when the bill has been taken through both Houses of Parliament and legislated on. Letwin was referring to a loophole in the Benn act which means Johnson only has to send a letter requesting an extension if MPs fail to pass a motion backing a deal by Saturday. In theory they could pass that motion, but then fail to pass the withdrawal agreement legislation, which would mean the UK leaving without a deal on 31 October. The Letwin amendment should also make it possible for MPs to table an amendment saying Johnson\u2019s deal should be subject to a second referendum. (See 9.13am.) After the vote on the amendment, the motion as amended was approved without a vote. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, told the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics that he had not decided yet whether he would vote for this deal. As the BBC reports, he explained: I want to know how quickly can we get to a free trade agreement, how quickly can we therefore get out, what incentive is there for the EU to do this quickly? And is the political declaration exclusively for free trade? MPs are now voting on the motion to sit on Saturday. In the Commons MPs are now debating the government business motion saying they sit on Saturday. Opening the debate Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said that Boris Johnson would make a statement to MPs on Saturday about the new Brexit agreement. Only after that statement would MPs start the debate on it. Rees-Mogg said MPs would then vote either on a motion to back the deal or on one to approve no deal. He explained: The debate that follows will be a motion to either approve a deal or to approve a no-deal exit. That debate on one or other of those motions would run for up to 90 minutes under the existing rules of this house. In the event of a motion to approve a deal, that motion, if passed, will meet the terms both of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act [aka, the Benn act] and of section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act. The government has not published the motion it is tabling for Saturday. The debate is scheduled to last 90 minutes. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Tory former cabinet minister who has been leading efforts to ensure MPs block a no-deal Brexit, has tabled an amendment to the business motion allowing the debate on Saturday to last longer and also allowing more amendments to be put to a vote. Rees-Mogg claimed that the Letwin amendment could actually shorten the debate because, if Johnson\u2019s statement went on for hours, under the Letwin procedure there would be less than 90-minutes left for the main debate. But John Bercow, the Speaker, contradicted Rees-Mogg. He said he had the discretion to allow the debate to over-run and he said there was \u201cno way on Earth\u201d he would let it be shortened in the way Rees-Mogg was suggesting. Here is the key extract from the DUP\u2019s statement. These arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland. This drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement. For all of these reasons it is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long-term interests. Saturday\u2019s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons. The DUP has just issued this statement. Here is the text of Michel Barnier\u2019s opening statement at his press conference earlier. And here are the key points from the opening and the Q&amp;A. Barnier said that the new deal could be ratified before 31 October. That would be necessary for Boris Johnson to be able to fulfil his pledge to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Barnier stressed that the agreement was only a draft, and that it would not be ratified at the summit today. But he also said: I am confident [the agreement] can be supported and ratified in the time between now and 31 October. He confirmed that the DUP would not have a veto on whether the new arrangements for Northern Ireland came into force. (See 11.16am.) Explaining what the agreement now says about the issue of consent, which is different from what Johnson was proposing earlier this month, Barnier said: Four years after the entry into force of the protocol, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will be able to decide, by simple majority, whether to continue applying relevant Union rules in Northern Ireland or not. He said Johnson told Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, he was confident MPs would pass his deal. Barnier said: Mr Johnson said to President Juncker this morning he has faith in his ability to convince the majority he needs in the House of Commons. He said, based on this agreement and the explanations he intends to give, he has confidence in his ability to win that vote. Barnier refused to speculate on whether the EU would be willing to make a fresh offer to the UK if MPs voted down this plan. From Bloomberg\u2019s Kitty Donaldson A view in Northern Ireland is that the DUP have been totally shafted, or \u201crun over by a convoy of juggernauts\u201d, and for once lost out in their hallmark brinkmanship. This could rise to further tensions in the region, making it vital that there is \u201cno crowing in Dublin\u201d, one source said. The DUP, which had been the lynchpin in Theresa May\u2019s government, have seen their powerful position rubbed out this morning in Brussels and some in Northern Ireland are saying they believe that this was Boris Johnson\u2019s calculation all along: get a deal and have a general election whether he gets it through parliament or not. \u201cThis has not gone well for the DUP. This is a huge moment for the DUP, and it is going to create huge tensions on the unionist side. Northern Ireland continues to be collateral damage in Brexit,\u201d said the source. Some believe that the DUP\u2019s statement this morning was about forcing further concessions from Boris Johnson. But the moment the deal was done the door was closed in their face. That said it may well be that Johnson lavishes the DUP/Northern Ireland with a jacuzzi of cash in the next two days to bring them back on board. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, was in Derry recently to discuss the establishment of a new medical school and there has been repeated talk of money for a motorway from Derry to Belfast. But sources say \u201cthis is of no interest to the DUP because that is Sinn F\u00e9in territory\u201d. So if the DUP have been sold a dummy pass, how did that happen? Could Dominic Cummings have come up with a cunning plan to persuade them to drop regulatory alignment in exchange for a veto on the deal, a veto that he knew would never get through? That is a question yet to be answered. Others point out that the DUP took a huge step agreeing to yield on regulatory alignment with the EU and this was not matched by the EU/Dublin. They felt that this was not recognised by Dublin and they were \u201cvery annoyed\u201d when Leo Varadkar made an off-the-cuff remark in Sweden days later that the British public actually wanted to stay in the EU but it was politically impossible. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, told Sky News that this deal was not a betrayal of the DUP. Asked if the government had thrown the DUP under the bus, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely not, this is a great deal.\u201d Asked what would happen if MPs rejected the deal on Saturday, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t contemplate defeat.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, says the new deal does not amount to proper Brexit. Here is the revised text of the political declaration (pdf). It runs to 27 pages. And here is some comment on it from journalists and other commentators From ITV\u2019s Joel Hills From Stuart Wood, a Labour peer and former EU adviser to Gordon Brown From Sam Lowe from the Centre for European Reform From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse From Politics.co.uk\u2019s Ian Dunt This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. These are from my colleague Rajeev Syal, who was at the No 10 lobby briefing. Q: What happens if the Northern Ireland assembly wants to stop accepting EU rules? And what is the solution on VAT? On VAT, Barnier says an agreement was reached overnight. There was an issue with the need for consistency on VAT rates. A mechanism to ensure this was agreed. The EU system would apply in Northern Ireland. For businesses, it is logical to have consistency, as with the single market for goods. On consent, he says the new protocol would be supported democratically. At the end of the transition period there would be a four-year period for the new arrangements to be in force. At the end of that the members of the Northern Ireland assembly would vote, on the basis of a simple majority, for the arrangement to continue for another four years. If there were a cross-community vote in favour, it would continue for eight years. If there were a vote to end the arrangements, there would be a two-year cooling off period. He says this new approach has nothing to do with the old backstop. It sets up a system in Northern Ireland that is sustainable. It is linked to regular, democratic verification. There is ownership of this in Northern Ireland. We now must place our trust in the system, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: The UK authorities will be able to apply their own tariffs, as long as there is no risk of goods entering the single market. How will that be established? Barnier says there is a possibility that goods arriving from GB, or from a third country via GB, might not stay in the customs territory of NI. That risk exists. That is why both sides have come up with a mechanism to assess this risk. The assessment will be based on a number of criteria, overseen by a joint committee. What is the destination of the goods? Are they consumer goods or industrial goods? What is the value of the goods? What is the risk of an infringement? Q: What was key turning point in the last week? Barnier says the taoiseach had a special responsibility. The Irish government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement. He met Boris Johnson in Liverpool. And after that meeting the UK and the EU were able to make headway. They agreed there would be no customs checks in Ireland or Northern Ireland. He says this new solution must be sustainable. Q: If this does not get through parliament, is this as far as the EU goes? Barnier says that is a hypothetical question. He says Boris Johnson thinks it will pass. He says he has always avoided talking on the basis of emotion and passion. He works on the basis of fact and objectivity. He has looked for practical solutions to the problems posed by Brexit. He says in Northern Ireland a joint committee will have a mandate. This is a balanced agreement, he says. He says it is \u201cthe best possible one\u201d. The backstop has been replaced with a new approach. This justifies the consent procedure, he says. He says this is a dynamic compromise between the UK and the EU. Q: Did you get an assurance that Johnson would get a majority for this? Barnier says, when Boris Johnson spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker this morning, he presumes Johnson had faith in his ability to get a majority. He has said he has confidence in his ability to win the vote. Boris Johnson has said he is confident he can get his deal through parliament, says Barnier. Q: MPs have voted against a deal three times. Has Boris Johnson assured you he can get this through? Barnier says he has some experience here. That is why is is being \u201ccautious\u201d. The House of Commons will have to take its decision. Barnier says he was an MP. He knows what it means to be a parliamentarian. He says the agreement is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d, to use Boris Johnson\u2019s words. (See 10.36am.) He says has never wanted to give a commentary on British political debate. Q: Can the deal be ratified at this summit? Or will there need to be another one? Barnier says there will be \u201cno ratification at the council\u201d today. The council will be able to give a favourable opinion on the recommendation, and on the draft agreement. It is a draft, he stresses. He says the council has to formally agree the agreement after the European parliament has ratified it. He says there should be \u201cno surprises\u201d here. He says he has done what he has done to ensure member states are well informed. He says he believes it can be ratified by 31 October. Barnier says the text of the agreement is now available. It is here (pdf) - all 64 pages of it. These are the revisions to the withdrawal agreement. The rest of the agreement as negotiated by Theresa May still stands. Barnier switches to speaking in English (he was speaking in French) and turns to the one aspect of the agreement the UK wanted to reopen \u2013 the backstop. He says the EU wanted to keep the border open, preserve the all-island economy and protect the integrity of the single market. And it was important for Boris Johnson to keep NI in the UK customs territory. He says the talks have \u201cat times been difficult\u201d. But they have a deal, with four parts. First, EU regulations will apply to all goods in Northern Ireland. This means checks at the border. Second, NI will remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory. It will therefore benefit from UK trade policy. But it will remain an entry point into the single market. So UK authorities will apply UK tariffs to countries coming from third countries as long as goods entering NI are not at risk of entering the single market. If they are at risk of entering the single market, EU tariffs will apply. Third, on VAT, the plan will maintain the integrity of the single market, while respecting the UK\u2019s digital wishes. And, fourth, there will be a consent mechanism. Four years after the arrangements starts, the Northern Ireland assembly will decide by a simple majority if these arrangements stay. Barnier confirms that the DUP will lose its veto on whether the new arrangements come into force. Under the plan proposed by Boris Johnson earlier this month, the new plan for NI would only have taken affect subject to a vote in the assembly \u2013 which the DUP would have been able to veto. Barnier says the transition will last until the end of 2020. But it could last another year or two years, if there is joint agreement. Barnier says citizens have always been, and will remain, the EU\u2019s priority. Uncertainty for them has been going on for too long, he says. There is also certainty for groups getting funding from the EU budget. That is because financial commitments made by the EU28 will be honoured by the EU28. He says there is more certainty for businesses. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is holding a press conference now. He says the EU has built its position together. The agreement has been agreed. Boris Johnson will present it to the EU27 later at the summit. He says the text should provide \u201clegal certainty\u201d, especially for citizens. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has issued this statement about the UK-EU Brexit deal. He said: From what we know, it seems the prime minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected. These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations. This sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby Yesterday my colleagues Kate Proctor and Rowena Mason looked at Boris Johnson\u2019s chances of getting his Brexit deal through the Commons. The numbers make it look difficult. But the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth explains how Johnson significantly boost his chances of winning. Here are extracts from the letter from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, to Donald Tusk, president of the European council. (See 10.38am.) As regards the withdrawal agreement itself, negotiations focused on the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland [ie, the backstop] and sought to identify a mutually satisfactory solution to address the specific circumstances on the island of Ireland. The negotiators also discussed the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Their aim was to adjust the political declaration in a way that reflects the different level of ambition now sought by the government of the United Kingdom for the country\u2019s future relationship with the European Union ... I believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process and move on, as swiftly as possible, to the negotiation on the European Union\u2019s future partnership with the United Kingdom. The pound has just surged through $1.29 against the US dollar, hitting a new five-month high. Shares in UK housebuilders and banks are also rallying, as investors welcome the news that a Brexit deal has been agreed. From Sky\u2019s David Blevins That is a reference to the statement issued this morning. See 8.26am. And Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has also confirmed that a deal has been agreed. He has posted this on Twitter. This is from Boris Johnson. From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly The Brussels press pack are all picking up the same message. From the Times\u2019 Brussels correspondent Bruno Waterfield. From the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent James Crisp From my colleague Jennifer Rankin From my colleague Daniel Boffey The Jacob Rees-Mogg business statement will now start after 11am (see 10.05am) because there is an urgent question for age verification for pornographic websites first. It is hard to be sure what will happen in Brussels today, because there seems to be considerable uncertainty as to how the day will play out. But here is the schedule for Brexit-related events in London and Brussels as things stand now. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, makes a business statement in the Commons. After 11.30am: MPs debate the motion for the Commons to sit on Saturday. They will also consider an amendment to it tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin designed to stop the government limiting voting on amendments on the Saturday. From 12.30pm: EU leaders start arriving for the EU summit in Brussels. 2.30pm: The summit starts. Brexit is expected to be the first item on the agenda. 3.15pm: David Sassoli, president of the European parliament, is due to hold a press conference. Around 6pm: Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, are expected to hold a press conference. These are from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly in Brussels. As a columnist on the Daily Telegraph Boris Johnson was notorious for always filing his column at the very last moment - often beyond what he had been told was the final deadline. It now seems that the EU is getting much the same treatment. This is from Sam McBride, political editor of the News Letter in Belfast on the DUP statement. (See 8.26am.) More from my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels These are from the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent James Crisp. From my colleague Daniel Boffey From Reuters On the Today programme Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has confirmed that Labour would push for a referendum on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. This should not be a surprise - Jeremy Corbyn has been saying for some time that if the country is facing either a no-deal Brexit or what he terms a damaging Tory Brexit, there should be a referendum \u2013 but in recent days there has been some uncertainty about what the party would do, because it also wants a general election ahead of a referendum. But Lloyd said the party would back moves to subject Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum. He said: If there is a majority for that deal, and if in turn there is an amendment moved, and that\u2019s put to a confirmatory vote, a public vote, then, consistent with what Labour is saying that any deal ought to go back to the public, then we are almost bound to vote for that amendment ... It would be very hard for us to support a deal [along the lines proposed by Johnson, with employment rights in the UK potentially falling behind EU standards]. Labour doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a blocking minority in parliament. And on that basis if Prime Minister Johnson is able to push through a deal, even a deal that we don\u2019t like, if an amendment were moved to subject that to the test of public opinion, that would be the right thing to do. With Labour backing a plan to put Johnson\u2019s deal to a referendum, it is possible, although not yet certain, that such an amendment could pass. But what would happen then? It is almost impossible to imagine circumstances in which the government would agree to put the proposal to a referendum. Inside No 10, a no-deal Brexit is seen as preferable to a second referendum. And legislating for a referendum, and then having a campaign, would probably take several months. This suggests that, for any referendum on Johnson\u2019s plan to actually happen, opposition MPs would have to vote for some sort of interim government to replace Johnson\u2019s. This is from Mina Andreeva, the European commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman. Speaking to the German parliament this morning, Angela Merkel, the chancellor, said she did not know whether the EU summit would conclude with a Brexit deal. But Europe would never allow violence to return to Ireland, she said. She told her MPs: There has been movement in recent days, significant movement ... so we are on a better path than before but, today I must say very clearly, we have not reached the goal yet. So I cannot say today how the European council will end tomorrow. But I can say that we will not allow hate and violence to flare up on the island of Ireland again. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has arrived at 10 Downing Street, and did not respond to questions about securing an exit deal, the Press Association reports. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Nadeem Badshah. Here is the full text of the DUP statement issued earlier. It was sent out as a statement from Arlene Foster, the party leader, and Nigel Dodds, her deputy. They said: We have been involved in ongoing discussions with the government. As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT. We will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said we knew the negotiations were going to be difficult and would go down to the line, but the government is \u201cworking very intensively... to try and secure a deal\u201d. Asked whether the prime minister would meet with the DUP today, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: I don\u2019t know the exact arrangements for the next few hours, but be assured the prime minister and his team are in intensive negotiations with all parties, including with the DUP. We want to provide sufficient comfort for the DUP and unionists in Northern Ireland to feel that the arrangements we would put in place with this deal are sufficient to give them comfort to support it. We know there are clearly concerns on the part of the DUP and we want to try and work through these productively in the hours to come. All sides in this do want to secure an orderly exit from the EU, and I think one is in sight, although there is clearly very significant issues to be hammered out. Let\u2019s wait and see. More from Tom the painter in Athens \u201cIn the beginning there was Boris, then there was God. Gen II\u201d: Not long after Greece\u2019s own eurozone drama, graffiti appears in Athens, in the Plaka district beneath the Acropolis, immortalising the man who might save Britain from Brexit - described as a one-way street in the second picture. Greece, which adopted punishing austerity to remain in the eurozone (and by extension the EU) has been watching the Brexit drama with thinly-veiled dismay. The Guardian\u2019s Greek correspondent Helena Smith can reveal that Tom, the painter of these works of art, is an Irishman who has long lived in the Plaka district. The DUP\u2019s statement makes clear the party cannot support the deal as it stands, but it is not closing the door completely so could be read as a final prod to Michel Barnier to compromise on the customs arrangements, consent and give more clarity on the very tricky issue of VAT. Three routes open up from this: 1. Boris Johnson compromises more. However with three meetings in three days in Downing Street, it is unclear whether Downing Street can cede any more and ruins the prospect of a deal. 2. The EU yields to the DUP\u2019s demands. Given the EU\u2019s deep concern about how it can protect the single market from rogue goods on a border, with no border checks, it is difficult to see the EU cede further on customs. 3. The DUP folds at the last minute. Note its statement: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom\u201d. This is leaving the door open to further changes today. It is worth remembering that the DUP is the party that says no. \u201cNo surrender\u201d was its slogan in its heyday when it was led by its bombastic founder, the now deceased Ian Paisley. It is also worth remembering that it did not support the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in 1998. And we know what happened there. The pound fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar and the euro within minutes of the announcement by the DUP just before 7am that the party cannot support the Brexit deal as it currently stands. A pound was worth 1.2759 dollars and 1.1525 euros. If you are wondering what exactly is in the deal, our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin got a briefing last night. There is a potentially pivotal day ahead with the EU summit ahead of Saturday\u2019s deadline to prevent a delay to Brexit. Boris Johnson is on his way to Brussels this morning. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll on the DUP\u2019s decision. Good morning everyone. More reaction to the DUP\u2019s statement. That\u2019s it from me, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah. The DUP has issued a statement from Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds saying that \u201cas things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d For those of you who missed this, late last night Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, announced she was leaving the Labour Party because she could \u201cno longer advocate voting Labour when it risks Corbyn becoming PM\u201d. Dame Louise, 73, who is Jewish, said she had been \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the \u201cgrowth of anti-Semitism\u201d in Labour in recent years. She told the Times newspaper that if he became prime minister \u201cI believe that Jeremy Corbyn would be a danger to the country, a danger to the Jewish community as well, but a danger to the country too\u201d. Lord Adonis is up and tweeting early, as he often does. He is reiterating his view that Johnson will end up being forced to ask the EU for an extension beyond 31 October. How the papers covered it A photograph of Boris Johnson walking behind a metal fence, which gives the unfortunate impression that the prime minster was behind bars, provided a visual metaphor too good for most publications to pass up and it is the lead image on most of the front pages. The Telegraph really pushes the image, its slightly baffling headline is: \u201cBrexit is like the Shawshank Redemption... but now we can see the light\u201d. The Daily Express has: \u201cAgainst all odds, Boris closes in on Brexit deal\u201d, the Times reports: \u201cBrexit deal on knife edge as DUP blocks Johnson\u201d, the Mail says: \u201cIn sight of the summit\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cJohnson in last-minute scramble for DUP backing\u201d, the Mirror goes with: \u201cBrexit on a knife-edge\u201d, the i\u2019s splash is: \u201cDeadlock on Brexit deal ahead of summit\u201d. Boris Johnson is in a race against time to secure the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s backing for his newly negotiated Brexit deal as EU leaders said they were ready to approve the agreement on Thursday if the prime minister succeeds. Plans to publish a full legal text ahead of the leaders\u2019 summit had to be put on hold to the frustration of EU officials after the DUP raised a series of objections to the tentative agreement. With time short, Johnson told a meeting of Conservative MPs he was hopeful of a deal but it felt like he was on the Hillary Step of Mount Everest while the summit was \u201cshrouded in mist\u201d. The prime minister appeared to have the party\u2019s hardline Eurosceptics onboard, including Steve Baker, who said Johnson had briefed them that the whole of the UK was leaving the customs union. But they also added a note of caution that they could not vote for any Brexit deal without seeing a legal text. The 21 former Tory MPs who have recently lost their whip could also rebel. An issue over VAT was said by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, to be a last-minute obstacle in the negotiations when he briefed European ambassadors on Wednesday night. But the British objection was described by EU diplomats as a \u201cBritish smokescreen\u201d to give Downing Street more time to win over the DUP\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster. Good (very early!) morning to everyone. We\u2019re up with the sparrows because there is talk that Boris Johnson might make an early-morning dash to Brussels to get his Brexit deal done. This would require the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, who have raised serious concerns with the deal. But, if the DUP come around and agree to support the deal, Johnson can then take it back to EU leaders who are meeting in Brussels today, who have said they will give political agreement to it during their summit. They will still need to have the text scrutinised before giving formal approval and it also remains to be seen whether the UK parliament will agree to the deal on Saturday, when they are sitting to vote on the potential deal. No one knows what will happen and we\u2019ve all been round the Brexit deal merry-go-round more times we care to remember, but there\u2019s a sense that today could be a BIG MOMENT in this journey. I will be shepherding us all through the Brexit news for the first few hours before I hand over to my colleagues, who will take you through the rest of the day.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic Unionist party is reeling from accusations it was duped and betrayed by Downing Street over a Brexit deal that weakens Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK. Rival unionists on Thursday said the DUP had committed a catastrophic miscalculation in trusting Boris Johnson, potentially putting Northern Ireland on a path towards a united Ireland. The DUP also risked isolation at Westminster where some Conservative Brexiters, who previously pledged solidarity with the DUP, signalled they would ignore the party\u2019s opposition and vote for the deal in a Commons vote on Saturday. It was a vertiginous fall to earth for a regional party that until recently boasted of unprecedented influence, its clout extending from Belfast to London and Brussels. Robin Swann, leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said DUP blunders had paved the way to Northern Ireland being left on the \u201cwindow ledge\u201d of the union. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace ... this deal is worse than the one Theresa May brought forward at Chequers. It\u2019s awful. It would put a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea and annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.\u201d Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, called the deal \u2013 welcomed by the Irish government and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 a disaster that would put Northern Ireland in the Republic of Ireland\u2019s economic orbit, ensuring the union \u201cslowly bleeds to death\u201d. \u201cThe inescapable reality is that a permanent regulatory and customs border cutting us off from GB puts us in a waiting room for Irish unity with the door locked from the outside.\u201d Many farmers and business owners, in contrast, welcomed a deal that would keep trade flowing and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cWhat is good is that a deal is struck, we can move on to the more positive conversation about the future relationship and, regardless, Northern Ireland can continue to have tariff-free, quota-free access to both the UK and the EU\u2019s single market,\u201d said the Manufacturing Northern Ireland chief executive, Stephen Kelly. They are relieved they have certainty as the new arrangements will mean the same trading environment for four years beyond the transition period. Stormont then gets to vote, and if the new regime is popular and can command 60% support \u2013 with at least 40% each of the nationalist and unionist votes \u2013 it will be rolled over for another eight years, a protracted EU alignment that is anathema to the DUP. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC that he felt the Benn act preventing no deal had pushed Boris Johnson \u201cinto desperate measures\u201d. Dodds said: \u201cHe has been too eager by far to get a deal at any cost, and the fact of the matter is, if he held his nerve and held out he would, of course, have got better concessions that kept the integrity, both economic and constitutionally, of the United Kingdom.\u201d Under Johnson\u2019s deal, Northern Ireland would legally remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory but stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods. The EU\u2019s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. Under a complicated consent mechanism, four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would vote on maintaining the arrangements. Crucially, the DUP would have no veto. The DUP rejected the deal and vowed to vote against it, saying it would undermine the integrity of the union and drive \u201ca coach and horses\u201d through the Good Friday agreement\u2019s consent mechanism. Once the details became clear DUP leaders pivoted towards a campaign to retain their base, said one source. \u201cShouting traitor from the green benches might suit them.\u201d Some Brexiters will blame the party if the deal falters in the Commons, further straining relations between Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists and English Conservatives. Rival unionists said DUP hubris led to the deal. A year ago the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, boasted of its unprecedented influence at Westminster \u2013 where its 10 MPs propped up the government \u2013 and garlanded Johnson at its party conference. Johnson said Northern Ireland should be treated no differently from the rest of the UK. Two weeks ago Johnson, under pressure for a deal with Brussels, persuaded his allies to accept some regulatory alignment with the EU, necessitating checks in the Irish Sea. That concession \u2013 a DUP recognition that farmers and business owners feared a no-deal hit on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy \u2013 facilitated Downing Street stretching the measure to clinch a deal with Brussels, said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and co-author of a book about the DUP. \u201cThey\u2019ve been completely stitched up by Boris Johnson. He reversed on all that he promised them. This deal gives the EU and Irish government huge economic leverage over Northern Ireland.\u201d Tonge called the consent mechanism a fantasy given Stormont\u2019s dysfunction \u2013 it has been mothballed since power sharing collapsed in January 2017. The anti-abortion DUP may receive another humiliation on Monday when abortion rights are due to be extended to Northern Ireland, the result of a vote by Labour and Conservative MPs at Westminster earlier this year. The Stormont assembly is due to sit on Monday for the first time since devolution collapsed after more than 30 members backed a recall petition to debate the law. Analysts said it was unlikely they could stop the law taking effect.",

The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.</p>\n    <p>The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p><b>Interactive: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/sep/02/a-typical-hour-in-the-life-of-the-irish-border\">A typical hour in the life of the Irish border</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked whether the agreement was the final possible deal for the EU, he declined to comment.</p> \n<p>Under the agreement, Barnier said, Northern Ireland would stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and the EU\u2019s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis means that all applicable procedures on goods will take place at points on entry into Northern Ireland and not across the island,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> would legally remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory, to allow the prime minister to boast the country \u201cwhole and entire\u201d had left the EU.</p> \n<p>Barnier said: \u201cIt will therefore benefit from the UK future trade policy. But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into our single market. So what have we done to square this circle? UK authorities can apply UK tariffs on products coming from third countries as long as those goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk of entering our single market.

      "bodyText": "EU leaders have left open the option of extending Brexit beyond 31 October if the new deal is voted down by the Commons, in a blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy. The prime minister had been seeking to pitch Saturday\u2019s vote in the Commons as a choice between deal or no deal after coming to an agreement with the EU. Johnson was helped by comments from Jean-Claude Juncker casting doubt on the possibility of a further Brexit delay, but the heads of state and government did not follow the European commission president\u2019s lead. A summit communique issued after two hours of discussion tasked the commission and European parliament with taking \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure that the agreement can enter into force on November 1\u201d. But a senior EU official said that the leaders would follow events on Saturday, and reflect on the next steps if they were in a \u201cdifferent situation\u201d. A second diplomatic source said they had chosen not to interfere in a \u201csensitive domestic debate \u2026 but they leave the door open to the possibility of an extension, to be discussed at a later stage \u2013 if required\u201d. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council who will provide guidance on the options in the event of another rejection of a deal, said the issue of an extension was for a later date. \u201cOur intention is to work towards ratification. We support a deal and this was a clear decision of the 27 member states. And we prepared for this ratification, politically logistically, technically\u201d, Tusk said. \u201cNow the ball is in the court of the UK. I have no idea what will be the result of the debate in the House of Commons on Saturday. It isn\u2019t for me to comment on political developments in the UK. But if there is a request for an extension, I will consult member states to see how they react.\u201d Johnson is facing an uphill battle to build a majority after the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party rejected the revised deal, describing it as driving \u201ca coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement\u201d. Juncker had tried to help sell the deal by pouring doubt on a further Brexit extension in the event of it being rejected. He told reporters he was \u201cruling out\u201d a prolongation, but the issue is solely the remit of the EU heads of state and government. \u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation,\u201d he added No other EU leader expressed the same view. One senior EU official told the Guardian of Juncker\u2019s intervention: \u201cIt is fake news.\u201d Agreement on the new deal was struck in a phone call between Juncker and Johnson at 11.10am London time. During a later joint appearance they called on the Commons to pass the deal so that negotiations could move on to the terms of the trading relationship. Johnson said: \u201cI hope very much \u2026 that my fellow MPs in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done, to get this excellent deal over the line and to deliver Brexit without any more delay so that we can focus on the priorities of the British people.\u201d Juncker said the EU would ensure the UK was able to exit on 31 October if parliament gave its consent to the deal on its \u201csuper Saturday\u201d sitting this weekend. Johnson will have to win over a significant number of Labour MPs and some of the 21 former Conservatives who had the whip removed last month. As details of the new deal emerged, the DUP issued a statement attacking Downing Street\u2019s deal. \u201cIt is our view that these arrangements would not be in Northern Ireland\u2019s long-term interests,\u201d the party said. \u201cSaturday\u2019s vote in parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons.\u201d Soon after the agreement was announced, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also rejected it as worse than the deal produced by Johnson\u2019s predecessor in Downing Street Theresa May. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the prime minister had backed himself to win over a majority of MPs to support the deal during a phone call earlier in the day with Juncker \u2013 but he adopted a sceptical tone. \u201c[Boris Johnson] said, based on this agreement and the explanations he intends to give, he has the confidence to win that vote,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cThat is all I can say on that.\u201d Asked whether the agreement was the final possible deal for the EU, he declined to comment. Under the agreement, Barnier said, Northern Ireland would stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods and the EU\u2019s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. \u201cThis means that all applicable procedures on goods will take place at points on entry into Northern Ireland and not across the island,\u201d he said. But Northern Ireland would legally remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory, to allow the prime minister to boast the country \u201cwhole and entire\u201d had left the EU. Barnier said: \u201cIt will therefore benefit from the UK future trade policy. But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into our single market. So what have we done to square this circle? UK authorities can apply UK tariffs on products coming from third countries as long as those goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk of entering our single market. However, for goods at risk of entering the single market the UK authorities will apply the EU tariffs.\u201d Businesses in Northern Ireland will be able to apply for rebates if the UK has lower tariff rates on goods imported from outside the EU. The new Irish protocol also includes a last-minute compromise on VAT, after negotiators worked through the night to resolve this final sticking point. The UK has now conceded that Northern Ireland will follow EU rules on VAT, although the UK will remain responsible for collecting VAT and enforcement action. A joint committee of EU and UK officials will oversee how the system works. Under a complicated consent mechanism, four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would vote on maintaining the arrangements. The assembly would have to decide whether to vote by a simple majority or under a vote in which 40% of both nationalist and unionist assembly members would be required to give their assent. A 60% threshold of all members would need to be passed in that case. If Stormont was not sitting, the status quo would continue. There would be another opportunity four years later to give consent if they voted by simple majority, and eight years later if they took the cross-party route. A two-year notice period would be granted if Northern Ireland exited the special relationship with the EU to allow alternative arrangements to be put in place. \u201cThis democratic support is a cornerstone of our newly agreed approach,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cWhy? Because this newly agreed protocol is no longer to be replaced by a subsequent agreement between the EU and the UK.\u201d Barnier said Johnson had agreed the political declaration would maintain British commitments to fair competition. The prime minister had agreed this was the quid pro quo for a free-trade agreement which would seek to keep trade between the UK and the EU free of tariffs and quotas. The EU negotiator said the British government was seeking a looser relationship to the bloc and \u201cthe option of creating a single customs territory between us has been discarded\u201d.",

These kinds of big numbers get media attention and help drive a narrative, particularly when they come from an establishment organisation such as the CBI. But by presenting an unbalanced view it has lost out on an opportunity for genuinely useful public debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/northern-rail-should-be-renationalised-says-grant-shapps-transport-secretary\">Northern rail could be renationalised, says transport secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The organisation, which lobbies on behalf of British business, has already been forced by Labour to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/cbi-admits-error-in-196bn-price-tag-for-labour-plans\" title=\"\">admit its mistake</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-apology-cbi-renationalising-railway-programme-mcdonald-a9158021.html\" title=\"\">analysis assumed</a> that a Labour government would purchase the rail industry\u2019s rolling stock \u2013 trains that are privately held and leased to rail operating companies \u2013 even though this is not party policy. While this mistake is important, as it has misled the public, its effect on the overall figure is likely to be relatively small. </p> <p>There are far bigger problems with the CBI\u2019s analysis. For example, in calculating how much the government would pay for the companies operating in the industries it plans to nationalise, the CBI applied a 30% mark-up to the firms\u2019 asset values. This is based on \u201cevidence of historical takeovers which shows that utility companies have typically fetched a price above the asset value\u201d. Yet this higher price reflects that, as essential services, they effectively enjoy a guarantee from government, as well as the value of economic rents that can be generated in monopolistic industries. This would not be a fair price. There is no reason why the government would pay for its own guarantee \u2013 nor should it pay for the rent extraction that nationalisation seeks to stop.</p> <p>Even more fundamentally, the analysis only assesses the costs of nationalisation, rather than the potential benefits. It does not take into account income that would be generated by the companies brought back into public ownership \u2013 from ticket sales or energy and water bills, for instance. While the CBI was happy to reference future costs, including maintenance, running costs and investments, it hadn\u2019t considered the asset side of the balance sheet.</p> <p>That\u2019s a shame, because a genuine debate on public and private ownership would be welcome. There are legitimate questions about which industries and companies should be publicly owned, which ones should be in private hands and indeed whether alternative models such as community or cooperative ownership would deliver better outcomes. Those questions should consider not just the cost to government but also who benefits and loses in society from different ownership models \u2013 both financially and in terms of who has control over the economy. They should consider who will best manage services that we all rely on and ensure sufficient investment for the future. They should also consider assets as well as liabilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b036151f520b47d826a0f3490d338a8efd5ec10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b036151f520b47d826a0f3490d338a8efd5ec10/0_179_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"confederation of british industry logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The business membership organisation, which lobbies on behalf of British business, has already been forced by Labour to admit its mistake.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not just the CBI that fails to do this. The UK government\u2019s \u201cpublic sector net debt\u201d target fails to count many income-generating assets that could pay for themselves. By including public corporations in this calculus, a large bias against public ownership is built in. If Germany had taken the same approach, in 2015 its general government gross debt would have been more than <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/iipp_wp_2017-05_patient_strategic_finance-_opportunities_for_state_investment_banks_in_the_uk.pdf\" title=\"\">2.5 times higher</a>, at 181% of GDP. Thankfully, our national accounting rules are increasingly being called into question, with suggestions that the government should instead target public sector net worth to assess both sides of the balance sheet \u2013 as any private investor would.</p> <p>The CBI is upfront about omitting the potential benefits of nationalisation. But if it wishes to be considered a trustworthy and fair voice in our public debate, that simply isn\u2019t good enough. Voters cannot be expected to dig into the details and check how the big figures are calculated. Even if they wanted to, they would not be able to fully assess the CBI\u2019s claims. Worryingly, the group has said its members \u201cdo not feel comfortable\u201d explaining how they got to the total of \u00a3196bn. </p> <p>As the parties gear up for a potential general election, there will be many more claims and counter-claims to come. The business lobby group\u2019s eagerness to produce news splashes on Labour\u2019s policy plans suggests it believes it could be a close outcome. But rather than publishing partial analyses, the CBI should focus on the real questions at hand.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to unite nationalisation advocates and sceptics. But the Confederation of British Industry has managed to do just that, getting into hot water this week with an unsubstantiated claim that the Labour party\u2019s plans to renationalise utilities would cost \u00a3196bn. These kinds of big numbers get media attention and help drive a narrative, particularly when they come from an establishment organisation such as the CBI. But by presenting an unbalanced view it has lost out on an opportunity for genuinely useful public debate. The organisation, which lobbies on behalf of British business, has already been forced by Labour to admit its mistake. The analysis assumed that a Labour government would purchase the rail industry\u2019s rolling stock \u2013 trains that are privately held and leased to rail operating companies \u2013 even though this is not party policy. While this mistake is important, as it has misled the public, its effect on the overall figure is likely to be relatively small. There are far bigger problems with the CBI\u2019s analysis. For example, in calculating how much the government would pay for the companies operating in the industries it plans to nationalise, the CBI applied a 30% mark-up to the firms\u2019 asset values. This is based on \u201cevidence of historical takeovers which shows that utility companies have typically fetched a price above the asset value\u201d. Yet this higher price reflects that, as essential services, they effectively enjoy a guarantee from government, as well as the value of economic rents that can be generated in monopolistic industries. This would not be a fair price. There is no reason why the government would pay for its own guarantee \u2013 nor should it pay for the rent extraction that nationalisation seeks to stop. Even more fundamentally, the analysis only assesses the costs of nationalisation, rather than the potential benefits. It does not take into account income that would be generated by the companies brought back into public ownership \u2013 from ticket sales or energy and water bills, for instance. While the CBI was happy to reference future costs, including maintenance, running costs and investments, it hadn\u2019t considered the asset side of the balance sheet. That\u2019s a shame, because a genuine debate on public and private ownership would be welcome. There are legitimate questions about which industries and companies should be publicly owned, which ones should be in private hands and indeed whether alternative models such as community or cooperative ownership would deliver better outcomes. Those questions should consider not just the cost to government but also who benefits and loses in society from different ownership models \u2013 both financially and in terms of who has control over the economy. They should consider who will best manage services that we all rely on and ensure sufficient investment for the future. They should also consider assets as well as liabilities. It is not just the CBI that fails to do this. The UK government\u2019s \u201cpublic sector net debt\u201d target fails to count many income-generating assets that could pay for themselves. By including public corporations in this calculus, a large bias against public ownership is built in. If Germany had taken the same approach, in 2015 its general government gross debt would have been more than 2.5 times higher, at 181% of GDP. Thankfully, our national accounting rules are increasingly being called into question, with suggestions that the government should instead target public sector net worth to assess both sides of the balance sheet \u2013 as any private investor would. The CBI is upfront about omitting the potential benefits of nationalisation. But if it wishes to be considered a trustworthy and fair voice in our public debate, that simply isn\u2019t good enough. Voters cannot be expected to dig into the details and check how the big figures are calculated. Even if they wanted to, they would not be able to fully assess the CBI\u2019s claims. Worryingly, the group has said its members \u201cdo not feel comfortable\u201d explaining how they got to the total of \u00a3196bn. As the parties gear up for a potential general election, there will be many more claims and counter-claims to come. The business lobby group\u2019s eagerness to produce news splashes on Labour\u2019s policy plans suggests it believes it could be a close outcome. But rather than publishing partial analyses, the CBI should focus on the real questions at hand. With trust in business reaching record lows in the past few years, interventions such as this will do little for the strained relationship between it and the rest of society. \u2022 Carys Roberts is chief economist and head of the Centre for Economic Justice at the Institute for Public Policy Research",
