This is famously about the most abrasive audience in current affairs TV and all four leaders faced harsh questions, although Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, almost certainly fared worst. Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, probably had the best night. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd83dda8f087b800b61f71b#block-5dd83dda8f087b800b61f71b\">8.07pm.) </a>Corbyn had some humbling moments (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd8375f8f087b800b61f6f2#block-5dd8375f8f087b800b61f6f2\"> 7.38pm)</a>, and Johnson more so (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd84c148f083aa6d5789783#block-5dd84c148f083aa6d5789783\\\">9.25pm)</a>, but they both avoided disasters, and the most significant moment came when Corbyn announced - apparently, intentionally - that he would not take sides in a second independence referendum. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One, we negotiate a credible deal with the European Union. Secondly, we will put that, alongside remain in a referendum. My role, and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere, and we will abide by the result of it.</p> \n   <p>And I will adopt as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring out communities and country together, rather than continuing in endless debate about the EU and Brexit. This will be a trade deal with Europe, or remaining in the EU. That will be the choice that we put before the British public within six months.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn\u2019s new stance (which was not unexpected) means that he will no longer be criticised for refusing to answer questions about which side he would back in a referendum. But it means he risks losing more support from remainers, and Johnson claimed that Corbyn\u2019s chances of negotiating a Brexit deal with the EU would be diminished if Brussels knew he would not be willing to campaign for it. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd844e48f080fd59fb15a29#block-5dd844e48f080fd59fb15a29\">8.33pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sturgeon has argued that in practice a minority Labour government dependent on SNP support would agree to hold a second independence referendum - despite Corbyn saying on tonight\u2019s programme he would not allow this in the first two years of a Labour government.</strong> Sturgeon said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Do you think [Corbyn\u2019s] going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop universal credit, simply because he wants for a couple of years to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination? I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has refused to apologise for using racist and homophobic language in his newspaper columns in the past.</strong> When a questioner put it to him that he had contributed to \u201cracist rhetoric\u201d, Johnson replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have written many millions of words in my life as a journalist and I have ... genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody and that is my intention.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson said the questioner was referring to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/boris-johnson-cleared-over-burqa-comments\">article he wrote last year saying women wearing the burqa looked liked letter boxes. </a>But <strong>Fiona Bruce,</strong> the presenter, said that there were several Johnson articles that have caused offence. She told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To be fair, there\u2019s a few articles. So there\u2019s the Muslims going around looking like letterboxes, which was last year, you referred to tribal warriors with watermelon smiles and flag-waving pickaninnies and then just to get another demographic in, tank-topped bum boys.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson refused to apologise. Instead he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course I understand that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson dismissed criticism of his decision to delay the report from the intelligence and security committee into Russian interference in elections as \u201ccomplete Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. </strong>Asked why he would not publish it before the election, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is absolutely no evidence that I know of to show any interference in any British electoral event ... And the reason I won\u2019t [publish it now] is I see no reason, or if I decided not to ages ago, is because I see no reason to interfere with the normal timetable... just because an election is going on.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-22T22:50:15.716Z\">at 10.50pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd85dce8f083aa6d57897ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-22T22:15:17.353Z\">10.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart </strong>and<strong> Peter Walker</strong>\u2019s story about the Question Time leaders\u2019 special.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-labour-neutral-second-brexit-vote\">Corbyn 'neutral' on Brexit as Johnson attacked on trust</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd85aca8f083aa6d57897d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-22T22:05:41.830Z\">10.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tories will be delighted by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comment about being neutral in a Brexit referendum, some journalists are claiming.</p> \n  <p>From the Times\u2019 <strong>Steven Swinford</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1197986806958047232\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cabinet ministers delighted with Jeremy Corbyn's neutral position on EU referendum tonight. <br><br>They feel it plays into their hands<br><br>'Corbyn refusing to admit which way he will vote is not going to wash<br><br>'It will be seen by voters as pitiful'</p>\u2014 Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1197986806958047232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 22, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>From the Spectator\u2019s<strong> James Forsyth</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1197994699937726465\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Corbyn making news tonight by saying he\u2019ll remain neutral in the second referendum he wants pushes both Brexit and leadership up the agenda, which isn\u2019t bad for the Tories</p>\u2014 James Forsyth (@JGForsyth) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1197994699937726465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 22, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>From the Sunday Times\u2019 <strong>Tim Shipman</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ShippersUnbound/status/1197997205505880065\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you'd asked Tory spinners what they most wanted from QT they'd have said: \"Corbyn to say something equivocal about Brexit in the first 10 minutes\".

The poll shows the Conservatives 13 points ahead. As the Economist points out <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/21/labour-is-losing-the-battle-for-grimsby\">in its write-up (paywall)</a>, constituency polling tends to be more unreliable than national polling (and national polls themselves have had a poor record of late).

They were all conducted in Labour-held, leave-voting seats in Wales (ie, the sort of seats where the Tories think they have the best chance of winning).</p> \n  <p>Among other things, Lord Ashcroft says his participants weren\u2019t impressed by Labour\u2019s plan for free, full-fibre broadband.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour\u2019s promise of free broadband for all had cut through to an unusual degree, albeit to what might charitably be called a mixed response. Many of these previous Labour voters thought it sounded like an odd sort of priority: \u201cI might nationalise certain essential things. But I\u2019m not desperately sure I would nationalise wifi\u201d; \u201cThere are people sleeping in cold homes, kids without warm clothes, families on the breadline. I just don\u2019t think this is top of the list\u201d; \u201cI work six days a week to provide my family with the necessities to live with. Broadband is a luxury, not a necessity. You have to work for it, you don\u2019t get given it. If you don\u2019t want to graft or pay your dues, that\u2019s cool, but don\u2019t expect to get it for free.\u201d</p> \n   <p>They also tended to see it as a transparent bribe, and not a particularly believable one: \u201cIt\u2019s trying to go after first-time voters, because for teenagers, wifi is everything. So for people who haven\u2019t looked into it and haven\u2019t paid taxes, if they\u2019re going to have something like that for free it\u2019s a vote winner\u201d; \u201cThe government is paying, so we are\u201d; \u201cIt would be like two megabytes a second, then you have to upgrade\u201d; \u201cNothing is going to be free. Is it unlimited? It will be something like, the broadband is free, but the router is \u00a35,000. They\u2019re going to make the money back somehow\u201d; \u201cNext they\u2019re going to promise you three years of Greggs or something.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Some also worried about what state-run broadband would actually be like: \u201cSlow. Unreliable\u201d; \u201cThey\u2019d be able to listen down every Alexa in every house\u201d; \u201cIt screams \u2018state-owned internet\u2019 to me. It\u2019s not going to be North Korea, but it does scream \u2018control\u2019\u201d; \u201cIt would be like Big Brother, with all your personal details and social media profiles and everything else. Would you want that in a government-owned business?\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Focus groups normally only comprise a dozen or so people and, without knowing how participants have been selected, it is hard to know how representative they are.

But his overall verdict on the manifesto is balanced and judicious. Here is an extract from his conclusion.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto is simply huge in the changes it proposes. Individually many are not out of line with other northern European countries. But taken together, they are a big step change from the plans Labour proposed just two years ago and more radical than anything we\u2019ve seen in the UK for a generation (Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1979 manifesto proposed far fewer changes). That is clearest when considering the proposed increase in the size of the state. But it is true also on proposals for deep economic reform \u2013 from our labour market to corporate governance and a big increase in public ownership.</p> \n   <p>With high inequality and stagnant productivity, none of us should be satisfied with the status quo. Indeed, there are very strong reasons for thinking that an increase in the size of our state and reform of our economic model are priorities for Britain. But despite having quite so much in it, Labour\u2019s manifesto is lacking some crucial ingredients for any would-be government wanting to embark on that journey.</p> \n   <p>First, prioritisation among such a long list of promises would be key.</p> \n   <p>Second, for any economic reform of this kind to last, much broader coalitions for it would need to be built than Labour has currently been able to secure (in contrast, see for example what the New Zealand Labour party has been able to do on collective bargaining).</p> \n   <p>Third, more honesty about the difficulties involved would be needed. For example, such an agenda would have to involve much more of a focus on wealth taxes. And while more can be raised from the top, the reality is we will all need to pay higher taxes if we want a state the size of Germany\u2019s that delivers not just free social care but free broadband ...</p> \n   <p>Labour hopes its hugely radical programme will refocus the election campaign on domestic policy issues and away from Brexit alone. That may or may not happen, but what is certain is that if Labour forms the next government, the party is going to have one hell of a to-do list. And, as we all know, a long to-do list risks becoming something very different \u2013 a wish list.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-22T16:41:33.189Z\">at 4.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd7f5438f080fd59fb155d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-22T14:52:34.057Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This, from Labour\u2019s candidate in Tooting, <strong>Rosena Allin-Khan</strong>, must be one of the most creative campaign videos of the election.

Oborne has spent most of his career writing for the Tory press (he was a political columnist for the Daily Mail until recently, and he was political editor of the Spectator when Johnson himself was editor) but he is also something of an iconoclast and has become a fierce critic of his old boss\u2019s dishonesty. He helps to run a very good website, <a href=\"https://boris-johnson-lies.com/\">boris-johnson-lies.com,</a> cataloguing \u201cthe lies, falsehoods and misrepresentations of Boris Johnson and his government\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Oborne\u2019s Guardian article included this intriguing paragraph.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A big reason for Johnson\u2019s easy ride is partisanship from the parts of the media determined to get him elected.

Is that a reason for giving Johnson free rein to make any false claim he wants?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This claim caused some surprise. <strong>John Simpson</strong>, the veteran BBC world affairs editor, posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnSimpsonNews/status/1197090845721276416\">a tweet</a> saying he had never heard anyone at the BBC express this view.

Scottish councils already spend \u00a3120m a year on meals during the school year, after deducting payments by those able to pay, taking the putative year-round costs to \u00a3310m.</p> \n  <p><strong>Richard Leonard,</strong> Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It cannot be right that in the fifth biggest economy in the world, one in every four children in Scotland is living in poverty. After a decade of Tory austerity and SNP complacency, it is time for real and radical change.</p> \n   <p> But it\u2019s not enough to only provide free school meals to those on low incomes. We need a plan that tackles the stigma that can prevent some children accessing free meals and the barriers that we know eligibility and registration create.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Leonard said the funding would be provided by a UK Labour government\u2019s massive expansion in state spending, neatly highlighting a paradox about the general election in Scotland. Like the vast majority of domestic policy areas, education policy and local government funding are entirely devolved to Holyrood.</p> \n  <p> The domestic policy battles being fought by Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, say over NHS funding or policing or social care, have little direct relevance to Scottish parties. And Leonard\u2019s school meals policy requires Labour to win two successive elections: firstly on 12 December for Westminster and then in May 2021 for the Scottish parliament.</p> \n  <p>Opinion polls for the Westminster election are unfavourable for Labour but downright hostile at Holyrood level. A recent YouGov poll put Labour at 12% in Scotland \u2013 that is the lowest ever, and may well be an outlier, but the party is running third in nearly all polls, while Leonard is little known to voters.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has announced that he would take a \u201cneutral\u201d stance in the second referendum on Brexit being planned by Labour. He made the announcement during a BBC\u2019s Question Time leaders\u2019 special, that saw Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson each spend half an hour being quizzed by the Question Time audience. This is famously about the most abrasive audience in current affairs TV and all four leaders faced harsh questions, although Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, almost certainly fared worst. Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, probably had the best night. (See 8.07pm.) Corbyn had some humbling moments (see 7.38pm), and Johnson more so (see 9.25pm), but they both avoided disasters, and the most significant moment came when Corbyn announced - apparently, intentionally - that he would not take sides in a second independence referendum. He said: One, we negotiate a credible deal with the European Union. Secondly, we will put that, alongside remain in a referendum. My role, and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere, and we will abide by the result of it. And I will adopt as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring out communities and country together, rather than continuing in endless debate about the EU and Brexit. This will be a trade deal with Europe, or remaining in the EU. That will be the choice that we put before the British public within six months. Corbyn\u2019s new stance (which was not unexpected) means that he will no longer be criticised for refusing to answer questions about which side he would back in a referendum. But it means he risks losing more support from remainers, and Johnson claimed that Corbyn\u2019s chances of negotiating a Brexit deal with the EU would be diminished if Brussels knew he would not be willing to campaign for it. (See 8.33pm.) Sturgeon has argued that in practice a minority Labour government dependent on SNP support would agree to hold a second independence referendum - despite Corbyn saying on tonight\u2019s programme he would not allow this in the first two years of a Labour government. Sturgeon said: Do you think [Corbyn\u2019s] going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop universal credit, simply because he wants for a couple of years to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination? I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue. Johnson has refused to apologise for using racist and homophobic language in his newspaper columns in the past. When a questioner put it to him that he had contributed to \u201cracist rhetoric\u201d, Johnson replied: I have written many millions of words in my life as a journalist and I have ... genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody and that is my intention. Johnson said the questioner was referring to an article he wrote last year saying women wearing the burqa looked liked letter boxes. But Fiona Bruce, the presenter, said that there were several Johnson articles that have caused offence. She told him: To be fair, there\u2019s a few articles. So there\u2019s the Muslims going around looking like letterboxes, which was last year, you referred to tribal warriors with watermelon smiles and flag-waving pickaninnies and then just to get another demographic in, tank-topped bum boys. Johnson refused to apologise. Instead he said: If you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course I understand that. Johnson dismissed criticism of his decision to delay the report from the intelligence and security committee into Russian interference in elections as \u201ccomplete Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. Asked why he would not publish it before the election, he replied: There is absolutely no evidence that I know of to show any interference in any British electoral event ... And the reason I won\u2019t [publish it now] is I see no reason, or if I decided not to ages ago, is because I see no reason to interfere with the normal timetable... just because an election is going on. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart and Peter Walker\u2019s story about the Question Time leaders\u2019 special. The Tories will be delighted by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comment about being neutral in a Brexit referendum, some journalists are claiming. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman Here is some more comment from journalists on Boris Johnson\u2019s performance. From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Herald\u2019s Iain Macwhirter Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s verdict on the night. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is complaining that there were no questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Actually, Farage may be wrong. Although people assumed this would be a Brexit election, and the Tories want to make it a Brexit election, it is not necessarily rolling out quite like that. Much of the campaign hasn\u2019t been about Brexit. Some clips from the programme. This is from Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, on Jo Swinson on Question Time. For Boris Johnson that was an awkward and uncomfortable half-hour, that highlighted his arrogance and the extent to which he is perceived as untrustworthy, but none of it was terminal, and the main consolation is that it could have been a lot worse. The opening question, about Johnson\u2019s relationship with the truth, could quickly have turned very ugly, but it was not Peter Oborne asking the questions (see 2.37pm), but instead a Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) female campaigner, and Johnson quickly digressed into talking about pensions. Towards the end, as he faced a series of harsh questions about NHS underfunding, he was very much on the back foot, but none of those questions were steel-tipped. The one that most fitted this category was the one about Johnson\u2019s use of racist language in his journalism, to which Johnson blithely responding by citing free speech. This was Johnson\u2019s worst moment and, as Sky\u2019s Rob Powell points out, his refusal to apologise lays him open to the charge not just of insensitivity, but of hypocrisy. But there is nothing very much new about Johnson refusing to apologise for racist or homophobic remarks made during his time as a journalist and this does not feel like one of those rows that is going to escalate. Overall, it was a very defensive performance. Johnson did not say anything particularly unexpected, he did not have anything particularly new or pertinent to say about his opponents and he did not even say very much about Brexit, which on Tuesday night, in the ITV debate, was the one subject he kept coming back to at every opportunity. Tonight the topic he kept returning to was his time as London mayor \u2013 with the result that it sounded like a rerun of his campaign for the Tory leadership in the summer. This was not an outing that will help his cause, but he can probably take some comfort from knowing that by this time next week it will mostly have been forgotten. Factcheck Claim: Boris Johnson says the Conservatives are promising 20,000 more police officers and \u201cthey are doing this now\u201d. Reality: the Tories have pledged an extra 20,000 police officers but in reality this is more of a restoration as the party has overseen a cut of just as many officers since 2010. Furthermore, the 20,000 will not appear immediately but will be staggered over three years with 6,000 in the first year. Factcheck Claim: Boris Johnson says the Conservatives are building 40 new hospitals over time, and that \u201cwe are building six immediately\u201d. Reality: the Conservatives earmarked \u00a33bn earlier this autumn, saying they would build 40 new hospitals. However, it emerged the majority of the funds would go to just six NHS trusts, which each have a major hospital badly in need of rebuilding and have had plans waiting for approval. In this regard, the prime minister is wrong to claim six new hospitals are being built immediately. A further 21 NHS trusts will get \u00a3100m seed funding between them for building works on 34 hospitals they need for 2025-2030. Q: I\u2019m a physiotherapist, and the removal of the bursary made a real difference to the number of people training. Will you bring it back? Q: I work in the NHS. Things are getting worse and worse. Why should we trust you to put the extra money in? Q: We have seen CCHQ changing Twitter handles. Why should we trust you on anything? Johnson starts talking about being mayor of London. He massively cut crime. There was a 50% cut in the murder rate, he says, and he promised 20,000 more police officers. They are coming now. He says he promised a big NHS uplift. That is coming. He has talked to hundreds of doctors and nurses. They can only meet the demand if there is a dynamic economy. And, coming back to trust, he says the biggest corrosion of trust is caused by parliament\u2019s refusal to vote for Brexit. His deal is ready to go, he says. If he gets elected, Britain will have not two referendums, but years of growth, he says. And that\u2019s it. The programme is over. Reaction and analysis etc coming soon ... Factcheck Claim: Boris Johnson said the government built a record number of homes last year and that 57,000 were affordable. Reality: Johnson is correct that, at 240,000, the number of new homes created was the highest since this data started to be collected almost 30 years ago. However, 12,000 of those homes were conversions from former offices, which are controversial as developers do not have to get planning permission. The government\u2019s record on \u201caffordable housing\u201d is questionable \u2013 it brought in a new \u201caffordable rent\u201d, which can be up to 80% of market rents, and many of the new builds he referred to meet this criteria. Johnson says he is recruiting more staff for the NHS. The only way to he can do this is by having a strong economy, he says. Factcheck Claim: Boris Johnson said that there are \u201cmore people in employment than ever before\u201d and that wages are growing faster than at any time in the past 12 years. Reality: more than 32 million people are in work in Britain, with the employment rate at the highest levels since comparable records began in 1971. Average wage growth has also hit the highest rates in more than a decade, so the prime minister is correct. However, real wages remain below the level recorded before the financial crisis, after a lost decade for pay growth. Unemployment is at the lowest levels since the 1970s. However, the use of zero-hours contracts has risen in the past decade, while the number of people affected by in-work poverty has risen to about 4 million, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Labour are using Twitter heckling during the show too. Q: Why should I believe your pledge now to hire more GPs when the Conservatives have promised this before, but not delivered? Johnson says the Conservatives are putting more money in. They are building new hospitals, he says. Q: How many? Johnson says it is 20. But over time it will be 40, he claims. Fiona Bruce says the real number is six. Q: You have contributed to race hate. Will you accept that and apologise? Johnson says this is a reference to his article about a year ago describing Muslim women wearing the burqa as looking like letterboxes. Fiona Bruce says he has written several offensive articles. She refers to others, including one referring to \u201cbum boys\u201d. Johnson says if you go through all his articles, and take some of the words he used, you can find things that may be seen as offensive. He says his burqa article was making a liberal case for women being allowed to wear what they want. Johnson refuses to apologise for offensive language in his journalism. Factcheck: Claim: Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland\u2019s deficit \u201chas been accrued under the Westminster system of governance\u201d and claimed it was equivalent to deficits in other parts of the UK outside London. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t control, as first minister, the macroeconomic policies of the UK.\u201d Reality: Scotland had a deficit in public spending in 2018/19 of 7% of GDP, including Scotland\u2019s notional share of oil and gas receipts, because the Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a312.6bn more than was raised in taxes. Excluding oil receipts, the deficit was \u00a314bn, or 8.5% of Scotland\u2019s GDP. Total state spending in Scotland last year was \u00a31,661 higher per head than the UK average. The UK\u2019s deficit, including oil and gas receipts, was 1.1%. That is not about macro-economic policy but public spending. Sturgeon seemed to confuse public debt with day-to-day spending. EU rules require applicants for membership to have deficits below 3%. The Office for National Statistics said that in 2018, London, the south-east of England and eastern England all had net fiscal surpluses. Q: Why should a young person between 18 and 25 vote Conservative? Johnson says his party will help people get a high-wage, high-skill job. People in the audience ask about housing. Johnson says more than 200,000 homes were build last year. He says 57,000 were affordable ones. As mayor of London, he \u201coutbuilt Labour by miles\u201d, he says. And he will put in transport infrastructure that will allow us to unite and level up the country, he says. Q: Why won\u2019t you release the Russia report? Johnson says he has seen no evidence of Russian interference in British elections. Q: So why won\u2019t you release it? Johnson says he sees no reason to change the normal procedure. Q: Dominic Grieve says it is ready for publication. Johnson says this is \u201cBermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. Johnson says he wants to help people with the cost of living. He says the national insurance cut will save people \u00a3100 a year. But once he has achieved his ambition of lifting the national insurance threshold to \u00a312,500 a year, people will save \u00a3500 a year. (The Conservatives have set no timetable for hitting that target, and won\u2019t even confirm to achieving this within a five-year parliament.) Johnson says he has been PM for 120 days. He is levelling up education, he says. He says he massively expanded the living wage when he was mayor of London. George Osborne nicked it from him, he says. He says he wants to tackle poverty. He wants to give every kid opportunity. He believes there is talent in every part of the country. He wants to unleash that talent. Factcheck Claim: Jo Swinson said the Liberal Democrats would increase education funding, stating \u201cyou\u2019ve got some schools not opening all day on a Friday\u201d. Reality: some schools have shortened teaching hours, citing funding cuts as the reason. Earlier this year, the Guardian reported on a school in Stockport that was planning a 4.5 day week, and said at least 25 schools in England had taken similar steps to cut costs. Q: How important is it for politicians to tell the truth? Very important, says Boris Johnson. He says there is a problem of trust. We are having an election because Brexit has been delivered. Fiona Bruce asks the questioner why she asked the question. The woman says she is a Waspi woman campaigner. Johnson says he knows the campaign\u2019s demands, but can\u2019t promise to give them what they want. Q: Why won\u2019t you publish the Russia report? Q: Why should you be PM when you keep avoiding scrutiny? Johnson says he is here facing scrutiny. He says he had to have an election because parliament was blocking Brexit. Bruce says that is not right. Johnson says parliament was blocking Brexit. Some in the audience jeer. Johnson says he does not see how Corbyn can negotiate a deal with the EU if he is going to be neutral on it. Johnson claims Corbyn will not be able to negotiate new Brexit deal with the EU if he won\u2019t be willing to campaign for it. And he says the country does not need more \u201cdelectable disputations\u201d next year. Factcheck Claim: Jo Swinson said staying in the EU would mean more money for investing in communities, and that Brexit would \u201cmake us poorer, lose jobs, mean less money for the NHS\u201d. Reality: the National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank has said that leaving the EU with Boris Johnson\u2019s deal would mean an economy \u00a370bn a year smaller after a decade. Mainstream economic forecasters have said that Brexit would likely lead to a rise in unemployment and that the public finances would be damaged. The Lib Dems argue there would be a \u201c\u00a350bn remain bonus\u201d for the government finances from staying in the EU. This is in line with forecasts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, although has been criticised for potentially misleading voters because it adds together five years\u2019 worth of higher taxes. She had a dismal half hour - undoubtedly her worst of the campaign. See 8.15pm. More later. Q: Why did you say you would be willing to use nuclear weapons? Swinson says she thinks the world has become more uncertain. She supports the UK having the nuclear deterrent. Here is the official Lib Dem HQ response to what Jeremy Corbyn said about being neutral in a Brexit referendum. For the Lib Dems this is a good attack line. But it is not one that Swinson herself as been using in the programme. Q: You pretend to be progressive. But you have voted against progressive policies. The Lib Dems are a rightwing party. Swinson says she is not a social democrat. She is a liberal. The Lib Dems are a liberal party. They are internationalist. They are not the same as Labour. Q: Why can we trust you on fracking? Swinson says she is against fracking. Q: You voted for it in the coalition. Ed Davey, energy minister in the coalition, proposed conditions for fracking, Swinson says. But she says since then things have moved on. She says the Lib Dems are now against it. Q: Why are you having a go at Corbyn over antisemitism? He has been fighting antisemitism since before you were born. Swinson says she has spoken to people like Luciana Berger who know all about antisemitism in the Labour party. She will trust them. Q: Would your conscience be clear if the UK ended up leaving the EU because the Lib Dems split the remain vote? Swinson says she wants people to be able to vote for a remain party. Labour would negotiate a Brexit deal, she says. She says Corbyn\u2019s Labour will not win votes from the Tories. So people have to vote Lib Dems, she says. From the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil Q: It is not just about abolishing tuition fees. You could do other things to help. Swinson says the Lib Dems want to focus on early years education. That is where you can make most difference to social mobility. Swinson says she will not promise to abolish tuition fees. She says a lot of promises are being bandied around. But she does not want to make promises that cannot be kept. Look at what the IFS said about Labour\u2019s manifesto, she says. Swinson ruled out going into coalition with the Conservatives under Boris Johnson. She said he was too extreme; he was now backed by Tommy Robinson. Jo Swinson is struggling. Here are comments from journalists. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has been on for a few minutes now. The first question was brutal: did she regret saying she could be prime minister? Swinson claimed that things had got harder for her since the Brexit party stood down in Tory seats. She also claimed that strange things happen in elections. But she also implied that she now accepts that she won\u2019t be PM after polling day. Nicola Sturgeon is the longest serving party leader on the programme tonight, and before she became Scotland\u2019s first minister in 2014 she had had a long apprentice as deputy first minister, and it showed. She came over as confident and assured, as some of the Twitter reaction acknowledges. Here are two London journalists on her performance. Sturgeon said the SNP would not put the Tories into office, but she confirmed that she would expect Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a second independence referendum in return for SNP support. My colleague Owen Jones, who is a prominent Corbyn supporter, thinks Sturgeon\u2019s stance will help the Tories. Sturgeon also said the SNP would not expect to vote on English-only matters. Under EVEL (English votes for English laws \u2013 new parliamentary rules introduced by David Cameron), the SNP would not vote on these matters anyway. Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt says this has interesting consequences. Factcheck Claim: Nicola Sturgeon said the EU \u201cdidn\u2019t make any comment\u201d about what would happen if Scotland voted for independence in the 2014 independence referendum. She also said Spain has \u201cnever said it would veto the membership of an independent Scotland\u201d in the EU. Reality: a lot has changed since 2014, but the European commission president at the time, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, said that it would be \u201cdifficult, if not impossible\u201d for an independent Scotland to join the EU. The Spanish prime minister at the time, Mariano Rajoy, said his government believed an independent Scotland could only apply to join the EU from outside the organisation as a new state. Both Spain and the EU have new leadership, and circumstances have changed, but Sturgeon\u2019s claim is wrong. Q: How much influence do you think the SNP would have over English matters if it was supporting a Labour government? Sturgeon says the SNP would not intervene in devolved matters, except in so far as there might be knock-on effects for Scotland. For example, a trade deal with the US could have an impact on the NHS. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said about staying neutral in a second Brexit referendum. One, we negotiate a credible deal with the European Union. Secondly, we will put that alongside remain in a referendum. My role, and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere, and we will abide by the result of it. And I will adopt as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring our communities and country together, rather than continuing in endless debate about the EU and Brexit. This will be a trade deal with Europe, or remaining in the EU. That will be the choice that we put before the British public within six months. Q: What are you doing about drug deaths in Scotland? There are three times as many as in England. Sturgeon says it is important to provide context. Scotland had a drug problem in the 1980s. That cohort is now getting older, she says. Q: Our grandparents fought to defend the UK. How would you defend your desire to break it up? Sturgeon says her grandmother was from the north of England. She wants Scotland to be self-governing. But Engand and Scotland will always be close. Those ties will continue. She does not believe in Scotland turning its back on England. Q: Who was it that promised independence would be a once in a generation event? Sturgeon says circumstances change. If the UK had voted to stay in the EU, she says she thinks she would not be pushing for a second referendum now. Q: If Scotland votes for independence, it will be treated by the EU as a third state? And what would you do about Scotland\u2019s debt? And what about Spain - they would not let you join the EU as an independent state? Sturgeon says the EU did not say in 2014 what would happen if Scotland voted for independence. She says their body language may have implied they were not keen, but they did not express a view. And Spain never said it would veto an independent Scotland being in. She says since 2014 there has been a sea change in attitudes in the EU towards Scottish independence. On Scotland\u2019s deficit, she says, if you exclude London, it is in line with the deficit for the rest of the UK. She says, with all its natural resources, Scotland should be able to emulate other small countries that flourish as independent states. Q: What will you do if London refuses to let you have a second referendum? Sturgeon says she hopes the people of Scotland will use the election to send a message as to what they want. Nicola Sturgeon has been going for a few minutes now. Here are some highlights. Often the best way to seize the initiative on a programme like this is to make news, and that\u2019s what Jeremy Corbyn did tonight. He gave us a story, confirming for the first time that he would be neutral in a second Brexit referendum. The Tories will criticise him for this \u2013 they\u2019ve started already (see 7.24pm) - but at least now Corbyn will not have to put up with headlines like the ones he faced on Saturday, when he was criticised for refusing to say nine times what he would do in such a referendum. Tonight his answer seemed to close down some of the criticism he was getting from the audience over Brexit. Otherwise he faced quite a lot of hostility, which he handled reasonably well. The most aggressive questioning came from the man who asked about Corbyn\u2019s failure to intervene at a press conference to protect the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth from a heckler. Corbyn\u2019s resort to a stock answer was not impressive, but the anger of the questioner sounded contrived (even by the standards of this programme) and of the two men in the exchange, Corbyn sounded the more reasonable. Factcheck Claim: Jeremy Corbyn said that \u201c95% of the population will pay no more whatsoever in tax\u201d under a Labour government. Reality: the Labour leader is right that income tax will only rise for the top 5%. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that this will not raise all of the money needed to fund its plans, and that shareholders in companies will in effect pay more as a result of higher corporation tax. Labour is also planning to reverse changes to inheritance tax and has said it will end the marriage tax allowance. Q: Have you finally got the chance to get rid of the legacy of Thatcher and Blair? Q: In your manifesto you say you will abolish the married couples\u2019 tax allowance. That will be a tax cut for people. Corbyn says he is not doing any deals with any other parties. He says his taxation policies will affect the richest 5%. But he confirms that he will end the married couples\u2019 allowance. That discriminates against people who are not married, he says. And he confirms he would be neutral in a second referendum. \u201cFirst heard here on Question Time,\u201d he says. There is another question about Scotland. There do seem to have been quite a few Scots asking questions in the last five minutes. Fiona Bruce tries to call someone who does not want to ask about Scotland. Q: You are talking about delaying the Scottish independence referendum. Is the UK like Hotel California \u2013 you can check out, but you can never leave? Corbyn says he does not see an independence referendum as a priority. He would not have one in the early years of a Labour government. Q: What does early years mean? In the first two years at least, says Corbyn. Q: But if it is the priority of the Scottish people, what right do you have to say no? Corbyn says he is putting forward a programme for the whole of the UK. He is planning a \u00a3100m investment programme for Scotland. Q: There is already a mandate for a second Scottish independence referendum. Corbyn repeats the point about how his plans would benefit Scotland. Here is the CCHQ response to Corbyn\u2019s announcement that he would be neutral in a second Brexit referendum. Q: What do you say about the IFS claim that it won\u2019t just be the richest 5% who pay more in tax under your plans? Corbyn says he insisted on having costed plans. He says 95% of taxpayers will not pay more under his plans. Under his manifesto plan, the UK will become more or less \u201cmid-ranking\u201d in terms of the provision of public services. He is referring to comparisons like the ones in the chart quoted at 3.48pm. Corbyn says broadband is essential for everyone. We can afford the plan, he says, but we cannot afford not to install full-fibre broadband. We have to invest in it for the whole country, he says. Factcheck Claim: Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would ask companies to pay a \u201clittle bit more\u201d in corporation tax, that it would be lower than in 2010 and lower than the average for industrial countries. Reality: the Labour leader is correct that his party\u2019s plan would take the corporation tax rate to levels below 2010 and in line with many industrial nations. The Conservatives have cut the rate from 28% in 2010 to 19% now, one of the lowest levels in the EU. Labour would raise corporation tax to 26% over five years. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes the total value of corporation tax taken by a Labour government would be the highest in the G7 and more than almost anywhere else in the OECD. Q: What would Labour policies do for jobs, and for young people in Sheffield? Corbyn says there is a climate emergency and poorer people suffer first. He says that he got parliament to vote to declare a climate emergency. A member of the audience defends Corbyn\u2019s Brexit stance, saying it is the only sensible position. Q: Will you support leaving or remaining in the EU? Corbyn explains Labour\u2019s position. Then he says he will adopt a \u201cneutral\u201d stance in the referendum campaign, so he can implement the result. In the past he has implied that this is what he will do, but he has not said this explicitly before. Corbyn confirms he would be neutral during second referendum on Brexit. Q: Why did you support Evo Morales, who stood down as president of Bolivia after a disputed election? Corbyn says he met Morales last year. Morales stood down. Bolivia used to be the poorest country in South America before Morales took power. It isn\u2019t now. Q: Are you happy that Labour is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Corbyn says Labour\u2019s processes are being investigated. Q: What terrifies me is the misogyny that Labour women MPs experience. I\u2019ve seen the video of Ruth Smeeth online. She was heckled out of a press conference, and you were chatting happily to the heckler afterwards. I\u2019m terrified for my daughters. That\u2019s disgraceful. Corbyn says nobody should suffer abuse, in public or private. Q: Watch the video. Corbyn repeats the point about how no one should have to put up with this. Q: So why were you talking to the heckler like that? Why do Labour female MPs need bodyguards? Corbyn says he has had many conversations with Smeeth since. He tells the man that he does not know what went on in the conversation. Corbyn says government plans for broadband are insufficient. Only 10% of homes get access to full-fibre broadband. He will give it to everyone. Q: Why is this man frightened of Labour being in power? Corbyn tells the man he cannot understand everything going through his mind. Maybe they can talk about it later, he says. Q: Should businesses be frightened of an incoming Labour government? No, says Corbyn. He says firms will have to pay more in corporation tax. But it will be lower than in 2010 and lower than in most industrial countries. He says he enjoys working with all business organisations. A member of the audience says Corbyn\u2019s reckless ideas are terrifying for business. Another man in the audience says internet companies like Virgin won\u2019t have a product to sell under Labour\u2019s plans to nationalise the internet. Jeremy Corbyn takes the stage. He says it\u2019s a pleasure to be here. The Tory online heckling has started. Fiona Bruce opens the programme. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has arrived at the Octagon Centre in Sheffield. Presumably he will be spinning for Boris Johnson. From Jeremy Corbyn More from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall More video from Sheffield. This is from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. Laura Pidcock has tweeted a picture of the Labour team ready for spin duty at the Question Time leaders\u2019 special: John Trickett, herself, Shami Chakrabarti and Andy McDonald. And Labour\u2019s Jon Trickett says the pro-Corbyn singing from the crowd outside can be heard in the green room, where leaders are getting ready for the Question Time special. Here is the spin room at the Sheffield venue. Here is the running order for the Question Time leaders\u2019 special. 7pm: Jeremy Corbyn 7.30pm: Nicola Sturgeon 8pm: Jo Swinson 8.30pm: Boris Johnson Labour\u2019s Laura Pidcock has also been tweeting video of the pro-Corbyn crowd outside the venue for the BBC Question Times leaders\u2019 special. There is a big crowd of Labour supporters waiting outside the Octagon Centre in Sheffield, where the BBC Question Time leaders\u2019 special is taking place, according to Momentum, the pro-Corbyn organisation. And Labour\u2019s Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, has tweeted some video. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Bassetlaw district general hospital, Boris Johnson said that leaving the EU would allow the Conservatives to implement their plan to impose an extra 3% stamp duty on foreign buyers (see 7.43am) without having to leave out EU nationals. He explained: What we\u2019re doing is putting a 3% increase in stamp duty for foreign buyers. Now, one of the advantages of getting Brexit done is that you can then do it in a non-discriminatory way between all international buyers \u2013 because previously you couldn\u2019t do it with people coming from the 27 other EU countries. As we come out of the EU we\u2019ll be able to levy that increased stamp duty on all international buyers. I want our market to be open \u2013 I want people to be able to buy stuff in the UK \u2013 but it is only reasonable when international buyers come in and buy property that they should make a contribution to life in this country. And we will use that 3% stamp duty to help tackle the problems of homelessness. I think it is the right thing to do. From the Times\u2019s Steven Swinford The latest edition of the Economist out today has some grim polling for Labour in it. It has commissioned various constituency polls and this week it is running one from Great Grimsby, a Labour-held seat (Melanie Onn won with a majority of 2,565 in 2017) that voted leave by more than 70%. The poll shows the Conservatives 13 points ahead. As the Economist points out in its write-up (paywall), constituency polling tends to be more unreliable than national polling (and national polls themselves have had a poor record of late). But this is still a striking result from a place that has been Labour for 74 years and is 45th on a list of Tory target seats. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, and Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, have arrived at the Octagon Centre in Sheffield for the BBC\u2019s Question Time leaders\u2019 special. Michael Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chair who has become a polling specialist, has been conducting focus groups during the election and has published a write-up of the most recent three he has organised. They were all conducted in Labour-held, leave-voting seats in Wales (ie, the sort of seats where the Tories think they have the best chance of winning). Among other things, Lord Ashcroft says his participants weren\u2019t impressed by Labour\u2019s plan for free, full-fibre broadband. Labour\u2019s promise of free broadband for all had cut through to an unusual degree, albeit to what might charitably be called a mixed response. Many of these previous Labour voters thought it sounded like an odd sort of priority: \u201cI might nationalise certain essential things. But I\u2019m not desperately sure I would nationalise wifi\u201d; \u201cThere are people sleeping in cold homes, kids without warm clothes, families on the breadline. I just don\u2019t think this is top of the list\u201d; \u201cI work six days a week to provide my family with the necessities to live with. Broadband is a luxury, not a necessity. You have to work for it, you don\u2019t get given it. If you don\u2019t want to graft or pay your dues, that\u2019s cool, but don\u2019t expect to get it for free.\u201d They also tended to see it as a transparent bribe, and not a particularly believable one: \u201cIt\u2019s trying to go after first-time voters, because for teenagers, wifi is everything. So for people who haven\u2019t looked into it and haven\u2019t paid taxes, if they\u2019re going to have something like that for free it\u2019s a vote winner\u201d; \u201cThe government is paying, so we are\u201d; \u201cIt would be like two megabytes a second, then you have to upgrade\u201d; \u201cNothing is going to be free. Is it unlimited? It will be something like, the broadband is free, but the router is \u00a35,000. They\u2019re going to make the money back somehow\u201d; \u201cNext they\u2019re going to promise you three years of Greggs or something.\u201d Some also worried about what state-run broadband would actually be like: \u201cSlow. Unreliable\u201d; \u201cThey\u2019d be able to listen down every Alexa in every house\u201d; \u201cIt screams \u2018state-owned internet\u2019 to me. It\u2019s not going to be North Korea, but it does scream \u2018control\u2019\u201d; \u201cIt would be like Big Brother, with all your personal details and social media profiles and everything else. Would you want that in a government-owned business?\u201d Focus groups normally only comprise a dozen or so people and, without knowing how participants have been selected, it is hard to know how representative they are. But yesterday the Times published some polling (paywall) suggesting that voters are sceptical about Labour\u2019s ability to deliver not just free broadband, but some of its other headline promises too. Yesterday the Institute for Fiscal Studies published its analysis of the Labour manifesto. As we reported, it said it did not believe Jeremy Corbyn would be able to implement his spending plans with only the richest 5% of taxpayers paying more. Corbyn himself and John McDonnell have both been rejecting this criticism today. (See 8.22am and 10.46am.) Today the Resolution Foundation, a rival economic thinktank, has published its own analysis of the manifesto plans. It\u2019s by Torsten Bell, the RF\u2019s chief executive, and a former Labour head of policy under Ed Miliband, and it\u2019s long, but well worth reading. Bell says that, although Labour is planning a \u201chuge\u201d increase in the size of the state, under the manifesto plans government spending as a proportion of GDP would only end up roughly in line with Germany\u2019s. Like the IFS, Bell thinks Labour would not be able to achieve its goals without all taxpayers, and not just the richest, having to pay more. But his overall verdict on the manifesto is balanced and judicious. Here is an extract from his conclusion. Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto is simply huge in the changes it proposes. Individually many are not out of line with other northern European countries. But taken together, they are a big step change from the plans Labour proposed just two years ago and more radical than anything we\u2019ve seen in the UK for a generation (Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1979 manifesto proposed far fewer changes). That is clearest when considering the proposed increase in the size of the state. But it is true also on proposals for deep economic reform \u2013 from our labour market to corporate governance and a big increase in public ownership. With high inequality and stagnant productivity, none of us should be satisfied with the status quo. Indeed, there are very strong reasons for thinking that an increase in the size of our state and reform of our economic model are priorities for Britain. But despite having quite so much in it, Labour\u2019s manifesto is lacking some crucial ingredients for any would-be government wanting to embark on that journey. First, prioritisation among such a long list of promises would be key. Second, for any economic reform of this kind to last, much broader coalitions for it would need to be built than Labour has currently been able to secure (in contrast, see for example what the New Zealand Labour party has been able to do on collective bargaining). Third, more honesty about the difficulties involved would be needed. For example, such an agenda would have to involve much more of a focus on wealth taxes. And while more can be raised from the top, the reality is we will all need to pay higher taxes if we want a state the size of Germany\u2019s that delivers not just free social care but free broadband ... Labour hopes its hugely radical programme will refocus the election campaign on domestic policy issues and away from Brexit alone. That may or may not happen, but what is certain is that if Labour forms the next government, the party is going to have one hell of a to-do list. And, as we all know, a long to-do list risks becoming something very different \u2013 a wish list. This, from Labour\u2019s candidate in Tooting, Rosena Allin-Khan, must be one of the most creative campaign videos of the election. Provided you\u2019ve seen Love Actually, of course ... On Monday the Guardian published a powerful article by the journalist Peter Oborne criticising the media for letting Boris Johnson get away with lies. Oborne has spent most of his career writing for the Tory press (he was a political columnist for the Daily Mail until recently, and he was political editor of the Spectator when Johnson himself was editor) but he is also something of an iconoclast and has become a fierce critic of his old boss\u2019s dishonesty. He helps to run a very good website, boris-johnson-lies.com, cataloguing \u201cthe lies, falsehoods and misrepresentations of Boris Johnson and his government\u201d. Oborne\u2019s Guardian article included this intriguing paragraph. A big reason for Johnson\u2019s easy ride is partisanship from the parts of the media determined to get him elected. I have talked to senior BBC executives, and they tell me they personally think it\u2019s wrong to expose lies told by a British prime minister because it undermines trust in British politics. Is that a reason for giving Johnson free rein to make any false claim he wants? This claim caused some surprise. John Simpson, the veteran BBC world affairs editor, posted a tweet saying he had never heard anyone at the BBC express this view. This morning Oborne posted his own tweets, saying it was Tony Hall, the BBC director general, who was queasy about calling Johnson a liar. In response, the BBC simply referred to a letter in today\u2019s Guardian, from the BBC\u2019s director of editorial policy and standards, David Jordan, saying that although the BBC will call out lies, it does not label people as liars because \u201cthat\u2019s a judgment for audiences to make about an individual\u2019s motives\u201d. Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. I\u2019ll be here for the rest of the day, including to cover the BBC\u2019s general election Question Time, featuring Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson all being quizzed by the Question Time audience in Sheffield. Fiona Bruce will be chairing. The two-hour programme starts at 7pm. We\u2019ve got three weeks to go until the election, but local council byelections are still taking place and there were six last night. Britain Elects has the results. They will be very encouraging for the Conservatives. My colleague Hilary Osborne has this factcheck on whether earning \u00a380,000 means you earn more than 95% of the UK population, after a member of the Question Time audience cried foul last night. He claimed he was not in the top 5% of earners, although he earned more than \u00a380,000. The verdict: a salary of more than \u00a380,000 a year does put someone in the top 5% of earners, even if they do not necessarily feel wealthy. The Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope raises a pertinent question after the Brexit party proposed to allow referendums if more than 5 million people wished to vote on something. Meanwhile, after Nigel Farage said his party was committed to the NHS and that it needed more money, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov has reposted this old clip of him advocating a move to an insurance-based system. This is from PA Media on the Brexit party\u2019s contract launch. Nigel Farage has called for a cap on immigration, a 50% cut in the foreign aid budget and the scrapping of HS2 as he set out the Brexit party\u2019s policy platform for the general election. Launching the party\u2019s \u201ccontract with the people\u201d, Farage said all the party\u2019s demands were underpinned by the need to secure a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d with the EU. While he acknowledged they were not seeking election as the next government, he said they were committing to achieving the Brexit which people voted for in the 2016 referendum. \u201cA clean-break Brexit can shape the future of our economy and society,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will give us the freedom to shape our future by taking immediate control of our own laws, borders, money, fishing and defence.\u201d The policy document calls for: Scrapping the BBC licence fee. Allowing citizens to call referendums if 5 million people agree. Abolishing inheritance tax. Investing \u00a32.5bn in fishing and coastal communities. Giving businesses zero-rate corporation tax for the first \u00a310,000 of pre-tax profits. Abolishing privatisation in the NHS. Establishing 24-hour GP surgeries. My colleague Peter Walker was at the event and has highlighted an apparent absence of costings in the party\u2019s manifesto. Earlier, Scottish Labour unveiled a pledge to provide free meals for every pupil at every state secondary and primary school throughout the year. Richard Leonard, Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, said: It cannot be right that in the fifth biggest economy in the world, one in every four children in Scotland is living in poverty. After a decade of Tory austerity and SNP complacency, it is time for real and radical change. But it\u2019s not enough to only provide free school meals to those on low incomes. We need a plan that tackles the stigma that can prevent some children accessing free meals and the barriers that we know eligibility and registration create. A recent YouGov poll put Labour at 12% in Scotland \u2013 that is the lowest ever, and may well be an outlier, but the party is running third in nearly all polls, while Leonard is little known to voters. In short, this is a retail offer to voters long on aspiration. Elsewhere, my colleague Severin Carrell is at the launch of the Scottish Labour party\u2019s manifesto. Moving away now from the Brexit party\u2019s \u201ccontract\u201d launch to the unveiling of Plaid Cymru\u2019s manifesto. Adam Price, the party\u2019s leader, struck a defiantly hopeful and optimistic mood at the launch. Promising to keep his anger in check, he repeatedly stressed there was hope for Wales if it could tap into the power of its people. He started off with a football joke, claiming that both the Welsh star Gareth Bale and Plaid put Wales first \u2013 Bale is in a spot of bother for standing behind a banner suggesting that his priorities are Wales, golf and only thirdly his club, Real Madrid. \u201cLet\u2019s make the coming decade the decade of hope and change,\u201d Price said. He pledged that by 2030 Wales could be zero-carbon, zero-waste, zero-poverty. \u201cWe have the power, we have the potential.\u201d Price said the answers for Wales would not come from Islington or the Bullingdon Club, but from its valleys and the villages. He said Wales could be the cradle of a \u201cgreen jobs revolution\u201d and compared his ambition to that of JFK at the time of the space race. In its manifesto, Plaid promised more doctors, nurses, police, more social housing. \u201cLet\u2019s inject some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cHope, it\u2019s us. The future, it\u2019s us,\u201d he said. Despite Wales voting in favour of leaving the EU, Price said: Europe is core to the future of Wales. This Brexit is not for us. It never was, it never will be. Here\u2019s a summary of Plaid\u2019s green revolution pledges: The electrification of all mainline rail lines by 2030 and electrification of the Valleys railways, followed by the North Wales Coast railway. Building a super metro in the south-east of Wales, a new metro system for Swansea Bay and the western valleys, a metro for the north-east of Wales, and reopening rail services in the Amman, Tawe, Neath, and Dulais valleys. The creation of a trans-Wales railway and a Cross-rail for the Valleys, expanding the trans-Wales bus network with high-quality buses using renewable energy, and a new, publicly owned regional bus company for the south of Wales. The construction of tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Cardiff, and Colwyn Bay, an offshore windfarm off Ynys M\u00f4n, and a barrage on the River Usk. The rollout of a massive \u00a35bn home energy efficiency programme and building 20,000 green social houses. Asked whether he would stay in politics if the Brexit party fail to win any seats, or give up and spend more time in the US, Farage says he is \u201cabsolutely committed to the complete reform of our political system\u201d. Farage then outlines the party\u2019s tree-planting proposals, as reported by my colleague Kate Proctor yesterday. Farage welcomes the apparent movement within Tory party policy towards supporting an Australian-style points-based system, but criticises a failure to commit to \u201creducing numbers\u201d. He claims that the Conservatives have no intention of reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK because many of the party\u2019s \u201cbig business backers want as much cheap labour as they can possibly get\u201d. The Brexit party leader says that the UK has a \u201cpopulation crisis directly as a result of policies since the late 1990s\u201d and calls for a hardline approach to immigration. He suggests immediately deporting those who arrive in the UK clandestinely. The Brexit party\u2019s plans would be paid for by \u00a3200bn of savings by cutting the foreign aid budget, ceasing EU payments and a suggested scrapping of the HS2 project, according to Farage. He also says \u00a37bn could be claimed back from the European Investment Bank and claims HS2 is a project costing \u00a3100bn to benefit \u201cjust a few thousand people\u201d. \u201cWe would want to save that money,\u201d he says, adding that he would \u201cstop sending\u201d \u00a313bn to the EU every year and proposes also cutting the foreign aid budget, which is currently set at 0.7% of GDP. He says the Brexit party would introduce a \u201ccitizens\u2019 initiative\u201d, triggering a referendum if 5 million people sign a valid register calling for a public vote on a particular issue. Farage calls for a constitutional convention to work out what sort of written constitution the country needed and adds that civil servants should also be made to declare their political neutrality. He proposes to scrap VAT on fuel bills after a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d and to stop companies earning less than \u00a310,000 a year from paying corporation tax. The party would \u201ccut the cost of living\u201d by removing VAT on domestic fuel bills, which he says would save the average family \u00a365 per year. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a big weight off the mind of many struggling small companies.\u201d Alluding to his claims of being offered a seat in the House of Lords by the Tories in exchange for keeping quiet, Farage \u2013 attempting to furnish his self-described anti-establishment credentials \u2013 says the appointments and honours system borders on corrupt. We are sickened in many ways by the system of political patronage that we see in this country. Frankly I do think the way appointments to the House of Lords and indeed other honours are used borders on corruption and the House of Lords is now no longer fit for purpose and we think it needs to go. The former Ukip leader says there are 330 seats across the UK that the Tories have never won and will never win, and suggests that the party will actually be helped by the Brexit party running in Labour-held seats. There are a lot of Labour voters who just cannot and will not bring themselves to vote Conservative but they will vote for us. They showed that in the European elections and they\u2019re showing it now. We are now beginning to dig into the old Labour seats. As for splitting the vote ... arguably in many of the key Tory seats we\u2019re actually making it rather easier for them by picking up Labour votes that would never ever go to the Conservatives. Farage says the party decided to call the document containing their policy proposals a contract because a word association test with \u201cmanifesto\u201d arrived at the word \u201clie\u201d. He says the Brexit party has already changed the landscape of politics and criticises the lack of discussion during the election run-up on the withdrawal agreement and the terms of Brexit. The debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson on Tuesday \u201cexposed fact that Labour do not have a party-wide position on which way it would campaign\u201d, he declares, before saying that the prime minister indicated a change of direction recently \u2013 which led to the Brexit party standing down candidates. He said we will leave in 2020, but more significantly that he\u2019s going to negotiate a super Canada plus plus deal without alignment [with the EU] and that is progress, because if we leave the European Union and we find ourselves aligned in everything from financial services to fisheries we have not actually left. We took that promise, and said OK, on the basis of that, we will concentrate firepower against Labour and the remainers, and that is exactly what we are doing. Be in no doubt, we want a clean break from the political institutions of the EU and you can get that with a Canada-style trade deal just as you can get it leaving on WTO terms. In an apparent slight to the Liberal Democrats, Pugh says the Brexit party does not present itself as being able to form the next government, but stresses it can lead the agenda. He says many of the people in the Brexit party \u2013 which will field 274 candidates \u2013 heading up policy areas have real-world experience and it is hoped their policies will become mainstream. Citing the concept of a clean-break Brexit, regional infrastructure investment and the cancellation of HS2 \u2013 which is now being reviewed \u2013 Pugh says the party has been influential. He calls for no extended transition and for Boris Johnson to stick to his Brexit commitments. Pugh then claims that the party will set out proposals to be budget neutral over five years and highlights what he said is a figure of \u00a31.8tn in outstanding debt that the UK owes. He adds that servicing that debt costs \u00a340bn a year \u2013 constituting most of defence budget. \u201cThe magic money tree has been shaken hard and is now fairly bare,\u201d he says. \u201cThe spending commitments of the two main parties are not going to be delivered.\u201d He congratulates the party for polling 17%, and then playsa sombre election broadcast which primarily attacks Labour before Nigel Farage takes to the stage. Someone has forgotten to turn off an instrumental version of Kanye West\u2019s hit song Power, as the Brexit party\u2019s Yorkshire MEP Jake Pugh gets the event under way. If the track had played with the lyrics, you would have heard: I\u2019m living\u2019 in that 21st century Doing something mean to it Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it I guess every superhero need his theme music The Brexit party is about launch its election manifesto, or \u201ccontract\u201d as Nigel Farage insists on calling it. You can follow the launch here: Meanwhile, in Nantgarw ... Asked how he could reassure the public that he would be able to implement his spending plans, Corbyn said: We\u2019ve costed it through \u2013 the needs of this country are enormous. The housing crisis, the underfunding of schools, the needs of our health service, the lack of infrastructure development \u2013 we need all that. This has to be done and this will help to deal with the climate emergency by the green energy jobs we will be creating. Yes, there will be a referendum in six months to bring the whole Brexit issue to a close because we will negotiate an agreement with the EU by which we could leave and maintain a trade relationship \u2013 at the same time we will set that alongside against remain and the British people make the final choice. Responding to the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans could not just be funded by taxes on the rich, Corbyn said: \u201cWe\u2019re being very straight. Ninety-five percent of the British public will not pay any more in tax at all. \u201cThe richest 5% will pay a bit more and the biggest corporations will pay more. \u201cWe have costed it very, very carefully, produced a very full costings through our grey book, and the information is all there and out there \u2013 95% will not pay any more.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn said he would \u201cright one of the wrongs of history\u201d by granting sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The UK\u2019s refusal to end its occupation of the Indian Ocean archipelago is expected to be marked by protests outside the UK high commission in the Mauritian capital, Port Louis. The protest is organised by those who were forcibly deported more than 40 years ago and their descendants. The government has defied a UN deadline to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius by today. Speaking to reporters at a campaign even in Stoke-on-Trent, Corbyn was asked whether a Labour government would accept the UN\u2019s ruling on the sovereignty of the islands. He said: Yes, absolutely. I\u2019ve been involved in the Chagos campaign for a very long time. What happened to the Chagos islanders was utterly disgraceful. [They were] forcibly removed from their own islands, unfortunately, by this country. They need a full apology. They need adequate compensation. They\u2019ve had some, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s sufficient. And I believe the right of return to those islands is absolutely important as a symbol of the way in which we wish to behave in international law. So yes, we will carry that out. And I\u2019m looking forward to being in government to right one of the wrongs of history. Chris Moncrieff, one of the most respected lobby journalists of his generation, has died. He was 88. The former political editor of PA, who was hailed as \u201cthe one journalist who mattered\u201d by former prime minister Tony Blair, died in hospital on Friday morning after a short illness. his family said. He retired after 32 years at Westminster in 1994, but returned to work the next day and continued to contribute to the agency until his death. Pete Clifton, PA\u2019s editor-in-chief, said: \u201cMoncrieff was the ultimate news agency journalist: great contacts, always close to the action, working some epic hours and obsessed by getting stories out before everyone else. \u201cHe had no interest in any political agenda or viewpoint, just making sure he was first to write about it.\u201d Plaid Cymru is launching its manifesto in Nantgarw. Steven Morris is there and will report back soon. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, was confronted in Glasgow this morning by a young voter who challenged her about her role in the coalition government and the impact of its austerity policy. Scottish Labour has unveiled a pledge to provide free meals for every pupil at every state secondary and primary school throughout the year as a curtain-raiser before publication of its Scottish election manifesto later this morning. Labour\u2019s pledge, which it says will cost up to \u00a3231m a year as well as an upfront cost of \u00a325m in new equipment and infrastructure, is being presented as its solution to a decade of austerity under successive Conservative and Scottish National party governments. Labour has sought to partly blame the SNP for passing on Tory spending cuts in local government and frontline services \u2013 a charge Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government rejects. Scottish councils already spend \u00a3120m a year on meals during the school year, after deducting payments by those able to pay, taking the putative year-round costs to \u00a3310m. Richard Leonard, Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, said: It cannot be right that in the fifth biggest economy in the world, one in every four children in Scotland is living in poverty. After a decade of Tory austerity and SNP complacency, it is time for real and radical change. But it\u2019s not enough to only provide free school meals to those on low incomes. We need a plan that tackles the stigma that can prevent some children accessing free meals and the barriers that we know eligibility and registration create. Leonard said the funding would be provided by a UK Labour government\u2019s massive expansion in state spending, neatly highlighting a paradox about the general election in Scotland. Like the vast majority of domestic policy areas, education policy and local government funding are entirely devolved to Holyrood. The domestic policy battles being fought by Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, say over NHS funding or policing or social care, have little direct relevance to Scottish parties. And Leonard\u2019s school meals policy requires Labour to win two successive elections: firstly on 12 December for Westminster and then in May 2021 for the Scottish parliament. Opinion polls for the Westminster election are unfavourable for Labour but downright hostile at Holyrood level. A recent YouGov poll put Labour at 12% in Scotland \u2013 that is the lowest ever, and may well be an outlier, but the party is running third in nearly all polls, while Leonard is little known to voters. In short, this is a retail offer long on aspiration. Nigel Farage has called for immigration into the UK to be restricted to 50,000 people a year. Farage, who is launching his Brexit party\u2019s election \u201ccontract\u201d later today, said there should be an Australian-style points based system limiting the numbers allowed to settle in the country. \u201cWe had a 60-year postwar norm of about 30,000 to 50,000 people coming into the United Kingdom. That has completely gone out of the window,\u201d he told Today. \u201cWhat I think is very real is that we now have in many ways a population crisis in this country. Nobody could possibly have foreseen the massive growth in our population.\u201d Farage said labour shortages in specific sectors such as the NHS could be addressed by issuing temporary work permits. McDonnell suggested that Labour would allow a return to secondary picketing. Under Labour\u2019s manifesto the party committed to removing \u201cunnecessary restrictions on industrial action\u201d. Asked on the Today programme whether that meant restoring secondary picketing, McDonnell said: \u201cWe will make sure that people have the right, as in the ILO [International Labour Organisation] conventions to withdraw their labour. Yes ... I believe any workers should have the right to withdraw their labour.\u201d But asked again whether that meant a return to secondary picketing, he said: \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re creating a new climate in this country, which is based upon a stakeholder economy where we all recognise we\u2019ve got a stake in this economy.\u201d He added: \u201cThe idea is that we\u2019re democratising the economy and providing people with a greater range of basic rights.\u201d On Today McDonnell again challenged the IFS\u2019s claim that Labour could not assert that only the rich would pay for its spending plans. Using the same phraseology he used on Sky, McDonnell said: I have a greater respect for the IFS. I just think they\u2019ve got it wrong on this one. Yes, the top 5% will pay a bit more. The 95% of earners will not pay an increase in income tax rates or in VAT, or in national insurance, but we are we\u2019re being straight with people. We are reversing some of the corporation tax cuts that have been given away by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over the last 10 years. He added: It is not inevitable that when you increase [corporation] it lowers wages or increases prices. The IFS needs to look at the structural changes in the economy we\u2019re making ... because we\u2019re democratising the way in which these corporations work and are more accountable, they will actually invest in their companies, instead of being driven by short-term profiteering and shareholder interest only. They will think for the long term, invest and grow the economy and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening elsewhere across Europe ... they have longer term decision-making. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has been defending the Labour manifesto in a round of broadcast interviews. Asked on Sky News about a claim by the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank that Labour would impose the highest tax burden since the second world war, McDonnell said: \u201cIt is high. I don\u2019t hesitate from that because we\u2019ve had 10 years of austerity under the Conservatives and Lib Dems, [and] our public services are in a terrible state.\u201d He added: We\u2019ve got to be honest. It does mean raising taxes, but we protect those people who can least afford it. Income tax will go up. It\u2019ll be the top 5% of earners, the highest earners will pay a bit more. I\u2019m reversing some of the corporation tax cuts that the Tories have given away. Corporations were given tax cuts and they haven\u2019t invested that money. And I am introducing a financial transaction tax so that the City pays a bit more. McDonnell also challenged the IFS\u2019s claim that ordinary people would have to pay for Labour spending plans in the long term. He said: \u201cI have a lot of respect for the IFS. On this one, though, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got it right. And so do most other economists as well.\u201d McDonnell was vague on how Labour would tackle student debt. Asked if he would write it off, he said: \u201cI\u2019m going to look at a whole range of options \u2026 because the system is collapsing.\u201d The leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, has said Labour must back an investment programme for Wales if it is to secure his party\u2019s support in the event of a hung parliament, PA reports. The party is launching its manifesto on Friday with a call for the Westminster government to allocate an additional 1% of GDP to invest in \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d over the next decade, allowing Wales to spend an additional \u00a315bn on green jobs, transport and energy. Price said Jeremy Corbyn would have to adopt the programme if Plaid Cymru \u2013 which had four MPs in the last parliament \u2013 were to help him enter No 10. \u201cIt has to be this investment programme. That has to be the key. Fair funding for Wales,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cWe want to make those investments in Wales. We don\u2019t want them done by, as Labour is suggesting, creating state-owned monopolies based outside of Wales. This is not much better than privately owned monopolies based outside of Wales.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has confirmed Conservative party plans to increase stamp duty for foreign buyers. Under the plan, those outside the UK will pay 3% more in the home purchase tax, he told BBC Breakfast. Sunak said: Today, if you are foreign company or someone living overseas, it is as easy to buy a property as it is for someone who is actually living here. We don\u2019t think that is right so we are saying we will have a 3% stamp duty surcharge on those foreign transactions. That should make housing more affordable especially for first-time buyers. Sunak could not confirm when the Conservative manifesto would be published. It is expected on Sunday, but Sunak said only that it would be published \u201csoon\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, Plaid Cymru will be launching its policies today with a promise for a \u00a320bn \u201cgreen jobs revolution\u201d. It will also be calling for another referendum on Brexit. As one of the pro-remain MPs, Plaid has struck a deal with the Lib Dems and the Greens, in which they will stand aside for each other. It means the party will get a clear run in seven seats. Under the deal, the Lib Dems will have clear air in three seats in Wales and the Greens in one. This foray into political ads from the Sun is getting a fair amount of traction on Twitter this morning. Nigel Farage is hoping to enlist the help of Donald Trump in a global campaign to plant billions of trees to capture CO2. The Brexit party leader, a friend of the US president, is due to make the announcement in Westminster on Friday as his party launches its version of an election manifesto. You can re-watch Farage\u2019s interview with Donald Trump below. What else is happening today? It\u2019s going to be a busy Friday for all the party leaders: The PM will campaign in Nottinghamshire, Corbyn will be in the Midlands. Jo Swinson will campaign in Glasgow after announcing yesterday that a Lib Dem government would commit to building 300,000 new homes a year. Scottish Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Brexit party are all scheduled to launch their policies today. A BBC Question Time special with the four major party leaders will air at 7pm. The one-off episode will be filmed in Sheffield, in which Johnson, Corbyn, Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon each have half-an-hour to debate with a live studio audience. Boris Johnson will be out on the campaign trail in Nottinghamshire today, no doubt trashing Labour\u2019s manifesto as unworkable, but also revealing a plan for a higher stamp duty rate for non-UK residents. The election pledge is most likely designed to link foreign purchasers to inflated property prices. Under a new Johnson government, they would pay an extra 3% stamp duty. It will apply to companies and individuals, and also to expats wanting to move back home. According to the Conservatives, as many as one in eight new London homes were bought by non-residents in 2014-16. The Conservatives estimate the measure will raise up to \u00a3120m, which would be directed at programmes to tackle rough sleeping. The stamp duty move follows Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge to build 150,000 council and social homes a year by the end of the next parliament. And at least one candidate is up early pushing the Tory line on housing. Robert Jenrick, the Tory candidate for Newark, who is standing for re-election, says \u201cmore homes of all types are built under @Conservatives\u201d. In a moment I\u2019ll bring you up to date on all the day\u2019s comings and goings with events planned for most parties, but first, let\u2019s have a quick look at the front pages \u2026 where Labour\u2019s manifesto is front and centre. Given the reaction of the business community, I\u2019m going to include some bonus business pages in today\u2019s press coverage roundup. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the general election. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I\u2019ll be steering you through this early part of the day before handing over to colleagues. As Labour embarks on its big sell of the party\u2019s manifesto, Jeremy Corbyn will be out and about in the Midlands today. He\u2019ll be urging people to register to vote this morning, before next Tuesday\u2019s deadline to get on the electoral roll (applications must be submitted by 11.59pm that day). He will tell people in Stoke that people need to sign up to achieve real change and \u201cmake sure their voice is heard\u201d. According to Corbyn, a whopping 9 million voters are still not registered. \u201cWe want to make the next five days the biggest voter registration drive that our country has ever seen,\u201d he will say. If you missed out on the detail of the manifesto, you can catch up here. My cheatsheet guide includes a huge investment in social housing, education, health, providing universal free broadband, a 5% pay rise for public sector workers, the nationalisation of rail, water and mail, and new powers to allow councils to take control of bus services. Total cost: \u00a382.9bn. There\u2019s plenty of analysis from the Guardian\u2019s experts and comment writers on the manifesto, including from Richard Partington (businesses say manifesto will suppress innovation and smother growth), John Crace (Corbyn has gone for broke). It will all provide fodder for when Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson appear tonight a special edition of the BBC\u2019s Question Time. So, as your captain says before takeoff: sit back, relax, and enjoy the (Friday) ride.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn would take a \u201cneutral stance\u201d in a future Brexit referendum, he has announced, after facing mounting pressure in recent days to pick a side. Appearing in a special BBC Question Time programme, in which Boris Johnson was attacked over racism and Jo Swinson found herself on the back foot over Brexit, Corbyn confirmed for the first time he would not campaign either for leave or remain. All the leaders faced robust questioning from the studio audience in Sheffield during the two-hour live debate, during which: Swinson faced sustained criticism over her record in the coalition and the Liberal Democrats\u2019 revoke article 50 policy. Johnson was challenged over his trustworthiness, accused of fomenting racism and questioned over an unpublished report on Russian interference. Corbyn was confronted over antisemitism and his sweeping renationalisation plans. The Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, confirmed she could support a Corbyn government in exchange for a Scottish independence referendum. Labour\u2019s Brexit policy is to negotiate a new deal within three months of coming to power \u2013 and then put it to a referendum, alongside an option to remain in the EU, within six months. Despite the vast majority of Labour members being pro-remain, Corbyn has always declined to say how he would campaign. He had previously suggested Labour\u2019s position would be determined at a special conference once a new Brexit deal had been agreed. He was pressed repeatedly about it by Johnson when the two men met for a head to head debate earlier this week \u2013 and the Tories had seized on his refusal to give an answer. When he was asked about it once again on Friday, the Labour leader revealed that his plan was to take a \u201cneutral stance\u201d. An article he wrote for the Guardian in September was seen as the strongest sign yet he would stay neutral, but he has until now refused to confirm his stance. The Labour leader later tweeted that his approach would be to act as an \u201chonest broker\u201d in a referendum, and \u201cnot campaign on either side\u201d. The prime minister, who appeared last of the four, was given few opportunities to rehearse his \u201cget Brexit done\u201d catchphrase. Instead, Johnson faced a string of questions about the state of the health service \u2013 and whether the public could trust him. He refused to apologise for his past newspaper articles, including a column that claimed women wearing burqas \u201clook like letter boxes,\u201d and another that referred to \u201ctank topped bumboys\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve written many millions of words as a journalist in my life, and I\u2019ve genuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go through all my articles with a fine tooth comb there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive.\u201d He added: \u201cI defend my right to speak out.\u201d Appearing on Sky News after the programme had aired, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, argued furiously over the records of their respective parties on racism. The pair appeared to square up to each other as McDonald accused Raab of kicking the issue of Islamophobia into the long grass. Raab responded: \u201cTwo parties in this country\u2019s history have been investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, Labour under Corbyn and the BNP.\u201d In the debate, Johnson also rejected the idea he had suppressed the intelligence and security commission\u2019s report into Russian interference, saying he had decided \u201ca while ago\u201d not to publish it immediately. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that I know of to show any interference in any British electoral event,\u201d he said, adding that the idea the referendum had been fixed in any way was \u201cBermuda triangle stuff\u201d. Pressed repeatedly about the funding squeeze facing the NHS, Johnson pointed out he had met many nurses and doctors since he became prime minister, and had plans to increase resources. \u201cYes of course I understand that things have been tough in the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the massive, massive demand that the NHS faces \u2013 but we can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy.\u201d Swinson faced a rough ride from the studio audience. As a former minister in the Conservative-led coalition government, she was asked about her party\u2019s support for policies including fracking and the bedroom tax. And she was ridiculed by one man for claiming during the early stages of the general election campaign that she could be prime minister \u2013 something she acknowledged had become more difficult since the Brexit party stood down in the Conservative-held seats the Lib Dems hoped to win. But she was unrepentant about the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit policy. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can accuse us of not being upfront about wanting to stop Brexit. We\u2019ve been crystal clear about that from the very beginning.\u201d And she insisted hers was the only party that could deprive the Tories of a majority. Before the event kicked off, a large crowd of supporters gathered to welcome Corbyn. The Labour leader stopped to speak to them, brandishing a copy of the party\u2019s manifesto. Once in the studio, Corbyn faced a tough grilling from the audience, with questions on issues including antisemitism, nationalisation and Brexit. One audience member raised the treatment of the Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, which subsequently led to the expulsion of the activist Marc Wadsworth from the party. Sturgeon, who spoke after Corbyn, confirmed she would be prepared to offer her party\u2019s support to a Labour government on an informal basis, in exchange for the confirmation that Labour would allow Scotland to hold another independence referendum. Corbyn had earlier said he would not support a poll in the first two or more years of the next parliament \u2013 and that he would first like the chance to implement the \u00a3100bn increase in investment Labour has promised for Scotland. Sturgeon suggested he might change his mind, faced with the prospect of being able to implement his programme for government. \u201cHaving heard Jeremy Corbyn, do you think he\u2019s going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, to stop universal credit, simply because he wants, for a couple of years, to prevent Scotland to have the right to self-determination?\u201d she said. \u201cJeremy Corbyn supports the right of self-determination for almost every other country in the world. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government on that issue.\u201d The Tories quickly seized on her remarks, retweeting a mock up of a poster with Corbyn peeking out of Sturgeon\u2019s pocket \u2013 an echo of a similar poster used against Ed Miliband in the 2015 general election campaign.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>There was a time whenever I felt ill, I would diagnose myself with something fatal. I once managed to spoil an entire Christmas by insisting I had mad cow disease \u2013 an episode that ended with admission to a mental hospital. (Thereby proving my point, I thought.) Curiously, now I\u2019m of an age when any symptoms are more likely to be serious, I find my hypochondria has morphed into hypochondria by proxy. It may yet be another form of projection or denial \u2013 life skills, I call them \u2013 but I spend more time worrying about others dying than I do about myself pegging out.</p> <p>My current obsession is our dog. Herbie is now eight years old, which means that statistically he probably only has between four and six years left. Traditionally dog years have been measured as seven human years, making Herbie still (just) younger than me. But scientists at the University of California havecome up with a more accurate formula for determining a dog\u2019s age based on the rate molecules are added to its DNA.</p> <p>Using this model of multiplying the natural logarithm of a dog\u2019s age by 16 and adding 31 (you\u2019ll have to take this on trust as the maths is beyond me), Herbie was apparently the equivalent of 30 in human years by the age of one. By the age of four, he was into his early 50s and is now well into his mid 60s. The only plus side to this, according to the graph, is that the rate of ageing in dogs slows significantly the older they get. Should Herbie make it to 14 in human years, he will still only be just over 70. Which makes me wonder why dogs don\u2019t actually live a great deal longer.</p> <p>I also can\u2019t help feeling that I may actually be on an inverse ageing curve to my dog. For years, I still vaguely felt as if I was in my 40s even when I was in my 50s. Now time seems to have raced past and I feel like I have caught up with my real age of 63. The trick is \u2013 like Herbie \u2013 to try and get time to stand still from now on.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/19/i-wouldnt-buy-a-used-car-from-either-readers-on-the-itv-election-debate\">ITV leaders\u2019 debate</a>, the media were parked in a side studio with a giant TV screen at one end from which we could follow the Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn exchanges taking place just a few metres away next door. The debate itself proved to be something of a non-event. The lasting memory was the contemptuous laughter from the audience directed at both politicians. The real fun kicked in once the programme was over and both Labour and the Tories wheeled out members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet into the spin room to try to convince everyone that their man had won.</p> <p>To be honest, they might as well have got it over and done with long before the debate had started. They\u2019d have said much the same thing and they could have all gone out to dinner. I am beginning to wonder, though, if someone at Conservative campaign headquarters doesn\u2019t have it in for the Tory chairman, James Cleverly. James isn\u2019t the sharpest mind in the cabinet \u2013 and we\u2019re including Liz Truss, Priti Patel and Matt Hancock in this \u2013 yet he is always sent out to be ripped apart by Emily Maitlis on Newsnight. Next time James, just say no. You\u2019ll feel a lot better about yourself.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Ten minutes before the start of the election debates I got a message that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-manager\">Spurs had sacked their manager</a>, Mauricio Pochettino. The news did not come as a total surprise as Tottenham have been fairly rubbish all season \u2013 something I have found vaguely reassuring as there is nothing worse than going to a game with a sense of hope. But I did have a feeling of loss. Pochettino has been by far the best manager the club has had in decades. But Poch\u2019s departure was nothing compared to the announcement that Jose Mourinho was to replace him. It\u2019s as if Spurs have gone out of their way to piss off every fan.

      "bodyText": "Monday There was a time whenever I felt ill, I would diagnose myself with something fatal. I once managed to spoil an entire Christmas by insisting I had mad cow disease \u2013 an episode that ended with admission to a mental hospital. (Thereby proving my point, I thought.) Curiously, now I\u2019m of an age when any symptoms are more likely to be serious, I find my hypochondria has morphed into hypochondria by proxy. It may yet be another form of projection or denial \u2013 life skills, I call them \u2013 but I spend more time worrying about others dying than I do about myself pegging out. My current obsession is our dog. Herbie is now eight years old, which means that statistically he probably only has between four and six years left. Traditionally dog years have been measured as seven human years, making Herbie still (just) younger than me. But scientists at the University of California havecome up with a more accurate formula for determining a dog\u2019s age based on the rate molecules are added to its DNA. Using this model of multiplying the natural logarithm of a dog\u2019s age by 16 and adding 31 (you\u2019ll have to take this on trust as the maths is beyond me), Herbie was apparently the equivalent of 30 in human years by the age of one. By the age of four, he was into his early 50s and is now well into his mid 60s. The only plus side to this, according to the graph, is that the rate of ageing in dogs slows significantly the older they get. Should Herbie make it to 14 in human years, he will still only be just over 70. Which makes me wonder why dogs don\u2019t actually live a great deal longer. I also can\u2019t help feeling that I may actually be on an inverse ageing curve to my dog. For years, I still vaguely felt as if I was in my 40s even when I was in my 50s. Now time seems to have raced past and I feel like I have caught up with my real age of 63. The trick is \u2013 like Herbie \u2013 to try and get time to stand still from now on. Tuesday For the ITV leaders\u2019 debate, the media were parked in a side studio with a giant TV screen at one end from which we could follow the Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn exchanges taking place just a few metres away next door. The debate itself proved to be something of a non-event. The lasting memory was the contemptuous laughter from the audience directed at both politicians. The real fun kicked in once the programme was over and both Labour and the Tories wheeled out members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet into the spin room to try to convince everyone that their man had won. To be honest, they might as well have got it over and done with long before the debate had started. They\u2019d have said much the same thing and they could have all gone out to dinner. I am beginning to wonder, though, if someone at Conservative campaign headquarters doesn\u2019t have it in for the Tory chairman, James Cleverly. James isn\u2019t the sharpest mind in the cabinet \u2013 and we\u2019re including Liz Truss, Priti Patel and Matt Hancock in this \u2013 yet he is always sent out to be ripped apart by Emily Maitlis on Newsnight. Next time James, just say no. You\u2019ll feel a lot better about yourself. Wednesday Ten minutes before the start of the election debates I got a message that Spurs had sacked their manager, Mauricio Pochettino. The news did not come as a total surprise as Tottenham have been fairly rubbish all season \u2013 something I have found vaguely reassuring as there is nothing worse than going to a game with a sense of hope. But I did have a feeling of loss. Pochettino has been by far the best manager the club has had in decades. But Poch\u2019s departure was nothing compared to the announcement that Jose Mourinho was to replace him. It\u2019s as if Spurs have gone out of their way to piss off every fan. Even though we haven\u2019t won anything other than a League Cup this century, we always considered ourselves lucky not to have been managed by Mourinho, whose negative style of football and hatred of young players was the opposite of everything we held dear. It seems odd for Tottenham to have declared that the club\u2019s hand was forced because \u201cthe dressing-room had become toxic\u201d only to appoint a manager with a track record of leaving every club a far more toxic place than he found it. Mourinho says he wants to spread the love and that he is a reformed character. But apparently he also said that to Manchester United before he helped tip them into a downward spiral. I guess I may eventually warm to Mourinho if we win something \u2013 blood being thicker than water and all that \u2013 but right now I\u2019d have settled for relegation under Poch. Weirdly, I still count the season Spurs spent in the second division in the late 70s as among my happiest footballing memories. At least then there was a nobility \u2013 a purity \u2013 to the suffering. The thought of Mourinho makes me feel a little grubby.

His victory was the product not of a movement but a moment. He emerged at a time when social democratic parties across the west were being crushed because they had provided inadequate responses to a generation of wage stagnation, deregulation and neoliberalism, more than a decade of war, five years of crisis and austerity and an ever-intensifying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/30/two-thirds-of-britons-agree-planet-is-in-a-climate-emergency\" title=\"\">climate emergency</a>.</p> \n<p>The issue was whether the centre left was capable of providing a vision of society in which the poor did not pay for the crisis of the rich, the weak would not be scapegoated for the follies of the powerful and the planet did not pay for everything. Corbyn won not because he had all \u2013 or even any \u2013 of the answers, but because he was at least prepared to put the questions. He stood for more than office. Elected the year before Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, his unlikely ascent did not spark the crisis in Labour\u2019s relevance; it was a response to it.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-to-slap-11bn-tax-on-oil-and-gas-firms-to-fund-green-plan\" title=\"\">Labour manifesto</a>, released on Thursday, exemplifies why a course correction was both urgent and necessary. It does not justify everything the party has or hasn\u2019t done over the past four years. What it does do is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-election-corbyn\" title=\"\">elevate the electoral conversation</a> beyond Corbyn the individual, to the set of priorities, values and interests that his election as leader represented.</p> \n<p>For most of my political life, Labour has attempted to cattle-prod me to the polls with the threat that if it lost, things would be much worse. It is a relief to have a party woo me with the notion that if it wins things could get much better. The party\u2019s commitment to taxing the oil companies to green the economy, taxing the tech giants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/18/broadband-communism-founding-nhs\" title=\"\">pay for broadband</a>, nationalising the railways, building council houses and offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/labour-pledge-we-would-give-six-years-of-free-study-for-adults\" title=\"\">free training for adults</a> are changes I would like to see and would be prepared to pay my share for. Moreover, they are underpinned by values that have people rather than profit at their centre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"24e26e95-41f8-4972-a832-e738993b5850\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SmBBpulqb3w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A manifesto of this nature expands the sense not only of what is desirable but what might be possible. It forces other parties and commentators to explain why they don\u2019t want those things or aren\u2019t prepared to prioritise them. They will vacillate between claiming that Labour cannot pay for its promises, and complaining that they don\u2019t like how it will pay for its promises, and insisting that the promises are undesirable, untenable or unworkable. Predictably, the very party that squandered more than \u00a32bn on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/chancellor-commits-another-2bn-for-no-deal-brexit-planning\" title=\"\">preparations for a no-deal Brexit</a> and \u00a31bn for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/19/dup-bung-schools-hospitals-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">support of the Democratic Unionist party</a> will inevitably cry profligacy.</p> \n<p>Those who claim it will wreck the economy must consider who, ultimately, this economy is for. When the fifth-richest country in the world cannot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/14/uk-holiday-hunger-schemes-deprived-children-summer\" title=\"\">feed its children</a>, house its working poor or treat its sick, its economy is already wrecked. Those who lamented the choice in candidates on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson-tv-debate-watched-by-67-million-people\" title=\"\">debate stage on Tuesday</a> now have the opportunity to contemplate the choice in agendas \u2013 to reflect not simply on who will win, but on what might change. The manifesto will primarily be understood in the context of the next three weeks. That is understandable. The point is not to lay out these plans and start a conversation, but to get people to vote for them and start a transformation. The manifesto\u2019s proposals will be polled, its inconsistencies pored over, its arithmetic scrutinised.</p> \n<p>In 2017, the manifesto marked a shift on the doorstep. When people complained about Corbyn, canvassers could pivot to the policies. Often, it turned out, voters liked what he would do more than they disliked him. For the first time since his election many party members emerged from their defensive crouch and advocated not necessarily for him, but for the agenda that made him possible.</p> \n<p>But while the electoral impact of these manifestos are important they are essentially political documents. If there\u2019s a serious criticism of Labour to be made here, it\u2019s that too little of substance has emerged between the last manifesto and this one to remind us what the party is for and why we should care what it does. In the words of Lynton Crosby, the Australian consultant who shapes Conservative electoral strategy: \u201cYou can\u2019t fatten the pig on market day.\u201d The case against poverty and inequality, militarism and bigotry, must be made constantly and consistently, not presented as a one-off party trick.</p> \n<p>There is a significant, if dormant, constituency for that discussion. On the day the 2017 manifesto came out, I sat in on a focus group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/29/harrow-west-labour-leaning-focus-group-may-not-be-all-it-seems\" title=\"\">undecided voters from Harrow</a>, north London. That day Sarah (she withheld her second name) had driven to London from Edinburgh, where she had been visiting her mum, listening to the radio as she travelled. Taxing people more for earning more than \u00a380,000 seemed reasonable to her. \u201cThings have swung too far the wrong way,\u201d she said, setting the tone for the group. It was time to \u201cmake things fairer\u201d. Debbie was broadly in agreement: \u201cWe need to show people we care about them.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the press deplored this descent into socialist orthodoxy and Marxist dogma \u2013 and almost certainly will again \u2013 the reception around the table was far more tempered and sympathetic. Debbie and Sarah weren\u2019t just commenting on the coming election \u2013 they were talking about the accumulated decay of the previous decade and how it might be reversed. As a country, they thought we could do better. One of the casualties of the media\u2019s chronic lack of curiosity about Corbyn\u2019s appeal both within and outside the Labour party was the portrayal of his support base as swivel-eyed and hard-headed, when it has always been far more relatable and less ideological.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-election-corbyn\">Labour\u2019s electrifying manifesto should jolt this election into life | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is not 2017. We don\u2019t know what effect this manifesto will have. We shouldn\u2019t assume it will be the same. The Tories have a different leader; Brexit is a different beast; public perception of Corbyn has shifted; traditional allegiances are softening. Anything could happen.</p> \n<p>But the one thing that has happened is the presentation of an alternative.

He emerged at a time when social democratic parties across the west were being crushed because they had provided inadequate responses to a generation of wage stagnation, deregulation and neoliberalism, more than a decade of war, five years of crisis and austerity and an ever-intensifying climate emergency. The issue was whether the centre left was capable of providing a vision of society in which the poor did not pay for the crisis of the rich, the weak would not be scapegoated for the follies of the powerful and the planet did not pay for everything. Corbyn won not because he had all \u2013 or even any \u2013 of the answers, but because he was at least prepared to put the questions. He stood for more than office. Elected the year before Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, his unlikely ascent did not spark the crisis in Labour\u2019s relevance; it was a response to it. The Labour manifesto, released on Thursday, exemplifies why a course correction was both urgent and necessary. It does not justify everything the party has or hasn\u2019t done over the past four years. What it does do is elevate the electoral conversation beyond Corbyn the individual, to the set of priorities, values and interests that his election as leader represented. For most of my political life, Labour has attempted to cattle-prod me to the polls with the threat that if it lost, things would be much worse. It is a relief to have a party woo me with the notion that if it wins things could get much better. The party\u2019s commitment to taxing the oil companies to green the economy, taxing the tech giants to pay for broadband, nationalising the railways, building council houses and offering free training for adults are changes I would like to see and would be prepared to pay my share for. Moreover, they are underpinned by values that have people rather than profit at their centre. A manifesto of this nature expands the sense not only of what is desirable but what might be possible. It forces other parties and commentators to explain why they don\u2019t want those things or aren\u2019t prepared to prioritise them. They will vacillate between claiming that Labour cannot pay for its promises, and complaining that they don\u2019t like how it will pay for its promises, and insisting that the promises are undesirable, untenable or unworkable. Predictably, the very party that squandered more than \u00a32bn on preparations for a no-deal Brexit and \u00a31bn for the support of the Democratic Unionist party will inevitably cry profligacy. Those who claim it will wreck the economy must consider who, ultimately, this economy is for. When the fifth-richest country in the world cannot feed its children, house its working poor or treat its sick, its economy is already wrecked. Those who lamented the choice in candidates on the debate stage on Tuesday now have the opportunity to contemplate the choice in agendas \u2013 to reflect not simply on who will win, but on what might change. The manifesto will primarily be understood in the context of the next three weeks. That is understandable. The point is not to lay out these plans and start a conversation, but to get people to vote for them and start a transformation. The manifesto\u2019s proposals will be polled, its inconsistencies pored over, its arithmetic scrutinised. In 2017, the manifesto marked a shift on the doorstep. When people complained about Corbyn, canvassers could pivot to the policies. Often, it turned out, voters liked what he would do more than they disliked him. For the first time since his election many party members emerged from their defensive crouch and advocated not necessarily for him, but for the agenda that made him possible. But while the electoral impact of these manifestos are important they are essentially political documents. If there\u2019s a serious criticism of Labour to be made here, it\u2019s that too little of substance has emerged between the last manifesto and this one to remind us what the party is for and why we should care what it does. In the words of Lynton Crosby, the Australian consultant who shapes Conservative electoral strategy: \u201cYou can\u2019t fatten the pig on market day.\u201d The case against poverty and inequality, militarism and bigotry, must be made constantly and consistently, not presented as a one-off party trick. There is a significant, if dormant, constituency for that discussion. On the day the 2017 manifesto came out, I sat in on a focus group of undecided voters from Harrow, north London. That day Sarah (she withheld her second name) had driven to London from Edinburgh, where she had been visiting her mum, listening to the radio as she travelled. Taxing people more for earning more than \u00a380,000 seemed reasonable to her. \u201cThings have swung too far the wrong way,\u201d she said, setting the tone for the group. It was time to \u201cmake things fairer\u201d. Debbie was broadly in agreement: \u201cWe need to show people we care about them.\u201d While the press deplored this descent into socialist orthodoxy and Marxist dogma \u2013 and almost certainly will again \u2013 the reception around the table was far more tempered and sympathetic. Debbie and Sarah weren\u2019t just commenting on the coming election \u2013 they were talking about the accumulated decay of the previous decade and how it might be reversed. As a country, they thought we could do better. One of the casualties of the media\u2019s chronic lack of curiosity about Corbyn\u2019s appeal both within and outside the Labour party was the portrayal of his support base as swivel-eyed and hard-headed, when it has always been far more relatable and less ideological. This is not 2017. We don\u2019t know what effect this manifesto will have. We shouldn\u2019t assume it will be the same. The Tories have a different leader; Brexit is a different beast; public perception of Corbyn has shifted; traditional allegiances are softening. Anything could happen. But the one thing that has happened is the presentation of an alternative. Living at a time when many find it easier to imagine the end of the world as we know it than the end of capitalism as we know it, that is no small thing. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

David Hare, the group\u2019s chief executive, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labour\u2019s stance of removing the independent sector from the NHS is deeply misguided and would significantly undermine patients\u2019 ability to get the care they need. </p> \n   <p>Rather than improve patients\u2019 access to care, removing the independent sector from NHS service delivery would dramatically lengthen waiting times and add millions to NHS waiting lists. For planned care, where over four million patients are waiting for treatment today, the NHS would need to build the equivalent of 42 extra hospitals just to stand still \u2013 a complete waste of taxpayers\u2019 money.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The IHPN\u2019s members include some of the biggest private providers of NHS care, such as Care UK, BMI Healthcare, InHealth and Newmedica. </p> \n  <p>The Labour manifesto says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Every penny spent on privatisation and outsourcing is a penny less spent on patient care. Labour will end and reverse privatisation in the NHS in the next parliament.

We will end the requirement on health authorities to put services out to competitive tender. We will ensure services are delivered in-house and also bring subsidiary companies back in-house. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge seems to go further than what John McDonell, the shadow chancellor, said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show on 3 November. In that interview, McDonnell seemed to acknowledge that some NHS contracts with private firms may not have run out by the end of a five-year Labour government. </p> \n  <p>Some contracts last up to 10 years.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is impossible to understate just how extraordinary this manifesto is just in terms of the sheer scale of money being spent and raised through the tax system: hundreds of billions of additional spending on investment, \u00a380bn plus per year on spending on day to day things, social security, spending on the NHS, student loans and so on, and matched by supposedly an \u00a380bn increase in tax.</p> \n   <p>These are vast numbers, enormous, colossal, in the context of anything we\u2019ve seen in the last - ever, really.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if it would be possible to spend this amount of money with tax increases just affecting businesses and the richest 5% of individuals, as Labour claims, Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Labour manifesto suggests they want to raise \u00a380bn of tax revenue, and they suggest that all of that will come from companies and people earning over \u00a380,000 a year. That is simply not credible. We cannot raise that kind of money in our tax system without affecting individuals.</p> \n   <p>Obviously corporate tax affects individuals anyway. Someone has to pay that tax. But if you\u2019re looking about transforming society, which the Labour party is absolutely up front about doing, then you need to pay for it. And it can\u2019t be someone else who pays for it.

Instead he just claimed that Corbyn\u2019s plans did not have any \u201ceconomic credibility\u201d because of the uncertainty about his Brexit policy.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>None of it has any credibility whatever because the whole at the heart of Labour\u2019s manifesto - this was the moment, it was \u2018Lights, camera, action\u2019, Corbyn comes centre stage, drumroll, and he completely misses his cue - because what we want to know is what is his plan to deliver to Brexit, and what\u2019s the deal he wants to do, and which side would be vote on that deal, and we still don\u2019t know. Until we have answers to those questions, until we get Brexit done, none of this carries any economic credibility whatever.</p> \n   <p>And I contrast our approach. We\u2019ve got a deal, ready to go. Put it in the oven, it\u2019s done, we\u2019re through by January. We get on with our ambitions for the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although Johnson is right to say Corbyn has not said whether he would campaign for remain or leave in a second referendum, the main thrust of his argument is not correct. There may be reasons why the manifesto plans lack economic credibility, but they are mostly not related to Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, which would involve the UK deciding between remain and a soft Brexit next summer. This creates uncertainty. But there is also some uncertainty as to what sort of trade deal with the EU a Johnson government would negotiate, and whether or not there would be a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition in December 2020.</p> \n  <p>The official CCHQ response to the Labour manifesto does have a line about how Labour\u2019s plans would involve \u201ca reckless spending spree which would take a sledgehammer to the British economy and cost every taxpayer \u00a32,400 a year\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/will-labour-plans-really-cost-each-taxpayer-2400\">(this figure is unfounded)</a>, but, interestingly, the Tory press notice also focuses mostly on Corbyn\u2019s position on Brexit and on the threat of a second Scottish independence referendum.</p> \n  <p>It may be the case that the Tories are wary of attacking Labour over taxation and spending because they think the Labour plans are popular. Or it may just be that they think Brexit is their best attack line against Labour, and they want to use it at every opportunity.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19443811-8da9-4ffb-91f5-6b4abf6453e7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jDoA0yC0bWE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T17:27:57.149Z\">at 5.27pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd69c818f087b800b61e6bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T14:25:24.336Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At Holyrood, first minister\u2019s questions did not touch directly on the election, but the session did go nuclear. </p> \n  <p>First, SNP MSP <strong>Jenny Gilruth</strong> gave <strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong>the opportunity to answer the question posed to Jo Swinson in the ITV Leaders\u2019 Interviews on Tuesday: would you use nuclear weapons? </p> \n  <p>While Swinson attracted much criticism for her short and direct \u201cYes\u201d, Sturgeon gave a similarly direct \u201cNo\u201d, describing nuclear weapons as \u201cimmoral, ineffective and a waste of money\u201d. </p> \n  <p>She was later asked by <strong>Mark Ruskell</strong> of the Scottish Greens about the costly 15-year delay in decommissioning nuclear submarines at Rosyth dockyard in Fife. Ruskell wanted to know \u201cwhat the Scottish government could do to free up the yard for low-carbon shipbuilding ... while removing those weapons from Jo Swinson\u2019s reach\u201d. After some laughter in the chamber, Sturgeon reiterated that she did not want Scotland to be home to WMD. </p> \n  <p>This is especially pertinent today given that Labour\u2019s manifesto includes a commitment to Trident renewal (we\u2019ll find out the Scottish Labour policy at their manifesto launch tomorrow, as it has diverged from the UK position in the past). And the SNP leadership has said previously that removing the weapons from Scotland could be a red line in any post-election negotiations (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/snp-no-deal-made-with-labour-on-scottish-referendum-says-nicola-sturgeon\">my report</a> yesterday for where we\u2019ve got to on this between Labour and the SNP).</p> \n  <p>And talking of Labour\u2019s manifesto, it is noteworthy that it has retained the rather vague guarantee not to agree to a section 30 order request for the powers to hold a second independence referendum \u201cin the early years of a Labour government\u201d.

Many analysts would say that is what happened to Labour in 1987 and in 2017. Arguably it also happened to Labour in 1992 and to the Conservatives in 2005. And it is possible that the same thing might happen again.</p> \n  <p>Up to now Labour has had a good campaign. As <strong>Alex Wickham</strong> reports <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/tories-losing-the-media-labour-policy-winning\">in a recent BuzzFeed feature on jitters in the Conservative camp</a>, Labour \u201cwon the media narrative almost every day\u201d in the first two weeks of the campaign. It has been announcing detailed policy, and holding press conferences. The Conservative campaign is wholly dependent on Boris Johnson who is running mostly on negative claims about Labour and on a pledge to get Brexit done whose credibility is open to question. But the Tories are still leading comfortably in the polls.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn in full campaign mode is a much more impressive figure than he was when elected party leader four years ago and at the manifesto launch this morning he put on a confident performance. In the election two years ago the publication of the manifestos marked the moment when support for the Tories started to sink, and Labour\u2019s ratings started to go up. We don\u2019t know yet whether the same thing will happen this time around (the Tory manifesto is due out in the next few days), but Corbyn certainly had a distinctive pitch this morning.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from his speech and Q&amp;A.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn urged people to judge the value of Labour\u2019s \u201cmanifesto for hope\u201d by the fact that it is getting so much opposition from \u201cthe bankers, the billionaires and the establishment\u201d</strong>.

Most high street ATMs are run by private, third-party companies that are focused on the bottom line and profit margins rather than public access. Put simply, if they don\u2019t make enough money, those ATMs start disappearing altogether. </p> \n  <p>Natalie Ceeney, the author of the Access to Cash Review, has warned that Britain\u2019s cash infrastructure network is \u201cvery, very fragile,\u201d and that taking out another brick from the teetering Jenga tower \u2013 like rural ATMs \u2013 could bring us one step closer to its collapse. </p> \n  <p>ATM companies such as NoteMachine and Cardtronics make money by charging banks a fee every time customers take out cash, but consumers are taking out less money at ATMs and opting for contactless payments for small purchases instead. Banks have also negotiated cuts to their fees in recent years. </p> \n  <p>So if ATM operators feel they aren\u2019t making enough money from one of their cash machines, they\u2019ll start charging customers a withdrawal fee to make up the difference. If that fails to bring in enough cash, operators may remove cash machine altogether, creating ATM \u201cdeserts\u201d.</p> \n  <p>There is a risk a ban on fees could just speed up the whole process. </p> \n  <p>But Labour\u2019s ATM policy should be considered alongside others including plans to stop bank branch closures, and create a Post Bank within the Post Office Network that would be likely to maintain access to cash in rural communities, even if those private ATM operators decide to pack up and leave. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T13:00:30.540Z\">at 1.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd684608f083aa6d578851a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jillian-ambrose\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T12:39:20.803Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour manifesto: big six energy companies to have their supply divisions nationalised</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Labour party will push ahead with plans to nationalise the energy supply arms of the Big Six energy companies.

Employees still paying NICs would save \u00a385 year.</p> \n  <p>The IFS also says that 16m households \u201cwould gain by \u00a3150 a year on average, since many households have more than one earner.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But \u201cmost of the benefits [from the policy] would go to middle and high-income households\u201d, the IFS says.</p> \n  <p>This is from <strong>Xiaowei Xu,</strong> a research economist at the IFS.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Successive governments have fixated on income tax at the expense of NICs, for example by raising the personal allowance while doing nothing to NICs thresholds. The attention to NICs is therefore both welcome and overdue. That said, if the intention is to help the lowest-paid, raising the NICs threshold is an extremely blunt instrument.</p> \n   <p>Only 3% of the total gains from raising NICs thresholds accrues to the poorest fifth of all households \u2013 and only 8% to the poorest fifth of working households. The government could target low-earning families much more effectively by raising in-work benefits, which would deliver far higher benefits to the lowest-paid for a fraction of the cost to government \u2013 but at the expense of expanding means-testing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfaf478d03a15f411b0e867a072f3a45b6f7afb3\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfaf478d03a15f411b0e867a072f3a45b6f7afb3/0_0_822_544/500.jpg\" alt=\"Distributional impact assessment of Tory NIC cut\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distributional impact assessment of Tory NIC cut</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T10:44:59.555Z\">at 10.44am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd6643c8f080fd59fb14715\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T10:19:37.460Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> and his shadow cabinet have arrived for the launch of the Labour manifesto in Birmingham.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2a633ae25b891bc4252569809ee9f0910cde682\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a633ae25b891bc4252569809ee9f0910cde682/61_0_853_512/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with his shadow cabinet\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn with his shadow cabinet</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dd661188f083aa6d57883b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T10:06:03.993Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from Sky\u2019s <strong>Sam Coates</strong>, setting out exactly what Boris Johnson said about the proposed Tory tax cut yesterday and how CCHQ\u2019s own briefing points out that what he said was wrong.

By the mid 2020s this discount could apply to up to 19,000 homes, the Tories say.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Lifetime rental deposits</strong>.

But he will concentrate much of his speech on those who won\u2019t be supporting his party\u2019s programme, \u201cthe rich and the powerful\u201d, arguing that the strength of their opposition to him shows how serious he is about change.</p> \n  <p>It is a clever attempt to leverage the extreme criticism he is facing (which is probably as intense as anything directed at any Labour leader in modern times) to his own advantage.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract from the speech released overnight by the party. Corbyn will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a manifesto of hope. A manifesto that will bring real change. A manifesto full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation. Those policies are fully costed, with no tax increases for 95% of taxpayers.</p> \n   <p>Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. That it\u2019s too much for you. Because they don\u2019t want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It\u2019s rigged in their favour.<br></p> \n   <p>But it\u2019s not working for you. If your wages never seem to go up and your bills never seem to go down, if your public services only seem to get worse, despite the heroic efforts of those who work in them, then it\u2019s not working for you ...<br></p> \n   <p>The US president who led his country out of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt, had to take on the rich and powerful in America to do it. That\u2019s why he said: \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me, and I welcome their hatred.\u201d</p> \n   <p>He knew that when you\u2019re serious about real change, those who profit from a rigged system, who squirrel away the wealth created by millions of people, won\u2019t give up without a fight.<br></p> \n   <p>So I accept the implacable opposition and hostility of the rich and powerful is inevitable.<br></p> \n   <p>I accept the opposition of the billionaires because we will make those at the top pay their fair share of tax to help fund world-class public services for you. That\u2019s real change.<br></p> \n   <p>I accept the hostility of the bad bosses paying poverty pay because we will give Britain a pay rise, starting with a real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour, including for young workers. That\u2019s real change.<br></p> \n   <p>I accept the implacable opposition of the dodgy landlords because we\u2019ll build a million homes, empower tenants and control rents. That\u2019s real change.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>I accept the hostility of the big polluters because we will make sure they pay their fair share of the costs of their destruction, create huge numbers of climate jobs and build the healthy, green economy of the future. That\u2019s real change.<br></p> \n   <p>I accept the fierce opposition of the giant healthcare corporations because we will stop them sucking out profits from our NHS. That\u2019s real change.<br></p> \n   <p>I accept the hostility of the privatised utilities companies because we will stop their great rip-off by bringing rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and running them for the people. That\u2019s real change.<br></p> \n   <p>And here\u2019s a brand new one: I accept the implacable opposition of the private internet providers because we\u2019re going to give you the very fastest full fibre broadband for free.

The saving from the specific pledge announced by the Tories, raising the threshold to \u00a39,500, is only about \u00a3100.

<span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning and welcome to all things politics for today. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I will be guiding you through the first hour or so of today\u2019s coverage. So let\u2019s get into it.</p> \n  <p>The big set-piece event of the day is Jeremy Corbyn launching Labour\u2019s manifesto in Birmingham this morning. Its centrepiece is the party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/labour-to-unveil-75bn-social-housing-plan-to-build-for-the-many\">big promise on social housing</a> ... to the tune of \u00a375bn in a promise to \u201cbuild for the many\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn will pledge to be \u201con your side\u201d, including promising to build 100,000 council houses a year and 50,000 social homes through housing associations by the end of its first term. That\u2019s a massive jump from the 6,287 council homes built in 2018-19.</p> \n  <p>No doubt Labour hopes this pitch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/labour-targets-renters-with-pledge-of-100000-council-houses-a-year\">will appeal to the almost 1.6m families raising children in rented homes</a>. </p> \n  <p>And how will the pledge it be paid for? The money is earmarked to come out of the recently announced \u00a3150bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d.</p> \n  <p>You can see the Guardian\u2019s fact check on whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/is-labours-pledge-to-build-100000-council-houses-achievable\">the numbers stack up here.</a></p> \n  <p>(Not to be outdone on housing, the Tories will announce their \u201cfairer deal for renters\u201d today, so stay tuned for that.) </p> \n  <p>Another big set piece in the manifesto is Labour\u2019s promise to create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-promises-1m-green-jobs-to-tackle-climate-crisis\">million green jobs</a> to tackle the climate crisis. New jobs will be promised in insulation upgrade projects, offshore wind and carbon capture developments. As the Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor writes: \u201cThe focus on tackling climate change while also supporting mass job creation is likely to be a resolution of tension between ambitious de-carbonisation targets set by Labour activists at the autumn party conference and union concerns about job losses.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a977323e37546859ba714c1347c45cfb56b3f8a0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a977323e37546859ba714c1347c45cfb56b3f8a0/0_371_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn will launch Labour\u2019s election manifesto in Birmingham this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn will launch Labour\u2019s election manifesto in Birmingham this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>According to the Press Association, the manifesto will also include plans to renationalise key utilities, following a pledge to take part of BT into public ownership to deliver free full-fibre broadband for all, as well as promises to significantly boost NHS spending.</p> \n  <p>So stay tuned for a day of announcements. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-21T08:39:51.458Z\">at 8.39am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has launched the most radical and potentially transformative manifesto published by a mainstream party in decades in what is potentially a make-or-break moment for Labour in the election campaign. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the non-partisan tax and spending thinktank, said that it does not believe Labour\u2019s claim that it will be able to achieve everything it plans with 95% of taxpayers not having to pay any extra in tax. Labour has said public sector workers would get a pay rise worth more than \u00a31,600 on average from April under its plans. Boris Johnson has attacked the Labour manifesto by claiming that Jeremy Corbyn does not have any \u201ceconomic credibility\u201d because of the uncertainty about his Brexit policy. Overseas residents and companies buying properties in the UK will be forced to pay more stamp duty under Conservative proposals. On top of any private sector homes built, Labour has committed to building 150,000 a year in its manifesto while the Lib Dems have pledged to building 300,000 new homes a year. British orphans whose parents died in Syria are being repatriated to the UK, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said.The announcement follows a tweet from the Kurdish administration in Syria that suggested three children were handed to the UK authorities. A website purporting to showcase Labour\u2019s manifesto but which instead attacks the party\u2019s policies has been set up by the Conservatives just days after the party faced criticism for misleading the public with a similar stunt. The UK\u2019s GDP growth rate will slip to 1% next year even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, according to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation. Boris Johnson and his staff were given compulsory training on the importance of acknowledging personal friendships months before he met the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, and just after he was rebuked for failing to declare an interest with another woman, the Guardian can reveal. A new rule banning microtargeting in political adverts will have minimal impact in the UK, the Guardian has learned, because the majority of political advertisers do not use the tools anyway. Barry Gardiner, Labour\u2019s candidate in Brent North, discussing his party\u2019s manifesto on BBC\u2019s Newsnight. Overseas residents and companies buying properties in the UK will be forced to pay more stamp duty under Conservative proposals to help more Britons get on the housing ladder. Buyers who are not tax resident in the UK will be made to pay a higher rate of stamp duty land tax if the Tories win a majority at the election. The surcharge will be levied on top of all other stamp duty payable and charged at 3 per cent. The party estimates the measure will raise up to \u00a3120 million a year, which would be directed at programmes to tackle rough sleeping. Currently, people who reside abroad and companies can buy homes as easily as UK residents. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, said: \u201cThe Conservative Party is levelling up opportunities across the country, helping millions of people into home ownership. \u201cEvidence shows that by adding significant amounts of demand to limited housing supply, purchases by non-residents inflate house prices. \u201cThat is why we are introducing a higher rate of stamp duty for non-UK residents that will help to address this issue and could raise up to \u00a3120 million.\u201d The Lib Dems\u2019 Chuka Umunna and housing secretary Robert Jenrick clash over the issue of public trust in politicians. Richard Burgon, Labour\u2019s candidate for Leeds East, on the party\u2019s manifesto. Jeremy Corbyn has tweeted about Boris Johnson not participating in a leaders\u2019 debate which had ben scheduled for Sunday. Meanwhile, the first ever election leaders\u2019 debate focusing on the climate crisis will be broadcast by Channel 4 next week with the prime minister the only major party leader set to be absent. Channel 4 News said it was awaiting confirmation from Johnson as to whether he would take part and could place an empty chair in the place of the PM if he declines to attend. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/boris-johnson-election-leaders-debate-climate-crisis Housing secretary Robert Jenrick on Question Time on his party\u2019s strategy.

Friday\u2019s Mirror front page Tomorrow\u2019s Financial Times front page The Times is also splashing on Labour\u2019s election manifesto. Friday\u2019s Daily Express front page SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon believes Scotland does not want to leave the EU and she still wants to hold an independence referendum in 2020. She told BBC Scotland that the way to solve the country\u2019s \u201cproblem of having our future determined by Westminster\u201d was to be independent. \u201cThe UK is in a mess right now \u2013 it\u2019s not a mess of my making, and it\u2019s got to plot its way out of that.\u201d The i\u2019s front page for Friday The Liberal Democrats have committed to building 300,000 new homes a year. A third of the homes planned by the Lib Dems would be social rented homes, with a 10 billion capital infrastructure investment to support this. Labour has committed to building 150,000 a year in its manifesto, two-thirds of which would be council houses, with the rest being \u201cgenuinely affordable homes\u201d. Meanwhile, the Conservatives said they would build \u201cat least\u201d a million more homes in the next parliament - a move housing charity Shelter said would be a \u201csignificant disappointment to many\u201d as it is actually 100,000 fewer than the current target. The Lib Dems would also set up a \u201cRent to Own\u201d model for social housing and providing government-backed tenancy deposit loans for all first-time renters under 30. The party\u2019s housing spokesman Tim Farron said the Lib Dems are \u201cthe only party with a bold plan to build a brighter future for all.\u201d He added: \u201cWhether renting or buying, across the country too many people - people who work hard and play by the rules - are struggling to afford good homes in the right location. We are facing a national housing crisis. \u201cTo meet demand we need to build 300,000 homes a year. Both Labour and the Tories, in pursuing Brexit, show they are willing to risk 10% of our construction workers who are from the EU, making this crisis worse. \u201cLiberal Democrats will build 100,000 social homes for rent every year, to ensure that everybody has a safe and secure home. We will tackle rogue landlords with mandatory licensing, and promote long-term lettings. \u201cWe will also tackle wasted vacant housing stock by allowing local authorities to increase council tax by up to 500% where homes are left empty for more than six months.\u201d Friday\u2019s Guardian front page Tomorrow\u2019s Indy front page Friday\u2019s City AM front page Tomorrow\u2019s front pages are starting to filter through, starting with the Telegraph Sir Keir Starmer has said Britain \u201cwon\u2019t go back to normal\u201d after Brexit or whether there is a vote to remain. During a meeting in support of Edinburgh Labour candidate Ian Murray, the shadow Brexit secretary said regardless of the decision made after his party\u2019s proposed second referendum, the country will remain divided. The claim comes on the same day his party released its manifesto with a promise to negotiate a new deal with the EU and hold a second referendum on the issue within six months. The shadow Brexit secretary said the only way to unite the country will be to take action to ensure people no longer feel disenfranchised. Sir Keir told the meeting: \u201cAnybody who thinks that the deal with Europe is going to resolve the issue, needs to think again. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be resolved. There isn\u2019t going to be a happy day, when it\u2019s either the deal or remain is decided and it just goes back to normal. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d Brexit Party candidate Ann Widdecombe has repeated her claims that she was offered a role by the Conservatives in the Brexit negotiations if she stood down in the general election in an interview on LBC. In response, the Lib Dem\u2019s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the allegation \u201cmust be added to the police investigation into whether peerages were offered to Brexit Party candidates to stand down\u201d. Last week, Boris Johnson said claims that Brexit Party election candidates had been offered peerages to encourage them to stand down were \u201cnonsense\u201d. Robbie Williams has disclosed he will be voting for the first time in the upcoming election and believes it will be an entertaining outcome. The singer said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly say. The next question is: \u2018Who?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t possibly say the right thing to that question. \u201cDo you know what? It is going to be really entertaining. That\u2019s how much I know about the run-up to this election and the night itself. \u201cI\u2019m going to be glued to the television like everybody else. And \u2018yes\u2019, the answer is. \u201cThe first time I will be voting is in this election. I have now got the right to vote by post. But I\u2019m not saying who.\u201d There are five days left to register to vote in next month\u2019s election. The deadline is 23:59 GMT on November 26th. Channel 4 News has called on Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to participate in a debate on climate change ahead of the general election.

Raab told MPs last month that as long as there was no security threat, children rescued from the fighting in northern Syria could be allowed to return home. He has now confirmed that the first children were in the process of being returned to the UK. Raab said: \u201cThese innocent, orphaned children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war. We have facilitated their return home because it was the right thing to do. Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life.\u201d Dr Abdulkarim Omar, the de facto foreign minister of the self-styled autonomous administration of north and east Syria, tweeted earlier: \u201cToday, 21 November 2019, three British orphans from Isis parents were handed over to a delegation representing the British foreign ministry, headed by Mr Martin Longden, according to an official repatriation document signed by the self-administration and the British government.\u201d Nigel Farage has faced renewed criticism for discussing tropes and conspiracy theories associated with the far right and antisemitism after it emerged he said migration would \u201cimperil the future of our civilisation\u201d and called Goldman Sachs \u201cthe enemy\u201d. In an interview this year with Revelation TV, a UK evangelical Christian channel, the Brexit party leader alleged that banks and multinational corporations were trying to created a dictatorial world government. An anti-Brexit campaign group has bought thebrexitparty.com and is offering to sell the domain name to Nigel Farage for more than \u00a31m. Led By Donkeys said the fee would increase by \u00a350,000 each day and if paid would be donated to the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a charity. The move comes after Brexit party lawyers contacted Led By Donkeys asking them to remove their logo from the site. The party said the campaign group was refusing to transfer the domain name, which is similar to that of their official site, thebrexitparty.org. The website features a rising total of the cost being sought, along with an \u201celection advent calendar\u201d offering examples of the \u201clies, lunacy and hypocrisy\u201d of the Conservatives and Brexit party every day until the election on 12 December. Oliver Knowles, a co-founder of Led By Donkeys, said: \u201cWhen Farage and his millionaire backers set up the Brexit party, they didn\u2019t have the foresight to buy up all of the websites with their own name \u2013 and we did. \u201cWith the advent calendar, we are telling the story of the Brexit party and the Tory party, who are now election partners, and the threat they represent to the country.\u201d All versions of the Brexit party logo have been removed from the website. Ireland\u2019s justice minister, Charlie Flanagan, has said he was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d to learn of another incident of people being found in a sealed lorry container, on this occasion onboard a ferry. Detectives are speaking to the driver and owners of the lorry after 16 people were discovered inside on a Stena Line ferry that arrived in Rosslare, Co Wexford, this afternoon from Cherbourg in France. Police said they were investigating possible immigration offences and had seized a truck involved in the incident. Flanagan said: \u201cThere is an active garda investigation under way and I would appeal to anyone with any information on these nefarious activities to come forward. I welcome the statement issued by An Garda Sioch\u00e1na earlier today. \u201cThe persons found in the lorry container are now being cared for by state services. As part of that care, they will receive initial medical assessments.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn has launched the most radical and potentially transformative manifesto published by a mainstream party in decades in what is potentially a make-or-break moment for Labour in the election campaign. The plans in the 105-page document (pdf) would fundamentally reset the relationship between the state, citizen and business, adding around \u00a380bn to the amount government spends every year by the end of the next parliament, taking tax levels to their highest sustained levels since the end of the second world war, unleashing a blizzard of investment and providing citizens with a plethora of attractive services, like free full-fibre broadband, free university tuition, free adult learning, free personal care, free prescriptions and free dental check-ups. In 2017 the Labour manifesto was seen as the star performer of the party\u2019s campaign. At present, according to the polls, Labour continues to languish far behind the Conservatives, but the party will be hoping that this document will make a big enough splash to change minds. My colleague Rowena Mason has a summary of the contents of the manifesto here. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the respected and non-partisan tax and spending thinktank, has said that it does not believe Labour\u2019s claim that it will be able to achieve everything it plans with 95% of taxpayers not having to pay any extra in tax. Labour claims it would only need to make businesses and the richest 5% pay more. The IFS has also said that the Labour promise not to raise the state pension age beyond 66 could add around \u00a324bn a year to the cost of state pensions by the middle of the century. Labour has said public sector workers would get a pay rise worth more than \u00a31,600 on average from April under its plans. It is proposing to give them a 5% pay rise. According to Labour, this would mean newly qualified nurses getting a rise of more than \u00a31,200 on average; firefighters more than \u00a31,800; teachers in state-funded schools almost \u00a32,000; junior doctors almost \u00a31,400; police constables almost \u00a32,000; army sergeants more than \u00a31,700; civil servants more than \u00a31,300; and council workers more than \u00a31,200. Boris Johnson has attacked the Labour manifesto by claiming that Jeremy Corbyn does not have any \u201ceconomic credibility\u201d because of the uncertainty about his Brexit policy. In a marked contrast with the party\u2019s response to previous Labour manifestos, the Tories have said little about the potential downsides of increasing government spending. This reflects Johnson\u2019s eagerness not to be seen as a defender of austerity. The government is not responsible for poverty in the UK, Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said. A website purporting to showcase Labour\u2019s manifesto but which instead attacks the party\u2019s policies has been set up by the Conservatives just days after the party faced criticism for misleading the public with a similar stunt. The UK\u2019s GDP growth rate will slip to 1% next year even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, according to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation. Boris Johnson and his staff were given compulsory training on the importance of acknowledging personal friendships months before he met the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri, and just after he was rebuked for failing to declare an interest with another woman, the Guardian can reveal. A new rule banning microtargeting in political adverts will have minimal impact in the UK, the Guardian has learned, because the majority of political advertisers do not use the tools anyway. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now in charge. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has insisted due process must be respected after her predecessor appeared in court on a series of sexual assault charges. Alex Salmond pleaded not guilty to 14 separate allegations involving 10 women. He faces a charge of attempted rape, 11 charges of sexual assault, including one with intent to rape, and two charges of indecent assault. Speaking outside the high court in Edinburgh, Salmond said: \u201cI am innocent and I will defend my position vigorously.\u201d Sturgeon said her only interest was that \u201cjustice is done, whatever that might be.\u201d The SNP leader, who was campaigning in Glasgow, said: \u201cThis is a live, ongoing criminal trail so there is nothing it is appropriate for me to say. In fact there is nothing it is appropriate for anybody to say because it is absolutely essential that due process is allowed to take its course. \u201cMy only interest as first minister and as an ordinary citizen is that justice is done, whatever that might be. So I will say nothing that in any way might influence or prejudice that trial because it is vital that goes ahead and due process is respected.\u201d Boris Johnson has pulled out of a planned Channel 4 leaders\u2019 debate, according to Channel 4\u2019s Louisa Compton. Boris Johnson\u2019s main election pitch is that, unlike Labour, he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. He says he would take the UK out of the EU before the end of January, and he claims he would be able to negotiate a trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020 so that there would be no need to extend the transition period (the period during which the UK is out of the EU, but EU rules still apply, to allow people time to prepare for Brexit proper). Even though many experts think the transition period will have to be extended for up to two years, the government has said categorically that it will not allow it. According to the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, Johnson\u2019s position is implausible. She explains why in a good Twitter thread starting here. The Labour manifesto says the party would abandon plans introduced by the government to raise the state pension age beyond 66. It says: Labour will abandon the Tories\u2019 plans to raise the state pension age, leaving it at 66. We will review retirement ages for physically arduous and stressful occupations, including shift workers, in the public and private sectors. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 briefing on the Labour manifesto plans , this could add around \u00a324bn a year to the cost of state pensions by the middle of the century. This is from the IFS\u2019s Rowena Crawford. Keeping the state pension age at 66 would be costly, potentially adding around \u00a324bn per year to the cost of state pensions by the late 2050s. This would be on top of the dramatic, \u00a338bn per year, increase in spending on state pensions projected even with the planned increase in the SPA to 69. Increasing the SPA is a coherent response to increases in life expectancy at older ages and would keep the average share of life spent in receipt of a state pension constant. Concerns about those unable to work at older ages, or groups who have shorter life expectancies, would be better addressed through more targeted policies. Boris Johnson has been at a building site in Bedford today promoting Conservative plans to help people buy a home. (See 9.48am.) As well as saying that the Tories would build 1 million more homes over the next five years, he mentioned two specific measures for would-be homeowners. Number one: helping local people so that they have a 30% discount on their home. And they\u2019ve got to make sure that when the home is sold it goes on to a local person. Also, helping people who are renting to get the high-value mortgage they may need to buy the home. But the impact of the first home programme for local people is relatively limited. According to the Tory briefing, by the mid-2020s this discount could apply to up to 19,000 homes. (See 9.48am.) And, as Sky\u2019s Ed Conway reported earlier (see 10.58am), there are some doubts as to the feasibility of the new mortgage products Johnson is proposing. According to the Press Association, Johnson smoothed cement and laid a few bricks on a metre-high wall at a new home at the Willow Grove estate in Bedford. He remarked that his efforts were \u201cnot bad\u201d, before looking back on his work and adding: \u201cKind of.\u201d From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said Labour\u2019s plans would push the UK\u2019s tax burden well above levels that have been sustained at any time since the second world war, and expressed scepticism about whether the burden would fall exclusively on the better off and companies. It says the Labour manifesto proposes \u201can enormous increase in the amounts they want to raise from corporation tax. If their proposals did raise the sums they suggest then we would be raising more in corporation tax, as a fraction of national income, than any other country in the G7, and more than almost anywhere else in the OECD. This would clearly come with substantial risks.\u201d Labour outlined plans to raise corporation tax to 28%, put up income taxes to those earning more than \u00a380,000, levy higher taxes on multinationals and increase the take from capital gains tax and dividend taxation. The \u00a383bn would match the spending commitments laid out in the manifesto. In an analysis, the IFS said: In the end, it is unlikely that one could raise the sums suggested by Labour from the tax policies they set out. If you want to transform the scale and scope of the state then you need to be clear that the tax increases required to do that will need to be widely shared rather than pretending that everything can be paid for by companies and the rich. Billionaires and financiers are among those who have helped the Conservative party raise \u00a35.7m in a single week, according to official figures. Data published by the Electoral Commission on donations received between 6 and 12 November shows the Tories far outstripped other parties, most of which raised a couple of hundred thousand pounds during the same period. The top donors to the Conservatives were: John Gore, a theatre producer and recent addition to the Sunday Times rich list, with an estimated net worth of \u00a31.5bn. He donated \u00a31m. WA Capital, the vehicle of the Dunelm Group founder Bill Adderley, worth an estimated \u00a31.4bn. He donated \u00a3500,000. Trailfinders Limited, a travel company, donated \u00a3500,000. Countywide Developments Ltd, which is owned by the property billionaire Tony Gallagher, donated \u00a3500,000. The Tories received \u00a34.1m in the first week of the 2017 general election campaign. Here is Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s one-minute summary of his manifesto plans. The prospect of more allotments, pubs saved from closure and an end to rising retirement ages are among the promises, but the biggest social reforms would be Labour\u2019s abolition of universal credit and the creation of a national care service. Labour would scrap the benefit cap, costing \u00a3185m a year, and the two-child limit for benefits, costing \u00a32bn a year. An extra \u00a3200m a year would be spent on human staff to end the \u201cdigital only\u201d method of communicating with claimants. Another \u00a3520m a year would go on extra benefit payments for disabled people and Labour would halt \u201cdehumanising\u201d fitness-for-work tests. The national care service would offer free personal care, beginning with elderly people, an end to 15-minute care visits, paid travel time for care workers and a \u00a36.95 weekly benefit increase for full-time carers. Around \u00a3800m a year would go into a new national youth service, reversing cuts to clubs and youth workers. Private health firms say Labour\u2019s ambitious plan to end the privatisation of NHS care would force patients to wait longer for treatment and lead to the waiting list for non-urgent operations in England, currently at 4.4 million people, to grow substantially. The Independent Healthcare Providers Network (IHPN) has strongly criticised Labour\u2019s pledge to \u201cend and reverse privatisation in the NHS in the next parliament\u201d. David Hare, the group\u2019s chief executive, said: Labour\u2019s stance of removing the independent sector from the NHS is deeply misguided and would significantly undermine patients\u2019 ability to get the care they need. Rather than improve patients\u2019 access to care, removing the independent sector from NHS service delivery would dramatically lengthen waiting times and add millions to NHS waiting lists. For planned care, where over four million patients are waiting for treatment today, the NHS would need to build the equivalent of 42 extra hospitals just to stand still \u2013 a complete waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The IHPN\u2019s members include some of the biggest private providers of NHS care, such as Care UK, BMI Healthcare, InHealth and Newmedica. The Labour manifesto says: Every penny spent on privatisation and outsourcing is a penny less spent on patient care. Labour will end and reverse privatisation in the NHS in the next parliament. We will repeal the Health and Social Care Act and reinstate the responsibilities of the secretary of state to provide a comprehensive and universal healthcare system. We will end the requirement on health authorities to put services out to competitive tender. We will ensure services are delivered in-house and also bring subsidiary companies back in-house. Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge seems to go further than what John McDonell, the shadow chancellor, said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show on 3 November. In that interview, McDonnell seemed to acknowledge that some NHS contracts with private firms may not have run out by the end of a five-year Labour government. Some contracts last up to 10 years. McDonnell did not say whether a Jeremy Corbyn-led administration would try to force the termination of such contracts, which would be costly and legally fraught. New polling from Ipsos Mori gives the Conservatives a comfortable 16-point lead over Labour. The research for the Evening Standard has the Conservatives on 44%, Labour on 28%, the Liberal Democrats on 16%, the Brexit party on 3% and the Greens on 3%. Asked what issues were driving their decisions, 63% of voters mentioned Brexit, 41% the NHS and 21% education. Taxation and protecting the environment were each brought up by 11% of those surveyed, while the economy was cited by 9%. Brexit was particularly important to Conservative and Liberal Democrat supporters (76% and 77% respectively), while only 45% of Labour supporters mentioned it. Possibly most interestingly, those who said they\u2019d vote Conservative were surer of their vote than those voting Labour. Seventy-one per cent of Tory supporters said they would definitely back the party, compared with 54% of Labour supporters. Just 40% of Liberal Democrats supporters said they were definitely decided. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, has told ITV News that he does not believe Labour\u2019s claim 95% of taxpayers would not need to pay more under its spending plans. He said: It is impossible to understate just how extraordinary this manifesto is just in terms of the sheer scale of money being spent and raised through the tax system: hundreds of billions of additional spending on investment, \u00a380bn plus per year on spending on day to day things, social security, spending on the NHS, student loans and so on, and matched by supposedly an \u00a380bn increase in tax. These are vast numbers, enormous, colossal, in the context of anything we\u2019ve seen in the last - ever, really. Asked if it would be possible to spend this amount of money with tax increases just affecting businesses and the richest 5% of individuals, as Labour claims, Johnson replied: The Labour manifesto suggests they want to raise \u00a380bn of tax revenue, and they suggest that all of that will come from companies and people earning over \u00a380,000 a year. That is simply not credible. We cannot raise that kind of money in our tax system without affecting individuals. Obviously corporate tax affects individuals anyway. Someone has to pay that tax. But if you\u2019re looking about transforming society, which the Labour party is absolutely up front about doing, then you need to pay for it. And it can\u2019t be someone else who pays for it. We collectively will need to pay for it. The layout of the manifesto says it all: plans for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d come first, with eye-catching pledges of a windfall tax on oil and gas, 1m new jobs and the nationalisation of energy, water and railways. This is the first time one of the UK\u2019s two major parties has placed so much store on the environment, and Labour has carefully positioned its low-carbon plans as a support for industry, not a burden as the Conservatives have termed green measures for years. In place of a firm deadline to reach net-zero carbon by 2030, which many activists pushed for, after union pressure the agreed commitment is to \u201cachieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030\u201d. That should imply stronger and swifter action than the Tory net-zero carbon by 2050 pledge but allows a lot of room for interpretation. The manifesto does set a net-zero deadline of 2040 for the farming sector and 2030, 10 years ahead of the Tories, to phase out fossil-fuel vehicles. Generating 90% of electricity renewably by 2030 is more than the 80% Lib Dem pledge, energy nationalisation will encompass supply as well as the grid, and companies failing to tackle emissions forfeit their stock exchange listing. Missing is any commitment to curb emissions from aviation, singled out as a growing problem by the Committee on Climate Change, with no frequent flyer levy and a hedge on airport expansion. Boris Johnson has delivered a clip for broadcasters about Labour\u2019s manifesto. Normally you would expect a Conservative leader, commenting on a Labour manifesto like this, to focus on the plans for higher taxes, and to make an argument about how these might turn out to be ruinous to the economy. But Johnson did not say that at all. Instead he just claimed that Corbyn\u2019s plans did not have any \u201ceconomic credibility\u201d because of the uncertainty about his Brexit policy. None of it has any credibility whatever because the whole at the heart of Labour\u2019s manifesto - this was the moment, it was \u2018Lights, camera, action\u2019, Corbyn comes centre stage, drumroll, and he completely misses his cue - because what we want to know is what is his plan to deliver to Brexit, and what\u2019s the deal he wants to do, and which side would be vote on that deal, and we still don\u2019t know. Until we have answers to those questions, until we get Brexit done, none of this carries any economic credibility whatever. And I contrast our approach. We\u2019ve got a deal, ready to go. Put it in the oven, it\u2019s done, we\u2019re through by January. We get on with our ambitions for the country. Although Johnson is right to say Corbyn has not said whether he would campaign for remain or leave in a second referendum, the main thrust of his argument is not correct. There may be reasons why the manifesto plans lack economic credibility, but they are mostly not related to Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, which would involve the UK deciding between remain and a soft Brexit next summer. This creates uncertainty. But there is also some uncertainty as to what sort of trade deal with the EU a Johnson government would negotiate, and whether or not there would be a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition in December 2020. The official CCHQ response to the Labour manifesto does have a line about how Labour\u2019s plans would involve \u201ca reckless spending spree which would take a sledgehammer to the British economy and cost every taxpayer \u00a32,400 a year\u201d (this figure is unfounded), but, interestingly, the Tory press notice also focuses mostly on Corbyn\u2019s position on Brexit and on the threat of a second Scottish independence referendum. It may be the case that the Tories are wary of attacking Labour over taxation and spending because they think the Labour plans are popular. Or it may just be that they think Brexit is their best attack line against Labour, and they want to use it at every opportunity. At Holyrood, first minister\u2019s questions did not touch directly on the election, but the session did go nuclear. First, SNP MSP Jenny Gilruth gave Nicola Sturgeon the opportunity to answer the question posed to Jo Swinson in the ITV Leaders\u2019 Interviews on Tuesday: would you use nuclear weapons? While Swinson attracted much criticism for her short and direct \u201cYes\u201d, Sturgeon gave a similarly direct \u201cNo\u201d, describing nuclear weapons as \u201cimmoral, ineffective and a waste of money\u201d. She was later asked by Mark Ruskell of the Scottish Greens about the costly 15-year delay in decommissioning nuclear submarines at Rosyth dockyard in Fife. Ruskell wanted to know \u201cwhat the Scottish government could do to free up the yard for low-carbon shipbuilding ... while removing those weapons from Jo Swinson\u2019s reach\u201d. After some laughter in the chamber, Sturgeon reiterated that she did not want Scotland to be home to WMD. This is especially pertinent today given that Labour\u2019s manifesto includes a commitment to Trident renewal (we\u2019ll find out the Scottish Labour policy at their manifesto launch tomorrow, as it has diverged from the UK position in the past). And the SNP leadership has said previously that removing the weapons from Scotland could be a red line in any post-election negotiations (see my report yesterday for where we\u2019ve got to on this between Labour and the SNP). And talking of Labour\u2019s manifesto, it is noteworthy that it has retained the rather vague guarantee not to agree to a section 30 order request for the powers to hold a second independence referendum \u201cin the early years of a Labour government\u201d. This gives them ample flexibility should the SNP win a pro-independence majority at the next Holyrood election in 2021. Labour\u2019s manifesto says it will consult on establishing an inquiry into \u201cfake news\u201d. As the Press Association reports, the party says that \u201cfake news\u201d has eroded trust in the media and democracy. It says: We will consult media-sector workers and trade unions to establish an inquiry into the \u2018fake news\u2019 undermining trust in media, democracy and public debate, and on a legal right of public interest defence for journalists. And here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about the manifesto launch. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s guide to what\u2019s in Labour\u2019s manifesto. Campaigners for EU citizens say they are \u201cvery happy\u201d with Labour\u2019s manifesto proposals which will ensure they are \u201clawful\u201d in the UK post-Brexit. Under Labour\u2019s proposals the government would move to a \u201cdeclaratory\u201d system for EU citizens who would merely have to \u201cdeclare\u201d they were in the country through whatever scheme Labour laid out. It could mean registering at a town hall, a local council or through the exiting Home Office settled status programme. The manifesto says: We will end the uncertainty created by the EU settlement scheme by granting EU nationals the automatic right to continue living and working in the UK. This new declaratory system will allow EU nationals the chance to register for proof of status if they wish, but will mean they no longer have to apply to continue living and working in this country. \u201cThis is a really big step and we are delighted the main opposition party is on the side of EU citizens,\u201d said the3million co-founder Nicolas Hatton. Labour is also planning to scrap the hostile environment. That means foreign migrants \u2013 who will include, after Brexit, EU citizens \u2013 will no longer have the shock of their driving licence being cancelled, bank accounts closed or benefits stopped due to a Home Office official\u2019s decision, says Hatton. One of the peculiarities of a British general election is that a party can win the campaign (in the sense of delivering a more coherent and professional message) but still lose quite badly on polling day. Many analysts would say that is what happened to Labour in 1987 and in 2017. Arguably it also happened to Labour in 1992 and to the Conservatives in 2005. And it is possible that the same thing might happen again. Up to now Labour has had a good campaign. As Alex Wickham reports in a recent BuzzFeed feature on jitters in the Conservative camp, Labour \u201cwon the media narrative almost every day\u201d in the first two weeks of the campaign. It has been announcing detailed policy, and holding press conferences. The Conservative campaign is wholly dependent on Boris Johnson who is running mostly on negative claims about Labour and on a pledge to get Brexit done whose credibility is open to question. But the Tories are still leading comfortably in the polls. Corbyn in full campaign mode is a much more impressive figure than he was when elected party leader four years ago and at the manifesto launch this morning he put on a confident performance. In the election two years ago the publication of the manifestos marked the moment when support for the Tories started to sink, and Labour\u2019s ratings started to go up. We don\u2019t know yet whether the same thing will happen this time around (the Tory manifesto is due out in the next few days), but Corbyn certainly had a distinctive pitch this morning. Here are the main points from his speech and Q&amp;A. Corbyn urged people to judge the value of Labour\u2019s \u201cmanifesto for hope\u201d by the fact that it is getting so much opposition from \u201cthe bankers, the billionaires and the establishment\u201d. (See 9.06am.) He claimed that the super-rich and \u201cbad bosses\u201d now effectively owned the Conservative party. (See 11.23am.) He said Labour\u2019s plan would unleash investment \u201con a scale you have never known\u201d. (See 11.39am.) He insisted he was a patriot. Asked in the Q&amp;A how he would respond to people who do not seem him as patriotic, he replied: Yes, I do support this country. I am patriotic about this country. I\u2019m patriotic about all people in this country. That means patriotism is about caring for the entire society. Patriotism is about supporting each other, not attacking somebody else. He claimed that Boris Johnson\u2019s spending claims were bogus. When it was put to him that, unlike in 2017, at this election the Tories were also promising big spending increases, he replied: The offers made by the Conservatives on spending ever since Boris Johnson became prime minister are sometimes, how shall I put it? I\u2019m trying to be generous here ... inaccurately sourced? As an example, Corbyn cited Johnson\u2019s claim that he has announced plans for 40 new hospitals. In reality, he has only confirmed plans to upgrade six hospitals. The other 34 projects are long-term aspirational ones for which very little money has been set aside. He said there were no plans in the Labour manifesto that were incompatible with EU state aid rules. The document is fairly light on migration policy \u2013 dedicating only two out of 107 pages to the issue. Most notable is the absence of anything remotely radical on freedom of movement, which is mentioned only twice. The party has said free movement will be \u201csubject to negotiations\u201d if the UK leaves the European of Union \u2013 but nothing more. This will disappoint the likes of the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, who put forward a popular motion at the party\u2019s recent conference to maintain and extend free movement. However, it will satisfy the likes of the influential union leader Len McCluskey, who called for a cautious stance. The manifesto firmly puts to bed the highly spurious claims disseminated by the Conservative party last week that as prime minister Jeremy Corbyn would oversee an open borders policy that would push net migration as high as 840,000 people a year. A review of the impact of Britain\u2019s colonial legacy around the world is the flagship pledge in the 13-page section of the manifesto devoted to foreign policy, aid and defence. The party wants \u201cto understand our contribution to the dynamics of violence and insecurity across regions previously under British colonial rule\u201d - a commitment designed to inform foreign policy thinking under a Labour government. A Jeremy Corbyn-led government would also end the \u201cbomb first, talk later\u201d approach to global security, and implement a War Powers Act to end the theoretical discretion that the prime minister has to launch military action without parliamentary approval. The party also promises to \u201cestablish a judge-led inquiry into our country\u2019s alleged complicity in rendition and torture\u201d in connection with the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts \u2013 a commitment quietly abandoned by the Tories in the summer. An existing pledge to renew Trident is reiterated from 2017 \u2013 although there has been speculation that the SNP wants Labour to scrap the nuclear deterrent as the price for a post-election coalition. Labour would also \u201cactively lead\u201d global efforts for multilateral nuclear disarmament. The party will also continue to spend 2% of GDP on the armed forces, end the public sector pay cap for military personnel, and \u201cmaintain our commitment to Nato\u201d. Labour is pledging in the manifesto to ban ATM charges, presumably to increase access to cash across the country. But a fee ban doesn\u2019t address the underlying issue. Most high street ATMs are run by private, third-party companies that are focused on the bottom line and profit margins rather than public access. Put simply, if they don\u2019t make enough money, those ATMs start disappearing altogether. Natalie Ceeney, the author of the Access to Cash Review, has warned that Britain\u2019s cash infrastructure network is \u201cvery, very fragile,\u201d and that taking out another brick from the teetering Jenga tower \u2013 like rural ATMs \u2013 could bring us one step closer to its collapse. ATM companies such as NoteMachine and Cardtronics make money by charging banks a fee every time customers take out cash, but consumers are taking out less money at ATMs and opting for contactless payments for small purchases instead. Banks have also negotiated cuts to their fees in recent years. So if ATM operators feel they aren\u2019t making enough money from one of their cash machines, they\u2019ll start charging customers a withdrawal fee to make up the difference. If that fails to bring in enough cash, operators may remove cash machine altogether, creating ATM \u201cdeserts\u201d. There is a risk a ban on fees could just speed up the whole process. But Labour\u2019s ATM policy should be considered alongside others including plans to stop bank branch closures, and create a Post Bank within the Post Office Network that would be likely to maintain access to cash in rural communities, even if those private ATM operators decide to pack up and leave. The Labour party will push ahead with plans to nationalise the energy supply arms of the Big Six energy companies. The party\u2019s election manifesto said the Big Six - including British Gas, SSE, E.ON UK, EDF Energy, Scottish Power and Npower - would continue to supply gas and electricity to millions of homes while helping customers to reduce their energy use. The plan to nationalise the Big Six won the approval of Labour members at the party\u2019s conference earlier this year, but many in the energy industry did not expect the pledge to be included in the manifesto. It builds on plans to nationalise other utilities including regional energy networks \u2013 which run the UK\u2019s power lines and gas pipes \u2013 as well as water companies and part of the telecoms giant BT. If elected Labour \u201cwill rip up the deeply flawed deal negotiated by Boris Johnson\u201d and will strike a new deal within three months, the manifesto says. It promises to guard against further deregulation in manufacturing that would leave the UK \u201cat the mercy of a trade deal with Donald Trump\u201d. The deal will involve: a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d UK-wide customs arrangement with the EU; \u201cclose alignment with the single market\u201d, and \u201cdynamic alignment on workers\u2019 rights and the environment which guarantees keeping pace with any future EU protections \u201cas a minimum\u201d. Labour will also negotiate \u201clegal protection\u201d for citizens\u2019 rights introducing a new \u201cdeclaratory system\u201d whereby EU citizens no longer have to \u201capply\u201d to stay, but merely register for proof of status. Under Labour, the UK will also: continue to participate in the EU funding programmes on science and environment; scrap Operation Yellowhammer contingency planning and the current Brexit legislation, and hold a referendum \u201cwithin the first six months of a Labour government\u201d (not within six months of a new deal). The referendum will not be advisory but \u201clegally binding\u201d. Legally the 2016 one was only advisory, but the government had given a political commitment to be bound by it. The Welsh Labour government will campaign to remain. On transport, Labour pledges to give all councils powers and resources to take bus services back under local control. Under 25s would get free bus travel. Along with its commitment to renationalising rail, Labour would put a guard on every train \u2013 a move seen as crucial to ensure accessible, safe travel for all, and which also end the current industrial disputes. The cost of \u00a3100m a year would come from road taxes that Conservatives have hypothecated for roadbuilding, Labour has said. It would deliver \u201cCrossrail for the North\u201d, another (less George Osborne-inspired) name for northern powerhouse rail, build HS2 to Scotland, and restore axed electrification. It will \u201caim for 2030\u201d rather than the government\u2019s 2040 target to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars, and increase funding for cycling and walking. Labour also promises a shot across the bows of the likes of Uber with a pledge to reform taxi rules to ensure a \u201clevel playing field\u201d. Corbyn is now responding to questions from students at the venue, Birmingham City University. He says young workers will benefit from the living wage. They will also have full rights at work from day one of their employment. And they will have the right to trade union representation from the start, he says. He says, as part of ending universal credit, Labour will end the two-child policy and the so-called rape clause. He says the education system is too competitive. There are too many pupils being excluded. Exclusion affects their achievements later in life. Labour will get schools to support each other, so teachers should face less stress. He says the Tories introduced what they called a fair funding formula. But it was the very opposite; it took funds away from many schools, he says. He says headteachers should not have to beg for money from parents. This might work in wealthy areas. But in areas where parents are on the minimum wage, the schools do not get top-up funding, and their pupils lose out. He says Labour will have a ringfenced pupil arts premium so every pupil can learn a musical instrument. He ends by saying how proud he is of the manifesto. And that\u2019s it. The launch is over. As the day goes on, we will be looking at the manifesto in detail \u2013 here, and elsewhere on the website. And I will post a summary of the main points from the launch shortly. Q: Some voters do not see you as patriotic. Is that fair? Corbyn replies: Yes, I do support this country. I am patriotic about this country. He says patriotism is about caring for the whole of society \u2013 not walking by on the other side, and ignoring the homeless. He says members of the armed forces working on disaster relief have told him how proud they are of the work they do. He says patriotism should be about supporting each other, not attacking people. And he loves this country\u2019s literature, he says. When he travels, he goes on about the history of different places. He jokes that those travelling with him may find this hard to put up with. Q: Do you think Prince Andrew should cooperate with the lawyers for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein? And do you think there needs to be a wider review of the royal family. Corbyn says the interests of Epstein\u2019s victims should come first. He says no one should be above the law. Q: Now the Tories are also promising high levels of investment. Why should voters trust you to deliver? Corbyn says some of Boris Johnson\u2019s claims about his spending plans are - Corbyn says he is trying to be generous - inaccurately sourced. For example, Johnson said he would create 40 new hospitals, when it turned out to be only six projects. And the proposals in other areas, such as police funding, do not match the cuts enacted by the Tories since 2010. He says his proposals are bold. The costings document (see 11.56am) goes into a great deal of detail, he says. He asks what the country will be like if it carries in the way things are going now. The Tories are just offering \u201csame old, same old\u201d and \u201cmore and more inequality\u201d. There is also a question about whether Corbyn would cooperate with the Tories on a cross-party solution to social care, but Corbyn ignores this. Long-Bailey is taking questions three at a time, and some journalists are asking two questions at the same time, and so that one got overlooked. Q: A lot of your manifesto is reminiscent of the 1970s. The 1970s gets a bad press. How do you remember it - as a good time or a bad time? Corbyn says the businesses he wants to nationalise are natural monopolies. He says the way postal workers are being treated is terrible. If you stop to talk to them, they do not have time to stop because they are being monitored. They would be treated better if the Royal Mail were in public ownership, he suggests. He says water deserves to be nationalised. The private companies are not providing a good service. We waste enough water to fill Loch Ness with leaks. He says the public ownership model will be one with consumer involvement. He is not going for a top-down nationalisation model. It will be more community-orientated and more consumer-orientated. He says British Rail was under-resourced. Private rail companies are now getting more in public subsidy than British Rail ever got. Q: What do you say to claims you are good at spending money, but that you do not understand how to raise money? Corbyn says he spends a lot of time talking to groups such as the CBI, and to small business owners. He is absolutely on their side. Often these are the most innovative people, he says. He says they say they want broadband, buses, trains and good quality roads. So the Labour broadband offer will create opportunities all over the country. Q: Many windfarms are being made abroad. So will your green plans benefit workers in Scotland? Corbyn says up to 5% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs could be met by windfarms off the Scottish coast. Those wind turbines could be built in Scotland. But Scotland needs an industrial strategy. He says workers in Scotland are annoyed these are being manufactured abroad. He wants those turbines to be built here. He says he will invest \u00a3100m in Scotland. Q: The Scottish Labour party does not want a second independence referendum. So is this a manifesto that excludes them? Corbyn says he is fighting the election to win as Labour. He is not fighting to go into coalition with anyone. Q: Why do you think the public will back this manifesto when voters weren\u2019t won over by the 2017 one? Corbyn says this is a radical manifesto. But radical answers are what is necessary. When you have a mental health crisis, working people in poverty, overcrowded schools, unqualified teachers and people unable to buy their own home, you realise what is needed. And when you live in a community that once had a proud industrial basis to it, a steelworks or coalmine, and you walk down the high street and see empty shops, you recognise the scale of need. He says he is very proud of the fact it is a radical manifesto. The levels of poverty are horrific. And poverty is such a waste of the abilities of people. Corbyn says children cannot achieve properly at school if they are growing up in poverty. He says Labour did not win the last election. He knows that every day, because he sees that in his advice surgery, and he sees problems getting worse. That is why he is determined to get his message across. Q: In the TV debate you were laughed at when you would not say how you would vote in the second Brexit referendum. Is your policy credible, and how would you vote? Q: Some of your plans would fall foul of EU rules on state aid. So could Labour really campaign for remain? Taking both questions together, Corbyn says people voted to leave the EU in 2016. People have spent a lot of time discussing Brexit, and the shadow cabinet has too. He has sought to understand why people voted leave. There are people facing the same problems, some of whom voted remain and some of whom voted leave. He sets out Labour\u2019s policy: a renegotiation followed by a referendum. He says it is responsible to try to bring people together. He does not accept that the UK must remain divided. He wants to give people the final say, and then carry out the result of that vote. Regarding EU state aid rules, he says Labour has looked at this carefully. He says all his policies are possible under EU state aid rules. And here is Labour\u2019s 44-page document (pdf) with its manifesto costings. Rebecca Long-Bailey asks Labour supporters in the audience to let journalists ask their questions without interruption. She calls the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Some in the audience start booing. Jeremy Corbyn protests. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that,\u201d he says. Before the Q&amp;A Corbyn says this is the 45th anniversary of the Birmingham pub bombings. He says that should be a reminder that peace in Northern Ireland is priceless. Here is Corbyn\u2019s peroration. Ignore the wealthy and powerful who tell you that\u2019s not possible. The future is ours to make, together. As the writer Pablo Neruda wrote so beautifully: \u201cYou can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming.\u201d Vote for this manifesto of hope. It\u2019s time for real change. From the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman The Conservatives are expected to propose repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in their manifesto too. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s first-take story on the Labour manifesto. And this is how it starts. A Labour government would put an \u00a311bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies to create a \u201cjust transition fund\u201d and help shift the UK towards a green economy without creating mass job losses, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The one-off tax would be calculated according to an assessment of each firm\u2019s past contribution to the climate crisis, Labour said \u2013 and could be paid over years. The total is 10 times the \u00a31.1bn that the Treasury expects to raise from the oil and gas sector this year. Corbyn confirms that Labour would scrap tuition fees, and universal credit. If you\u2019re a patient or a nurse, Labour is on your side. We\u2019ll rescue our NHS, make dental check-ups free, recruit thousands of nurses and doctors and bring down waiting lists. If you\u2019re a student, Labour is on your side. We\u2019ll create a national education service, make lifelong education a right, value technical education as highly as academic learning and we\u2019ll bring back maintenance grants and, yes, scrap university tuition fees. If you\u2019re reaching old age, Labour is on your side. We\u2019ll protect pensions and provide free personal care. If you\u2019re living with a disability, Labour is on your side. We\u2019ll update the Equality Act and scrap universal credit. If you\u2019re a tenant, Labour is on your side. We\u2019ll launch the biggest council housebuilding programme since the 1960s and cap rents. If you\u2019re a new parent, Labour is on your side. We\u2019ll guarantee 30 hours of free childcare for all two- to four-year olds. Corbyn promises investment \u201con a scale you have never known\u201d. It\u2019s time to bring a divided country together so we can get on with delivering the real change Britain needs. To drive that change we will unleash a record investment blitz, getting the economy moving in every corner of our country. This is about the jobs at the end of your road. It\u2019s about breathing new life into your area. Reviving your high street. Our investment blitz will upgrade our national infrastructure in every region and nation, and rebuild our schools, hospitals, care homes and housing. Investment on a scale you have never known in every town, city and region. And we\u2019ll boost the devolved budgets, allowing the Welsh Labour government to build on its success with huge new projects like the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon, and putting an extra \u00a3100 billion into Scotland to boost the Scottish economy, secure the future of industry and properly fund our public services. Labour will transform our economy so that no one is held back, and no community is neglected. From ITV Cymru Wales\u2019 Adrian Masters From my colleague Heather Stewart More from the manifesto. Here is the full text of the manifesto (pdf). It runs to 107 pages. Corbyn says people\u2019s votes can be \u201cmore powerful than all the wealth in the world\u201d. (That claim might struggle to get past the factcheckers, I\u2019m afraid.) He is now urging people to vote. More from the manifesto. Jeremy Corbyn is delivering his speech now. He says billionaires effectively own the Conservative party, but they don\u2019t own Labour. A third of Britain\u2019s billionaires have donated to the Conservative party. The billionaires and the super-rich, the tax dodgers, the bad bosses and the big polluters - they own the Conservative party. But they don\u2019t own us. They don\u2019t own the Labour party. The people own the Labour party. That\u2019s why the billionaires attack us. That\u2019s why the billionaire-owned media makes things up about us. Corbyn is now using the passage quoted earlier. (See 9.06am.) From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith The manifesto does not seem to be online quite yet, but journalists at the launch have copies, and they have started tweeting out details. These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says this is a manifesto for hope. Long-Bailey says Jeremy Corbyn is someone who has a track record of standing up for his principles. And he has already transformed politics - even before getting into Downing Street. She introduces him as \u201cour next prime minster\u201d. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is speaking at the launch now. She says the document will be radical and transformational. Here is the Birmingham Post and Mail\u2019s Jonathan Walker on what the Labour manifesto actually says about the target for reaching net zero carbon emissions. As expected, the manifesto does not include the firm 2030 target date set out in a motion passed at conference. According to Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, it\u2019s chilly at the Labour manifesto launch in Birmingham. These are from Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway, who says the Conservative housing plan announcement overnight (see 9.48am) contains a misleading promise. The UK\u2019s GDP growth rate will slip to 1% next year even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, according to the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation. My colleague Phillip Inman has the full story here. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has released a briefing on the Conservative plan to offer a tax cut by raising the national insurance threshold. It says raising the threshold to \u00a39,500, which Boris Johnson is promising to do in the first budget after the election, would take 0.6m people out of paying national insurance contributions. Employees still paying NICs would save \u00a385 year. The IFS also says that 16m households \u201cwould gain by \u00a3150 a year on average, since many households have more than one earner.\u201d But \u201cmost of the benefits [from the policy] would go to middle and high-income households\u201d, the IFS says. This is from Xiaowei Xu, a research economist at the IFS. Successive governments have fixated on income tax at the expense of NICs, for example by raising the personal allowance while doing nothing to NICs thresholds. The attention to NICs is therefore both welcome and overdue. That said, if the intention is to help the lowest-paid, raising the NICs threshold is an extremely blunt instrument. Only 3% of the total gains from raising NICs thresholds accrues to the poorest fifth of all households \u2013 and only 8% to the poorest fifth of working households. The government could target low-earning families much more effectively by raising in-work benefits, which would deliver far higher benefits to the lowest-paid for a fraction of the cost to government \u2013 but at the expense of expanding means-testing. Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow cabinet have arrived for the launch of the Labour manifesto in Birmingham. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, setting out exactly what Boris Johnson said about the proposed Tory tax cut yesterday and how CCHQ\u2019s own briefing points out that what he said was wrong. Earlier Sajid Javid, the chancellor, dodged the question when asked whether Johnson should apologise for misleading voters. (See 8.48am.) These are from Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, on the Labour manifesto. UK public sector net borrowing surged to \u00a311.2bn in October, the highest borrowing recorded in October in five years, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports. She has more on her business live blog. To coincide with the publication of Labour\u2019s election manifesto, the Conservatives are announcing their own plans in relation to housing. Generally these are initiatives that are already in the pipeline, but, for the record, here is a summary of what they are proposing: An extra 1m homes to be built over the next five years. The Tories say this can be achieved just by matching what has happened since 2014. They cite government figures saying 241,000 net additional homes were delivered in 2018-19. Help to allow renters to buy. The Tories say they would take steps to give buyers more access to long-term, fixed-rate mortgages, and to make it easier for buyers to get mortgages with just a 5% deposit. Quite how this will happen is not specified, because the press notice just said the Tories would work with lenders to make these loans more available. Discounts for local first-time buyers. The Tories say they would increase the number of properties available under the first home programme, which enables local first-time buyers to get discounts of 30%. By the mid 2020s this discount could apply to up to 19,000 homes, the Tories say. Lifetime rental deposits. The Tories say they would provide a government guarantee for lifetime rental deposits, allowing renters to move their deposit easily from on property to another. Google will no longer allow political advertisers to target voters based on their political affiliation, the company has announced, in a move that will increase pressure on Facebook to limit micro-targeting. My colleague Julia Carrie Wong has the full story here. In his speech at the launch of the Labour manifesto this morning, which is due at 11am, Jeremy Corbyn will describe it as a \u201cmanifesto of hope\u201d. But he will concentrate much of his speech on those who won\u2019t be supporting his party\u2019s programme, \u201cthe rich and the powerful\u201d, arguing that the strength of their opposition to him shows how serious he is about change. It is a clever attempt to leverage the extreme criticism he is facing (which is probably as intense as anything directed at any Labour leader in modern times) to his own advantage. Here is an extract from the speech released overnight by the party. Corbyn will say: This is a manifesto of hope. A manifesto that will bring real change. A manifesto full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation. Those policies are fully costed, with no tax increases for 95% of taxpayers. Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. That it\u2019s too much for you. Because they don\u2019t want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It\u2019s rigged in their favour. But it\u2019s not working for you. If your wages never seem to go up and your bills never seem to go down, if your public services only seem to get worse, despite the heroic efforts of those who work in them, then it\u2019s not working for you ... The US president who led his country out of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt, had to take on the rich and powerful in America to do it. That\u2019s why he said: \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me, and I welcome their hatred.\u201d He knew that when you\u2019re serious about real change, those who profit from a rigged system, who squirrel away the wealth created by millions of people, won\u2019t give up without a fight. So I accept the implacable opposition and hostility of the rich and powerful is inevitable. I accept the opposition of the billionaires because we will make those at the top pay their fair share of tax to help fund world-class public services for you. That\u2019s real change. I accept the hostility of the bad bosses paying poverty pay because we will give Britain a pay rise, starting with a real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour, including for young workers. That\u2019s real change. I accept the implacable opposition of the dodgy landlords because we\u2019ll build a million homes, empower tenants and control rents. That\u2019s real change. I accept the hostility of the big polluters because we will make sure they pay their fair share of the costs of their destruction, create huge numbers of climate jobs and build the healthy, green economy of the future. That\u2019s real change. I accept the fierce opposition of the giant healthcare corporations because we will stop them sucking out profits from our NHS. That\u2019s real change. I accept the hostility of the privatised utilities companies because we will stop their great rip-off by bringing rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership and running them for the people. That\u2019s real change. And here\u2019s a brand new one: I accept the implacable opposition of the private internet providers because we\u2019re going to give you the very fastest full fibre broadband for free. That\u2019s real change. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Mattha Busby. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has just been on the Today programme now. As when he was on BBC Breakfast earlier (see 7.32am), he was asked about Boris Johnson\u2019s claim yesterday that his proposed tax cut (an increase in the national insurance threshold) would make people \u00a3500 a year better off. Mishal Husain, the presenter, put it to Javid that Johnson was misleading people, because people will only save \u00a3500 a year when the threshold reaches \u00a312,500, and that is only a long-term aspiration. The saving from the specific pledge announced by the Tories, raising the threshold to \u00a39,500, is only about \u00a3100. Husain asked Javid whether Johnson would apologise for saying something that was untrue. She did not get an answer from the chancellor, who sidestepped this specific accusation and focused on defending his boss. It emerged last night that a reporter from the Mirror was not allowed to board the Conservative\u2019s election bus yesterday despite having initially been offered access, according to the paper. Senior Tory aides told the Mirror as early as last week they could have access to the trip - the Tory leader\u2019s first with the bus - but pulled the offer at the last minute. Our reporter was then blocked from boarding the red, white and blue emblazoned campaign coach when she arrived in Manchester city centre, where it set off just before 8am. As the bus headed for crucial electoral battlegrounds in the north east with Mr Johnson, our correspondent was forced to wave goodbye. The Tories had blamed the Mirror\u2019s critical coverage of the Prime Minister in recent weeks. The paper\u2019s political correspondent Mikey Smith notes that a number of former Tory leaders have provided access to their battle bus to the Mirror during general election campaigns. Its worth noting that the Mirror has long supported the Labour party. Back in May 2017, ahead of the election in the next month, the Mirror had asked the then prime minister why she was \u201csuch a chicken\u201d. But access to the Tory battle bus was seemingly unaffected. The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, refused to be drawn over suggestions that the party\u2019s narrative has shifted since the election campaign begun, when the leader, Jo Swinson, claimed she would be the next prime minister. Instead, he said spreading the message of the Liberal Democrat\u2019s manifesto would \u201cgreatly enhance\u201d her chance of becoming the next PM. He had been asked three times why Swinson no longer believed she could be prime minister. We are fighting very hard, particularly in Conservative seats, to take seats from Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, we know we\u2019re best placed to do that. There\u2019s no evidence Labour can. That is what we are doing and I\u2019m convinced what we are setting out in our manifesto, setting our proposals to fund the health service properly, tackling climate change, investing in childcare, much of it paid through the \u00a350bn remain dividend over a five-year period. When people hear that, her prospects of becoming prime minister are greatly enhanced. Questioned on whether the Liberal Democrats would go into coalition with either Labour or the Tories, Brake said: \u201cWe have made it absolutely clear that in no circumstances whatsoever are the Liberal Democrats going to prop up either a Boris Johnson government or a Jeremy Corbyn government.\u201d Worth harking back to John Crace\u2019s sketch yesterday on how Swinson used to insist she was going to be the next prime minister. How Jeremy Corbyn would vote in a second referendum on Brexit \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d, according to Angela Rayner. She had been asked what side of the debate her party leader would be on in a future vote \u2013 as Labour eventually pledged. Jeremy stands on the side of the people. We\u2019ve had three years of the Conservatives propped up with the DUP who have failed to get a deal on Europe. We\u2019ve said that we will get a deal that will put jobs, the economy, consumers, the environment, and employment protections first, within six months of a Labour government. We\u2019ll put that back to the people in a vote. For that deal or Remain. Then we\u2019ll do the investment in Britain that we need. That\u2019s the important thing, that people understand that we\u2019re respecting that they have the final say. It doesn\u2019t matter how Jeremy Corbyn votes, it matters what he\u2019s going to do for the people of this country. Ahead of the party\u2019s manifesto launch later today shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told the programme that Labour\u2019s plans to build 100,000 council homes a year would help \u201cstruggling\u201d families. She said that far too many people were paying huge amounts of money to privately let former council homes, with families dependent on council contributions due to the exorbitant rents. \u201cWe need to make sure we have the council housing stock we need for the people and families who are struggling at the moment to meet housing demands,\u201d she said, adding that homes would primarily be built on brownfield, public sector land while protecting greenbelts, Its not just about how many units we build, but actually that we build communities again. If you remember the council houses of the past, I grew up on a council estate and now its considered posh if you\u2019ve got a council house because its so hard to get one. But actually those council estates had green fields where kids could play, we had parks where people could go and have leisure. Our programme will make sure people can live healthy green lives as well as making sure they\u2019ve got the houses that are energy efficient, fit for the 21st century. Rayner said that a house building plan in 1945 transformed communities and rapidly increased the number of social homes, and Labour would emulate that if elected. Questioned on the home-building legacy of the Blair governments, Rayner said Labour had to now go back to its fundamental values \u2013away from right-to-buy schemes and so-called affordable housing. When I was a young mum at 16 I was lucky enough to get a council house, many young people today are not in that position. And many families watching your programme are in substandard accommodation paying huge amounts of money for it, no chance of ever getting on the property ladder and are really frustrated they can\u2019t get their young ones a home near to them. The chancellor is making a concerted attempt to appeal to lower earners in this interview, with soundbites and numbers galore. I want everyone to be better off. If you are asking me about taxes, we don\u2019t intend to plan to increase taxes. We plan to cut taxes for working people, with the tax cuts they\u2019ll be better off. If you are someone who hadn\u2019t even quite reached that wage ... you [the interviewer] chose an average wage, there are many people today still on lower incomes than that and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve set out our proposals to increase the National Living Wage. The former banker said that since the Tories raised the minimum amount you could be paid, people had seen a \u00a32,000 increase to their annual pay packets. With our new plans by 2023 thats a pay rise of \u00a34,000. We want everyone to be better off, but our focus is going to be on working people ... And trying to help them the most. Javid said that people would be better off in a Tory-majority post-Brexit government. \u201cWe\u2019re the only party which is going to support businesses,\u201d he claimed. Asked how much the Duke of York will be missed from public life, given his work helping to create new skilled jobs and stimulating economic growth through entrepreneurial scheme Pitch@Palace: When you mention him, the first thought that comes to my mind is the many victims of Mr Epstein, that is foremost in my mind and everything should be done that can possibly be done to help those victims. The Prince\u2019s statement yesterday speaks for itself, I think its the right decision and the last thing on my mind would be the value of his public duties at this point. Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, is on BBC Breakfast elaborating on the Tories\u2019 plans to raise the threshold which lower earners begin to pay national insurance contributions. A Conservative-majority government would cut taxes for working people by raising the national insurance to \u00a39,500 in the first year, before seeking to raise it to \u00a312,500 throughout their possible term in office. The current threshold is \u00a38,632. We\u2019ve shown this since we\u2019ve been back in office, that hard working people should be able to keep more of their hard earned cash. Questioned over Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the initial threshold rise would immediately put \u00a3500 in every person\u2019s pocket, Javid restated the policy without directly responding before he was pressed further. We\u2019ve been very clear, as soon as the prime minister had finished answering a very straightforward answer to a very good question from a young woman in Teesside where he was at the business, he set out what the plans were and since then we\u2019ve set out in far more detail how it is going to work. Once the threshold reaches \u00a312,500, people will be saving \u00a3500 each \u2013 but that figure only remains an intention at this stage. Johnson was in Teesside yesterday, where he appeared to disclose details about the policy prematurely. The PM may selling this election as all about Brexit, but the apparently marginal issue of animal rights could yet prove surprisingly influential, writes the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Barkham. While Extinction Rebellion and the youth climate strikes have turned the climate crisis into a popular priority, Barkham says the Conservatives hope to harvest this sentiment by championing animals, after former environment secretary Michael Gove demonstrated how animal welfare action such as the ban on all ivory trade were financially painless \u201ceasy wins\u201d. YouGov polling commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports has found that strengthening the 2004 Hunting Act to prevent the killing of foxes via trail hunting has the support of not only 89% of potential Labour voters but also 68% of Conservatives and 71% of Brexit party supporters. So don\u2019t rule out a pivot towards animal rights ... possibly partly inspired by the PM\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, who has worked for international charity Oceana, championed anti-whaling causes, and who also made a surprise appearance at this summer\u2019s Birdfair, dubbed \u201cthe conservationists\u2019 Glastonbury\u201d. In case you missed it, Jo Swinson launched the Liberal Democrat\u2019s election manifesto yesterday. You can catch up on the key policies here, including: revoking article 50 education promises including more childcare for working parents a \u00a37bn education cash injection into the NHS raised through a 1p increase on income tax a \u00a3130bn infrastructure investment in public transport You can read the Guardian\u2019s fact check on the party\u2019s claim that there will be a \u00a350bn \u201cremain bonus\u201d from revoking Brexit. As usual you can read plenty of Guardian opinion pieces today, including Owen Jones on why Jeremy Corbyn must convince voters under 40 that Labour\u2019s manifesto is worth voting for, or Johnson will triumph. There\u2019s also Martin Kettle on why it\u2019s time for tactical voting in this election. He says it is right for voters to cast their ballot for the candidate with the best chance of beating the Conservatives: \u201cThis is not a time for political piety, prissiness or pride. It\u2019s about facing the Brexit danger \u2013 and taking the one real chance of preventing it.\u201d The Conservatives haven\u2019t officially unveiled their manifesto yet, but Boris Johnson let a fairly large cat out of the bag yesterday when he revealed plans to raise the threshold at which people start paying National Insurance contributions from \u00a38,628 a year to \u00a39,500 \u2013 eventually rising to \u00a312,500. And the party pushing this policy this morning, tweeting in the past hour about the PM\u2019s support for people on low and middle incomes being able to \u201ckeep more of their hard-earned money\u201d. Back to housing and the Conservatives divulge plans to build 1m extra homes over the next five years today, as well as outline measures to make it easier for renters to buy. We\u2019ll bring you more details on that later. What else is happening today? Apart from Labour\u2019s manifesto launch at 11am, Boris Johnson is expected to be campaigning in Bedfordshire. And not election-related but still on politics, the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond is due to appear in court on a series of sexual assault and attempted rape charges. According to Press Association, the preliminary hearing is to take place at the High Court in Edinburgh. Salmond, 64, has previously denied the allegations and said he will defend himself \u201cto the utmost\u201d in court. The papers front pages are less election and more Prince Andrew today. You can see a full round up here, but here are the visual highlights. Good morning and welcome to all things politics for today. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I will be guiding you through the first hour or so of today\u2019s coverage. So let\u2019s get into it. The big set-piece event of the day is Jeremy Corbyn launching Labour\u2019s manifesto in Birmingham this morning. Its centrepiece is the party\u2019s big promise on social housing ... to the tune of \u00a375bn in a promise to \u201cbuild for the many\u201d. Corbyn will pledge to be \u201con your side\u201d, including promising to build 100,000 council houses a year and 50,000 social homes through housing associations by the end of its first term. That\u2019s a massive jump from the 6,287 council homes built in 2018-19. No doubt Labour hopes this pitch will appeal to the almost 1.6m families raising children in rented homes. And how will the pledge it be paid for? The money is earmarked to come out of the recently announced \u00a3150bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d. You can see the Guardian\u2019s fact check on whether the numbers stack up here. (Not to be outdone on housing, the Tories will announce their \u201cfairer deal for renters\u201d today, so stay tuned for that.) Another big set piece in the manifesto is Labour\u2019s promise to create a million green jobs to tackle the climate crisis. New jobs will be promised in insulation upgrade projects, offshore wind and carbon capture developments. As the Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor writes: \u201cThe focus on tackling climate change while also supporting mass job creation is likely to be a resolution of tension between ambitious de-carbonisation targets set by Labour activists at the autumn party conference and union concerns about job losses.\u201d According to the Press Association, the manifesto will also include plans to renationalise key utilities, following a pledge to take part of BT into public ownership to deliver free full-fibre broadband for all, as well as promises to significantly boost NHS spending. So stay tuned for a day of announcements.",
