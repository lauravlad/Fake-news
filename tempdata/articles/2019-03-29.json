Farage was speaking at a rival rally nearby.</p> \n  <p>And, just now, a report has emerged of tensions between Yaxley-Lennon\u2019s supporters and the police beginning to simmer. According to the Press Association, some have been engaging in a tug of war with officers over metal railings. Some Robinson backers are wearing yellow vests, while others have masks on, and appeared to be swearing and shouting at the police.</p> \n  <p>Earlier, the SNP MP, <strong>Joanna Cherry</strong>, tweeted:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joannaccherry/status/1111687381743267842\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very relieved to be safely back to my base in London.

He told RT\u00c9 Radio One:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We now are in an extremely serious situation. It\u2019s time perhaps to give time to it in terms of an extension and to calm things down ... A no-deal [Brexit] would be devastating for the agri-food industry in Ireland.

It is necessary to avoid the UK having to hold European elections, he says.</p> \n  <p><strong>John Baron</strong>, the Tory Brexiter, intervenes. Urging Raab not to change his mind, he says MPs must make a decision based on the facts available, not on what might happen in the future. This is a bad deal, Baron says.</p> \n  <p>Raab says there is a balance of risk. He cannot countenance a longer article 50 extension, or the UK taking part in European elections.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The choice now is between the risk of being held in the backstop by the EU for a period, without being able to control our exit, and on the other hand a significant risk of losing Brexit altogether. </p> \n   <p>Neither are palatable.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening \u2013 thanks for reading. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: MPs rejected the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal for a third time, throwing the plan for an orderly Brexit in May into chaos. A delay until 22 May, agreed with the EU last week, was dependent on the deal passing. A series of leave-supporting Conservative backbenchers, who had previously balked at the deal, reversed their positions after Theresa May said she would leave Downing Street if it passed. Competing pro-Brexit rallies were held in Westminster on the day many attendees had assumed would see them celebrating the UK\u2019s exit. Five people were arrested during the demonstrations, which attracted figures from the far-right, as well as more moderate Brexiters. MPs may be asked to vote again on the deal, amid indications the prime minister may be willing to call a general election. May told the Commons: \u201cI fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house,\u201d which has been interpreted in some quarters as a warning that, should MPs fail to back her, she could go to the country. The EU said the vote meant a no-deal Brexit was now likely and that a managed such process would not be on offer. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, underlined this, saying it did not appear clear the fact was appreciated in London. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Scotland Yard has now updated the arrest figures for today\u2019s rallies: The first three mentioned above have been added since 5.30pm. The other two arrests were made before that time. As of 5.30pm, there had been two arrests at today\u2019s pro-Brexit rallies, Scotland Yard says. One male was identified as being wanted for an offence in Hertfordshire and subsequently arrested. One male was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer. Both suspects have been taken to a central London police station, where they remain in custody. Police are unable to say at this point what offence the first person was arrested on suspicion of. Supporters of Yaxley-Lennon have marched to Downing Street. Many of his backers have begun to engage in heated exchanges with the police officers there, according to the Press Association. They chanted \u201cwe want our country back\u201d and \u201cwe want Brexit\u201d, before turning on a television crew. The rallies in Westminster are dying down but Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, the far-right activist also known as Tommy Robinson, has returned to the stage. With a much-diminished crowd, the chants of \u201coh Tommy Robinson\u201d continued as he led a singalong of Rule Britannia. Yaxley-Lennon, who\u2019s serving as an adviser to the Ukip leader, Gerard Batten, had previously told the crowd that Nigel Farage, the party\u2019s former leader, \u201cdoes not care about you, he is exactly the same as the establishment\u201d. Farage was speaking at a rival rally nearby. And, just now, a report has emerged of tensions between Yaxley-Lennon\u2019s supporters and the police beginning to simmer. According to the Press Association, some have been engaging in a tug of war with officers over metal railings. Some Robinson backers are wearing yellow vests, while others have masks on, and appeared to be swearing and shouting at the police. Earlier, the SNP MP, Joanna Cherry, tweeted: The Labour MP, Lisa Nandy, had also said she was the object of abuse. Opposition leaders in Ireland have voiced their disappointment at rejection of the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons. The Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has said: The behaviour of the DUP has been reckless and outrageous. They have been seduced by the games at Westminster at the cost of farmers, the economy and the views of the majority in the north. Our economy, the rights of citizens and our hard-won agreements cannot be collateral damage to Westminster. Sinn Fein is due to meet the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and other European leaders in Brussels on Monday. McDonald added: We will be pressing the case that in a crash-out Brexit, the EU must continue to act in the interests of all Ireland and support for our agreements, rights and economy. The Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Micheal Martin, said a further extension to article 50 was needed to ease tensions. He told RT\u00c9 Radio One: We now are in an extremely serious situation. It\u2019s time perhaps to give time to it in terms of an extension and to calm things down ... A no-deal [Brexit] would be devastating for the agri-food industry in Ireland. It would devastate the British economy, and the time for putting politics before the livelihoods of people is long over. There\u2019s a need now to think of businesses, to think of jobs. Nicola Sturgeon has offered further clarity on what her MPs may or may not support on Monday. The SNP are a significant voting bloc at Westminster and, inevitably, there\u2019s much speculation now about whether they could be persuaded to shift their position on some of the indicative vote options. They could, for example, have swung the customs union amendment on Wednesday, had they not abstained. But while the Scottish Conservatives accused the SNP of hypocrisy in not compromising over that amendment, Sturgeon was quick to point out yesterday that there was nothing in Wednesday\u2019s range of options that met the full continued single market/customs union arrangement put forward as a compromise by the Scottish government in 2016. And she had further clarified on Twitter this afternoon: Freedom of movement remains hugely important to the Scottish government, given the unique demographic challenges faced by the country and its heavy reliance on EU nationals, especially in the health and social care workforce. The Liberal Democrats have accused the government of sneaking out an impact assessment (pdf) that suggests a trade deal between the EU and Vietnam will \u201cincrease the welfare of UK households\u201d and boost UK exports to the country by nearly \u00a3500m per year. The party notes that the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has signed only eight trade deals that will maintain the relationships the UK currently has as an EU member, once it leaves the bloc. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, has said: Today, at one minute past 11pm, was supposed to be trade deal day for Liam Fox \u2013 the day he would roll over all our EU trade deals. This was the day when his vision of a buccaneering Britain would reach fruition. We would sign off trade deals worth tens of billions of pounds with countries across the globe. Unfortunately, his vision has collided with hard reality. Even when he gets the deal signed with Vietnam, the number still remain fewer than 10. On a day in which the government has witnessed yet another embarrassing defeat of the prime minister\u2019s deal, they have clearly decided today is a good day to bury bad news. Fox has failed. He should pay the price and walk. As an EU member, the UK benefits from trade deals that cover more than 70 countries. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, has called for a general election or a free vote in the Commons to break the Brexit impasse. He has said: Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is now dead. It has been rejected by the House of Commons three times. Its demise is testament to the prime minister\u2019s failure to act as a national rather than a party leader. Her efforts to reach out beyond the ranks of the Tory hard right have been too little and too late. It is now beyond urgent that politicians of all parties agree on a new approach. Uncertainty is costing jobs and investment. Britain\u2019s economic future is being held hostage by political paralysis. The deadlock can only be broken by a general election or by a free vote across the Commons on the range of options available. On Monday, MPs should agree a new approach based around a customs union between Britain and the EU. I would very much hope that those MPs in all parties who did not support this commonsense solution to the crisis in this week\u2019s indicative vote will do so in a free vote on Monday. In particular, I would urge the Scottish National party, supported as it is by many working people in Scotland, to vote to put economic security, jobs and prosperity first. While those events are going on, it has been confirmed this evening that Vote Leave has dropped its appeal against the Electoral Commission\u2019s finding that it broke the law. The commission says: Vote Leave has today withdrawn its appeal and related proceedings against the Electoral Commission\u2019s finding of multiple offences under electoral law, committed during the 2016 EU referendum campaign. Vote Leave was the designated lead campaigner for the leave outcome at the referendum. We found that it broke the electoral rules set out by parliament to ensure fairness, confidence and legitimacy at an electoral event. Serious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital, therefore, that they are properly investigated and sanctioned. We have been advised that Vote Leave has paid its \u00a361,000 fine and look forward to receiving the sum in full. In Westminster, where rival pro-Brexit rallies are taking place, the rhetoric is taking an aggressive and somewhat troubling turn, as my colleague Ben Quinn reports: The Labour MP Lisa Nandy says she has also been subjected to abuse: The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been speaking and it seems he may have drawn some supporters away from the event held by his old party: To chants of \u201cNigel, Nigel, Nigel\u201d, Farage said if Britain does not leave without a deal on 12 April and the country takes part in European elections on 23 May, he \u201cwill fight them\u201d. He claimed: And if the worst-case scenario occurs, if they force us to fight a second referendum, we will beat them by a bigger margin than last time. The SNP has been criticised for not voting for the customs union amendment during the indicative votes on Wednesday. This tweet from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, seems to be suggesting the SNP could back the customs union plan next week. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. More from my colleague Ben Quinn, who has been covering the rival pro-Brexit rallies outside the Houses of Parliament. The Mark Francois jibe seems to have been provoked in particular by a recent comment from James Naughtie (not even a Today presenter any more, but never mind). Naughtie infuriated Tories in the European Research Group by saying: Somebody put it to me the other day, look, in any other European country, the Conservative party wouldn\u2019t exist in its current form. The ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s group, in France would be in the National Front because that\u2019s what they believe, and in Germany they\u2019d be in the AfD. It\u2019s only because of our system that the carapace of this party keeps them in, and I think on both sides of the aisle that can\u2019t last. Naughtie subsequently apologised, saying his words had been ill-chosen. A UK snap election would not end the EU requirement that Britain stage European parliament elections if it wishes to remain in the EU beyond 23 May, the date of the European elections, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the German parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee chair, has said. R\u00f6ttgen, who has been in London for talks with David Lidington, the de-facto deputy prime minister, said: If Britain decides to be members on the European Union on the day of the European elections then European citizens have the right to take part in the European elections. You cannot deny citizens the right to take part in European elections. That is clear. He also insisted any request for an extension of article 50 beyond the month of May would have to come from the British government and not via parliament. And he warned any Conservative candidate for the party\u2019s leadership election who promised to unstitch a signed EU withdrawal agreement would be making \u201csimple, legally meaningless pledges that cannot be fulfilled under international law\u201d. He added if any Tory candidate sought to renegotiate a signed withdrawal agreement, the reaction would be \u201cthis is a done deal, full stop\u201d. R\u00f6ttgen said: We would notice the announcement of bad faith, particularly by people who are perhaps acquiring power in your country. More from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam on the delegation of ministers going in to see Theresa May. May\u2019s comments in the Commons earlier strongly implied she has no intention of tacking towards a no-deal Brexit. (See 3.08pm.) Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, has told the BBC he would rather see the UK stay in the EU than put the place of Northern Ireland in the union at risk, Nicholas Watt reports. This is what Chris Grayling, the Brexiter transport secretary, told the BBC about the result. What the house has just done is to vote effectively to leave this country either leaving the EU on 12 April with no deal, reversing Brexit or kicking it into the far long grass. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the majority in this country wants. We are going to have to think very hard over the next few hours how we respond to that. This is a hugely disappointing response that is absolutely not in the national interest. From the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. This is from Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, with footage of the March to Leave rally at Westminster. From the Times\u2019 Sam Coates. A mass of protesters ranging from British far-right activists through to Trump-voting Americans and French supporters of a \u2018Frexit\u2019 and others are among those attending a Ukip event outside the House of Parliament \u201csponsored\u201d, in the party\u2019s words, by Tommy Robinson. As supporters of the separate March to Leave event in Parliament Square assembled in front of a big screen, members of both crowds walked between it and the Ukip event, which was due to be addressed by the party\u2019s leader, Gerard Batten. To cheers, a number of Loyalist marching bands made a loud entrance to Parliament Square shortly after 4.30pm. Rabia Ouchikhe, a French citizen from the island of R\u00e9union who was gathered with others from France\u2019s Eurosceptic UPR movement, said: \u201cBrexit is a huge inspiration to us and we want France to follow.\u201d She said about 800 people had travelled from France. Other speakers were due to include Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, as well as the YouTube figure Carol Benjamin. Homemade placards and outfits ranging from yellow vests to military fatigues, as well as polo shirts of the various football fan groups that have come together under the banner of the Football Lads Alliance, were visible in the crowd. Barbara Parish, a former nurse from Nottingham, was wearing a crown and the sash of the suffragettes, and carrying a placard tracing UK democracy from the Magna Carta to universal suffrage and beyond. \u201cDon\u2019t let the EU and parliament destroy it,\u201d was her message. The gathering was watched by attendees who had floated across from the other rally. They included Louise Peart, a former police officer and NHS worker from Surrey, who described the parliamentary impasse as a \u201cshambles\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of getting tarnished as far right or racist or the other. We\u2019re just working, middle-class people who want democracy to be carried through,\u201d she said. Here is the full statement from the European commission following the vote in the Commons. The commission regrets the negative vote in the House of Commons today. As per the European council (article 50) decision on 22 March, the period provided for in article 50(3) is extended to 12 April. It will be for the UK to indicate the way forward before that date, for consideration by the European council. A \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since December 2017 and is now fully prepared for a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario at midnight on 12 April. The EU will remain united. The benefits of the withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option. The final two sentences refer to a claim often made by Brexiters at Westminster that, in the event of a no-deal departure, the UK and the EU would in practice negotiate a series of mini-agreements to mitigate the worst consequences. This is sometimes referred to as a managed no deal. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the UK does not realise a no-deal Brexit is still an option, and a growing possibility. In a statement just issued, he said: Ireland has been preparing intensively for a no-deal scenario. But no one should underestimate the difficulties that a no deal will present, for all of us, including the UK. It is not clear that the UK has fully understood that no deal is not off the agenda. Rather, it\u2019s a growing possibility. He said it was up to the UK to decide what to do now. And he went on: I believe we must be open to a long extension should the United Kingdom decide to fundamentally reconsider its approach to Brexit and put back on the table options previously ruled out. I believe that will result in a generous and understanding response from the [EU]27. The DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, has hinted the door is not closed on his party supporting Theresa May and her deal. He confirmed the party\u2019s position was a \u201cprincipled\u201d one, centred on the union of the UK and the threat the backstop posed to that. But in a statement, he suggested the problems were not insurmountable in the DUP\u2019s view: In our recent discussions with the government, good progress has been made on how domestic legislation would assist in ensuring the economic integrity of the UK as a whole and recognising Northern Ireland\u2019s particular situation sharing a land border with the European Union. We have encouraged the government to, as Dominic Raab has said [see 12.43pm], return to Brussels on these issues and not simply to accept the position of the European Union as being unalterable. The government must use the remaining time to deal with widely held concerns across the House of Commons. The list at 3.15pm is of all MPs who voted against Theresa May\u2019s agreement at MV2 and voted for it today - not just Conservative MPs as I originally wrote. Sorry. That has been corrected now. Here is some business reaction to the vote. From Josh Hardie, the CBI deputy director general. All eyes are now on Monday to discover what parliament is for. The UK\u2019s reputation, people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods are at stake. No deal is two weeks away. This winner-takes-all approach means everyone loses. Indicative votes must deliver. Only MPs can end this nightmare for businesses. And this is from Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors. The Brexit merry-go-round continues to spin, but the fun stopped a long time ago. We are running out of words to express how sick business leaders are of being stuck in this spirit-sapping limbo. The inability to make any decision is doing lasting damage to enterprise. As the ones who are actually negotiating with the EU, the government must be ready to make clear its own preferred route forward. It can\u2019t entirely absent itself from this process, even if parliament is crucial for the next steps. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. And this is from the Times\u2019 Sam Coates. On Sky News, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Tory Brexiter who voted against the agreement this afternoon, said he thought there would now have to be a long article 50 extension. At least after it was over, the UK would be able to leave the EU without conditions, he argued. (Although most Brexiters oppose a long article 50 extension, some of them read with interest this recent article by Martin Howe, a Brexiter QC, saying a long article 50 extension would be better than Theresa May\u2019s deal. What Jenkin was saying seemed to overlap with the arguments in the Howe piece.) Asked how he would feel about the UK having to take part in the European elections, Jenkin said he did not like the idea. But he suggested the Conservative party could refuse to take part. The full division list is here. This is how the parties divided: For the agreement Conservatives: 277 Labour: 5 (Sir Kevin Barron, Rosie Cooper, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint and John Mann) Independents: 4 (Ian Austin, Frank Field, Sylvia Hermon and Stephen Lloyd) Total: 286 Against the agreement Labour: 234 SNP: 34 Conservatives: 34 Independents: 16 Lib Dems: 11 DUP: 10 Plaid Cymru: 4 Green: 1 Total: 344 This is from Martin Selmayr, the European commission secretary general. Here is the Guardian guide to how MPs voted: And here is the list of MPs who voted against the withdrawal agreement at the second meaningful vote (MV2), but voted for it this afternoon: Lucy Allan, Richard Bacon, Crispin Blunt, Conor Burns, Rehman Chishti, Simon Clarke, Damian Collins, Rosie Cooper, Robert Courts, Richard Drax, Iain Duncan Smith, Charlie Elphicke, Michael Fabricant, Sir Michael Fallon, Jim Fitzpatrick, James Gray, Chris Green, Mark Harper, Gordon Henderson, Eddie Hughes, Boris Johnson, Gareth Johnson, Daniel Kawczynski, Pauline Latham, Andrew Lewer, Ian Liddell-Grainger, Jonathan Lord, Esther McVey, Anne Main, Sheryll Murray, Tom Pursglove, Dominic Raab, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Grant Shapps, Henry Smith, Royston Smith, Bob Stewart, Ross Thomson, Michael Tomlinson, Craig Tracey, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Shailesh Vara, John Whittingdale. Theresa May\u2019s defeat hits the pound as investors worry UK could crash out of EU without a deal. After the result of the vote was announced, sterling fell through the $1.30 mark against the US dollar for the first time since 11 March. The pound had earlier rallied to $1.314, as Conservative MPs, such as Dominic Raab, threw their support behind May. But it turned south as soon as traders heard the government had lost by 58 votes. The possibility of a general election is also unsettling the markets, following May\u2019s warning that parliament is \u201creaching the limits of the process\u201d. The currency expert Jeremy Thomson-Cook, of the foreign exchange company World First, said he couldn\u2019t see the pound recovering until the Brexit crisis had eased. Number 10 is holding a briefing now, but we learned quite a lot about Theresa May\u2019s thinking as to what happens next from the statement she gave to MPs. (See 2.54pm.) May seems determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit. One plausible response to the defeat, and the one that would have cheered Brexiters, would have been for May to resign herself to a no-deal Brexit on 12 April - or possibly 22 May, if the EU were to agree (as Katya Adler suggests they might - see 11.51am.) But May did not say she was going to do this, and she did not even seem to accept it as a possibility. She said MPs had been clear they would not allow it. And she ended saying: This government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands. May implied (although it was no more than this) that, if MPs could agree an alternative approach that would involve accepting the withdrawal agreement, she would support it. But she said there would have to be a further article 50 extension and that this would almost certainly involve the UK taking part in the European parliamentary elections - a condition that could turn out to be unacceptable to MPs. She said she thought MPs were \u201creaching the limits\u201d of attempts to find agreement. That sounded like an admission that she does not think the plan outlined above - an extension tied to MPs agreeing on a new plan - would work. It also sounded like a hint that she might go for a long article 50 extension tied to an election - although there would be considerable opposition to that amongst her own MPs too. The pound has fallen following the announcement of the result. Here is the full text of the statement Theresa May made to MPs after the result was announced. On a point of order Mr Speaker, I think it should be a matter of profound regret to every member of this House that once again we have been unable to support leaving the European Union in an orderly fashion. The implications of the House\u2019s decision are grave. The legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on 12 April. In just 14 days\u2019 time. This is not enough time to agree, legislate for and ratify a deal, and yet the House has been clear it will not permit leaving without a deal. And so we will have to agree an alternative way forward. The European Union has been clear that any further extension will need to have a clear purpose and will need to be agreed unanimously by the heads of the other 27 member States ahead of 12 April. It is also almost certain to involve the UK being required to hold European parliamentary elections. On Monday, this House will continue the process to see if there is a stable majority for a particular alternative version of our future relationship with the EU.Of course, all of the options will require the withdrawal agreement. Mr Speaker, I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House. This House has rejected no deal. It has rejected no Brexit. On Wednesday it rejected all the variations of the deal on the table. And today it has rejected approving the withdrawal agreement alone and continuing a process on the future. This government will continue to press the case for the orderly Brexit that the result of the referendum demands. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has called an emergency EU summit for Wednesday 10 April in light of this vote. That is two days before the new deadline for the UK\u2019s departure. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Wesminster, asks May to consider what Dominic Raab said in the debate about the backstop. She should use the time available to sort this out, he says. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says it is grotesque that May cannot recognise her deal is dead. Heidi Allen, the interim leader of the Independent Group, says May must recognise that her deal is dead. \u201cWe must have a people\u2019s vote now,\u201d she says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says May should consider revoking article 50. And, echoing Corbyn, he says there should be a general election. Jeremy Corbyn says the deal must change. If May cannot accept that, she must quit and let the country decide the future through a general election. Corbyn says May should call a general election if she is not willing to change her deal. Theresa May says the implications of this are \u201cgrave\u201d. The UK is due to leave the EU now on 12 April. That is not enough time to legislate for a deal. The UK could ask for a further extension. But that would mean holding European elections. MPs will consider further options on Monday. May says: I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house. She says she will continue to press the case for an \u201corderly Brexit\u201d. May says she will continue to fight for \u2018orderly Brexit\u2019. MPs have rejected Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement for the third time, by 344 votes to 286 \u2013 a majority of 58. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh This is from my colleague Dan Sabbagh. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Reminder: this is what Jacob Rees-Mogg told LBC last week about how he would not vote for the PM\u2019s Brexit deal if the DUP were voting against it. He said: Ultimately, the United Kingdom is more important to me than the European Union. So if the DUP felt the United Kingdom were being divided up in the deal then that would mean it were impossible to vote for the deal under any circumstances. This is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. May says she is commending this motion to the house \u201cwith all my heart\u201d. MPs are now voting. Yasmin Qureshi, a Labour MP, says May said this was about the country. But it wasn\u2019t, she says. She says Brexit has always been about the Conservative party. May says MPs from all parties voted for the referendum. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting says MPs have to think who might succeed May. He says she may have sacrificed her own career for the country. But there are plenty of people who want to follow her who put their own careers first, he says. May says, whoever succeeds her, the balance of votes in the House of Commons won\u2019t change. May urges MPs to \u201cput aside self and party\u201d and accept their responsibility to the British people. She says that is what she has done. Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies asks May to accept that her Brexit will make the UK poorer, more divided and more isolated. She knows that in her heart of hearts, he says. May says the government\u2019s own assessment shows this Brexit deal delivers the best outcome consistent with the referendum result. May says, if the deal is not passed today, the UK will have to leave the EU on 12 April. To avoid that, the UK would probably need a long extension, which would mean taking part in the European elections. She says she does not accept this is a \u201cblind Brexit\u201d. She says a withdrawal agreement would be required whatever deal is obtained. And she says the government is engaging in the Letwin process, which could lead to changes to the political declaration. She repeats the pledge made by Geoffrey Cox earlier to implement the Snell amendment. (See 10.02am.) And the Labour MPs behind that amendment will be consulted on the legislation, she says. Theresa May is now winding up the debate. She says the fact that the UK is not leaving the EU today is a matter of deep regret. She says people ask why she has brought the issue back today. They say she might leave, she says. But she is doing it because this is \u201cthe last opportunity to guarantee Brexit\u201d. Corbyn says he hopes the Commons retakes control on Monday. He hopes MPs enter those debates in the spirit of compromise. And he says the people should have the final say. If MPs cannot agree on Monday, there should be an election, he says. MPs should vote down this deal, he says. Many people fear for their jobs, and they worry about whether their friends can stay in the UK. We need to rebuild our communities, he says. A botched Brexit deal, like the one here today, will only deepen divisions. He urges MPs not to be cajoled by this \u201cthird-time lucky strategy\u201d and to vote down the deal. Corbyn says the government lost by the biggest majority in history in the first vote on the deal. The PM then tried begging, bullying and bribery. But the government then lost again, by the fourth-biggest margin in history. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, intervenes. She says Labour should be proud of the Good Friday agreement. Yet, by voting against the withdrawal agreement, it is voting against the backstop, and undermining the Good Friday agreement. Corbyn says he does not agree with that. Labour backs the Good Friday agreement, he insists. In the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn is now winding up for Labour. He says today\u2019s vote is \u201can affront to democracy\u201d. In January, the PM said the withdrawal agreement had to be taken alongside the political declaration, he says. But now the government is trying to separate the two. He says Labour will not vote for a \u201cblindfold Brexit\u201d. Passing the withdrawal agreement on its own would be doing just that, he says. The campaign group Change.org UK is seeking legal advice over the use of the name Change UK (see 1.01pm) for the new political party formed by members of the Independent Group of MPs, the Press Association reports. In a statement, the campaign group said: Change.org UK or UKChange is a movement of 17 million people in the UK. We empower ordinary people to start petitions and campaign to create the change they want to see. Change.org UK, or UKChange as we are interchangeably known, is totally independent of party politics, always has been and always will be. It is said that imitation is a form of flattery. But the movement that we have built in the UK to win campaigns for ordinary people is ours \u2013 all 17 million of us. We are seeking guidance on the proposed use of our brand name by those reported to be setting up a new political party. This is from Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform. In the context of what Grant is saying, it is worth flagging up this from jimbo246 BTL \u2013 which sounds like \u201cjust in case\u201d contingency planning, but could turn out to be prescient. Here are two BBC takes on the DUP/ERG relationship. From Nicholas Watt: From Laura Kuenssberg: Steve Brine, who resigned as a health minister this week to vote for the Letwin amendment setting up the indicate votes process, tells MPs he thinks the government will lose the vote today. He will back the government, he says. But he says the prospect of the PM losing explains why the next indicative votes debate on Monday will be so important. The SNP\u2019s Deidre Brock speaks next in the debate and quotes what an unnamed cabinet minister told Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. \u201cIt\u2019s like the living dead in here.\u201d Perhaps it was the PM herself who said this, Brock says. She also says she thinks Theresa May will be replaced by \u201ca more vicious version of the Bullingdon Club\u201d. The Tory Brexiter David Jones says he will continue to vote against the deal. If the deal had changed, he would have considered changing his mind, he says. But it has not. He says this was meant to be the day when the bells would be pealing to celebrate Brexit. The Tory Brexiter John Baron tells MPs he is going to carry on voting against Theresa May\u2019s deal. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says the political system at Westminster is broken. The people of Wales deserve better than this \u201cfailed empire of a union\u201d, she says. She also says she does not see why the Tories should be allowed \u201cmultiple shots\u201d at trying to get a deal through when the public are being denied a second referendum. A good question from BTL We were doing our own before MV1, but these are quite labour-intensive exercises, and in recent days the situation has been changing fast, which has not made things any easier. The most recent list I have seen is this one, by Alex Wickham at BuzzFeed. But it was last updated on Tuesday. At that point Wickham had counted 30 Tory MPs who had switched since MV2, and 45 Tories were were still saying they were opposed to the deal. The Tory Brexiter Owen Paterson says he has already voted against this deal twice, and he will vote against it again. He does not want to lose his \u201cintegrity and reputation\u201d, he says. He says that under the PM\u2019s plan, the UK would be subject to laws made by the EU27. They would have no incentive to act in the UK\u2019s interests, he says. He says the backstop would create an entity called UKNI. That could be contrary to the Acts of Union 1801, he says. At the end of her speech in the Commons, Anna Soubry said the Independent Group of MPs were now registering themselves as a political party, under the name Change UK. She said that could be the only good thing coming out of Brexit. The Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, who represents the remain-voting Poplar and Limehouse constituency in London, is voting for the PM\u2019s deal. He told the Press Association: I don\u2019t want a no deal. I\u2019ve voted against it twice, but this is a different proposition. It\u2019s separating the withdrawal deal, it gives us the opportunities to influence the final political situation and therefore, from my point of view, it\u2019s a better offer. I\u2019ve been saying for some time if it\u2019s a choice between her deal or no deal, then I\u2019d take her deal. This is from the Lib Dem leader, Sir Vince Cable. Anna Soubry, the former Conservative who is now part of the Independent Group, says she does not see why MPs are allowed to vote on the PM\u2019s deal two or three times, while the government refuses to give the public another say in a referendum. And she says Tories who say they are only backing the deal now because Theresa May is resigning are hypocritical. Outside the Houses of Parliament, pro-Brexit campaigners have brought traffic to a halt by blocking the road, the Press Association reports. They chanted \u201cWe shall not be moved\u201d and \u201cLeave means leave.\u201d The Tory Brexiter Sir Christopher Chope tells MPs he is still voting against the PM\u2019s deal. Dominic Raab is speaking in the debate now. He says he resigned at the end of last year because he opposed the PM\u2019s deal. And he still thinks it is a bad deal. But the government has effectively taken no-deal off the table, he says. It has not ruled out a further, long extension of article 50. This could lead to the UK ending up staying in the single market. But he says MPs need to proceed with realism. There is a choice between a risk of being trapped in the backstop, and a significant risk of Brexit not happening. He says the UK is left with these choices because of the flawed decisions taken by the government. This is not a third meaningful vote, he says. But it has significant legal and practical implications. It is necessary to get the extension until 22 May. It is necessary to avoid the UK having to hold European elections, he says. John Baron, the Tory Brexiter, intervenes. Urging Raab not to change his mind, he says MPs must make a decision based on the facts available, not on what might happen in the future. This is a bad deal, Baron says. Raab says there is a balance of risk. He cannot countenance a longer article 50 extension, or the UK taking part in European elections. The choice now is between the risk of being held in the backstop by the EU for a period, without being able to control our exit, and on the other hand a significant risk of losing Brexit altogether. Neither are palatable. Both could have been avoided if the government had shown the requisite resolve and will. He says the government should use the extra time available to get an exchange of letters with the EU giving effect to the Brady amendment. When the EU says it won\u2019t accept legally binding changes to the backstop, he says it is always assumed that the EU will hold firm, and that the UK must compromise. That mindset got us into this problem in the first place, he says. He says he is voting for the motion, but without prejudice to his position on the next meaningful vote. In the debate, the Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse says Theresa May could get her deal over the line if she combined it with a referendum. The Tory Brexiter Priti Patel says if MPs vote for this deal, they will be voting for a deal drawn up by the EU. She says her constituents voted leave. And leave should mean leave, she says. She says people are getting fed up of these endless debates. She implies that she is voting against the deal, but she does not say so explicitly. The BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins says there does not seem to be much sign of Labour MPs switching, and deciding to vote for the deal. (See 11.01am.) And ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks Theresa May is heading for a substantial defeat. The Tory Brexiter Anne-Marie Trevelyan is backing the PM\u2019s deal, ITV\u2019s Joe Pike reports. She has opposed it until now. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Michel Barnier\u2019s senior adviser, Stefaan de Rynck, has defended the Irish backstop, saying it is just as much an issue for the EU as it is for Ireland. He told the UK in a Changing Europe conference in London: It\u2019s really a mistake [to think of this as an Ireland-only issue]. This is also a European backstop. This is about the integrity of the internal market and protection of internal states, as much as about the protection of the Good Friday agreement \u2026 When I speak to businesses in France, in Belgium, in Denmark, the backstop comes up. He said businesses in the Benelux and Denmark are worried the border will not be robust enough after Brexit. Concerns cited previously over the border for non-Irish member states are British or other cheap but high-value goods from the likes of China flowing at industrial levels across the Irish border and on to the continent. De Rynck said if the UK crashed out of the EU with no deal on 13 April, the EU would act \u201cunilaterally\u201d to protects its interest and take temporary measures on aviation and lorry transport. Most favoured nation tariffs would apply to goods entering the bloc, as would regulatory checks on animals and food. \u201cThe member states are prepared, that doesn\u2019t mean there will not be disruption, but it is manageable on our side,\u201d he said. De Rynck did not say how this would apply on the Irish border, something that will be discussed at a summit between Angela Merkel and Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Thursday. (See 11.05am.) Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former chief whip, was one of the 39 Conservatives who voted against the deal at MV1 but in favour at MV2. He is still in favour, he tells MPs. The Labour Brexiter Kate Hoey has just intervened during Sammy Wilson\u2019s speech to say anyone voting for the deal today will be seen as not supporting the right of Northern Ireland to remain in the UK. Hoey often votes with the government on Brexit, but she did vote against the deal as a whole at MV2 and will again today, she is implying. Sammy Wilson, the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, is speaking in the Commons now. He says the DUP has not changed its position. People say this is not a meaningful vote, he says. But is it meaningful to the DUP; if they back the deal, Northern Ireland will be stuck in the backstop. Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European and former attorney general, says he will not be voting for the deal because it will not deliver the benefits people claim it will. He says he agrees on this with John Redwood, the Brexiter \u2013 they both think the agreement does not deliver what was promised at the referendum. His Tory colleague Bob Seely intervenes. Doesn\u2019t Grieve accept the need to compromise? Grieve says compromise is only possible if people can take a settled view on an outcome. He says some of his Brexiter colleagues want to rework the Brexit settlement in the next stage of the talks. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has an interesting Twitter thread on the latest thinking in Brussels on what happens next. It starts here. She says, if the PM\u2019s deal fails again, and the UK opts for a no-deal Brexit rather than a long extension, the EU would probably delay that until 22 May. But the Labour MP Gareth Snell has told the BBC he is \u201cminded\u201d to vote for the government today, presumably in part because of Geoffrey Cox accepting his amendment. (See 10.02am.) Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, is speaking in the debate now. Using a metaphor that his Labour colleague Sir Keir Starmer was using on the Today programme this morning, he says voting for the withdrawal agreement without the political declaration would be like buying a house without knowing were you were going to live next. The Scottish Conservative Ross Thomson has posted a thread on Twitter explaining why, after voting against the PM\u2019s deal twice, he is now backing it. It starts here. Back in the chamber, the Tory Brexiter Sir John Redwood is speaking now. He says his constituents do not want the withdrawal deal. At best around a quarter of the public is in favour, he says. He says it would require legislation that would, in practice, keep the UK in the EU for several years. The EU would be able to decide new laws for the UK during that period, and the UK would have to accept. He also says the UK would be committing to open-ended payments to the EU. Who on earth would agree to pay unlimited, unknown bills and not have genuine independent arbitration over the purpose? The Labour MP Lisa Nandy also signed the Snell amendment. But she is going to vote against the government today even though the government has accepted it. (See 10.02am.) This is from ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt. The European commission has said that the UK only has to pass the withdrawal agreement for the UK to be able to leave the EU with a deal (ie, with the transition). This is from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner. Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier is speaking in the debate now. She says, if the UK has to take part in the European elections to be able to get a long article 50 extension, she would be happy with that. Melanie Onn is one of the Labour MPs who signed the Gareth Snell amendment, which Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, accepted in his speech at the start of the debate. (See 10.02am.) But, from this tweet, it does not sound as if she is being brought round. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, is speaking in the debate. He says he will vote for the deal. Until now he has been voting against it. He says some of his colleagues believe that, if they vote against the deal today, the UK will leave the EU on 12 April without a deal. But he is not convinced that that is what would happen, he says. He says the EU would want the UK to stay in. Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan intervenes to say Duncan Smith described the deal at one point as the \u201cfinal deceit\u201d. Duncan Smith says all the people opposing the government today want the UK to get another extension from the EU before 12 April. He says voting for the motion is the one way of ensuring that the UK will leave on 22 May. John Bercow, the Speaker, says there will now be an eight-minute limit on speeches. German chancellor Angela Merkel is to visit Dublin next Thursday amid high expectation that Theresa May will fail to win parliamentary support for the UK-EU Brexit deal this afternoon. The taoiseach Leo Varadkar is also travelling to Paris to meet Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. No-deal planning will be high on the agenda with no clear picture as to what the EU and Ireland will do on the Irish border in the event of a no deal to protect the single market. A German official told the Irish Times \u201cThis is not a social call.\u201d Confirming the summits with the EU\u2019s two key leaders, the taoiseach said in a statement: Both leaders have been strong and consistent allies of Ireland in responding to the unique challenges we face from Brexit. I will again express the government\u2019s gratitude for their continuing solidarity. We will take stock of the latest developments on Brexit when we meet, efforts to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement and no-deal planning. Both Merkel and Macron raised the issue of the Irish border at the meeting of the European Council last Thursday. \u201cWhat will happen if there is a no-deal Brexit on 12 April?\u201d Macron asked of the Irish taoiseach. \u201cWould you be fine?\u201d Varadkar replied: \u201cWe can cope\u201d. Under EU rules Ireland would have to impose tariffs and sanitary and phytosanitary checks on the Irish border on any food, plants and animals coming from Northern Ireland raising questions about cross-border food and drink production. At the weekend Varadkar insisted: \u201cI am not under any pressure from chancellor Merkel or anyone else on this issue\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is suggesting on Twitter that Labour MPs could rescue Theresa May. At MV2 only three Labour MPs voted with the government. The Cox announcement about the Snell amendment (see 10.02am) might help to win some more over, but to win the vote, Theresa May would need a sizeable Labour revolt and there is no evidence yet that that is going to happen. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is speaking in the debate now. He says Theresa May has made no attempt to engage with opposition MP, or with the devolved administrations. He says he and other opposition leaders met May last week. But she refused to accept any of the arguments they were making. This is from the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes. The Tory MP James Cartlidge asks Cash to accept that, if the vote is lost today, the UK could end up staying in the EU forever. Cash says he does not accept that. The legislation repealing the European Communities Act 1972 has already been passed, he says. He says he cannot imagine the Commons repealing it. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, is speaking in the debate now. He says the backstop \u201cdrives a coach and horses through our precious union\u201d. That is why the DUP will vote against the government today, he says. Sir John Redwood, another Tory Brexiter, intervenes. He says the government is not publishing its EU withdrawal agreement bill today because it would make it clear that, under the backstop, Northern Ireland would remain bound to the EU. Cash says he agrees. He says MPs should be able to see the bill today, so that they know what they are voting for. Scottish secretary David Mundell has warned that MPs \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways\u201d over today\u2019s vote on the withdrawal agreement. He told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland: They can\u2019t say, \u2018I don\u2019t like the future relationship that the prime minister has negotiated\u2019 and then on other hand say, \u2018We can\u2019t not tie down the future relationship because we want to have a say and shape it\u2019. It is very disappointing that colleagues and other parties haven\u2019t supported the deal. What we hadn\u2019t anticipated was the level of politics that would be played with the deal. Mundell - who himself broke the Tory whip last week to abstain on the vote to reject no-deal in any circumstances when his party was told to vote against it at the last minute - described himself as \u201cdisappointed\u201d that some Tory colleagues were still not supporting the deal. He also repeated accusations of SNP hypocrisy after the party voted against the customs union amendment on Wednesday after supporting such a compromise in previous statements, and urged \u201cMPs of all parties to put the national interest ahead of narrow political objectives\u201d. This morning, new polling from Progress Scotland \u2013 the pro-independence research organisation set up by former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson \u2013 found that Brexit had overtaken the economy as the key factor in people deciding whether to vote for independence, with 43% of those surveyed citing it in their top three concerns. However, the polling also suggested that overall support for independence had stalled, with 24% saying that they completely supported leaving the UK, compared with 40% who completely supported remaining. However, 56% of those still undecided about independence said they would be more likely to vote for it in the event of a no deal Brexit. Back in the debate Labour\u2019s Gareth Snell intervenes. If the government accepted the Labour version of Brexit, would Labour still want that to be subject to a confirmatory referendum? Nick Thomas-Symonds says Labour has been arguing for the UK to stay in the customs union for months. He says it is the PM\u2019s fault that has not been considered. He does not address whether Labour would still insist on a confirmatory referendum if the government backed its version of Brexit. (Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, told the People\u2019s Vote rally last Saturday that he thought any deal should be put to a referendum. On Wednesday Labour backed an amendment saying this too. But Jeremy Corbyn wrote to his MPs saying the party was backing that amendment even though it did not agree with everything it said.) This is from the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. For several months now Boris Johnson, the former Brexiter foreign secretary, has been denouncing Theresa May\u2019s deal. It was \u201cvassal state stuff\u201d, he used to say. But now he has confirmed in a series of tweets he will vote for it. Asked which bits of the withdrawal agreement Labour cannot accept, Thomas-Symonds says Labour has always been clear that the WA and the political declaration must be taken together. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, is speaking for Labour now. He says the government is asking MPs to accept a \u201cblindfold Brexit\u201d. Not only is it a blindford Brexit, MPs would be going into a different room, led by a different prime minister. He says Brexit should not depend on the outcome of a Tory leadership contest. He says Labour will never leave a Tory PM free to rip up workers\u2019 rights. Cox is winding up now. He says backing the amendment will guarantee the right to an article 50 extension. Any other extension could not be guaranteed, he say, and it would be subject to the EU agreeing. And it would require the UK to participate in European elections. He urges MPs to vote for the motion. Cox says there will be new mechanism introduced that will ensure the Commons is consulted on the next phase of the negotiation. He says the government would have accepted the Gareth Snell amendment had it been called. Snell asks Cox for an assurance that the EU withdrawal agreement bill will contain the legislative proposals in the amendment. Cox says the bill has not been published yet, but if Snell bring backs his plans as an amendment to that bill, the government will be \u201cminded to accept\u201d. Cox says government will agree to legislate to ensure MPs can vote to set the negotiating mandate for the next phase of the Brexit talks. For the record, here is the text of the Snell amendment. At end, add \u201cand further resolves that any bill introduced for the purposes of section 13 of that act to give effect to the withdrawal agreement in United Kingdom law should: 1. empower the House of Commons to pass a resolution or resolutions setting the negotiating mandate for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the Europe Union before 1 July 2019; 2. require the prime minister to report at least every three months on the progress of negotiations and the extent to which the likely outcome of those negotiations reflects the negotiating mandate set by the House of Commons; and 3. provide that the prime minister may not sign an agreement with the European Union on the future relationship unless authorised to do so by a resolution of the House of Commons.\u201d. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant says Cox is claiming passing the motion would provide certainty. But there would be no certainty. There would be no guarantee the EU withdrawal agreement bill would pass, he says. Cox says, if MPs back the motion today, he would expect them to pass the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, says the extension until 22 May is a technical extension. If the UK has not passed the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration by then, the UK will leave the EU without a deal, he says. But he says at the moment the UK still has the option to request a longer extension, for a different sort of Brexit. Cox says he knew Grieve was a distinguished lawyer, but he did not know he had a crystal ball. He says Grieve cannot be sure the EU would grant a second extension. Cox says Labour has not objected to a single clause or article of the withdrawal agreement. Yet Labour still intends to vote against it, he says. What kind of cynicism is that, Mr Speaker? Cox accuses Labour of \u201ccynicism\u201d because he says it is voting against an agreement is supports. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn says, if MPs pass the resolution today, the UK could go beyond 12 April, and after that it would not be able to get another extension beyond 22 May. Cox says today MPs can guarantee an extension to 22 May. That offers certainty. He says Benn\u2019s plan would mean taking a chance on the EU offering a further extension. Cox says the EU is open to changing the political declaration. He says the Commons is in the middle of a process (indicative votes) that might propose changes to the political declaration. If today\u2019s motion is posed, the government will bring forward the EU withdrawal implementation bill within the next few days, he says. Labour\u2019s Ian Lucas asks Cox to admit that this motion does not comply with section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act, which says that for the withdrawal agreement to be ratified, MPs must pass a resolution backing the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. Cox says the motion is not intended to be a resolution of the required under section 13 of the act. Cox says the government fully accepts the Speaker\u2019s ruling that it cannot bring back the same motion for a repeat vote. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is opening the debate. He starts with an apology. He is sorry MPs have had to come to the Commons today. (It was not meant to be a sitting day.) He says the UK should have been leaving today. But he won\u2019t go through the reasons why that is not happening, he says. He refers to the conclusion at the EU summit last week about an article 50 extension. He reads out a summary of what the summit decided. Here is the key passage from the EU statement: The European council agrees to an extension until 22 May 2019, provided the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week. If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European council agrees to an extension until 12 April 2019 and expects the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by the European council. Cox says, if MPs do not pass the WA today, then the article 50 extension until 22 May will lapse. Any further extension beyond 12 April would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU, he says. That means any one member state could have vetoed the process. He says, if the UK is going to leave the EU with any sort of deal, this WA will need to be passed. All negotiated exits from the European Union will require this withdrawal agreement to have been approved. Cox says any Brexit deal will require MPs passing this withdrawal agreement. Cox says today\u2019s debate is about ensuring the UK can guarantee its \u201clegal right\u201d to an article 50 extension until 22 May. Cox says today is the last chance for MPs to secure the UK\u2019s \u201clegal right\u201d to an article 50 extension until 22 May. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he is not selecting any of the three amendments down. (See 9.24am.) The Commons sitting has started. MPs approve the business motion without a division. According to a ConservativeHome survey, 60% of Tory party members now think MPs should back Theresa May\u2019s deal. As ConservativeHome\u2019s Paul Goodman explains, that is quite a turnaround. Previously the membership was strongly opposed. The month before last, 19 per cent of Party member respondents to our survey said that the agreement was acceptable to them. Last month, the total saying that MPs should vote for it touched 40 per cent. This month, it has reached 60 per cent. That\u2019s the first time the deal has obtained the backing of a majority of replies in any form. Three in five is a clear-cut margin \u2013 although over one in three party members remain opposed, if our survey is anything to go by. In an article for ConservativeHome, Mark Harper, the former Tory chief whip, explains why he has reversed his opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal. He explains: It is now clear from the events of the last few weeks in parliament that there are many MPs who wish to frustrate the decision made by the British people in the EU referendum, and are prepared to stop at nothing to do so. The cabinet\u2019s withdrawal agreement and political declaration remain a bad set of proposals. The passage of time hasn\u2019t changed this. However, I am prepared to compromise to ensure that we deliver Brexit. Another Tory MP who voted against the deal at MV1 and MV2 but who is now switching is Lucy Allan. In a post on Facebook, she said: No-one, but no-one, wants this uncertainty and chaos to continue. A vote for the deal means we can leave in a few weeks - a vote against means we don\u2019t. Tomorrow\u2019s vote is a vote on Brexit: either we leave or we don\u2019t. My constituents voted 67% to leave and leave we must. I have a duty to deliver that, whatever I think personally about the deal. Today we are likely to see a large number of Tory MPs who have previously voted against the withdrawal agreement at MV1 and MV2 - at least 30, according to one count - support the government. One of them is the Brexiter Daniel Kawczynski. You can read the motion for today\u2019s debate on the Commons order paper here (pdf). Three amendments have been tabled. One is an SNP one saying the government should not take the UK out of the EU without the consent of the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly, and another is from the SNP\u2019s Angus Brendan MacNeil saying article 50 should be revoked. Both of these, or versions of them, have been tabled before. The third one is more interesting. Tabled by Labour\u2019s Gareth Snell, and backed by Labour colleagues sympathetic to Brexit, it says the government should legislate to ensure the Commons can pass a resolution setting the negotiating mandate for the next phase of the Brexit process. Today is the 10th big Brexit vote held in the Commons this year. But it is not technically another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. MVs have been about trying to pass the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration at the same time, and we have had two of them already. We\u2019ve also had six \u201cnext steps\u201d (NS) votes, scheduled to allow MPs to discuss alternative plans after the deal was rejected in an MV. And there has been one indicative votes (IV) debate. Today we need a new acronym. It is a vote just on the withdrawal agreement, so that makes it WA1. MV1- Tuesday 15 January: This was the night Theresa May suffered the biggest government defeat in the era of democratic politicswhen MPs voted down her Brexit deal for the first time, by a majority of 230. Some 118 Conservatives voted against. NS1 - Tuesday 29 January: May managed to salvage a victory, but only by getting Tory MPs to unite behind the Brady amendment, which said her deal would only be acceptable if the backstop were \u201creplaced\u201d by \u201calternative arrangements\u201d. As well as effectively having to vote against her own deal, May was also defeated when MPs passed the Spelman amendment, ruling out no deal. Some 17 Tories defied the whip to back it. NS2 - Thursday 14 February: May suffered a surprise defeat when what was meant to be non-controversial motion just restating the NS1 result got voted down, by a majority of 45, because hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group did not want to be seen to be endorsing the Spelman result. The vote had little practical effect, but it was humiliating for May, whose defeat was decided entirely by a whipping decision taken by the ERG. NS3 - Wednesday 27 February: Unusually May was on the winning side, as Tory and Labour MPs united to support a backbench amendment committing the government to allowing a vote on extending article 50 if it lost MV2. But it was an amendment tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, underwriting a verbal promise only made by May to stop pro-European ministers resigning en masse. MV2 - Tuesday 12 March: This was the second vote on the deal, taking place after a late-night rush by May to Strasbourg the night before to firm up new assurances with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. But legal advice from Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, saying the legal risk of being stuck in the backstop remained \u201cunchanged\u201d, torpedoed any hope of victory, and the deal was voted down by a majority of 149, with 75 Tory MPs voting against. NS4 - Wednesday 13 March: This was the debate on ruling out a no-deal Brexit. But the government motion only ruled out no deal on 29 March, and May was defeated twice as MPs voted to rule out a no-deal Brexit for good. Some 17 Tories defied the whip and voted against any no deal in the final vote, with another 29 Tories abstaining, including four cabinet ministers. NS5 - Thursday 14 March: This was the debate where MPs approved, by a majority of 211, a government motion approving an article 50 extension until 30 June if MPs backed May\u2019s deal. Unusually for a Brexit debate, May did not lose a single vote, after the Benn amendment saying parliament should take control was defeated by a majority of two, and a second referendum amendment was rejected by a majority of 249. NS6 - Monday 25 March: After much talk for several weeks of MPs taking control of the Brexit process, finally the Commons approved the Letwin amendment enabling them to do just that. Three ministers resigned to join the 30 Tories who defied the whip to back Letwin, and the amendment was passed by a majority of 27. IV1 - Wednesday 27 March: This was the first indicative votes debates, held because the Letwin amendment enabled MPs, not the government, to decide the Commons business for the day, and MPs voted in a paper ballot on eight options. Critics claimed the process was a failure after all eight options were defeated, but a customs union was rejected by just eight votes, suggesting where compromise might be possible. Today was the day that the UK was supposed to be leaving the EU, two years after Theresa May sent the letter triggering article 50. But instead the House of Commons is having another debate about Brexit. It has almost become our national sport; by my count, this is the 10th big Brexit vote MPs have staged this year. Here is our overnight preview story. Today\u2019s vote will not be on the same proposition as the two \u201cmeaningful votes\u201d on May\u2019s deal that have been held already. They are voting just on the withdrawal agreement (WA), and not on the political declaration (PD) part of the deal. But it is the third time the WA has been put to a vote, and the debate is going ahead even though May is very likely to lose. My colleague Rajeev Syal explains why it is happening here. Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt also tried to find out from a cabinet minister why the vote was going ahead. The answer he got was rather more colourful. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK\u2019s former ambassador to the EU, speaks at a Chatham House event on Brexit. 9.30am: MPs begin the Brexit debate. After MPs approve the business motion, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will open the debate. After 2pm: Theresa May winds up the debate. MPs will then vote at 2.30pm. 4pm: Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, meets March to Leave campaigners as they arrive in Westminster. At 4.30pm Ukip are holding their own Make Brexit Happen rally at Westminster.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May hopes to bring her Brexit deal back to parliament again next week after it was rejected for a third time by MPs \u2013 and appears poised to trigger a general election if parliament fails to agree a way forward. Despite the embattled prime minister\u2019s dramatic promise on Wednesday that she would hand over the keys to 10 Downing Street if her Tory colleagues backed the withdrawal agreement, parliament voted against it on Friday, by 344 to 286. The Commons vote was held on the day when Britain was meant to be leaving the European Union, as Parliament Square outside overflowed with raucous pro-Brexit protesters. A string of leave-supporting Conservative backbenchers who had twice rejected the deal, including Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, switched sides to support the agreement. But with Labour unwilling to shift its position, and the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s 10 MPs implacably opposed, it was not enough to secure a majority for May. The result was a sense of stunned disbelief in Westminster. Asked what could happen next, one government source said: \u201cLast one out, turn off the lights.\u201d Immediately after the defeat was announced, May told MPs: \u201cThe implications of the house\u2019s decision are grave. The legal default now is that the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on 12 April. In just 14 days\u2019 time.\u201d Under the deal agreed by EU leaders in Brussels last week, if May had passed her withdrawal agreement this week, Brexit would have been delayed until 22 May. Now, she will have to return to Brussels for an emergency European council summit on 10 April. The EU27 expect her to ask for a longer delay \u2013 requiring Britain to participate in the European elections in May \u2013 or accept a no-deal Brexit two days later. However, her aides hope the 22 May date could still be in play if her deal is accepted next week. May did not spell out explicitly what she planned to do next, saying only that she would press ahead with an \u201corderly Brexit\u201d. However, it became increasingly clear after the vote that Downing Street does not believe the deal is dead. The prime minister pointed to MPs\u2019 plans to hold a second round of indicative votes on Monday, \u201cto see if there is a stable majority for a particular alternative version of our future relationship with the EU\u201d. But she told MPs: \u201cI fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this house.\u201d Many regarded that as a warning that if they supported an option she was not prepared to implement, or failed to reach agreement on an alternative, she was ready to call a general election. Government sources suggested she was first likely to make another attempt to force her deal through parliament in a third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. This might happen in a \u201crun-off\u201d against any successful alternative from Monday\u2019s indicative votes. The government has been discussing with the Speaker, John Bercow, whether there is a way to hold MV3 that would not fall foul of his insistence that the same proposition cannot be put before parliament again. A Downing Street spokesman highlighted the fact that May\u2019s margin of defeat, 58, was smaller than the 149 majority she lost by earlier this month, and the crushing 230-strong defeat in the first meaningful vote in January. \u201cWe are at least going in the right direction,\u201d the spokesman said. No 10 sources also pointed out that her deal had won more supporters than any of the eight options considered by MPs in Wednesday\u2019s indicative votes, in which the most popular, a referendum, received the backing of 268 MPs. Backers of the various alternatives were discussing how to build a proposition that could command a majority on Monday. Cabinet ministers were instructed to abstain in last week\u2019s process, which the government had initially tried to scupper by whipping MPs to vote against the business motion. May is likely to come under pressure to offer a free vote to cabinet supporters of a soft Brexit \u2013 the \u201cGaukward squad\u201d \u2013 on Monday. Jeremy Corbyn responded to the prime minister\u2019s latest defeat by calling on her to resign and trigger a general election.\u201cIf the prime minister can\u2019t accept that, then she must go, not at an indeterminate date in the future, but now, so that we can decide the future of this country through a general election,\u201d the Labour leader said. He had earlier urged his MPs to reject the deal, warning that it would lead to a \u201cblindfold Brexit\u201d. Just five Labour MPs voted for the withdrawal agreement. Before the vote, May had told MPs that the withdrawal agreement was the only way to guarantee Brexit and avoid a \u201ccliff edge\u201d in two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cWhen the division bell rings in a few moments, every one of us will have to look into our hearts to decide what is right for our country,\u201d she said. Friday\u2019s vote did not technically qualify as a third \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, because MPs were asked to consider only the withdrawal agreement, which includes the controversial Irish backstop and secures EU citizens\u2019 rights and the post-Brexit transition period.",

Here are what members of the ERG have said in the past about the deal they just voted for. Boris Johnson As well as describing it as \u201cwoeful\u201d, \u201clamentable\u201d, \u201ca deal that represents the worst of both worlds\u201d, and full of \u201cappalling defects\u201d, Boris Johnson wrote of the deal: \u201cI am afraid that, in legal terms, they will be our colonial masters, and there will not be a damn thing we can do about any of it. Will I vote for this backstop, as things stand? No way.\u201d The Telegraph, 10 March 2019 A week later he described a constituency meeting where they were discussing the deal: \u201cThere was a chance, I said, that the government would ask parliament to vote for a third time on the prime minister\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement. If such a vote took place, I had two options. I could either stick to my guns, or I could fold. I asked for a show of hands. I was struck by the near unanimity of the meeting. My constituents were strongly of the view that I should not compromise.\u201d The Telegraph, 17 March 2019 Boris Johnson voted to pass the withdrawal agreement. Esther McVey \u201cIt will be no good trying to pretend to [voters] that this deal honours the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone that it doesn\u2019t. We have gone from \u2018no deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 to \u2018any deal is better than no deal\u2019. I cannot defend this, and I cannot vote for this deal. I could not look my constituents in the eye were I to do that.\u201d Esther McVey\u2019s resignation letter, November 2018 Esther McVey voted to pass the withdrawal agreement.

Of the six Labour MPs and two former Labour MPs who have signed the original amendment tabled on Friday morning, two have have already voted for the deal, Caroline Flint and Frank Field. The others have thus far withheld their support, but many have voted repeatedly against a second referendum or long article 50 extension. The amendment would require the Commons to pass a resolution approving the government\u2019s future negotiating mandate and any final trade deal with the EU, as well as obliging the government to report back to parliament every three months. It is unlikely the Labour frontbench would have backed the amendment, because it implicitly endorses May\u2019s Brexit deal. The prime minister will put only the withdrawal agreement to a vote on Friday, the day Britain was meant to be officially leaving the EU, having promised to step aside if MPs give her their approval. No 10 is hoping some Labour MPs could back the withdrawal agreement severing the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, without the political declaration governing Britain\u2019s future relationship with Brussels. However, it remains extremely unlikely to pass as Labour said it would never vote for a \u201cblindfold Brexit\u201d, while about 30 Eurosceptic Tories and the 10 Democratic Unionist party MPs are also holding out against it. A long-planned amendment on a confirmatory referendum to any Brexit deal, authored by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, was not tabled for Friday. MPs said efforts would focus on gaining support for the next round of anticipated indicative votes on Monday, should May\u2019s deal fail. Many of the most hardline Tory Brexiters have said they will now reluctantly back the deal. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he would support the plan, having previously called it \u201cworse than remaining in the EU\u201d. Smith said he hoped a Eurosceptic could take over May\u2019s job for the remainder of the negotiations. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to take a decision, which is we want to leave.

      "body": "<p>The news may yet be good. There is a way ahead. If we can just keep our nerve for one last push on Monday, a sensible outcome to the Brexit saga is in sight. It is what it always has been: Brexit within a customs union. It is \u201cleave\u201d without lunacy. But first Theresa May is to make one last despairing attempt to get her twice-rejected \u201cred lines\u201d deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/28/what-could-happen-if-mays-brexit-deal-is-voted-down-again\" title=\"\">through the Commons</a>.</p> <p>To satisfy the Speaker\u2019s requirement that it not be substantially the same as the previous votes, only the withdrawal agreement will be considered. But this represents the vast bulk of the deal, unchanged. Even as her fractious cabinet combusts, she hurls herself sacrificially into the flames. Until now, May\u2019s way was presented as at least better than hard Brexit. The choice was between it and crashing out. But her deal would still involve arguing over \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d for two more ghastly years \u2013 and then a possible repeat of this week\u2019s chaos.</p> <p>On the other hand, Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/alternative-brexit-options-what-will-john-bercow-select-for-indicative-votes\" title=\"\">indicative votes</a>, ridiculed as they were, offered a route out of the morass. If May loses today, parliament will resume its \u201ccontrol\u201d of business on Monday. It will re-run its indicative votes, but in a different form, presumably with fewer of them and with preference transfers. The winner is likely to be the customs union put forward variously by Ken Clarke, Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Boles, albeit on Wednesday in absurdly different versions. Why these sponsors failed to join forces is a mystery. They all know that staying in a customs union with our closest and biggest trading partner makes more sense than the fanciful gains from leaving it. They also know that, under the surface tribalism of the Commons chamber, most MPs would agree with this. They could have stymied May in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Now MPs must do two things. They must not vote to support May, but ensure that her deal is buried once and for all at the Westminster crossroads, garlic in mouth, stake through heart. Already the dark riders of the Tory backwoodsmen have done their treacherous deed. So apparently has the DUP. Then finally Clarke/Corbyn/Boles must conquer the sunny uplands of indicativity, with a clear Commons mandate for a customs union. That could then be rushed to Brussels by the deputy prime minister, David Lidington, or any other proxy for a reluctant May. We know it would be well received.</p> <p>Alongside a customs union, the other most favoured option on Wednesday was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-barry-gardiner-brexit-is-not-remain-party-and-support-for-public-vote-motion-difficult\" title=\"\">Margaret Beckett\u2019s</a>, for a second referendum \u2013 not to rerun the first but to confirm whatever deal is reached with Brussels. The choice would be either to approve parliament\u2019s departure plan or to stay in. After the blood and thunder of the past two years, such a confirming referendum would be cleansing, reasonable and calming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/28/tory-party-brexit-political-system-second-referendum\">We\u2019re led by a party not fit for power in a system not fit for purpose | Gary Younge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These two ways forward are quite separate. The one is a Brexit mandate, the other a Brexit process. They are simply the sensible compromise to the national debate of the past two years. May\u2019s deal has poisoned politics for long enough. Parliament has hinted at a willingness to \u201ctake back control\u201d. Now it must do so.</p> <p>I sense that history may be kinder to the past two years in British politics than appears likely today. London\u2019s political establishment has polarisation, rage and hysteria built into its psyche. Each night, commentators have presented Brexit as apocalypse for beginners. Such crudity is useful in holding power to account. But in time of crisis, when a clear head and a readiness to compromise are needed, it exaggerates rather than eases division. It is no help at all.</p> <p>Detaching Britain from the EU was never going to be easy. To have spent two years rehearsing and refining the arguments was perhaps inevitable \u2013 yet never critical until the last round. Where past such national crises, as in the 1970s, have been bedevilled by Labour\u2019s ideological splits, this time the demons have been Tory. A party divided over Europe since the demise of Edward Heath has still not found peace on the issue. The legacy of national isolationism runs deep in its veins and regularly breaks the surface. Such isolationism is not without popular support, in all countries these days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/27/peoples-vote-is-still-alive-after-a-day-of-brexit-drama-falls-flat\">People\u2019s vote is still alive after a day of Brexit drama falls flat | Sonia Sodha</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A greater tragedy for May was that the 2017 election should have forced her back on to the Conservative party\u2019s grimmest legacy, its historic bond with Irish unionism \u2013 and unionism\u2019s rumbling appendix, the partition of Ireland. The most astonishing sight this week was of Tory no-dealers imitating their hero Enoch Powell, and worshipping at the shrine of Churchill\u2019s \u201cdreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d. Northern Ireland has lurked too long beneath the waterline of British politics. Everyone knows that Northern Ireland needs an EU customs union more than anywhere else in the UK. No politicians, certainly not those of the DUP, seem to care.</p> <p>This week\u2019s chaos has ostensibly shamed Britain\u2019s parliament in the eyes of the world. But as in previous upheavals \u2013 from the \u201crevolution\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/30/english-dates-1688-glorious-revolution\" title=\"\">1688</a> to the reform crises of 1832 and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Parliament-Act-of-1911\" title=\"\">1911</a> \u2013 the Commons has still contrived to contain and embrace the chaos. It is no bad thing for politicians to be forced back on their consciences occasionally \u2013 or to argue openly with their constituents.</p> <p>Britons today must be vastly better informed on the EU than any other Europeans. Daily they have been infuriated, divided, exasperated, desperate, as they watch their parliament tear itself apart. But that is how parliaments should sometimes be. It is politics live. I refuse to believe it is a bad thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But her deal would still involve arguing over \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d for two more ghastly years \u2013 and then a possible repeat of this week\u2019s chaos. On the other hand, Wednesday\u2019s indicative votes, ridiculed as they were, offered a route out of the morass. If May loses today, parliament will resume its \u201ccontrol\u201d of business on Monday. It will re-run its indicative votes, but in a different form, presumably with fewer of them and with preference transfers. The winner is likely to be the customs union put forward variously by Ken Clarke, Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Boles, albeit on Wednesday in absurdly different versions. Why these sponsors failed to join forces is a mystery. They all know that staying in a customs union with our closest and biggest trading partner makes more sense than the fanciful gains from leaving it. They also know that, under the surface tribalism of the Commons chamber, most MPs would agree with this. They could have stymied May in one fell swoop. Now MPs must do two things. They must not vote to support May, but ensure that her deal is buried once and for all at the Westminster crossroads, garlic in mouth, stake through heart. Already the dark riders of the Tory backwoodsmen have done their treacherous deed. So apparently has the DUP. Then finally Clarke/Corbyn/Boles must conquer the sunny uplands of indicativity, with a clear Commons mandate for a customs union. That could then be rushed to Brussels by the deputy prime minister, David Lidington, or any other proxy for a reluctant May. We know it would be well received. Alongside a customs union, the other most favoured option on Wednesday was Margaret Beckett\u2019s, for a second referendum \u2013 not to rerun the first but to confirm whatever deal is reached with Brussels. The choice would be either to approve parliament\u2019s departure plan or to stay in. After the blood and thunder of the past two years, such a confirming referendum would be cleansing, reasonable and calming. These two ways forward are quite separate. The one is a Brexit mandate, the other a Brexit process. They are simply the sensible compromise to the national debate of the past two years. May\u2019s deal has poisoned politics for long enough. Parliament has hinted at a willingness to \u201ctake back control\u201d. Now it must do so. I sense that history may be kinder to the past two years in British politics than appears likely today. London\u2019s political establishment has polarisation, rage and hysteria built into its psyche. Each night, commentators have presented Brexit as apocalypse for beginners. Such crudity is useful in holding power to account. But in time of crisis, when a clear head and a readiness to compromise are needed, it exaggerates rather than eases division. It is no help at all. Detaching Britain from the EU was never going to be easy. To have spent two years rehearsing and refining the arguments was perhaps inevitable \u2013 yet never critical until the last round. Where past such national crises, as in the 1970s, have been bedevilled by Labour\u2019s ideological splits, this time the demons have been Tory. A party divided over Europe since the demise of Edward Heath has still not found peace on the issue. The legacy of national isolationism runs deep in its veins and regularly breaks the surface. Such isolationism is not without popular support, in all countries these days. A greater tragedy for May was that the 2017 election should have forced her back on to the Conservative party\u2019s grimmest legacy, its historic bond with Irish unionism \u2013 and unionism\u2019s rumbling appendix, the partition of Ireland. The most astonishing sight this week was of Tory no-dealers imitating their hero Enoch Powell, and worshipping at the shrine of Churchill\u2019s \u201cdreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d. Northern Ireland has lurked too long beneath the waterline of British politics. Everyone knows that Northern Ireland needs an EU customs union more than anywhere else in the UK. No politicians, certainly not those of the DUP, seem to care. This week\u2019s chaos has ostensibly shamed Britain\u2019s parliament in the eyes of the world. But as in previous upheavals \u2013 from the \u201crevolution\u201d of 1688 to the reform crises of 1832 and 1911 \u2013 the Commons has still contrived to contain and embrace the chaos. It is no bad thing for politicians to be forced back on their consciences occasionally \u2013 or to argue openly with their constituents. Britons today must be vastly better informed on the EU than any other Europeans. Daily they have been infuriated, divided, exasperated, desperate, as they watch their parliament tear itself apart. But that is how parliaments should sometimes be. It is politics live. I refuse to believe it is a bad thing. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",
