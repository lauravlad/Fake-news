Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Charles Michel, the president of the European council, welcomed the vote, tweeting that it was an \u201cimportant step in the article 50 ratification process\u201d.

      "body": "<p>\u201cBack of the net,\u201d shouted an unidentified Tory MP as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/20/brexit-pm-asks-britons-to-move-on-as-mps-debate-withdrawal-bill\">majority of 124 for the second reading of the Brexit withdrawal agreement</a> was declared. That got a few cheers, but not many. After all, it had been the most open of open goals. It had all been too easy. A bit like watching Liverpool take on a team of under-11s. And even then, some of the under-11s had started playing for the other side, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/20/six-labour-mps-defy-party-whips-vote-boris-johnson-brexit-bill\">30 Labour MPs either voted with the government or abstained</a>. If anything, there was a slight feeling of anticlimax in the chamber as MPs departed for their Christmas break. Not to mention a sense of deja vu.</p> <p>Boris Johnson had opened the debate by saying that now was the time to end the dither and delay. Rather forgetting, yet again, that few politicians had done more to prevent Brexit happening over the past three and a half years than him. He had twice voted against Theresa May\u2019s own Brexit deal, which had been \u2013 on his own previous admissions \u2013 substantially better than his own, in order to further his own career.</p> <p>But that was part of a prehistory now consigned to oblivion. 12 December had marked a new Year Zero in British politics. One in which the world must be rewritten in the image of its new Supreme Leader. The Once and Future World King. Anyone who dared to mention either that Johnson had described his Brexit deal as one to which no UK prime minister could possibly agree, or that it had actually already passed its second reading once before, was at risk of being disappeared. The truth was sinking fast and before long there would not even be a ripple on the surface to show it had even existed.</p> <p>\u201cIt is time to come together and get Brexit done,\u201d he said. It was time for the nation to be reinvigorated and to forget the old divisions of leave and remain. The downside to all this was that they were to be replaced with the new divisions of losers and winners. And it was about time the losers just sucked it up. Boris may talk the talk on healing, but every smirk, every casual aside, betrays his baser, primal instincts. His first reaction is always to gloat. He is a man entirely without humility. Anyone who challenges his sense of entitlement is to be crushed.</p> <p>Yes, there were one or two changes to his previous withdrawal agreement bill that definitely hadn\u2019t been passed in October, he conceded. The bit about safe passage for children of refugees had needed to be canned. Not because he had anything against children, mind. Rather because it was always useful to keep them as bargaining chips. It\u2019s what the kiddies would have wanted.</p> <p>Same with workers\u2019, food and environmental rights. Far too important to be left aligned with the EU when there was a chance of watering them down for a US trade deal.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBack of the net,\u201d shouted an unidentified Tory MP as the majority of 124 for the second reading of the Brexit withdrawal agreement was declared. That got a few cheers, but not many. After all, it had been the most open of open goals. It had all been too easy. A bit like watching Liverpool take on a team of under-11s. And even then, some of the under-11s had started playing for the other side, as 30 Labour MPs either voted with the government or abstained. If anything, there was a slight feeling of anticlimax in the chamber as MPs departed for their Christmas break. Not to mention a sense of deja vu. Boris Johnson had opened the debate by saying that now was the time to end the dither and delay. Rather forgetting, yet again, that few politicians had done more to prevent Brexit happening over the past three and a half years than him. He had twice voted against Theresa May\u2019s own Brexit deal, which had been \u2013 on his own previous admissions \u2013 substantially better than his own, in order to further his own career. But that was part of a prehistory now consigned to oblivion. 12 December had marked a new Year Zero in British politics. One in which the world must be rewritten in the image of its new Supreme Leader. The Once and Future World King. Anyone who dared to mention either that Johnson had described his Brexit deal as one to which no UK prime minister could possibly agree, or that it had actually already passed its second reading once before, was at risk of being disappeared. The truth was sinking fast and before long there would not even be a ripple on the surface to show it had even existed. \u201cIt is time to come together and get Brexit done,\u201d he said. It was time for the nation to be reinvigorated and to forget the old divisions of leave and remain. The downside to all this was that they were to be replaced with the new divisions of losers and winners. And it was about time the losers just sucked it up. Boris may talk the talk on healing, but every smirk, every casual aside, betrays his baser, primal instincts. His first reaction is always to gloat. He is a man entirely without humility. Anyone who challenges his sense of entitlement is to be crushed. Yes, there were one or two changes to his previous withdrawal agreement bill that definitely hadn\u2019t been passed in October, he conceded. The bit about safe passage for children of refugees had needed to be canned. Not because he had anything against children, mind. Rather because it was always useful to keep them as bargaining chips. It\u2019s what the kiddies would have wanted. Same with workers\u2019, food and environmental rights. Far too important to be left aligned with the EU when there was a chance of watering them down for a US trade deal. And as for the guaranteed end to transition that made a no-deal Brexit a real possibility at the end of next year, everyone deserved the chance to be poorer. We were in a new space-time continuum. Up was down and down was up. And there wasn\u2019t a damn thing anyone in the Commons could say to change that. Not that many were minded to do so. They were too busy drinking the Kool Aid.

Support dropped to 22% following the national executive committee\u2019s vote not to back a second referendum and after the prolonged Labour-Tory Brexit talks ended. Six days later Labour won only 13.6% of the vote share in the EU elections. The Brexit party got most votes nationally, including in Labour-held and remain-voting seats such as Exeter.</p> <p>Support hovered at 22%-25% until conference backed a second referendum in September. Thereafter it steadily rose, peaking at 32% in the election.</p> <p>Leave voters were attracted to the simplicity of the Tory message on Brexit. There was no way for Labour to counter that, given their catastrophic error of agreeing to an election on the Tories\u2019 terms before Brexit was \u201cdone\u201d or \u201csorted\u201d.</p> <p>What the second referendum commitment did help them do was to win back some remain voters and gain tactical votes. This was enough to win Canterbury, among other seats. If the pivot had come earlier and more clearly they would have kept Kensington (lost by 150 votes) and seats in the north such as Bury North, where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000611\" title=\"\">remain parties more than doubled their vote compared with 2017 to over 20,000</a>. The Tories won by 105 votes. <br><strong>Magi Young</strong><br><em>Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 And so the period of so-called reflection goes on with Owen Jones\u2019s article.

      "bodyText": "Owen Jones (Brexit and self-inflicted errors buried Labour in this election, Journal, 19 December) ignores some inconvenient facts when he claims that backing a second referendum was fatal to Labour\u2019s election chances. In April 2019 Labour was polling at about 33%. Support dropped to 22% following the national executive committee\u2019s vote not to back a second referendum and after the prolonged Labour-Tory Brexit talks ended. Six days later Labour won only 13.6% of the vote share in the EU elections. The Brexit party got most votes nationally, including in Labour-held and remain-voting seats such as Exeter. Support hovered at 22%-25% until conference backed a second referendum in September. Thereafter it steadily rose, peaking at 32% in the election. Leave voters were attracted to the simplicity of the Tory message on Brexit. There was no way for Labour to counter that, given their catastrophic error of agreeing to an election on the Tories\u2019 terms before Brexit was \u201cdone\u201d or \u201csorted\u201d. What the second referendum commitment did help them do was to win back some remain voters and gain tactical votes. This was enough to win Canterbury, among other seats. If the pivot had come earlier and more clearly they would have kept Kensington (lost by 150 votes) and seats in the north such as Bury North, where remain parties more than doubled their vote compared with 2017 to over 20,000. The Tories won by 105 votes. Magi Young Exeter \u2022 And so the period of so-called reflection goes on with Owen Jones\u2019s article. The policies were seemingly fine, Brexit was an insoluble issue, the media was unfair and the leadership made some severe mistakes. No, this electoral rout was down to Jeremy Corbyn and the people around him in the leader\u2019s office and was four years in the making \u2013 a complete failure in political leadership led to the final reckoning last week on all counts. Trust in the leader is the prerequisite for getting a hearing on any policies \u2013 that is the top and bottom of the whole period of reflection. If the next leader appears to voters as a potentially competent head of government then Labour will be on the long road back to credibility as an effective opposition.

We need to build consensus and stop the combative nature of this debate.\u201d</p> <p>Those who did not vote in either lobby included Labour frontbenchers Ian Lavery, Andrew Gwynne, John Healey and Jon Trickett.</p> <p>Healey and Trickett were among those who expressed scepticism at this week\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting about whether Labour should continue to oppose Johnson\u2019s bill, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>In a statement on his website published shortly after the vote, Healey said: \u201cIn a Brexit referendum and a Brexit election the public have now been clear, and so should Labour: our fight must be about the type of Brexit and the huge difference between Labour and Conservative visions of our economy. Any question about whether Brexit goes ahead has been closed.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson won a thumping Commons majority at last week\u2019s general election by promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and his manifesto included the promise of taking the next step towards leaving the EU before parliament\u2019s Christmas break.</p> <p>Lewell-Buck was joined in the aye lobby by Labour colleagues Jon Cruddas, Grahame Morris, Toby Perkins, Sarah Champion and Rosie Cooper.</p> <p>Labour has wrestled ever since the Brexit referendum with how to show that it respected the result, while satisfying its half-million members, the overwhelming majority of whom are pro-remain.</p> <p>Starmer, who helped to push his party towards adopting a policy of holding a second referendum, told MPs that, as a result of the general election result, \u201cwe will have left the EU within the next six months. Whatever side we were on, or no side at all, the leave/remain argument goes with it\u201d.</p> <p>MPs were voting on the second reading of the bill \u2013 in effect, signalling that they are willing in principle for it to proceed.

      "bodyText": "Six Labour MPs defied party whips to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s EU withdrawal agreement bill on Friday, and more than 30 stayed away. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, winding up the debate on the second reading of the bill, said last week\u2019s decisive election result \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the deal negotiated by the prime minister is a good deal: it isn\u2019t\u201d. But Emma Lewell-Buck, the Labour MP for South Shields, said she would support the bill \u201cwith the heaviest of hearts\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to oppose for opposition\u2019s sake. We need to build consensus and stop the combative nature of this debate.\u201d Those who did not vote in either lobby included Labour frontbenchers Ian Lavery, Andrew Gwynne, John Healey and Jon Trickett. Healey and Trickett were among those who expressed scepticism at this week\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting about whether Labour should continue to oppose Johnson\u2019s bill, the Guardian understands. In a statement on his website published shortly after the vote, Healey said: \u201cIn a Brexit referendum and a Brexit election the public have now been clear, and so should Labour: our fight must be about the type of Brexit and the huge difference between Labour and Conservative visions of our economy. Any question about whether Brexit goes ahead has been closed.\u201d Johnson won a thumping Commons majority at last week\u2019s general election by promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and his manifesto included the promise of taking the next step towards leaving the EU before parliament\u2019s Christmas break. Lewell-Buck was joined in the aye lobby by Labour colleagues Jon Cruddas, Grahame Morris, Toby Perkins, Sarah Champion and Rosie Cooper. Labour has wrestled ever since the Brexit referendum with how to show that it respected the result, while satisfying its half-million members, the overwhelming majority of whom are pro-remain. Starmer, who helped to push his party towards adopting a policy of holding a second referendum, told MPs that, as a result of the general election result, \u201cwe will have left the EU within the next six months. Whatever side we were on, or no side at all, the leave/remain argument goes with it\u201d. MPs were voting on the second reading of the bill \u2013 in effect, signalling that they are willing in principle for it to proceed. It passed by a majority of 124. Several prominent Labour frontbenchers who had previously warned about the risks of the party being seen to block Brexit obeyed the whip on Friday and voted against Johnson\u2019s deal. These included the potential leadership candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey, and deputy leadership contenders Richard Burgon and Angela Rayner. In total, 162 Labour MPs voted to oppose the bill: 32 short of Labour\u2019s complement in the new parliament of 202 MPs, once the six who voted for the bill and the two tellers who count the votes are taken into account. Labour whips estimated that approximately 20 of the MPs who failed to vote against had deliberately decided to defy the leadership and abstain \u2013 with others either paired with Conservatives, or were given permission to be absent. No disciplinary action is expected to be taken immediately against frontbenchers who disobeyed the whip \u2013 and parliament is now in recess until 7 January, when MPs will continue their scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement bill.",

Michael, Sheffield</em></p> <p>The need for voter ID could be very significant in my opinion. It was pleasing to see in the Queen\u2019s speech that the government suggested that those who did not have ID could apply for a free local electoral identity document. However impersonation at an election is extremely low, which makes this new rule seem heavy handed. The concern is that those on lower incomes who do not have the right documents will be put off voting.</p> <p><em>Q: Hi Kate, There is going to be an inevitable push and pull between left and centre-left in the Labour party for the forthcoming leadership election. What do you think the new leader needs to do to reconnect with lost votes, bearing in mind the policies under Corbyn seemed pretty popular? Nat, 26, local government officer, London</em></p> <p>It\u2019s true that the policies were popular but that many did not find Corbyn credible as a leader in order to deliver them. A leftwing manifesto may work again but scaled down as voters felt overwhelmed by the significant offer of policies. I think a new leader needs to work extremely hard in building a profile in the north of England and the Midlands. I felt some of the rallies in the election campaign were in the wrong places and there was no visibility of Labour in town centres, high streets and on market days. <br></p> <p>Even if it does not feel easy, leaders really need to do on the ground walkabouts and take the criticism head on. I think it may be sensible to try to bring a shadow cabinet together that has people with slightly different views from the leader on domestic policy. However, they should not have a shadow cabinet that is push and pull on Brexit. That will be too hard to navigate and it\u2019s been proven that it makes the public think there is not a cohesive top level of leadership. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T13:59:57.974Z\">at 1.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfcc4638f08c3972263e029\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:56:30.218Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You have been sending in your questions about the general election results, which I will be answering until 1.30pm.

Jon, 40, administrator, Sheffield</em></p> <p>Yes, he can abolish it and plans to do so in the first few months of 2020. It is something of a priority for the government. The previous arrangements of an election being held every five years will come back into force. Even if the FTPA existed, Johnson\u2019s majority means it would be very unlikely that MPs would try to call for an early election anyway.</p> <p><em>Q: What\u2019s happened to the report on Russian interference in the Brexit referendum? Fred, London</em></p> <p>We are still awaiting its publication, although Boris Johnson \u2013 after securing his majority \u2013 decided that the government was now in a position to release it. Expect pressure to mount for its publication in the early new year but it could still take months. The fact it was not printed pre-election was highly controversial and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who was the intelligence and security committee chair, said the reasons given were \u201cbogus\u201d. The report was compiled by the committee but a new chair and members will need to be elected, which could hold things up. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T14:02:03.590Z\">at 2.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfcbefd8f087e8308e61b4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:41:20.171Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of your questions so far have been about the opposition and a second referendum on Scottish independence:<br></p> <p><em>Q: This is the first big majority in parliament in over a decade. How will the opposition now operate in parliament since they are unlikley to be able to defeat the government on any legislation? Craig, 36, works in the public sector, Stirling</em></p> <p>The majority Conservative government is new ground for many opposition MPs and for those who took their seats in 2017. They have never operated in a majority scenario before. You might expect tighter whipping as the last thing Labour needs is to look divided in the face of huge majority votes that pass with ease. When there\u2019s only 202 Labour MPs, every vote counts. <br></p> <p>You might also see informal discussions with the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green on votes and working as a bloc. While they will not be able to overcome the Tory majority of 80, unity between those parties is in the very least a visual message to the public that the government is scrutinised and opposed. There will also be a scramble for opposition MPs to get the chair position on select committees, which is a powerful way of holding the government to account.</p> <p><em>Q: The SNP received a larger share of the vote in Scotland (45%) to the Conservatives in the UK (44%). Do you think that Boris\u2019 position to \u201cnot permit\u201d a second referendum on Scottish independence is democratically sustainable? James Munro, 53, architect, Glasgow</em></p> <p>Boris Johnson was extremely firm on this in the Queen\u2019s speech when the SNP brought up independence. He is 100 per cent against it and the power to grant another independence vote is in his hands. I think he will stick to this and will not bend to pressure. That does not of course stop the debate raging within the Commons throughout his entire premiership. I do think the first 12 months will be the time for Sturgeon to capitalise on her share of the vote in Scotland and I think we can expect her coming down to Westminster to hold press conferences and meetings with her MPs with more frequency.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:45:39.609Z\">at 12.45pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfcbf928f085eda5c10b49e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T12:36:20.672Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The SDLP\u2019s <strong>Claire Hanna</strong> used her maiden Commons speech to warn that Brexit \u201creopens old wounds\u201d in Northern Ireland.

Here it is with a few gaps for interjections:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I beg to move that the bill be read a second time and that we come together as a new Parliament, to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done.</p> <p> Now is the moment \u2013 as we leave the European Union \u2013 to reunite our country and allow the warmth and natural affection that we all share with our European neighbours \u2013 to find renewed expression in one great new national project of building a deep, special and democratically accountable partnership with those nations we are proud to call our closest friends.</p> <p> Because this bill, and this juncture in our national story, Mr Speaker must not be seen as a victory for one party or one faction over another.</p> <p> This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain in fact the very words seem tired to me as defunct as big enders and little enders or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play now is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny,and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us.</p> <p> And the whole purpose of our withdrawal agreement is to set this in motion and avoid any further delay. And in the hope that the honourable gentleman does not wish to have any further delay I will give way to him.</p> <p>... I think most people looking at the negotiation would agree that it strengthens our negotiating position. If we have learned anything from the experience of the last three years it is that drift and dither means more acrimony, and anguish Mr Speaker and there would be nothing more dangerous for the new future that we want to build than allowing the permanent possibility of extending \u2013 I think I\u2019m coming to the point that the right honourable members wish to discuss- the implementation period in a torture that came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown\u2019s football or Prometheus chained to the tartarean crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back as all right honourable members in the House will recall \u2013 and then growing back only to be pecked out again in the cycle repeated forever</p> <p> This bill learns the emphatic lesson of the last parliament unlike members opposite and rejects any further delay. It ensures that we depart from the EU on 31 January \u2013 and at that point Brexit will be done.</p> <p> It will be over. The sorry story of the last three-and-a-half years will be at an end and we will be able to move forward Mr Speaker together</p> <p> The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on 31December next year \u2013 with no possibility of an extension. </p> <p> And it paves the way for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours, based on an ambitious free trade agreement, with no alignment on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws, and close and friendly relations.</p> <p> Mr Speaker, this vision of the United Kingdom\u2019s independence, a vision that inspires so many is now \u2013 if this new parliament allows \u2013 only hours from our grasp the oven is on so to speak. It is set at gas mark 4 we can have it done by lunch time or late lunch</p> <p> And the new deal that I negotiated with our European friends will restore our great institutions to their rightful place as the supreme instruments of British self-governance.</p> <p> Once again this house will be the only assembly able to legislate for this United Kingdom. British courts will be the sole arbiters of those laws.</p> <p> And above them all, the sovereign British people masters of their own fate, controlling their own borders, laws, money and trade.</p> <p> And throughout our new immigration system, we will not only welcome those with talent but go out of our way to attract people of ability regardless of nationality or background.</p> <p> And we are only able to do this because the freedoms offered by our European Union partners \u2013 by leaving the EU \u2013 allow us once again to control overall numbers and bear down on unskilled immigration with our new points-based system.</p> <p> And if the honourable lady if she is against our new control of immigration I would like to hear her explain why</p> <p>.... We remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children and will continue to support fully the purpose and spirit of Dubs amendment but this is not the place in this bill to do so. The government remains absolutely committed to doing so. And amongst many other advantages of this bill Mr Speaker is of course that we will be able to sign free trade deals with the booming markets of the world, a power that no British government has enjoyed for the last 46 years.</p> <p>We will cast off the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say\">common agricultural policy</a> that has too often frustrated and burdened our farmers we will release our fishermen from the tangled driftnets of arcane quota systems ...</p> <p> I remind the House and I remind the members opposite that there is of course on party in this House that is committed to reversing will of the people and handing back control of Scotland\u2019s outstanding marine wealth to Brussels \u2013 the SNP. That\u2019s what they would do.</p> <p>I look forward to hearing them explain why they continue to support this abject policy and abject surrender. This house will also under this bill regain the authority to set the highest possible standards and we will take advantage of these new freedoms to legislate in parallel on the environment, on workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights.</p> <p> And I reject the inexplicable fear \u2013 and I will give way for the last time \u2013 the right honourable lady may wish to talk about this ... </p> <p>The very essence of the opportunity of Brexit is we will no longer outsource these decisions.</p> <p> With renewed national self-confidence we will take them ourselves and answer to those who sent us here.</p> <p> It was this parliament \u2013 this parliament \u2013 in this country that led the whole of Europe and the world in passing the Factory Acts \u2013 the clean air Acts of the nineteenth century \u2013 which improved industrial working conditions by law. And this house should never doubt its ability to pioneer the standards of the fourth industrial revolution just as we did the first.</p> <p> And that epoch-making transformation \u2013 as with all the pivotal achievements of British history \u2013 reflected the combined national genius of every corner of this United Kingdom.</p> <p> In this new era our success, once again, will be achieved as one nation.</p> <p> This new deal in this bill ensures that the United Kingdom will leave the EU whole and entire with an unwavering dedication to Northern Ireland\u2019s place in our union ... Let me just remind the House Mr Speaker that the special provisions applying to Northern Ireland \u2013 which ensure after all one very important thing \u2013 that there is no hard border across Ireland and Northern Ireland are subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland assembly.</p> <p> And unless the assembly specifically withholds its consent unless indeed the assembly insists on continuing with this approach then those arrangements automatically lapse into full alignment with the rest of the UK.</p> <p> I believe these arrangements serve the interests of Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole.

They were fighting the election in the last ten days over Brexit\u201d. </p> <p>Asked whether continued Tory refusal would, as Sturgeon has suggested, increase support for independence, Jack warned that the first minister\u2019s call to devolve the power to hold referendums permanently to Holyrood would result in \u201cperpetual neverendums\u201d. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfca8c48f085eda5c10b35b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T10:58:24.316Z\">10.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tory backbencher <strong>Suella Braverman </strong>claims trust in politicians was stretched to breaking point in the last parliament. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfca7228f08c3972263de68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T10:55:16.621Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeffrey Donaldson</strong>, the leader of DUP in the Commons, says that European Union will continue to have a say in Northern Ireland affairs under the bill. </p> <p>I want the prime minister to treat my part of the United Kingdom the same as the rest of the country when it comes to leaving the European Union, Donaldson says. </p> <p>We don\u2019t want barriers to trade with the rest of the country, he said.

They have done their utmost to hide its likely impact and continue to use gimmicks and slogans to turn attention away from their real intentions.</p> <p>And nothing exposes this more than the steps they have already taken on workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>For all the promises over the past few weeks that they are the party to protect rights at work, at the very first opportunity they have removed the basic provisions they had said would be part of this bill.</p> <p>That does not bode well for the separate bill the prime minister is now saying he will bring forward on workers\u2019 rights</p> <p>If he wants to assure people that their rights are safe in his hands he should commit to legislate to ensure workers rights in Britain will never fall behind EU standards in the future and support amendments to enshrine this commitment within this bill.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, I want to make it absolutely clear how appalled I am to see the government remove the protections in this Bill for unaccompanied children seeking asylum.</p> <p>Throughout the last Parliament and for his whole life my good friend Lord Dubs has worked tirelessly to ensure children affected by the worst aspects of global injustice are given sanctuary in this country.</p> <p>Now this government, in its first week in office has ripped up those hard won commitments.</p> <p>This is a move the director of the charity Safe Passage has described as, and I quote: \u201ctruly shocking\u201d Saying it could have and I quote again: \u201cpotentially tragic consequences\u201d. </p> <p>Shame on this government for abandoning children in this way.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, on the environment and food safety standards this deal points to a complete realignment towards the far weaker protections and standards that operate in Donald Trump\u2019s America.</p> <p>If this government is set on pursuing a Trump trade deal with precious few bargaining chips to hand the brutal reality is that Britain will have to lower its standards.</p> <p>The EU has made it clear that a future trade deal with them will depend on maintaining a level playing field in standards and protections.</p> <p>So the choice we now face is between keeping the highest environmental and food standards in order to get that future deal with the EU or slashing food standards to match the US, where what are called \u201cacceptable levels\u201d of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed, just so we can strike a new race-to-the-bottom deal with Donald Trump.</p> <p>Turning to the arrangements with Northern Ireland the Prime Minister has emphatically claimed, and I quote:\u201cthere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB\u201d</p> <p> And that: \u201cwe have a deal that keeps the whole of the UK together as we come of the EU\u201d</p> <p> These claims are simply not true.</p> <p>We know from the analysis carried out by his own Treasury that under his deal there will, in fact, be an abundance of checks and customs declarations in the Irish Sea.</p> <p>Not only will this have a huge impact on Northern Irish business and society, it will also have implications for the rest of Britain\u2019s economy and manufacturing industry.</p> <p>The Treasury\u2019s own analysis spells it out: the more the government diverges from EU trading regulations in the future the more checks and disruption will be put in place between Britain and our biggest trading partner.</p> <p>More checks and more disruption would be deeply damaging for trade and for our manufacturing sector and threatens to take a wrecking ball to our vital supply chains and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on them.</p> <p>From car manufacturers to the chemical industry disruption to our just-in-time supply chains will have a devastating impact.</p> <p>This all makes it even more incredible that since agreeing its deal the government has yet to produce a single bit of evidence or analysis to show it will have a positive impact on the economy or our communities in any way. We scarcely need to ask ourselves, why?</p> <p> I say to all members new and old that it is our job to question to scrutinise and to hold the government of the day to account.</p> <p>If we believe the government is taking the wrong approach we should not be afraid to oppose.</p> <p>And when it comes to our future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world we cannot let this government act in an undemocratic and secretive manner.</p> <p>Trade deals with the EU, the US, or anybody else for that matter must be done transparently. This country is about to embark on a major change of direction as we leave a 40-year economic partnership for an unknown future, under the terms of this withdrawal deal.</p> <p> The government needs to be honest with the people about the real choices and the real risks that lie ahead.</p> <p>So stop the posturing and the gimmicks and ditch the unachievable red lines that will only lead to another no-deal cliff edge, with all the anxiety and uncertainty that brings.</p> <p>The prime minister may believe that fuelling division and confrontation has helped him realise his personal political ambition.</p> <p>But it\u2019s no way to heal the deep divisions in our society or find the common ground we need to move beyond Brexit.</p> <p>We need an approach that puts jobs and living standards first and builds the strongest cooperation with our European neighbours based on openness, solidarity and internationalism.</p> <p>That is the approach that will bring an end to the Brexit crisis and bring our country together.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T11:03:41.831Z\">at 11.03am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfca1728f085eda5c10b315\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-20T10:25:04.170Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sajid Javid is still on message:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/1207969881402073088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Big day.

To do that, we must open up power like never before. An inequality of power underpins the inequalities of wealth and opportunity that scar our country. The trade unions were founded to give power and a voice to working class people. They founded the Labour Party, and by winning power we built the NHS, free state education and the welfare state.</p> <p>The rich and privileged have always had the power they need to shape their lives and to shape world in their own interests. Labour\u2019s historic task is to open up power to everyone else so we can build the fairer world we believe in. We call it socialism because we believe in the transformative power of society and communities. That historic mission remains our mission today.</p> <p>But we can\u2019t do it on our own. The point about a movement is it brings everyone together in a common cause. Labour must learn from the social movements that people create to fight injustice: renters\u2019 unions, delivery drivers\u2019 unions, movements to prevent social cleansing of estates. We need to embed this party deep into the everyday lives of people in areas that feel hopeless and abandoned.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer calls for Labour to broaden its appeal and widen its ideological stance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Labour tradition has never drawn from a single ideology: at its best, it is an alliance of different traditions. The challenge of leadership is to draw out the best from them, and get them working towards the single goal of an electoral majority.</p> <p>We have so much more in common than that which divides us, and each of us has something to teach and something to learn.

      "bodyText": "Parliament has passed a historic milestone towards leaving the European Union, backing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill by a thumping majority of 124, a week after the Conservatives won a landslide victory in the general election. After comfortably passing its second reading by 358 votes to 234, the withdrawal agreement bill is on track to complete its passage through both houses of parliament in time to allow Britain to leave the European Union at the end of January. Speaking ahead of the vote, Boris Johnson called on the British public to discard the labels of leave and remain as MPs prepared to take a historic step towards withdrawing the UK from the EU. Labour opposed the bill, but six of the party\u2019s MPs voted with the government and a further 32 abstained, including three shadow cabinet members. Ahead of the vote, Corbyn said: \u201cThis deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path towards more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines. We remain certain there is a better and fairer way for Britain to leave the EU.\u201d A former Tory MP breached the ministerial code by using force against a climate change protester at a black-tie City dinner, a government investigation has found. Mark Field, who stood down from parliament after being suspended as a Foreign Office minister, grabbed a Greenpeace activist, Janet Barker, by the neck and forced her out of the event. Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK financial watchdog, has been named as the next governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced the replacement for Mark Carney, who is due to stand down from the role at the end of January after six-and-a-half years in the job. The new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has revealed he was diagnosed with diabetes days before the general election, and vowed it will not prevent him from carrying out the prestigious role. Hoyle, 62, said he had lost three stone in recent months and said he was still in shock over the diagnosis. Here\u2019s a nice interactive showing how each MP voted in the withdrawal agreement bill vote this afternoon. In more news regarding alleged ministerial code breaches ... Former Tory MP Mark Field is found to have breached the code by using force against a climate change protester at a black-tie City dinner. Field, who stood down from parliament after being suspended as a Foreign Office minister, grabbed a Greenpeace activist, Janet Barker, by the neck and forced her out of the event. The Cabinet Office investigation found that he had to make a \u201csplit-second decision\u201d and \u201chad the option of simply blocking her way\u201d during the incident in London\u2019s Mansion House in June. You can read more here \u2013 A Cabinet Office investigation into Tory MP Alun Cairns, who quit the Cabinet during the election campaign, has not upheld allegations of a breach of the ministerial code, the PA news agency reports. The former Welsh secretary announced he was standing down from the Cabinet last month over his links to a Conservative candidate accused of sabotaging a rape trial. The report, published today, found it \u201cunlikely\u201d that the MP was not told anything about his former staff member\u2019s role, but concluded that the evidence did not support the allegations of a breach. You can read the full story here \u2013 And here\u2019s shadow housing secretary John Healey on why he abstained \u2013 Six Labour members voted for the bill \u2013 Sarah Champion, Rosie Cooper, Jon Cruddas, Emma Lewell-Buck, Grahame Morris, Toby Perkins. Here is Lewell-Buck\u2019s speech, in which she says that it is with a heavy heart that she has decided she couldn\u2019t vote with the Labour party. Some Labour MPs have written on Twitter about why they decided to abstain in this afternoon\u2019s vote. Sharon Hodgson, MP for Washington and Sunderland West, said she had always said she would not vote for a form of Brexit that would harm those she represented, but she recognised that her constituents wanted to see the UK leave the EU. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has responded to the announcement by the Crown Prosecution Service that they will be charging the wife of a US intelligence officer with causing the death by dangerous driving of the 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn. I welcome the taking of a charging decision which is an important step towards justice for Harry and towards solace for his family, but it is not the end. I hope that Anne Sacoolas will now realise the right thing to do is to come back to the UK and cooperate with the criminal justice process. Charles Michel, the president of the European council, welcomed the vote, tweeting that it was an \u201cimportant step in the article 50 ratification process\u201d. He added: \u201cA level playing field remains a must for any future relationship,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s demand for fair competition in exchange for a free-trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas. The European parliament expects to ratify the withdrawal treaty on 29 January, if the next stages at Westminster go to plan, paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. This is from BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. He says as many as 30 Labour MPs abstained or stayed away from the vote on the Brexit bill this afternoon. You can read our story on the passage of the withdrawal agreement bill at second reading here. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart writes: Parliament has passed a historic milestone towards leaving the European Union, backing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill by a thumping majority of 124, a week after the Conservatives won a landslide victory in the general election. After comfortably passing its second reading by 358 votes to 234, the withdrawal agreement bill is on track to complete its passage through both houses of parliament in time to allow Britain to leave the European Union at the end of January. The clear support for the bill marked a decisive break with the parliamentary gridlock that marked the past two years. The programme motion has been passed by 353 votes to 243. The deputy speaker wishes members a very peaceful Christmas and they file out. There is now an adjournment debate on the \u201cprogress of Southend towards city status\u201d and then parliament breaks up til 7 January. The Telegraph\u2019s Asa Bennett has tweeted some pictures of the prime minister signing copies of the withdrawal agreement bill for MPs: This, from the Mirror\u2019s deputy political editor Ben Glaze: MPs are now voting on the programme motion, which sets out the timetable for getting the bill through parliament by 31 January. It\u2019s a good time to share another explainer on what happens after the Brexit bill passes. (Spoiler alert \u2013 Brexit will not be done.) Some reaction from political journalists \u2013 MPs have voted on the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement bill at the second reading. With Boris Johnson\u2019s 80-strong majority, the bill was passed by a comfortable margin, with 358 voting for and 234 against. Here\u2019s an explainer from Guardian Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll on what\u2019s new in this version of the bill: Today\u2019s vote means MPs have approved the general principles of the bill and it will now move to what is known as \u201ccommittee stage\u201d, where a more detailed examination takes place. Here\u2019s a guide as to what happens next from parliament\u2019s website. As we are waiting for the outcome of the vote on the WAB, reports that the prime minister is signing copies of the bill for MPs. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the general election had delivered a clear instruction to parliament to leave the EU and so MPs should respect that decision and back the bill. This bill is not a victory for one side over the other. The time has come to discard the old labels to move from the past divisions and to come together as one United Kingdom. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who is predicted to run for the Labour leadership, warned Conservative MPs to \u201cbe careful\u201d. \u201cDoing things because the government has a majority doesn\u2019t mean those things are right,\u201d he said. He said the move to water down commitments to child refugees was an example of that. \u201cThat is a moral disgrace,\u201d he said. I turn to my own benches. We may have lost the general election, but we have not lost our values and our beliefs and we must fight for them \u2013 day in, day out \u2013 in this parliament and we will. Starmer said the result of the general election means that Brexit will happen. \u201cWe will have left the EU within the next six months,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever side we were on \u2013 or no side at all \u2013 the leave/remain argument goes with it.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that the deal negotiated by the prime minister is a good deal. It isn\u2019t. It was a bad deal in October when it was signed. It was a bad deal when it was first debated in this house in October. It was a bad deal last Thursday and it\u2019s a bad deal today. Starmer says that, in fact, it is a worse deal today because the government has removed the role of parliamentarians to vote on negotiating objectives and has sidelined workers\u2019 rights. He also says that the clause that prevents the government from asking for an extension is \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d. You can read the background on his point here. Lee Rowley, the Conservative MP for North East Derbyshire, said it was just over a year since he announced \u201cwith great regret\u201d he would not be supporting the government on the initial iteration of the withdrawal agreement bill. \u201cI think all of us who served in the previous parliament, particularly on these benches, regret what happened over the past year or so,\u201d he said. \u201cWherever we stood, whatever our views, there was a fog that descended over this place, which meant that people here, otherwise rational, otherwise willing to look at the wider picture, were unable to do so, and it paralysed our politics. And today marks an important stage for many of us that we can start to move on.\u201d Meg Hillier, the Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, thanked Rowley for speaking \u201ccharacteristically thoughtfully and without triumphalism\u201d. But she said there were very valid reasons why the \u201crushed bill and rushed debate on it\u201d would lead to very real problems in the future. Debbie Abrahams, Labour MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said there is \u201cso much\u201d wrong with the withdrawal agreement bill, much more than before. She says that a free trade agreement of the sort sought by the government would have a terrible impact on the economy and on constituencies like hers. I am going to withhold any firm views until I\u2019ve seen the British election survey when it\u2019s published \u2013 the most reliable evidence that you can get on the election \u2013 in the new year, but I can\u2019t ignore what constituents were saying to me. They ignored or didn\u2019t believe the evidence or even worse, they didn\u2019t care and I think there\u2019s a lot we need to take from that about how we conduct ourselves. Politics and politicians really need to take that on board. The emotional response to Brexit \u2013 and that is what it has been \u2013 has been a lesson for all of us. Mike Wood, the Conservative MP for Dudley South, said he spoke to many former Labour voters during the campaign who said they would be voting for him. He said the phrase \u201cget Brexit done\u201d did not come from election posters, but from the doorstep. \u201cIn those areas that for many, many years have been returning Labour members to this house, the overwhelming sense was frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were tired of being ignored by their representatives and Brexit was an obvious example.\u201d They were tired of being patronised by so many people who would claim to represent them, and we\u2019ve even heard some of those sentiments today from the members opposite. The suggestion that, whether it was in the general election or in the referendum campaign, that the voters who firstly voted for Brexit and now for a Conservative government \u2026 that they either didn\u2019t understand the question or they were mislead by the slogans, or perhaps their prejudices meant they couldn\u2019t make a fair decision ... Thanks for all your questions Here are a few more of your questions answered. Q: Where can I go to be part of a \u2018rejoin the EU\u2019 fight back? I am feeling a terrible powerlessness and don\u2019t want it to become hopelessness. Alistair Levie, bed and breakfast owner, Torquay There is the Final Say group if you\u2019re looking to try to push for a confirmatory public vote. Details on this are easy to find online. A rejoiners group set up shortly after the election is being run by the leadership and membership of the Open Britain/People\u2019s Vote campaign group. It does not have a website so it appears hard to know how to get engaged but as ever, Twitter might be able to provide connections to people who feel the same way. Q: If we had proportional representation, with the same voting system, what would be the number of seats allocated to each party? Kay, Felixstowe Some research done by the Conversation website, and not by the Guardian, looked at both the German and Dutch models of PR. They concluded that under both systems the Conservatives would have won the most seats but not an outright majority, coming in at fewer than 300 MPs, and inevitably leading to a hung parliament. The Lib Dems do better and the Scottish National party fared worse in both forms of PR. The Brexit party and the Greens would have done mildly better under a Dutch system but not the German one. Hello, it\u2019s Frances Perraudin here, taking over the live blog from Matthew Weaver. Ruth Cadbury, the Labour MP for Brentford and Isleworth, has been speaking in the house. She said parliament had a duty to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement bill. She said 53% of people voted for parties that wanted a second referendum in the general election and opinion polls showed most people were now in favour of remaining in the EU. Never have we had a prime minister that spent so much effort avoiding scrutiny. We\u2019ve noticed in recent weeks that when he can\u2019t avoid the question he responds with a posh bloke version of Little Britain\u2019s Vicky Pollard: \u2018Nah but ya, but nah but yah.\u2019 Just over 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the general election results and what happens next. Send them in to us here. Q: How significantly will voter ID and the new constituency boundaries influence future elections? Michael, Sheffield The need for voter ID could be very significant in my opinion. It was pleasing to see in the Queen\u2019s speech that the government suggested that those who did not have ID could apply for a free local electoral identity document. However impersonation at an election is extremely low, which makes this new rule seem heavy handed. The concern is that those on lower incomes who do not have the right documents will be put off voting. Q: Hi Kate, There is going to be an inevitable push and pull between left and centre-left in the Labour party for the forthcoming leadership election. What do you think the new leader needs to do to reconnect with lost votes, bearing in mind the policies under Corbyn seemed pretty popular? Nat, 26, local government officer, London It\u2019s true that the policies were popular but that many did not find Corbyn credible as a leader in order to deliver them. A leftwing manifesto may work again but scaled down as voters felt overwhelmed by the significant offer of policies. I think a new leader needs to work extremely hard in building a profile in the north of England and the Midlands. I felt some of the rallies in the election campaign were in the wrong places and there was no visibility of Labour in town centres, high streets and on market days. Even if it does not feel easy, leaders really need to do on the ground walkabouts and take the criticism head on. I think it may be sensible to try to bring a shadow cabinet together that has people with slightly different views from the leader on domestic policy. However, they should not have a shadow cabinet that is push and pull on Brexit. That will be too hard to navigate and it\u2019s been proven that it makes the public think there is not a cohesive top level of leadership. You have been sending in your questions about the general election results, which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: Can Johnson abolish the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and not replace it with anything else, meaning there will be no local means of an election being called? Jon, 40, administrator, Sheffield Yes, he can abolish it and plans to do so in the first few months of 2020. It is something of a priority for the government. The previous arrangements of an election being held every five years will come back into force. Even if the FTPA existed, Johnson\u2019s majority means it would be very unlikely that MPs would try to call for an early election anyway. Q: What\u2019s happened to the report on Russian interference in the Brexit referendum? Fred, London We are still awaiting its publication, although Boris Johnson \u2013 after securing his majority \u2013 decided that the government was now in a position to release it. Expect pressure to mount for its publication in the early new year but it could still take months. The fact it was not printed pre-election was highly controversial and the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who was the intelligence and security committee chair, said the reasons given were \u201cbogus\u201d. The report was compiled by the committee but a new chair and members will need to be elected, which could hold things up. Some of your questions so far have been about the opposition and a second referendum on Scottish independence: Q: This is the first big majority in parliament in over a decade. How will the opposition now operate in parliament since they are unlikley to be able to defeat the government on any legislation? Craig, 36, works in the public sector, Stirling The majority Conservative government is new ground for many opposition MPs and for those who took their seats in 2017. They have never operated in a majority scenario before. You might expect tighter whipping as the last thing Labour needs is to look divided in the face of huge majority votes that pass with ease. When there\u2019s only 202 Labour MPs, every vote counts. You might also see informal discussions with the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green on votes and working as a bloc. While they will not be able to overcome the Tory majority of 80, unity between those parties is in the very least a visual message to the public that the government is scrutinised and opposed. There will also be a scramble for opposition MPs to get the chair position on select committees, which is a powerful way of holding the government to account. Q: The SNP received a larger share of the vote in Scotland (45%) to the Conservatives in the UK (44%). Do you think that Boris\u2019 position to \u201cnot permit\u201d a second referendum on Scottish independence is democratically sustainable? James Munro, 53, architect, Glasgow Boris Johnson was extremely firm on this in the Queen\u2019s speech when the SNP brought up independence. He is 100 per cent against it and the power to grant another independence vote is in his hands. I think he will stick to this and will not bend to pressure. That does not of course stop the debate raging within the Commons throughout his entire premiership. I do think the first 12 months will be the time for Sturgeon to capitalise on her share of the vote in Scotland and I think we can expect her coming down to Westminster to hold press conferences and meetings with her MPs with more frequency. The SDLP\u2019s Claire Hanna used her maiden Commons speech to warn that Brexit \u201creopens old wounds\u201d in Northern Ireland. She said: \u201cFor Northern Ireland in particular, Brexit has sharpened all of the lines that the Good Friday agreement was designed to soften around identity, around borders, around sovereignty. \u201cWe should have been spending the last few years talking about reconciliation, talking about regeneration, talking about social justice and equality. \u201cThat\u2019s what all political action should really be about but instead we\u2019ve spent morning, noon and night talking about Brexit \u2013 a problem that didn\u2019t need to exist and which, particularly in Northern Ireland, reopens old wounds and limits our horizons.\u201d Hanna said Brexit \u201cfed off\u201d people who felt lost and disenfranchised in the political system, adding: \u201cI fear it will leave them feeling much worse.\u201d She also said: \u201cBeyond the economy, Brexit upends the delicate balance that in Northern Ireland has allowed us to imagine our shared and equal future together. \u201cWe in Northern Ireland know the value of the EU and, as my political hero and predecessor in this house, John Hume, so often said, the EU is the greatest peace-building and conflict resolution project anywhere in the world and those of us particularly affected by conflict have a duty to reflect its principles. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the concerns we have have been dismissed by those of you who won\u2019t ever have to live with the consequences of these actions.\u201d I\u2019m Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and I will be answering any questions you have on the general election results today. I have been covering politics for six years, locally and nationally, and arrived in the lobby at Westminster the day after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party. Before joining the Guardian I worked for the Evening Standard for three years as their political reporter, and was the Yorkshire Post\u2019s political correspondent. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Mark Francois, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group, said the election has broken the logjam of the last parliament over Brexit. He said he wished anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray, a \u201chappy and silent retirement\u201d after he came sixth in the seat of Cynon Valley for the Liberal Democrats in the election. \u201cAll I want to for Christmas is not EU,\u201d Francois said. At the end of her speech backbench Tory MP Rachel Maclean said: \u201cI want to wish everybody a very Merry Brexmas.\u201d Labour\u2019s Catherine McKinnell (Newcastle upon Tyne North) said the Conservative election slogan \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d was misleading. She said: \u201cBrexit isn\u2019t going to be done. The challenges of the next stage are infinitely more complex than the first.\u201d Matthew Pennycook, Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, added: \u201cThere is no question it did its job, but after 31 January the slogan Get Brexit Done will be exposed as the fiction it is. \u201cBecause when this bill becomes law, as it will, it will not mean that Brexit is done, and every single honourable and right honourable member on the benches opposite who parroted that line during the recent election campaign knows full well that is the case. \u201cBrexit is a process not an act and the passage of this legislation and the full implementation of the agreement by both parties is only the end of the beginning of that process and a prelude to a far more challenging phase of it.\u201d Number 10 has released the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech opening the debate. Here it is with a few gaps for interjections: I beg to move that the bill be read a second time and that we come together as a new Parliament, to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done. Now is the moment \u2013 as we leave the European Union \u2013 to reunite our country and allow the warmth and natural affection that we all share with our European neighbours \u2013 to find renewed expression in one great new national project of building a deep, special and democratically accountable partnership with those nations we are proud to call our closest friends. Because this bill, and this juncture in our national story, Mr Speaker must not be seen as a victory for one party or one faction over another. This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain in fact the very words seem tired to me as defunct as big enders and little enders or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play now is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny,and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us. And the whole purpose of our withdrawal agreement is to set this in motion and avoid any further delay. And in the hope that the honourable gentleman does not wish to have any further delay I will give way to him. ... I think most people looking at the negotiation would agree that it strengthens our negotiating position. If we have learned anything from the experience of the last three years it is that drift and dither means more acrimony, and anguish Mr Speaker and there would be nothing more dangerous for the new future that we want to build than allowing the permanent possibility of extending \u2013 I think I\u2019m coming to the point that the right honourable members wish to discuss- the implementation period in a torture that came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown\u2019s football or Prometheus chained to the tartarean crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back as all right honourable members in the House will recall \u2013 and then growing back only to be pecked out again in the cycle repeated forever This bill learns the emphatic lesson of the last parliament unlike members opposite and rejects any further delay. It ensures that we depart from the EU on 31 January \u2013 and at that point Brexit will be done. It will be over. The sorry story of the last three-and-a-half years will be at an end and we will be able to move forward Mr Speaker together The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on 31December next year \u2013 with no possibility of an extension. And it paves the way for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours, based on an ambitious free trade agreement, with no alignment on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws, and close and friendly relations. Mr Speaker, this vision of the United Kingdom\u2019s independence, a vision that inspires so many is now \u2013 if this new parliament allows \u2013 only hours from our grasp the oven is on so to speak. It is set at gas mark 4 we can have it done by lunch time or late lunch And the new deal that I negotiated with our European friends will restore our great institutions to their rightful place as the supreme instruments of British self-governance. Once again this house will be the only assembly able to legislate for this United Kingdom. British courts will be the sole arbiters of those laws. And above them all, the sovereign British people masters of their own fate, controlling their own borders, laws, money and trade. And throughout our new immigration system, we will not only welcome those with talent but go out of our way to attract people of ability regardless of nationality or background. And we are only able to do this because the freedoms offered by our European Union partners \u2013 by leaving the EU \u2013 allow us once again to control overall numbers and bear down on unskilled immigration with our new points-based system. And if the honourable lady if she is against our new control of immigration I would like to hear her explain why .... We remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children and will continue to support fully the purpose and spirit of Dubs amendment but this is not the place in this bill to do so. The government remains absolutely committed to doing so. And amongst many other advantages of this bill Mr Speaker is of course that we will be able to sign free trade deals with the booming markets of the world, a power that no British government has enjoyed for the last 46 years. We will cast off the common agricultural policy that has too often frustrated and burdened our farmers we will release our fishermen from the tangled driftnets of arcane quota systems ... I remind the House and I remind the members opposite that there is of course on party in this House that is committed to reversing will of the people and handing back control of Scotland\u2019s outstanding marine wealth to Brussels \u2013 the SNP. That\u2019s what they would do. I look forward to hearing them explain why they continue to support this abject policy and abject surrender. This house will also under this bill regain the authority to set the highest possible standards and we will take advantage of these new freedoms to legislate in parallel on the environment, on workers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 rights. And I reject the inexplicable fear \u2013 and I will give way for the last time \u2013 the right honourable lady may wish to talk about this ... The very essence of the opportunity of Brexit is we will no longer outsource these decisions. With renewed national self-confidence we will take them ourselves and answer to those who sent us here. It was this parliament \u2013 this parliament \u2013 in this country that led the whole of Europe and the world in passing the Factory Acts \u2013 the clean air Acts of the nineteenth century \u2013 which improved industrial working conditions by law. And this house should never doubt its ability to pioneer the standards of the fourth industrial revolution just as we did the first. And that epoch-making transformation \u2013 as with all the pivotal achievements of British history \u2013 reflected the combined national genius of every corner of this United Kingdom. In this new era our success, once again, will be achieved as one nation. This new deal in this bill ensures that the United Kingdom will leave the EU whole and entire with an unwavering dedication to Northern Ireland\u2019s place in our union ... Let me just remind the House Mr Speaker that the special provisions applying to Northern Ireland \u2013 which ensure after all one very important thing \u2013 that there is no hard border across Ireland and Northern Ireland are subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland assembly. And unless the assembly specifically withholds its consent unless indeed the assembly insists on continuing with this approach then those arrangements automatically lapse into full alignment with the rest of the UK. I believe these arrangements serve the interests of Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole. And it is a great deal for our whole country. And we must now begin building our future relationship with the EU. Our aim is to provide a close friendship, between sovereign equals, to promote our common interests inspired by pride in our European heritage and civilisation. And Clause 3 of the political declaration invokes that spirit \u2013 establishing \u2013 and I quote \u201cthe parameters of an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership\u201d rooted in our shared \u201chistory and ideals\u201d and \u201cstanding together against threats to rights and values from without or within\u201d. I am absolutely determined that this great project will not be the project of one government or one party but of the British nation as a whole. So parliament as I have said will be kept fully informed about progress of these negotiations. And we should be fortified by a renewed sense of confidence that while our democratic institutions \u2013 and policy of Lib Dems is now to have another referendum \u2013 so when they have worked their policy out I\u2019ll give way. And we should be fortified by a renewed sense of confidence that while our democratic institutions \u2013 have been tested as never before if this house comes together now to support this bill as I hope it will history will record that the first act of this new parliament in its earliest days was to break the ice floes and find a new way \u2013 a new passage through - to unsuspected oceans of opportunity. Now is the moment to come together and write a new and exciting chapter in our national story to forge a new partnership with our European friends to stand tall in the world and to begin the healing for which the whole people of this country yearn. And it is in that spirit of unity that I commend this bill to the House. Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who came to the UK as a refugee in 1939 on the Kindertransport and forced the government to promise to give sanctuary to some unaccompanied child refugees, has reacted with dismay to the removal of these provisions from the bill. Today, Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer your questions about the general election result and what happens next between 12.30 and 1.30pm. You can ask your question via our form here. Here\u2019s a brief morning summary: Boris Johnson has called on the British public to discard the labels of leave and remain as MPs prepared to take a historic step towards withdrawing the UK from the EU. Opening the debate on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill he said: \u201cWe come together as a new parliament to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed his party would continue to oppose the bill despite calls in his shadow cabinet to move on from the referendum by supporting it. He said: \u201cThis deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path towards more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines. We remain certain there is a better and fairer way for Britain to leave the EU.\u201d Johnson has claimed he is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families after Brexit, in the face of opposition anger at removing those provisions from the Wab. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy said Johnson had \u201cnot earned the right to shoehorn into this legislation measures that are a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world\u201d. Downing Street has refused to say whether the government has carried out any analysis into potential benefits of any trade deals with third countries after Brexit. Pressed repeatedly on the matter, the official said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing preparatory work in relation to trade deals and we will now be able to sit down and have those talks properly.\u201d Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK financial watchdog, has been named as the next governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, announced the replacement for Mark Carney, who is due to stand down from the role at the end of January after six-and-a-half years in the job. The new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has revealed he was diagnosed with diabetes days before the general election, and vowed it will not prevent him from carrying out the prestigious role. Hoyle, 62, said he had lost three stone in recent months and said he was still in shock over the diagnosis. Johnson has claimed his government is \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to allowing unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families after Brexit, PA reports. The prime minister was accused of using key Brexit legislation to \u201cbring up the drawbridge\u201d and stop the right of unaccompanied minors coming to the United Kingdom. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford labelled changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and said it showed \u201cwho are the real separatists\u201d. For Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said it was \u201cone of the most appalling sections\u201d of the legislation and told MPs: \u201cComing to up to Christmas, shame on this Government for abandoning children in this way.\u201d Labour MP Lisa Nandy (Wigan) also questioned the PM\u2019s reluctance to help child refugees. She said that, while Johnson is right to say he has won a mandate to get Brexit done, he has \u201cnot earned the right to shoehorn into this legislation measures that are a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world\u201d. The government, as part of a redrafted Brexit Bill, appears to have rowed back on an original commitment to strike a deal with the EU so child refugees in Europe can continue to be reunited with their families in the UK, even after free movement ends. Clause 37 of the Bill replaces the pledge with a watered-down vow for ministers to \u201cmake a statement\u201d on the progress of the talks once the divorce with Brussels is complete. Nandy told the Commons: \u201cIf he thinks that people in towns like mine who believe that we should deliver Brexit want to see us turn our back on decency and tolerance and kindness and warmth and empathy, he is wrong. \u201cWill he take these measures on child refugees out of this Bill?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cShe is wrong on this point. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we continue in this country to receive unaccompanied children, as we have done. \u201cI reject the idea that our proceedings must be somehow overseen and invigilated by the EU and measured against their benchmarks.\u201d SNP justice spokeswoman Joanna Cherry asked: \u201cCan the primeminister tell me why he is making this mean-spirited and nasty move?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cThe honourable lady has totally misunderstood or possibly misrepresented the purpose of what we are doing here. \u201cWe remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children. We\u2019ll continue to support fully the purpose and spirit of the Dubs amendment but this is not the place, in this Bill, to do so. The government remains absolutely committed to doing so.\u201d Downing Street has refused to say whether the government has carried out any analysis into potential benefits of any trade deals with third countries after Brexit. Asked if analysis had been performed on the economic benefits of any deal with the US or other nations, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThe whole point is that when we get Brexit done on January 31 that we will be free to then sit down with all other countries around the world, emerging economies, and we will be able to start the talks on what those trade negotiations might be and what sort of deals they might deliver. \u201cThere are great opportunities out there for the United Kingdom.\u201d Pressed repeatedly on the matter, the official said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing preparatory work in relation to trade deals and we will now be able to sit down and have those talks properly.\u201d Boris Johnson has insisted leave and remain labels are now defunct as he moved to push Brexit legislation through Parliament, according to PA\u2019s write up of the prime minister\u2019s speech. After months of delay and deadlock, the PM said now is the time to act and forge a new relationship with the rest of Europe. Johnson, moving the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill at second reading, urged parliament to come together and allow the \u201cwarmth and natural affection that we all share\u201d for the UK\u2019s European neighbours to \u201cfind renewed expression in one great new national project\u201d. The PM told MPs the bill must not be seen as a victory for one party or faction before adding: \u201cThis is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain. \u201cIn fact, the very words seem tired to me \u2013 as defunct as Big-enders and Little-enders, or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play. \u201cNow is the time to act together as one reinvigorated nation, one United Kingdom, filled with renewed confidence in our national destiny and determined at last to take advantage of the opportunities that now lie before us.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cWe will be able to move forward together. The bill ensures that the implementation period must end on 31 January with no possibility of an extension. \u201cAnd it paves the path for a new agreement on our future relationship with our European neighbours based on an ambitious free-trade agreement, with no alignment ... on EU rules, but instead control of our own laws and close and friendly relations. \u201cThis vision of the United Kingdom\u2019s independence, a vision that inspires so many, is now if this parliament, this new parliament allows, only hours from our grasp. \u201cThe oven is on, so to speak, it is set at gas mark 4, we can have it done by lunchtime, or late lunch.\u201d SNP spin doctors have been described as at best \u201cpatronising\u201d after the leak of an email to broadcasters giving them tips on how to interview Tories about Scottish independence. The Times Scotland reports this morning that the SNP\u2019s email to journalists offered advice on how to ensure Tory interviewees are \u201ctied in knots\u201d over their opposition to a second referendum, and urged broadcasters to \u201crigorously\u201d scrutinise their answers. This came as news to all those journalists who thought that they were already doing just that to all politicians, regardless of party. Indeed, one recent example might by the interview of Scottish secretary Alister Jack, on Good Morning Scotland earlier today. Interestingly, Jack did not immediately dismiss Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s formal request for transfer of powers to hold a second vote: he said that Johnson would \u201cgive it careful consideration and reply in the new year\u201d. Challenged about whether the Tories were ignoring the election mandate, Jack insisted that recent polling showed Scots did not want another referendum, and said accused the SNP of changing their argument at the end of the election campaign \u201caway from indyref2 because they were losing, and they hardened their position on Brexit. They were fighting the election in the last ten days over Brexit\u201d. Asked whether continued Tory refusal would, as Sturgeon has suggested, increase support for independence, Jack warned that the first minister\u2019s call to devolve the power to hold referendums permanently to Holyrood would result in \u201cperpetual neverendums\u201d. Tory backbencher Suella Braverman claims trust in politicians was stretched to breaking point in the last parliament. Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of DUP in the Commons, says that European Union will continue to have a say in Northern Ireland affairs under the bill. I want the prime minister to treat my part of the United Kingdom the same as the rest of the country when it comes to leaving the European Union, Donaldson says. We don\u2019t want barriers to trade with the rest of the country, he said. Citing a Treasury report also mentioned by Corbyn, Donaldson said it is clear that checks will take place despite Johnson\u2019s pledge of no border checks. He added: \u201cWe want to work with the government to mitigate the impact on Northern Ireland business of the requirement for those checks, and again that\u2019s something we want to hear more from the government on and we will be looking towards committee stage to see what we can do to reflect the commitment in the agreement and the commitment from the prime minister that there will be unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in relation to trade.\u201d The former de facto deputy prime minister, Damian Green, urges those who voted to remain to accept the result of the referendum and stop trying to subvert Brexit. \u201cPlease accept the decision and move on,\u201d Green said. Green adds: \u201cWe should stop defining ourselves as leavers or remainers. The last few years have been miserable for democracy. The longer we fight past battles the longer that misery will persist.\u201d Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn says the PM has chosen to gamble with a cliff edge Brexit by trying to outlaw extending the implementation period in the bid. He says the government will need to be confident no extension is needed by the end of June. Benn also laments the lack of an economic impact assessment on the future trading relationship with the EU. He says history will judge this as deeply irresponsible. Labour has released the full text of Corbyn\u2019s speech on the withdrawal bill: Over the last three-and-a-half years the government\u2019s mishandling of Brexit has delivered nothing but political gridlock, chaos and economic uncertainty. It has paralysed our political system, divided our communities and nations and become a national embarrassment on an unprecedented scale. For people outside Westminster the constant argument and pointless posturing in parliament has only served to demonstrate the political system is not working for them. So we recognise the clear message from the British public last week, however they voted in the referendum of 2016, and understand their determination to end the never-ending cycle of Brexit debate and get back to solving the day-to-day issues and challenges they face in their lives. We must listen and understand that we cannot go on forever debating what happened in 2016. We have to respect that decision and move on. But Mr Speaker, understanding all this doesn\u2019t mean we as a party and a movement should abandon basic principles or give up the demand for a fairer and more just society. We warned before the general election that the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal was a terrible deal for our country and we still believe it is a terrible deal today. It will not protect or strengthen our rights or support our manufacturing industry and vital trading relationships, or protect our natural world in a time of a climate crisis. Neither will it address the deep inequality in our system or secure the interests of every nation and region in the United Kingdom. Instead under the Conservatives this deal will be used as a battering ram to drive us down the path of yet more deregulation and towards a toxic deal with Donald Trump that will sell out our NHS and push up the price of medicines to benefit the giant US drugs corporations. That will take us away from the essential principles we believe in, of a country that looks after everybody and protects those communities left behind by the excesses of runaway capitalism. This deal doesn\u2019t bring certainty for communities or for business and workforces. In fact it does the opposite and hardwires in the risk of a no-deal Brexit in a year\u2019s time. I\u2019m sure that will delight many of those on the benches opposite but not those who will suffer the consequences in communities and workplaces across Britain. That is why Labour will not support this Bill as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU. One which would not risk ripping our communities apart, selling out our public services or sacrificing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process. This deal is a roadmap for the reckless direction in which the government and the Prime Minister are determined to take our country. They have done their utmost to hide its likely impact and continue to use gimmicks and slogans to turn attention away from their real intentions. And nothing exposes this more than the steps they have already taken on workers\u2019 rights. For all the promises over the past few weeks that they are the party to protect rights at work, at the very first opportunity they have removed the basic provisions they had said would be part of this bill. That does not bode well for the separate bill the prime minister is now saying he will bring forward on workers\u2019 rights If he wants to assure people that their rights are safe in his hands he should commit to legislate to ensure workers rights in Britain will never fall behind EU standards in the future and support amendments to enshrine this commitment within this bill. Mr Speaker, I want to make it absolutely clear how appalled I am to see the government remove the protections in this Bill for unaccompanied children seeking asylum. Throughout the last Parliament and for his whole life my good friend Lord Dubs has worked tirelessly to ensure children affected by the worst aspects of global injustice are given sanctuary in this country. Now this government, in its first week in office has ripped up those hard won commitments. This is a move the director of the charity Safe Passage has described as, and I quote: \u201ctruly shocking\u201d Saying it could have and I quote again: \u201cpotentially tragic consequences\u201d. Shame on this government for abandoning children in this way. Mr Speaker, on the environment and food safety standards this deal points to a complete realignment towards the far weaker protections and standards that operate in Donald Trump\u2019s America. If this government is set on pursuing a Trump trade deal with precious few bargaining chips to hand the brutal reality is that Britain will have to lower its standards. The EU has made it clear that a future trade deal with them will depend on maintaining a level playing field in standards and protections. So the choice we now face is between keeping the highest environmental and food standards in order to get that future deal with the EU or slashing food standards to match the US, where what are called \u201cacceptable levels\u201d of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed, just so we can strike a new race-to-the-bottom deal with Donald Trump. Turning to the arrangements with Northern Ireland the Prime Minister has emphatically claimed, and I quote:\u201cthere will be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB\u201d And that: \u201cwe have a deal that keeps the whole of the UK together as we come of the EU\u201d These claims are simply not true. We know from the analysis carried out by his own Treasury that under his deal there will, in fact, be an abundance of checks and customs declarations in the Irish Sea. Not only will this have a huge impact on Northern Irish business and society, it will also have implications for the rest of Britain\u2019s economy and manufacturing industry. The Treasury\u2019s own analysis spells it out: the more the government diverges from EU trading regulations in the future the more checks and disruption will be put in place between Britain and our biggest trading partner. More checks and more disruption would be deeply damaging for trade and for our manufacturing sector and threatens to take a wrecking ball to our vital supply chains and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on them. From car manufacturers to the chemical industry disruption to our just-in-time supply chains will have a devastating impact. This all makes it even more incredible that since agreeing its deal the government has yet to produce a single bit of evidence or analysis to show it will have a positive impact on the economy or our communities in any way. We scarcely need to ask ourselves, why? I say to all members new and old that it is our job to question to scrutinise and to hold the government of the day to account. If we believe the government is taking the wrong approach we should not be afraid to oppose. And when it comes to our future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world we cannot let this government act in an undemocratic and secretive manner. Trade deals with the EU, the US, or anybody else for that matter must be done transparently. This country is about to embark on a major change of direction as we leave a 40-year economic partnership for an unknown future, under the terms of this withdrawal deal. The government needs to be honest with the people about the real choices and the real risks that lie ahead. So stop the posturing and the gimmicks and ditch the unachievable red lines that will only lead to another no-deal cliff edge, with all the anxiety and uncertainty that brings. The prime minister may believe that fuelling division and confrontation has helped him realise his personal political ambition. But it\u2019s no way to heal the deep divisions in our society or find the common ground we need to move beyond Brexit. We need an approach that puts jobs and living standards first and builds the strongest cooperation with our European neighbours based on openness, solidarity and internationalism. That is the approach that will bring an end to the Brexit crisis and bring our country together. Sajid Javid is still on message: Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP in the Commons, says the PM has no mandate to drag Scotland out of the EU against its will. He said Scotland will be made poorer by Brexit and it is already having an impact on the Scottish economy. Former international trade secretary, Liam Fox, says the bill is about fulfilling a promise to the British people. Corbyn challenges Johnson\u2019s commitment to have no checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He says more checks will have a devastating impact on the economy. Corbyn urges the PM to commit to ensure that workers\u2019 rights don\u2019t slip behind those in the EU. He says the removal of the commitment to refugee children is an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d. Quoting the charity Safe Passage he says the move is \u201cshocking\u201d and could result in tragic consequences. \u201cI want to make it clear that I see the government\u2019s removal of the protection in this bill for unaccompanied children seeking asylum is nothing short of an absolute disgrace and a piece of dishonesty toward those people who, at the moment, are clearly very, very concerned. \u201cThroughout the last parliament, and for his whole life, and I was talking to him last night, my good friend Lord Dubs has worked tirelessly to ensure children affected by the worst aspects of global injustice can be given sanctuary in this country. \u201cNow this government in its first week in office has ripped up those very hard-won commitments.\u201d \u201cI simply say this: coming to up to Christmas shame on this government for abandoning children in this way.\u201d Responding Jeremy Corbyn says Labour recognises the nation\u2019s desire to move on from the referendum debate. But he says the Brexit deal will be used as a battering ram to deregulate the UK and leave it open to the excesses of the free market. He claims the deal is a roadmap for the reckless direction the prime minister is determined to take the UK. \u201cWe remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU,\u201d Corbyn says. Johnson says: \u201cIf this house comes together now to support this bill ... history will record that the first act of this new parliament in its earliest days was to break the ice flows and find a new way through. \u201cNow is the moment to come together and write a new chapter in this nation\u2019s history,\u201d he says in closing his remarks. The possible Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy intervenes to challenge Johnson to show \u201cdecency\u201d on child refugees. \u201cIf he thinks that people in towns like mine \u2026 want to see us turn our back on decency and tolerance and kindness and warmth and empathy he is wrong,\u201d she said. Johnson says the UK will accept unaccompanied children but not overseen by the EU. He says the essence of the opportunity of Brexit is that parliament can take decisions for itself on this and environmental standards. He goes on to talk about the government\u2019s \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. Steven Swinford picks out these lines: Johnson insists the government is commitment to taking unaccompanied refugee children from Europe despite the withdrawal of provisions on this from the bill. Johnson insists that ruling out an extension to the implementation period will strengthen the UK\u2019s bargaining position with the EU. \u201cThe oven is on, it is set at gas mark 4, we can have it done by lunch or late lunch,\u201d Johnson tells MPs. Boris Johnson is opening the debate for the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill in the Commons. The prime minister calls on parliament to come together to get Brexit done and reunite the country by doing so. This bill should not be seen as a victory for one party or a one faction, Johnson says. \u201cNow is the time to act together,\u201d he says. Keir Starmer has set out another pitch for the Labour leadership. The shadow Brexit secretary has still not officially confirmed he is running, but an article for Labour List suggests this is very much his plan. Starmer writes: My case file, and that of most Labour MPs, is filled with the cases of people suffering stress, anxiety and hunger because of universal credit. I want to transform our party into a movement that empowers them to speak for themselves. To do that, we must open up power like never before. An inequality of power underpins the inequalities of wealth and opportunity that scar our country. The trade unions were founded to give power and a voice to working class people. They founded the Labour Party, and by winning power we built the NHS, free state education and the welfare state. The rich and privileged have always had the power they need to shape their lives and to shape world in their own interests. Labour\u2019s historic task is to open up power to everyone else so we can build the fairer world we believe in. We call it socialism because we believe in the transformative power of society and communities. That historic mission remains our mission today. But we can\u2019t do it on our own. The point about a movement is it brings everyone together in a common cause. Labour must learn from the social movements that people create to fight injustice: renters\u2019 unions, delivery drivers\u2019 unions, movements to prevent social cleansing of estates. We need to embed this party deep into the everyday lives of people in areas that feel hopeless and abandoned. Starmer calls for Labour to broaden its appeal and widen its ideological stance. The Labour tradition has never drawn from a single ideology: at its best, it is an alliance of different traditions. The challenge of leadership is to draw out the best from them, and get them working towards the single goal of an electoral majority. We have so much more in common than that which divides us, and each of us has something to teach and something to learn. With the whole party and whole movement pulling together rather than pulling apart, we can, and we will, win. The Brexit secretary, Steven Barclay, has defended the government\u2019s decision to strip out commitments on workers\u2019 rights from the withdrawal agreement bill. Speaking on TalkRadio he said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to them [workers\u2019 rights] but it\u2019s about having the right legislation vehicle. This legislation is about implementing into domestic law the international agreement that we reached with the EU. We\u2019ve got other legislation through the Queen\u2019s speech in terms of workers\u2019 rights, because quite often the UK has gone further than the European Union in terms of workers\u2019 rights. \u201cIf you look at things like paternity and maternity rights, the UK has higher standards than many countries in Europe, so we don\u2019t need the EU to set those standards. We can do that through the UK parliament answerable to the British people. Barclay also claimed the disbanding of his Department for Exiting the European Union was an \u201can exciting opportunity in government\u201d. He said after the department is scrapped former officials will be redeployed to other departments. Barclay said: \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity actually to pay tribute to the many officials in the department who have built up a massive amount of expertise. And what we can then do is socialise that expertise across Whitehall into the many departments that will be dealing with trade, because all areas of the government will then be involved in the future trade deal.\u201d Sajid Javid has announced that the head of Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, will be the new governor of the Bank of England. The chancellor said he was the \u201cstand out candidate\u201d to succeed Mark Carney. Bailey will take over in March. Our Business blog has more. European parliament vice president, Pedro Silva Pereira, said officials in Brussels expect to conclude the ratification process in the European parliament by 29 January. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always respected the choice of the British people, but it is true that it was a very long process.\u201d Asked what kind of trade deal can be negotiated and how \u201cdeep\u201d it can be if it is to be completely concluded by the end of 2020, he said: \u201cWe have a very short timeframe available. \u201cEleven months to negotiate such a complex trade agreement is unprecedented. It is a different situation. We come from a level of economic integration which has no comparison with other trade agreements that we\u2019ve done before.\u201d He added: \u201cThe key issue will be what kind of regulatory dis-alignment we will have. The political declaration that we\u2019ve agreed with the UK envisaged a very ambitious trading relationship with zero tariffs, zero quotas. But this can only be achieved if we ensure some regulatory alignment.\u201d Boris Johnson is due to open today\u2019s second reading debate on the withdrawal agreement bill at 9.30am. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, is set to close the debate and MPs are expected to start voting at about 2.30pm. Barclay\u2019s department is due to be scrapped by the end of January, along with the word \u201cBrexit\u201d if No 10 gets its way. According to the Huffington Post, the prime minister has ordered officials to drop the term \u201cBrexit\u201d once the Wab passes and the UK leaves the EU on 31 January as planned. Some shadow cabinet members representing pro-leave seats are understood to have suggested the Labour party should not vote against the Wab in today\u2019s second reading vote. But the party remains split on Brexit. Labour MP Anneliese Dodds said she is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the bill. Speaking to the Today programme, she said: \u201cI really don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s really matching up to many of the commitments that were given by previous Conservative governments, and as a result we really have to reject that bill. \u201cI mean, clearly, with a government majority of the size that it is at the moment, it is likely that it will pass, but I think we\u2019ve got to represent our constituents\u2019 concerns and do at least what we can to make sure these issues are heard.\u201d After the election there had been speculation that the size of Johnson\u2019s majority meant he might pursue a softer Brexit and and could afford to face down his hardline Eurosceptics. But a hard version of Brexit is still very much on the agenda following changes set out in the Brexit bill. And the European Research Group (ERG) is delighted. The Eurosceptic MP Bernard Jenkin said the ERG is \u201cquite happy\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt was the remainers that wrecked Boris Johnson\u2019s ability to get the agreement through parliament. \u201cEvery member of the ERG supported Boris Johnson\u2019s agreement, so we\u2019re generally quite happy about how all this is proceeding. It\u2019s a compromise deal.\u201d Jenkin added: \u201cI\u2019m just reminding myself what was in our manifesto \u2013 take back control of our laws, take back control of our money, control our trade policy, introduce an Australian-style points immigration system, raise standards in areas like workers rights, animal welfare, agriculture and the environment, and ensure we\u2019re in full control of our fishing waters. I mean, we\u2019re the manifesto support group now.\u201d Welcome to Politics Live a week on from the morning the nation woke up to news of Boris Johnson\u2019s thumping election win. His 80-seat majority means there is no doubt that MPs will pass the withdrawal agreement bill when it comes up for a second reading vote on Friday afternoon. This will be put Johnson\u2019s government on course to meet the election pledge of getting out of the EU by 31 January. The Brexit Bill set out in Thursday\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech has been greeted with dismay by opposition MPs. It strips out protections for workers\u2019 rights, waters down a commitment to take unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, and removes parliament\u2019s say on the future relationship. It also inserts a ban on the government extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. Meanwhile, the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis has declared his candidacy for Labour leader. And Nicola Sturgeon has called for the Scottish parliament to be given permanent powers to hold subsequent referendums on independence from the UK.",

It is needed to enshrine the deal Boris Johnson struck with the EU in October in UK law and legitimise the transition period before full departure on 31 December 2020. But, in a reflection of the freedoms delivered by an 80-seat majority, this new version removes previous concessions to opposition parties as well as signalling to Eurosceptics in his own party that Brexit will not just be done, but done the Boris Johnson way. It includes several key changes that reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit bill and give the government freedom to conduct negotiations without parliamentary approval. Three clauses and one entire schedule have been removed. Five clauses have been added and several clauses modified. What stays the same? Powers to make the Brexit deal legal domestically. The legislation enabling the transition period allowing the UK to stay in the customs union and single market between 1 February and 21 December 2020. Powers to ensure key elements of the European Communities Act of 1972 remain applicable domestically. The UK will remain a rule-taker and not a rule maker. Extensive powers to ministers and devolved governments to deal with the separation issues. So-called \u201cHenry VIII powers\u201d, under which ministers can repeal or amend an act of parliament without going back to MPs, allowing them to implement the protocol on special arrangements intended to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. These are \u201ca bit of a blank cheque\u201d, says Joe Owen, Brexit director at the Institute for Government. But as nobody knows the detail of how they will operate they reflect the complexity of the consequences of the divorce from the EU.

A clause outlawing an extension to the Brexit transition period beyond 31 December is included. A clause locking in Brexit at the stroke of midnight, 31 December. The only way that can change is if the EU changes its summer daylight saving. The bill gives the government new powers in several areas, including Northern Ireland, to change Brexit-related laws through secondary legislation rather than primary, which has the potential to reduce parliamentary scrutiny. Time limits on any discussion of the divorce bill payments, removing the option of debate up to March 2021. This is in line with the other clauses removing any chance of an extension to the transition period. It gives the House of Lords\u2019 EU committee the right to scrutinise developments in EU law of \u201cvital national interest\u201d to the UK during the transition or implementation period. The House of Commons already had these powers under the October bill. An independent monitoring authority to allow EU nationals in the UK to appeal against decisions relating to their rights has slightly changed, with the authority given the power to delegate decisions to launch inquiries. What happens next? After being approved at its second reading on Friday afternoon by 124 votes, the bill will go to its next stage after the Christmas recess. The government has set aside three days, 7, 8 and 9 January, for this, indicating its confidence that any of the previous obstacles \u2013 such as attempts to get a second referendum \u2013 will neither be mooted or will fail. Opposition parties say three days is not enough time to scrutinise one of the most important pieces of legislation in parliamentary history but the government disagrees.",

The future of the Banksy is caught up in that wider debate, which is why we haven\u2019t come to final conclusions. In the meantime, we\u2019ve worked hard to preserve that painting.\u201d The Banksy appeared in Taibach, close to the Tata steelworks. From one angle, it shows a child in a bobble hat with a sled, apparently enjoying a snow shower and trying to catch the flakes on their tongue. But from another it becomes clear that what is falling on the child is ash. Banksy confirmed the work was his by releasing a video of the mural accompanied by the Christmas song Little Snowflake. The camera rises above the garage and shows Port Talbot\u2019s rooftops and the billowing chimneys of the steelworks and other industrial buildings. The art dealer John Brandler bought the Banksy from Ian Lewis, who owned the garage and thus the artwork, for a six-figure sum and promised it would stay in Port Talbot for at least three years. Brandler is frustrated that the immediate future of the piece remains unclear. He said: \u201cIt is my guess that the authorities are saying we opened it to the public but only \u2018X\u2019 people came so there\u2019s no point in opening a museum. I hope for the people of Neath Port Talbot I\u2019m wrong.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland\u2019s election started as a contest about Brexit and British and Irish identities, and finished by focusing on a big empty building that evoked comparisons to the Overlook hotel in The Shining. The parliament building at Stormont, an estate outside Belfast, is an imposing structure in the Greek classical style filled with ornate ceilings, chandeliers and marbled halls. Life drained from the building three years ago when a row between Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) led to the collapse of power sharing, mothballing the assembly chamber and zombifying Northern Ireland\u2019s politics. The debacle haunted both parties on election night. The DUP lost two of its 10 MPs and saw its overall vote fall by 5.4 percentage points. Sinn F\u00e9in won a headline-grabbing victory in Belfast North where John Finucane toppled the DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds, but faltered everywhere else, losing a seat in Derry and seeing its overall vote drop by 6.7 percentage points. It was punishment for Stormont\u2019s paralysis amid crumbling public services, especially a crisis in healthcare, and it was Brexit blowback: retribution for DUP bungling and Sinn F\u00e9in irrelevance. \u201cPeople were voting against abstentionism and the dominance of the two big parties. People are fed up with the impasse,\u201d said Katy Hayward, a reader in sociology at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and the author of Bordering on Brexit. \u201cThey were not delivering for their constituencies,\u201d said Nicholas Whyte, a Northern Ireland election maven with the consultancy Apco Worldwide. \u201cSo votes went to other parties. A crucial number now feel sufficiently secure to not vote for their tribe.\u201d Days after the election, lights started blazing at Stormont. Chastened DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in leaders were huddling there with other party leaders and British and Irish officials in an attempt to revive the assembly. But last night the British and Irish governments blamed the DUP for holding up a compromise deal. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, said he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d and that talks would probably be paused over Christmas to give all parties time to \u201creflect\u201d before trying again in January. \u201cI know there are people in the DUP who want to move forward and I would urge them to move forward so we can get this done,\u201d he said. Smith said the lack of consensus stopped him tabling a motion to restore power-sharing at Stormont. If devolution is not restored by 13 January Smith has vowed to call new assembly elections. The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in want to avoid a fresh lashing at the polls so there had been optimism they would compromise on an Irish language act, the main sticking point, to clinch a deal. Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge on Thursday to end \u201cvexatious\u201d prosecutions of army veterans may create an additional hurdle. Bigger challenges loom, raising profound questions about Northern Ireland\u2019s future. The prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal rattles loyalists who say a border down the Irish Sea will diminish their British identity. And it will create headaches for business owners faced with murky rules and regulations for trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Equally unclear is how Downing Street\u2019s coming trade talks with the European Union will impact Northern Ireland\u2019s economy and constitutional status within the UK and EU. All this while a renewed push for Scottish independence and a demographic tilt towards a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland fans republican hopes \u2013 and unionist dread \u2013 of Irish unification. There is everything to play for, in other words, so little wonder that voters vented anger at the absence of players on the pitch. The DUP had deflected frustration over Stormont\u2019s impasse by touting its confidence-and-supply agreement with Theresa May\u2019s government, casting itself as Downing Street\u2019s puppeteer, only for her successor, Johnson, to negotiate a Brexit deal that cut the strings, leaving the DUP betrayed and sidelined. Sinn F\u00e9in, meanwhile, struggled to show its impact given the empty chamber in Belfast and a policy of abstention from Westminster that emasculated its seven MPs during Brexit\u2019s great parliamentary dramas.
