Johannesson\u2019s body was discovered in a rundown flat in Leeds almost a week after had died in September 1995 \u2013 Radebe attended the funeral but Masinga was unable to because he was in Wilkinson\u2019s squad for the next match. \u201cI was a little bit sad because of the circumstances of his death,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI wish that I could have met him before he died because I never had an opportunity to shake hands with him.\u201d The signing of the Ghana striker Tony Yeboah a few days after Masinga had scored a memorable hat-trick in extra time against Walsall in the FA Cup proved to be the beginning of the end for his Leeds career. While Radebe went on to establish himself as captain under George Graham, his friend was sold to the Swiss side St Gallen in 1996 having made 31 appearances for the Yorkshire club. Masinga moved on to Italy and enjoyed successful spells with Salernitana and Bari, for whom he scored more than 30 goals in four Serie A seasons before scoring the goal against the Republic of Congo that took South Africa to their first World Cup finals. But he was relentlessly booed by home supporters in Bafana Bafana\u2019s next match after missing some golden chances and later admitted he had come close to quitting international football before the tournament in France. \u201cIt was tough, it was killing me,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even buy newspapers any more because I didn\u2019t want to see what they would be writing about me.\u201d Masinga saw his hopes of a reunion with Strachan at Coventry ended when his work permit application was rejected in 2001 and he retired due to a knee injury after a short spell in the United Arab Emirates, returning to South Africa to coach at his former club Cosmos. Within five years he was back at his mother\u2019s house in Khuma having been forced to sell all of his memorabilia, including his 1996 Africa Cup of Nations winners\u2019 medal. \u201cI made some very bad investments because of a lack of financial knowledge,\u201d admitted Masinga. \u201cSome people are fortunate to get financial skills through studies or careers. I had to acquire mine through the \u2018university of life\u2019.\u201d Having left at 14, Masinga went back to school and studied management science at Nelson Mandela Bay university. But despite hoping to return one day to top-level football as an administrator, Masinga was admitted to Tshepong hospital in Klerksdorp in November before being diagnosed with cancer. \u201cVery sad news for South African football, we lost a true football legend in Phil \u2018Chippa\u2019 Masinga,\u201d wrote Steven Pienaar on Twitter. \u201cHe paved the way for all South African footballers in the UK. That goal at FNB Stadium that took us to our 1st World Cup will always be on my mind.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "No charges will be laid over the tipoff to the media of the raids on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union headquarters, the federal police have confirmed. The AFP told the federal court on Monday the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has concluded there are \u201cno reasonable prospects of a conviction\u201d for the unauthorised leak. Labor has seized on the revelation, questioning why the resignation of David De Garis, a senior adviser to then-employment minister Michaelia Cash, over the matter was not sufficient to prosecute him for the media tipoff. A spokeswoman for the AFP told Guardian Australia it now \u201cconsiders this investigation finalised\u201d, six months after a brief of evidence was sent to the CDPP which the deputy AFP commissioner, Leanne Close, had said indicated the police thought a crime may have been committed. Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman Brendan O\u2019Connor said while he respects the independence of police and prosecutors \u201cit is very disappointing that no charges are to be laid in a matter where senator Cash confirmed to the Senate that a staffer confessed\u201dto being responsible for the leak. Australian Workers Union national secretary Daniel Walton said the development was \u201cmixed news\u201d because while the union was \u201cobviously disappointed\u201d no charges were laid it could now press for documents which were protected by a public interest immunity claim while the police investigated the leak. In October 2017 police and officers of the union watchdog the Registered Organisations Commission raided the AWU investigating whether donations made to GetUp and Labor candidates in 2005 were authorised under the union\u2019s rules. Media were tipped off about the raids, leading to a referral to the AFP to investigate whether an unauthorised disclosure of information about the search warrants had occurred. On 25 October 2017 Cash told Senate estimates her office was not responsible but was forced to correct her evidence when De Garis came forward following a story in Buzzfeed contradicting the minister. She said her staffer had \u201cin the course of discussions with journalists, indicated that he had received information \u2026 that a raid may take place\u201d. Cash said she was advised the information came from a \u201cmedia source\u201d. \u201cAt least my staff member has offered his resignation\u2014he has admitted he was wrong,\u201d she said. The AWU brought a federal court case challenging the legality of the raid but police and the Registered Organisations Commission claimed public interest immunity over documents, including correspondence about the raids. Walton told reporters in Sydney that while the \u201cAFP was looking specifically at the leaks\u201d the separate AWU federal court case will continue. The union alleges in its court case that Cash improperly used a law enforcement body in the Registered Organisations Commission to go after her political enemies, he said. On Monday the AFP advised the federal court the CDPP had decided not to proceed with a prosecution and it will review which documents can be released. The federal court case is listed for a case management hearing on 29 January and a full hearing starting 11 February. The AWU has subpoenaed Cash to give evidence in the case, although Cash has said she will apply to have the subpoena set aside and consistently denied any wrongdoing. \u201cGiven the minister is not a party to the proceedings, she is not aware of what occurred in the court,\u201d a spokeswoman for Cash reportedly told the ABC. \u201cAs previously stated, neither the minister nor her office is under investigation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. I leave you with Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s post-match reaction. Bye! It was a tough night for us I think. Since we conceded a goal, after the game became very difficult. The red card, and all these things. The boys are working, and it becomes very hard. Playing with 11 is tough, with one man less it\u2019s harder. Was City\u2019s first goal disappointing? Of course. It\u2019s a 30-yard pass that breaks us. We have to see. I think, honestly, the result there\u2019s no doubt about it \u2013 Man City had chances, controlled the game \u2013 but we had a plan, a plan about our defensive organisation, trying to stay in the game. With the goal, with the red card, everything went down. We have to look ahead now, forget about it and look ahead. On Boly\u2019s red card: It\u2019s a red card, no doubt about it. It\u2019s a red card. Nuno Espirito Santo says: fair enough, guv. Here\u2019s Kyle Walker\u2019s reaction to the win: I think when they go down to 10 men \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen the decision \u2013 we\u2019re always going to find it easier. Fair play to them, they gave it a good go and we were probably fortunate to get the three goals. And to his return to the first team: It was obviously disappointing when you\u2019re left out of the Premier League line-up but it was a reality check. I had to sit on the bench, and you probably learn more than when you\u2019re on the field. I\u2019ve taken it under consideration, I\u2019ve took it on the chin and I\u2019ll just have to work hard to stay in the starting XI. And to where City are right now: I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed from the start of the season. We\u2019re getting the rub of the green now and our luck\u2019s starting to change. We\u2019re still in all four competitions, we\u2019re fighting to be in the finals of each one and we need to keep that going. Here\u2019s a much more comprehensive match report, courtesy of Daniel Taylor: If there is one thing that Liverpool should know, squatting defiantly at the top of the Premier League, it is that Manchester City have no intentions of seeing another team remove the championship trophy from their possession. Pep Guardiola\u2019s team made that clear when Liverpool were the visitors and, in their latest victory, it quickly became clear the reigning champions seem quite happy playing this game of catch-up. For now, at least. More here: That was, in the end, pretty humdrum. City hogged possession but created little against an admirably organised and disciplined (one tackle excepted) Wolves side. 90+4 mins: And that\u2019s it! City win with great ease, and trim Liverpool\u2019s lead at the top to four points! 90+3 mins: City are camped on the edge of the Wolves penalty area again. 90+2 mins: One last (probably) attempt on goal for City: Sterling gives the ball to Gundogan, who finds himself facing away from goal so tries backheeling it, sending it rolling gently to Rui Patricio. 90+1 mins: There will be about three minutes of stoppage time, which given that there have been no injuries, penalties or red cards this half seems a bit toppish. 90 mins: Traor\u00e9 sets off on a lone gallop into the City half and somehow comes out of it with a corner. The away fans roar in delight. 89 mins: City pass around the edge of the Wolves area for a while, without ever quite finding a way into it. 86 mins: Ederson roars out of his area to intercept a Wolves through-ball, controls it, is carried forward by his momentum and ends up hanging around and playing a few passes from a position in midfield. 82 mins: City are 20-1 up on shots, and 8-0 ahead when it comes to shots on target. 82 mins: Danilo becomes the latest City player to send a shot from outside the box wildly high and/or wide. This is perhaps the wildest of the lot, though. 80 mins: A cross from the left is headed away to the edge of the area, where Fernandinho sends it arrowing towards the back of the stand. The corner is played back to De Bruyne, who hangs in a lovely cross from the left, which hits the back of Coady\u2019s leg and goes in at the far post! 77 mins: De Bruyne blasts a shot towards the near post from the edge of the area, and Rui Patricio does well to push it away for a corner. 76 mins: The evening\u2019s final substitution sees Gabriel Jesus leave the field, and Sergio Ag\u00fcero come on for those few minutes\u2019 action Pep Guardiola promised pre-match. 74 mins: Back to the Kompany/Boly debate, then. \u201cI think the difference is home advantage,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cAs mentioned on a recent Football Weekly, there\u2019s ample evidence that home advantage comes down to referees being influenced by the reactions of the crowd. Kompany\u2019s tackle was at home, Boly\u2019s away.\u201d 74 mins: City make their second change, bringing Ilkay Gundogan on and San\u00e9 off. 72 mins: Wolves use up their final substitution by bringing Moutinho off, and Morgan Gibbs-White on. 70 mins: Fernandinho\u2019s shot is deflected over the bar. 67 mins: Wolves are defending well, and City attacking smartly. This game has plenty to commend it, but at present is entirely lacking in drama. 66 mins: De Bruyne runs onto a loose ball on the edge of the Wolves area, and blasts a shot wildly wide and high. Which is just as well, because that would have destroyed any goal it flew into. 64 mins: De Bruyne sends Sterling clear with a very fine pass, but the cross is cleared. 61 mins: David Silva, as of tonight City\u2019s all-time highest Premier League appearance maker, comes off, and Kevin de Bruyne replaces him. 60 mins: Fernandinho lifts the ball over the Wolves defence, but San\u00e9 can\u2019t quite bring it under control. 58 mins: Wolves make a second change, bringing Jota off and replacing him with Romain Sa\u00efss. 58 mins: Wolves are having a good spell of possession, though it\u2019s almost entirely inside their own half. 55 mins: Walker fires in a shot from range, which gets a slight deflection that helps it into Rui Patricio\u2019s arms. 54 mins: Jesus passes to San\u00e9, who is clean through but just offside, and anyway shoots into Rui Patricio. 53 mins: Wolves break through Traor\u00e9, but there\u2019s nobody there to meet his pull-back. City then break through Sterling, but he passes into a defender\u2019s leg. Wolves then try to break again, but a long pass to Jota runs out of play. 51 mins: City work the ball down the right with a lovely exchange of passes, and Bernardo Silva picks out San\u00e9 with the pull-back, but his shot is hilariously awful, and the ball bobbles out for a goal kick. 46 mins: The second half is under way! Wolves have brought Adama Traor\u00e9 on, and taken Raul Jim\u00e9nez off. \u201cThe difference, for clarification, is that one of the fouls was performed by Pep\u2019s anointed princelings while the other (totally different situation) was performed against them,\u201d writes Matthew Turner. \u201cNo brainer, really.\u201d That is an extremely cynical reading of the situation, if understandable in the circumstances. I think two referees can see two very similar situations very slightly differently without (necessarily) being guilty of favouritism. 45+4 mins: We have had half of the time. City have one hand on three points. 45+1 mins: There will be three minutes\u2019 stoppage time, which given that there\u2019s been a red card, a penalty and an injury seems on the light side. 44 mins: Sterling somehow wins a header, in the middle of the six-yard box, but he diverts the ball straight to Rui Patricio. 43 mins: \u201cPlease explain, what was the difference (apart from the red card) between Bony\u2019s tackle today and last week\u2019s tackle from Vincent Kompany,\u201d wonders Tim MacGabhann (and a few others). \u201cIf one\u2019s red both are reds.\u201d They were very similar offences, and there doesn\u2019t seem any logical explanation for only one of them being punished with a red card. Boly could have been booked, I thought, though having said that you couldn\u2019t really argue with the referee\u2019s harsher interpretation. Jesus sends Rui Patricio the wrong way, and City double their lead! 39 mins: Bernardo turns the ball towards Sterling in the area. He speeds past Bennett, who sticks out a leg with the ball nowhere near and catches the player! 37 mins: And nearly a second at the other end! Sterling pulls back to Jesus, in a pocket of penalty-area space, but his decision to control the ball before shooting gave a defender time to get in the way of the shot when it came. 36 mins: Chance for Wolves! Suddenly they have three people running towards two defenders, but Jonny tries to pass when he might have shot, and Jota didn\u2019t anticipate it. 35 mins: San\u00e9\u2019s very fine, mazy dribble into the box ends with his shot being blocked and bouncing away for a corner. 32 mins: Wolves are defending space pretty well at the moment. Offering very little in attack, as you\u2019d expect, but City haven\u2019t had any clear chances since their goal. \u201cYou said the name and number should be enough of a clue for players,\u201d writes Peter McMurry of those Wolves dressing-room pics, \u201cbut perhaps it isn\u2019t. In the 90s NHL player Stu Grimson used to hang a picture of himself over his locker so that, in his words, \u2018when I forget how to spell my name, I can still find my clothes\u2019.\u201d 28 mins: Danilo runs into the area, whereupon he throws himself to the turf in a very obvious attempt to win a penalty. If that\u2019s not a booking for simulation I\u2019m not sure what the rule\u2019s there for. 27 mins: Not as painful as it appeared, it seems. After a minute or so of treatment, Jesus leaps to his feet, jogs happily back to the half-way line and is beckoned back onto the field. 25 mins: Ouch! Again! Bernardo Silva plays Walker down the right, he slams in a hard cross and Jesus flies in at the near post, misses the chance and absolutely flies into the side of the goal, possibly via the post. He goes down, and stays there. 22 mins: Danilo shanks a 20-yarder over the bar. The traffic was pretty much entirely one-way even before Boly\u2019s blunder, so it hasn\u2019t really had much of an impact. 19 mins: Ouch! Boly flies in to win the ball, does so, and then keeps going right into Bernardo Silva\u2019s ankle. I\u2019m not sure there was any intent to harm, but it certainly looked pretty vicious, and the referee thinks it deserves a red card! 18 mins: City are absolutely dominant now. It looks very much like Wolves will look back on those two goal kicks and three throw-ins as their golden age. 16 mins: Save! David Silva\u2019s 25-yarder flicks off a defender and would have gone in had Rui Patricio not tipped it over. The corner is headed clear (for now). 15 mins: The free-kick is cleared to San\u00e9, who passes to Jesus and, already sprinting, speeds up. A few moments later and he\u2019s pointing towards the precise spot inside Wolves\u2019 penalty area where he would like the ball, and Jesus attempts to deliver it. The ball isn\u2019t perfect and it\u2019s intercepted, the move memorable mainly for San\u00e9\u2019s phenomenal length-of-the-pitch sprint. 14 mins: Walker gives the ball away and Jota leads a Wolves break \u2013 at least until Fernandinho hacks him down, with the ball long gone. That is every inch a booking, and he is indeed booked. 13 mins: This is a great stat: 11 mins: Wolves attack, and find Doherty running into the penalty area, in loads of space and with plenty of team-mates to aim for in the middle. A pull-back was the best option, but instead he wallops the ball over everybody\u2019s heads and out for a throw-in. And with their first attack of note, City take the lead! Laporte\u2019s excellent pass sends San\u00e9 running down the left, and his low centre picks out Jesus in the middle, who turns it in from six yards! 8 mins: Sterling sends in a tasty cross from the right, but in the middle three Wolves defenders are able to decide amongst themselves which of them will head it clear. 7 mins: The first shot of the game comes from the right boot of Leroy San\u00e9, and is thumped straight into Moutinho, who was closing him down. 5 mins: Describing Boly sending a limp header from a long throw looping six yards wide of goal an \u201copportunity for Wolves\u201d is inexplicably positive. 4 mins: Now City have a goal kick. The game can only improve from here. 4 mins: And now two more throw-ins. They are not hurrying to take them, either. 3 mins: So far Manchester City have hardly had a kick, and when they have touched the ball they\u2019ve put it straight out of play. Wolves have thus had two goal kicks and a throw-in. 1 min: And they\u2019re away! Jota gets the ball rolling for Wolves. Do your own body language interpretation: And they\u2019re out! Handshakes have just been completed, and kick-off is but moments away. The players are in the tunnel! \u201cThat Man City bench though. Is quite intimidating,\u201d writes Ian Copestake. \u201cOne realises what an amazing feat it is to even have a semblance of a title race.\u201d Ag\u00fcero and De Bruyne, that\u2019s basically cheating. Pep Guardiola talks, first about his player\u2019s mindset: The mindset was good for 16, 17 months. We don\u2019t have complaints about that. The players don\u2019t have to feel bad because they were outstanding for many, many months. All we can do is try to do our job. We cannot be involved in Liverpool\u2019s games, only when we play each other. Focus on what we have to do, try to do our game. The opponents are good, they have a lot of points, and if you want to have a chance to compete with them until the end we have to win points. And on Wolves: They are doing incredible so far. Newly promoted and a lot of points and they are already in the comfortable zone and playing good football. They are a strong team on set-pieces, they\u2019re so fast in front, they have a lot of quality in the middle. We know that. \u201cHugely irritated by the brainless use of both landscape and portrait for the Wolves players photos,\u201d says David Young. \u201cReal blight on the game.\u201d It\u2019s not a one-off, either: Nuno Espirito Santo has a chat, about whether his players are looking forward to tonight\u2019s match: They are always looking forward to big challenges, and today no doubt about it it\u2019s a big, big challenge. [Our record against the top teams] helps the work, it helps the belief, the confidence, the process of building a team ready to compete. All the matches in the Premier League are very hard and our approach is always the same. We will play against a fantastic team. What, he\u2019s asked, does his team need to do right tonight: The basics in football: to be organised, disciplined and play the game. Dressing-room watch: I do like the photographs stuck above each player\u2019s kit cubbyhole here, just in case the name and number isn\u2019t enough of a clue for them. The teams are in! And here they are: Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Laporte, Danilo, Bernardo Silva, Fernandinho, Silva, Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Sane. Subs: Gundogan, Aguero, De Bruyne, Delph, Mahrez, Otamendi, Muric. Wolverhampton Wanderers: Rui Patricio, Bennett, Coady, Boly, Doherty, Dendoncker, Neves, Jonny, Joao Moutinho, Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Ivan Cavaleiro, Helder Costa, Gibbs-White, John Ruddy, Saiss, Ruben Vinagre, Traore. Referee: Craig Pawson. Hello world! So the first thing to point out, which you might not have noticed during another weekend packed with, you know, hours and minutes and the kind of distractions that those things often bring, is that Liverpool won again. Their lead over Manchester City at the top of the table is currently seven points, with Tottenham nine points off the pace, Chelsea 10 points away and Arsenal and Manchester United 16 point behind and more likely to be renamed after Hogwarts houses and forced to play in deely boppers than they are to be crowned champions of England this year. But City have a game - this game - in hand. Win it and they shave Liverpool\u2019s lead to four points. Lose it and they don\u2019t. Wolves are 11th in the league and thus the calibre of opposition that Pep Guardiola\u2019s side can be expected to routinely swat aside, but it might not be so straightforward.

The EastEnders actor made the discovery while filming Danny Dyer\u2019s Right Royal Family, which airs on 23 January on BBC One. Among other revelations, the actor is told that his 26th great-grandfather is the French King Louis IX, a devout religious leader who died in 1270 and was later canonised as Saint Louis. Dr Emily Guerry, a medieval historian, told Dyer that his distant ancestor at one point wore the robes of a humble monk to lead a procession through Paris honouring the arrival of a religious relic purported to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ at his crucifixion. To commemorate his ancestor\u2019s actions, Dyer recreated the walk through the French capital barefoot.

      "body": "<p>If there is one thing that Liverpool should know, squatting defiantly at the top of the Premier League, it is that Manchester City have no intention of seeing another team remove the championship trophy from their possession. Pep Guardiola\u2019s team made that clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">when Liverpool came here two Thursdays ago</a> and, in their latest victory, it quickly became clear the reigning champions are quite happy playing this game of catch-up \u2013 for now, at least.</p> <p>By the time they were finished the gap at the top had come back down to four points, Gabriel Jesus had fully justified Guardiola\u2019s decision to keep him in the starting lineup and the goalkeeper, Ederson, had been impudent enough to stroll out of City\u2019s penalty area and nonchalantly start to stroke around the ball in midfield. The crowd loved those moments and, briefly, it did seem to cross Ederson\u2019s mind that he might continue those little one-twos even further upfield and join everybody else in the hunt for more goals. Do not bet against it happening at some point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jan/14/manchester-city-v-wolves-premier-league-live\">Manchester City v Wolves: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only surprise, perhaps, was that City did not do more to enhance their goal difference \u2013 now plus-42 compared with Liverpool\u2019s plus-40 \u2013 once Jesus had scored twice in the first half, either side of Willy Boly\u2019s red card for a studs-to-ankle challenge on Bernardo Silva. Two ahead against 10 men, City coasted through the second half but restricted themselves to only one more goal, courtesy of the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, inadvertently turning a deflected cross into his own net.</p> <p>To say it was comfortable would be an understatement and, in the process, City kept up their record of having scored at least twice in every home game this season. Their next goal will be their 100th in all competitions in 2018-19 and it is another measure of their firepower that they could win so convincingly on a night when Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kevin de Bruyne were restricted to substitute roles.</p> <p>At the same time it is also fair to say Wolves were obliging opponents for a side with City\u2019s needs. Boly did at least apologise to Silva and, in days gone by, the defender would probably have had a reasonable defence that he took the ball first. Unfortunately for Boly, he ought to have realised that is no mitigation in modern football when the follow-through involves studs connecting with a player\u2019s ankle. City were already leading at that point and the Frenchman\u2019s red card meant the night swiftly became an exercise in damage limitation for the away side.</p> <p>Jesus had opened the scoring with a close-range finish from Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s low delivery, a goal that originated from a beautifully weighted pass forward by Aymeric Laporte, and when the Brazilian doubled the lead with a penalty six minutes before half-time it meant he had accumulated seven goals in eight days.</p> <p>Did Ryan Bennett make enough contact on Raheem Sterling to warrant the decision? Sterling was travelling at speed, darting past Bennett and Coady, and he does occasionally tend to make the most of any form of contact inside the penalty area. Yet it was a clumsy effort from Bennett, who missed the ball, and ultimately Sterling was too quick for him. Jesus came forward, stuttering his run-up and sidefooted his kick past Rui Patr\u00edcio in the Wolves goal.</p> <p>Boly\u2019s early departure meant Leander Dendoncker moving into a more defensive role and the visitors switching to a 5-2-2 system with little hope but to defend robustly and try to catch their opponents on the break.

      "bodyText": "If there is one thing that Liverpool should know, squatting defiantly at the top of the Premier League, it is that Manchester City have no intention of seeing another team remove the championship trophy from their possession. Pep Guardiola\u2019s team made that clear when Liverpool came here two Thursdays ago and, in their latest victory, it quickly became clear the reigning champions are quite happy playing this game of catch-up \u2013 for now, at least. By the time they were finished the gap at the top had come back down to four points, Gabriel Jesus had fully justified Guardiola\u2019s decision to keep him in the starting lineup and the goalkeeper, Ederson, had been impudent enough to stroll out of City\u2019s penalty area and nonchalantly start to stroke around the ball in midfield. The crowd loved those moments and, briefly, it did seem to cross Ederson\u2019s mind that he might continue those little one-twos even further upfield and join everybody else in the hunt for more goals. Do not bet against it happening at some point. The only surprise, perhaps, was that City did not do more to enhance their goal difference \u2013 now plus-42 compared with Liverpool\u2019s plus-40 \u2013 once Jesus had scored twice in the first half, either side of Willy Boly\u2019s red card for a studs-to-ankle challenge on Bernardo Silva. Two ahead against 10 men, City coasted through the second half but restricted themselves to only one more goal, courtesy of the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, inadvertently turning a deflected cross into his own net. To say it was comfortable would be an understatement and, in the process, City kept up their record of having scored at least twice in every home game this season. Their next goal will be their 100th in all competitions in 2018-19 and it is another measure of their firepower that they could win so convincingly on a night when Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kevin de Bruyne were restricted to substitute roles. At the same time it is also fair to say Wolves were obliging opponents for a side with City\u2019s needs. Boly did at least apologise to Silva and, in days gone by, the defender would probably have had a reasonable defence that he took the ball first. Unfortunately for Boly, he ought to have realised that is no mitigation in modern football when the follow-through involves studs connecting with a player\u2019s ankle. City were already leading at that point and the Frenchman\u2019s red card meant the night swiftly became an exercise in damage limitation for the away side. Jesus had opened the scoring with a close-range finish from Leroy San\u00e9\u2019s low delivery, a goal that originated from a beautifully weighted pass forward by Aymeric Laporte, and when the Brazilian doubled the lead with a penalty six minutes before half-time it meant he had accumulated seven goals in eight days. Did Ryan Bennett make enough contact on Raheem Sterling to warrant the decision? Sterling was travelling at speed, darting past Bennett and Coady, and he does occasionally tend to make the most of any form of contact inside the penalty area. Yet it was a clumsy effort from Bennett, who missed the ball, and ultimately Sterling was too quick for him. Jesus came forward, stuttering his run-up and sidefooted his kick past Rui Patr\u00edcio in the Wolves goal. Boly\u2019s early departure meant Leander Dendoncker moving into a more defensive role and the visitors switching to a 5-2-2 system with little hope but to defend robustly and try to catch their opponents on the break. Truthfully, however, a side with 10 men was bound to be vulnerable against City\u2019s pass-them-to-death approach. City have not been defeated by a promoted side in 35 attempts, going back to February 2007 against Reading, and Wolves have not won here in the top division since December 1979. At least the Wolves fans had not lost their sense of humour, greeting every touch with \u201col\u00e9s\u201d during one passage early in the second half when the 10 men reminded themselves what it was like to keep the ball for a couple of minutes. No longer than that, mind. City soon had it back and set about re-establishing their superiority, keeping their first clean sheet in 10 league fixtures. Instead Wolves had to repel a City side for whom San\u00e9 was excellent, Ederson was rarely troubled and David Silva established himself as the club\u2019s highest appearance-maker in the Premier League era.

The warning echoes concerns of the Law Council of Australia about a bill likely to be a top Coalition priority in 2019, given Scott Morrison has nominated national security as the most important unfinished business before the federal election. In November, the government proposed to give the home affairs minister the power to strip Australian citizenship from people convicted of any terrorism offence, removing the current requirement that they must also have been sentenced to at least six years in prison. The standard for stripping a dual citizen of Australian citizenship would also be lowered, so the minister would only need to be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d that a person would have another citizenship. The change would increase the chances the minister might strip citizenship from a person who was not in fact a dual national or in circumstances where their foreign citizenship was disputed, as occurred in the case of 27-year-old Isis fighter Neil Prakash who was disowned by both Australia and Fiji. On Monday, Bill Shorten labelled the revocation of Prakash\u2019s citizenship a \u201csummer stunt\u201d. Shorten told reporters in Jabiru that he did not want Prakash back in Australia. But he accused the government of \u201cfluffing the legal procedures\u201d by not \u201c[squaring] it off with the Fijian government\u201d. In its submission to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, the AHRC urged parliament to block the bill because it was not a \u201creasonable, necessary and proportionate\u201d limitation on human rights. The AHRC warned the minister could be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d a person had a foreign citizenship and nevertheless be \u201cmistaken about that fact\u201d \u2013 rendering the person stateless. The new bill would prevent a person stripped of citizenship from applying to a court to prove they did not hold a foreign citizenship, allowing such a ministerial error to stand because merits review to the administrative appeals tribunal is also banned. The AHRC said this \u201craises a serious risk of conflict\u201d with the statelessness convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that \u201cno one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality\u201d. The AHRC said the power to strip Australian citizenship should be reserved for \u201cthe most exceptional circumstances, where the gravest criminal conduct also repudiates one\u2019s allegiance to Australia\u201d, arguing the bill\u2019s stated purpose of upholding the integrity of Australian citizenship was \u201ctoo general or vague\u201d. In a separate submission, George Williams, dean of the University of New South Wales law school, and senior research associate Sangeetha Pillai argued that \u201cminor convictions\u201d could trigger loss of citizenship. These included donating money to an overseas organisation reckless as to whether it was a terrorist organisation or entering an overseas conflict zone designated a no-go area even if the person did so without any intent to cause harm. The AHRC noted the new citizenship stripping powers would apply to offences committed after 12 December 2005. It said this \u201cin effect\u201d imposed a heavier penalty for criminal conduct than existed at the time of the offence, and noted that people stripped of citizenship would likely be held in immigration detention unless and until they were deported, an \u201cextremely severe\u201d consequence. The AHRC warned that children as young as 10 could have their Australian citizenship stripped, and stripping citizenship from parents might cause children to lose theirs too. Williams and Pillai argued that citizenship removal was of \u201cminimal utility as a national security device\u201d. Both submissions noted that national security is already protected by a regime of executive control orders and preventative detention orders. The committee is due to hold a public hearing on 30 January.",

It is therefore my judgment that the current draft withdrawal agreement now represents the only politically practicable and available means of securing our exit from the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8314039e99d5b74238144819532aa24a0f4c5f6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8314039e99d5b74238144819532aa24a0f4c5f6/0_16_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3ca833e4b0649df24d143b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-14T15:18:30.594Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from ITV\u2019s<strong> Paul Brand.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1084817352028491776\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Understand Brexiters holding out for another five potential resignations from the junior ranks of government today/tomorrow.</p>\u2014 Paul Brand (@PaulBrandITV) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1084817352028491776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3ca6a5e4b0e86a868276f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-14T15:14:28.496Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mel Stride,</strong> the Treasury minister, has been photographed coming out of a cabinet committee meeting with a note saying, in large handwriting, \u201cNo food\u201d and \u201cNo channel tunnel\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The Twitter consensus is that he\u2019s winding us up ...</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PoliticalPics/status/1084827663146119170\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mel Stride Financial sec to treasury paymaster gen leaving this afternoons brexit cabinet meeting showing some disturbing facts !!!!

For her to effectively concede that parliament would block a no-deal Brexit (which is the implication of the briefing, although the direct quotes from her on this point have not yet been released) is significant.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She will say MPs have a duty to honour the referendum result, citing Welsh devolution as an example of how even narrow referendum wins must be honoured</strong>. She will say:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In June 2016, the British people were asked by MPs to take a decision: should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or should it leave?</p> \n   <p>In that campaign, both sides disagreed on many things, but on one thing they were united: what the British people decided, the politicians would implement.</p> \n   <p>In the run-up to the vote, the government sent a leaflet to every household making the case for remain. It stated very clearly: \u2018This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.\u2019</p> \n   <p>Those were the terms on which people cast their votes. If a majority had backed remain, the UK would have continued as an EU member state.</p> \n   <p>No doubt the disagreements would have continued too, but the vast majority of people would have had no truck with an argument that we should leave the EU in spite of a vote to remain or that we should return to the question in another referendum. </p> \n   <p>On the rare occasions when parliament puts a question to the British people directly we have always understood that their response carries a profound significance.</p> \n   <p>When the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3%, on a turnout of just over 50%, to endorse the creation of the Welsh assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned ...</p> \n   <p>Imagine if an anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people of Scotland or Wales that despite voting in favour of a devolved legislature, parliament knew better and would over-rule them.

It is not just that this is an issue that has polarised the country, and split both main parties (although particularly the Conservatives). It is not just that parliamentary conventions are being upturned, and that one possible outcome could involve economic catastrophe (although some people say otherwise - see below). What makes this situation particularly remarkable is that no one is even pretending to be able to predict with confidence what will happen.</p> \n  <p>There is almost too much news. Here are the key developments overnight and early this morning.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/theresa-mays-brexit-deal-unlikely-to-pass-says-liam-fox\"><strong>Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, told the BBC that the government was \u201cunlikely\u201d to win the vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal tomorrow night.</strong> </a>He also said that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201csurvivable\u201d, and far preferable to cancelling Brexit, which he said would be \u201ca disaster from which we might not recover\u201d. Referring to what the Tory pro-European <strong>Dominic Grieve</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/11/brexit-latest-news-debate-commons-jeremy-hunt-claims-commons-votes-this-week-have-made-staying-in-eu-more-likely-p?page=with:block-5c38c59ae4b0cebe761847c2#block-5c38c59ae4b0cebe761847c2\">said on Friday about a no-deal Brexit, </a>Fox said:<br></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t regard no-deal as national suicide. This is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union. </p> \n   <p>We need to find ways if there is no deal, of mitigating that. But the best way to do it is to accept the deal that the prime minister has negotiated. It gives us a way of leaving the European Union with minimum friction. </p> \n   <p>I think no-deal would damage our economy - I\u2019ve been frank about that - but I think it\u2019s survivable. </p> \n   <p>I think no Brexit, politically, is a disaster from which we might not recover.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Grieve told the Today programme that Fox was wrong to dismiss his claim about a no-deal Brexit being \u201cnational suicide\u201d. Grieve said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It would be national suicide. It will lead to the break up of the UK for starters. That seems to me to be a pretty clear indication of a form of national suicide. </p> \n   <p>The economic damage which it will do to us will be immense, so that the most vulnerable in our society will be those who suffer most as a consequence. </p> \n   <p>If you are going to head to a position where you are going to have an 8% cut probably in your GDP - which is a major recession - it is those with least in our society who will suffer most. I\u2019m not prepared to see that happening.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Fox said May had been offered \u201cassurances\u201d from the EU about the backstop.</strong> They are expected to be published later today, in the form of a letter to May. Fox said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister will seek to make a statement in the House of Commons today outlining the assurances she had had from the European Union following discussions over the last few days and I hope my colleagues will listen to those and recognise the best way forward is to support the government\u2019s agreement because it delivers on the referendum result and does so in a way that minimises the risks to our economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Three Conservative former ministers have revealed details of a bill to allow the Commons liaison committee to produce a Brexit plan if May cannot get hers through the Commons.</strong> <strong>Nick Boles</strong> explained on the Today programme how the scheme, also backed by Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan, would work. They have produced a EU withdrawal number 2 bill, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This bill would do the following: it would give the government three more weeks to get a compromise deal, a plan B, through parliament so that we are leaving the EU on time on March 29 with a deal. If that failed, it would then ask the liaison committee, which is the committee of all the chairs of select committees and other parliamentary committees, it would give the liaison committee the responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal, which would have to go back to the House for a vote. If the House passed that compromise deal, then the Government would be legally required to implement whatever it was that they had.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the plan represented a \u201ccoup\u201d by MPs, Boles told Today: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a funny kind of coup which requires a majority vote of democratically-elected MPs before the tanks start rolling. So, no, it isn\u2019t a coup, it\u2019s an expression of parliamentary will.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But this morning the plan has been criticised by <strong>Sarah Wollaston</strong>, the Conservative MP who chairs the liaison committee (even though Wollaston, like Boles, Letwin and Morgan, is strongly committed to avoiding a no-deal Brexit. She posted these on Twitter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sarahwollaston/status/1084727753067450369\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Boles\u2019 plan appears to have been developed with just 2 other MPs and not discussed in advance with the Committee they propose to implement it.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now \u2013 thanks for reading it and for all the comments throughout the day. Here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s events: Theresa May urged parliament to give her deal a \u201csecond look\u201d as MPs prepare to vote tomorrow. She acknowledged it represented a compromise but warned MPs the eyes of history were upon them and characterised rejecting it as refusing to deliver the result of the referendum. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said May had failed to get the deal she wanted and said that, as she headed for a Commons defeat, the prime minister must stop trying to force MPs to vote for the deal she had settled for. Corbyn said rejection of the withdrawal agreement in parliament tomorrow, should that happen, must lead to a general election. While she insisted the government was committed to pushing through Brexit on 29 March, May refused to categorically rule out extending article 50. The government whip, Gareth Johnson, resigned because he was unable to support May\u2019s deal. Johnson said it would leave the UK \u201cperpetually constrained by the European Union\u201d. The Speaker, John Bercow, attacked the government over delays to the implementation of proxy voting in the Commons. The criticism followed news that a Labour MP was considering delaying the birth of her baby to vote tomorrow. Theresa May delivered a speech on Brexit in Stoke-on-Trent earlier in the day. You can read a fuller summary of that here. And my colleagues Heather Stewart, Jessica Elgot and Dan Sabbagh, have the full story as May appears to be heading for a crushing defeat over her Brexit deal: My colleague, Jessica Elgot, has a little more detail on those suggestions emanating from the PLP meeting tonight that a no-confidence vote might not be far off, should May\u2019s deal \u2013 as is expected \u2013 be voted down tomorrow: Barry Gardiner wraps up by saying he has been \u201cgenuinely torn apart\u201d by having to choose between leaving the EU, when that might harm the UK\u2019s economy, and backing a second referendum, when that may be seen as patronising the electorate. He says the Labour party\u2019s policy is to push through Brexit while protecting the existing rights and standards the country currently enjoys. He says the government should back the same and urges MPs to reject May\u2019s deal. The BBC\u2019s Iain Watson has a little more detail on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s discussions with the parliamentary Labour party this evening: The prime minister has concluded her meeting with the Tory backbench 1922 Committee. My colleague, Dan Sabbagh, has this: And this comes from City AM\u2019s Owen Bennett: Addressing his MPs this evening, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has signalled his belief that, as many expect, Theresa May has fallen short of the necessary support for her deal to get it through parliament. And he reiterated that Labour would see that as grounds for her to call a general election. Theresa May\u2019s deal is a bad deal for our country. It fails to meet the needs of millions of our constituents facing deep insecurity and stress from a lack of good jobs, inadequate housing and chronic under-investment in their communities and futures. Theresa May has attempted to blackmail Labour MPs to vote for her botched deal by threatening the country with the chaos of no deal. I know from conversations with colleagues that this has failed. The Labour party will not be held to ransom. When the prime minister\u2019s deal is defeated, she will only have herself to blame. She has spent two years negotiating with her cabinet and her bickering backbenchers instead of the EU, shutting out trade unions, businesses and parliament from the process. The Tory party\u2019s botched deal will be rejected by parliament. We will then need an election to have the chance to vote for a government that can bring our people together and address the deep-seated issues facing our country. The shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, is responding to the Fox\u2019s defence of May\u2019s deal by saying the Leave vote was driven in part by falling living standards that, while they were in no way caused by the EU, took place during the UK\u2019s membership of the bloc. He says the vote was a cri de c\u0153ur and that the EU \u201cdid not present itself as a champion of the voiceless\u201d. In response, he says Theresa May tried to appease her hard Brexit-supporting backbenchers, rather than unite the country. As MPs go ahead with the fourth day of debate on Theresa May\u2019s deal, my colleague Peter Walker has put together this \u2018what happens next?\u2019 guide: While this debate is going on, the leaders of the two largest parties are meeting their backbenchers. According to various Westminster-based correspondents, Theresa May has just arrived at the 1922 Committee, where she was welcomed with cheering and banging of desks. We\u2019ll have more information from those soon. Fox has described the referendum as a \u201ccontract\u201d with the British people that needed to be honoured. For parliament to attempt in any way to thwart or block Brexit by any means would be an act of vanity and self indulgence that would create a breach of trust between parliament and the people, with potentially unknowable consequences. Eighty per cent of the members of this house were elected on manifesto that said they would honour the result of the referendum and we have a duty to do so if we are to keep faith with our voters. He was asked by the Labour MP Lucy Powell what progress he had made on the \u201cdozens of trade deals\u201d he claimed were awaiting sign-off after Brexit. Fox responded: That process is going to the point where we are likely to be signing some of those agreements in the very near future, at which point we will put them to the House of Commons. Fox is reiterating that the government\u2019s view is that there are only three options: May\u2019s deal, no deal or no Brexit. And he insists that, while the government will prepare for no deal, it does not want that outcome. Fox also tells MPs he \u201cshares many of the reservations\u201d they have about the backstop arrangement. But I believe they the construction of the backstop and the relationship that is set out in the political declaration means that the risk of getting to that backstop is much less than I fear the risk is of not being able to achieve Brexit. And, for me, that\u2019s been one of the key political balances. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is opening the EU withdrawal agreement debate after the Speaker, John Bercow, issued a stinging rebuke to the government, telling MPs: I have no intention of taking lectures in doing right by parliament from people who have been conspicuous in denial of and, sometimes, contempt for it. I will stand up for the rights of the House of Commons and I will not be pushed around by agents of the executive branch. Bercow had been asked by the Conservative MP Matt Warman about his decision to allow a debate on an amendment proposed by the Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve last week. The May statement is over. A succession of Conservative MPs are now asking points of order inspired by the Sunday Times splash yesterday, suggesting that anti-Brexit MPs are plotting to change the parliamentary rules to allow motions proposed by backbenchers to take precedence over government business. John Bercow, the Speaker, is also being asked about reports suggesting that he conspired with Dominic Grieve ahead of the controversial procedural vote last week that will speed up any possible Commons vote on a Brexit plan B. Bercow is broadly dismissing the reports, saying that the parliamentary rules on procedure are clear and that he is not involved in any plan to change them. With regard to the meeting with Grieve, he says he meets MPs all the time. That is all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s statement to MPs. And here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response to her. Labour\u2019s Mike Gapes says in the UK system no parliament can bind its successor. It was not this parliaement that promised to implement the referendum result, but the last one. May says Gapes may not have noticed, but the Conservatives are in power. They will implement Brexit. Bill Wiggin, a Conservative, asks May if she can assure him that she will continue to carry on with \u201cBritish grit\u201d if she loses the vote tomorrow. May says she will carry on with determination. I\u2019m afraid comments will need to close at 6pm, because we are short of moderators tonight. I\u2019m sorry about that. Here is some comment on the May statement. From CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett From the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh Chris Bryant, the Labour MP, says No 10 is indicating that it will support amendments to the motion tabled by Hugo Swire and Andrew Murrison. Yet the government used to argue (ie, here - pdf) that, if the motion were amended, then that might stop the government ratifying the withdrawal agreement. So why has the government changed its mind? May says MPs still do not know what amendments will get called tomorrow. But if the government does support those amendments, it will be to give MPs more confidence about supporting the deal, she says. She says they would not impact on the ratification of the treaty. Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative, asks May to confirm that leaving the EU with no deal would not be the end of the world. May says it would be difficult, but the UK could recover from a no-deal Brexit. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business committee, asks May to rule out a no-deal Brexit. May says it is very simple: either you have a deal, her deal, the one on the table, or you have no deal. John Baron, a Conservative, asks what assurances there are that the EU would not drag out the trade talks for years. May says that would not be good for the EU. If the UK were stuck in the backstop, it would have tariff-free access to the single market, without having to pay any money or grant access to its fishing waters. Luciana Berger, the Labour MP, asks why it was acceptable for May to vote against the Welsh assembly, after people voted for it in a referendum, when she is now saying the Brexit referendum result must be accepted. May says parliament was clear; the referendum result must be accepted. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory chair of the European Research Group, says the EU will not agree an end date for the backstop. Does that make May doubt their sincerity when they say they don\u2019t really want it? May says the EU has been clear about not wanting the backstop Sir Desmond Swayne, the Tory Brexiter, says that to guarantee Brexit, she should prorogue parliament until April. \u201cTempting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d May jokes that it is tempting. Kate Hoey, the Labour Brexiter, asks May to state categorically that the UK will be leaving on 29 March. May says the UK will be leaving then. Greg Hands, the Tory former minister, says EU officials think the deal is a great deal for them. Matin Selmayr, the secretary general of the European commission, has said it will show that leaving the EU does not work. May says she thinks the deal is a good one for the UK. Labour\u2019s Chris Leslie says May is asking MPs to trust her. Anything could happen in the next two years. Who will be her successor who will conclude the negotiations on the next stage after two years. May says the EU cannot start trade talks with the UK until it has left. She ignores the question about her successor. Mark Francois, a Tory Brexiter, says the withdrawal agreement will be an international agreement that will outrank any UK legislation. He asks May to confirm that the Tusk/Juncker letter does not over-rule the treaty. It is a small figleaf. May says the assurances have standing in international law. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman says MPs need more time. Why can\u2019t they have it? May says by 29 March it will be almost three years since the referendum. MPs voted overwhelmingly for article 50, which set the date for Brexit. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says May has worsened divisions by not consulting and by delaying votes. She asks May to confirm she has not ruled out delaying article 50. May says she is clear the UK will leave the EU on 29 March. That is in legislation, she says. David Jones, a Tory Brexiter, says the Tusk/Juncker letter could make MPs even more likely to vote against the deal. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says May said this morning MPs should honour the result of the Brexit referendum, even though she voted against setting up the Welsh assembly and subsequently fought an election on a manifesto suggesting it could be abolished. Why should MPs listen to her on Brexit? May says the Conservatives accepted the result of the referendum on Welsh devolution. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, said it is clear the EU will not offer the UK any further help. He invites May to commit to reaching out across the Commons to find a solution if her deal is voted down. And she should seek an extension of article 50, he says. May says she is reaching out to MPs. She has been meeting Labour MPs, she says. Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, asks why young people who could not vote in the 2016 referendum should not have a say on Brexit now. They are the people who will bear the brunt of it, she says. May says the government said it would accept the referendum decision. Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, asks what meetings May has had with experts who can show how technical solutions can address the Irish border issue. May says the plans that Paterson brought her on this (an ERG plan - available here) would not fully avoid the need for controls at the border. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, says the government is a servant of the Commons. If May loses the vote, she would let the Commons have its say. May says the government is a servant of the people. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, asks May to confirm that she will \u201cnever\u201d extend article 50. May says the government\u2019s intention is to leave the EU on 29 March. She says some people want to stop that. But the government is firm in its intention, she says. She says \u201cit remains the commitment of this government to leave the European Union on 29 March.\u201d May again refuses to categorically rule out extending article 50. In response to Blackford, May says, if the SNP believe in listening to the people, they would drop support for Scottish independence. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, is speaking now. Is that it, he asks. He says May has failed to achieve what she set out to achieve. The voices of the people of Scotland are being ignored, he says. \u201cThis is a defining moment,\u201d he says. Why is the PM continuing to ignore Scotland? He urges May to extend article 50 and \u201clet the people decide\u201d. Here is the final passage from Theresa May\u2019s opening statement - her \u201chand of history\u201d peroration. (Or not - it wasn\u2019t exactly Churchill.) So I say to Members on all sides of this House \u2013 whatever you may have previously concluded \u2013 over these next 24 hours, give this deal a second look. No it is not perfect. And yes it is a compromise. But when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this House tomorrow and ask: Did we deliver on the country\u2019s vote to leave the European Union? Did we safeguard our economy, our security and our Union? Or did we let the British people down? I say we should deliver for the British people and get on with building a brighter future for our country by backing this deal tomorrow. May is responding to Corbyn. She says Corbyn\u2019s call for a general election shows he is just playing politics. Yesterday, when asked what he would say on Brexit in an election campaign, he refused five times to say, she says. Jeremy Corbyn is responding to May. He says May has failed to get the legal assurances she promised. The Tusk/Juncker letter contains nothing more than warm words. He says the attorney general\u2019s advice showed the UK could be locked into the backstop. By the end of 2020, under May\u2019s plan the UK will have to extend the transition, or enter a backstop that could last indefinitely. He says Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has said that today\u2019s Tusk/Juncker letter dos not alter his earlier assessment. (See 3.41pm.) He says May must no longer run down the clock. She should stop trying to scare people into voting for the deal. What MPs are voting on this week is the same deal MPs should have voted on in December. May should be reaching out to MPs, he says. But May is claiming that MPs who don\u2019t support her are undermining faith in democracy. The person who is undermining democracy is May herself, he says. He says May is facing a \u201chumiliating defeat\u201d. She will only have herself to blame, he says. He says there is a deal that could command support in the Commons - staying in the customs union, and maintaining EU standards. He says the government\u2019s handling of the talks has been \u201cshambolic\u201d. We are now on our third Brexit secretary, and they have all been sidelined, he says. He says the government is in disarray. If the government\u2019s deal is rejected tomorrow, it is time for a general election and a new government. May says MPs should \u201cgive this deal a second look\u201d, whatever they have previously concluded. \u201cYes, it is a compromise,\u201d he says. When the history books are written, people will ask if MPs delivered on the will of the British people, and if they secured the country\u2019s economy, security and union. May admits the EU would not agree to put a time limit on the backstop. Any attempt to reopen the negotiation would lead to other EU states seeking changes that would favour them, she says. May says the backstop would involve the EU relying on the UK to police its own market. This would be unprecedented, she says. She says that is why the EU does not want it. May says the EU has said that the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration come together. Although the political declaration is not legally binding in the way the withdrawal agreement is, the EU has insisted they come \u201cas a package\u201d. May says the EU has said that it does not see the backstop as the only mechanism that would avoid a hard border in Ireland. May says, if MPs agree the deal tomorrow, the UK and the EU will have almost two years to negotiate the final trade deal (because the EU has offered to open talks before 29 March). May says she has been clear that the UK would never allow any return to a hard border in Ireland. But it is not enough to say this, she says. She says the government must ensure that happens. That is why the backstop is in place. Theresa May is now making a statement to MPs about the assurances received today from Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president. Their letter to her is here. Here is a summary of the speech she gave this morning, where she explained what she thought the significant new elements in the letter were. And here is the attorney general\u2019s assessment of its significance. It has been rather overshadowed by everything else, but in his Today programme interview this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the fact that parliament is now flexing its muscles and trying to take control of the Brexit process. He explained: I actually think this is most probably parliament at its best. Individual MPs are behaving properly. They are listening to their constituents, they are exercising their own judgement about the interest of their constituency and the interests of the country. And they are coming to decisions based upon, not party advantage, not individual career moves, but actually on what is best for the people they represent. I think, far from parliament being at its worst, as some people have accused it, I actually think this is parliament at its best. It is forcing the executive, it is forcing the government, to actually not take parliament for granted anymore. It is redressing some of the imbalance between the executive and Parliament that has built up over decades. Many parliamentarians would agree, although whether McDonnell will feel the same way if Labour wins an election and at that point the legislature starts defying the executive remains to be seen ... In an article for the Guardian, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says that historical precedent dictates that, if Theresa May loses the Brexit vote tomorrow, she should call a general election. Here is an extract. In this week in 1910, the British electorate went to the polls. They did so because Herbert Asquith\u2019s Liberal government had been unable to get Lloyd George\u2019s famous People\u2019s Budget through the House of Lords. Liberal posters defined the election as a choice between the peers and the people. They finally got their way after a second election that December. So twice that year, and a number of other times, governments who could not get their flagship legislation through parliament, or who otherwise found their authority in the House of Commons exhausted, have been obliged to go to the country to seek a new mandate. For Earl Grey in 1832, it was electoral reform. For Gladstone in 1886, it was Irish Home Rule. And for Clement Attlee in 1951 and Ted Heath in 1974, it was a last throw of the dice when facing parliamentary stagnation and national crisis ... Theresa May said last week that our country would be in \u201cunchartered territory\u201d when MPs vote down her deal tomorrow. She is wrong. This is territory numerous previous prime ministers have walked through before. She has a constitutional obligation to follow the only course of action titans like Gladstone and Attlee felt was practically and honourably open to them when their parliamentary authority fell away. The prime minister must call an election. Anything else would not be stoicism or stubbornness, or whatever other qualities her admirers claim; it would just be sheer cowardice. And here is the full article. Conservative MPs have been told that Theresa May will address the party\u2019s backbench 1922 committee at 7pm, after her statement to the Commons. And Jeremy Corbyn will be addressing the parliamentary Labour party meeting tonight too. As Kate Proctor reports in today\u2019s Evening Standard, the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq is planning to delay the birth of her baby by caesarean section so that she can be in the chamber tomorrow to vote on Brexit. According to the Standard, Siddiq expects to be the lobby in a wheelchair by her husband Chris. In the Commons just now Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, raised this as a point of order. And, in response, John Bercow, the speaker, condemned the government for delaying the introduction of proxy voting for female MPs on maternity leave. He said that it was \u201cuncivilised\u201d for someone like Siddiq to have to be pushed through the lobby in a wheelchair and that the Commons had already twice in principle agreed in principle that proxy voting should be introduce. The first debate was around year ago, he said. But still nothing has happened, he said. He said this was \u201cfrankly lamentable\u201d and \u201cvery disadvantageous and injurious to the reputation of this House\u201d. If the government wanted to change Commons procedures to allow proxy voting, it could do so, he said. He implied that \u201creactionary forces\u201d within government were dragging their feet because they were opposed to reform and he said he very much regretted this. Bercow said he would like the situation resolved before tomorrow and that he would do what he could to help. Anyone who thought that, after last week\u2019s row about Bercow effectively rewriting Commons procedural rules, he might lose his appetite for taking on the parliamentary establishment will be disappointed. Instead his appetite for confrontation seems to be growing ... Remember the days when the government used to say that it never revealed the legal advice it received from the attorney general? Well, now ministers seem to be publishing it proactively, before the opposition has even had time to say \u201chumble address\u201d. The Department for Exiting the European Union has published on its website the text of a letter (pdf), written today, from Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to Theresa May assessing the significance of the Tusk/Juncker related about the Brexit deal sent earlier today. Here is an extract. Cox said: I agree that in the light of [the Tusk/Juncker letter], the council\u2019s conclusions of 13 December would have legal force in international law and thus be relevant and cognisable in the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement, and in particular the Northern Ireland protocol [ie, the backstop], albeit they do not alter the fundamental meanings of its provisions as I advised them to be on 13 November 2018 ... It is my opinion, based on the factors set out in my letter of 13 November 2018, reinforced by the joint response [the Tusk/Juncker letter], that the balance of risks favours the conclusion that it is unlikely that the EU will wish to rely on the implementation of the backstop provisions. It is therefore my judgment that the current draft withdrawal agreement now represents the only politically practicable and available means of securing our exit from the European Union. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Mel Stride, the Treasury minister, has been photographed coming out of a cabinet committee meeting with a note saying, in large handwriting, \u201cNo food\u201d and \u201cNo channel tunnel\u201d. The Twitter consensus is that he\u2019s winding us up ... Theresa May will neither back nor reject the Andrew Murrison amendment to her Brexit motion (see 9.33am) saying the deal should be agreed \u201csubject to a legal codicil being added to the withdrawal agreement treaty which specifies that the backstop solution shall expire on 31 December 2022\u201d, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. The Times\u2019 Sam Coates says some government aides are encouraging Tory MPs to support it. On the World at One Sir Edward Leigh, the Conservative Brexiter, said he would be backing Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal because he was worried about what might happen if she lost. He explained: What worries me is that if she (the PM) loses by over 100 the EU might offer her nothing and the remainers might take control completely. He also denied that his decision to vote for the deal had anything to do with the fact that he was recently appointed a privy counsellor. He said the honour was awarded in recognition of his service as chair of the public accounts committee (between 2001 and 2010) and that it was originally proposed some time ago. In his LBC phone-in this morning Boris Johnson, the Brexiter foreign secretary, suggested that he knows more about car manufacturing that the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) chief executive Ralf Speth. Johnson dismissed claims that recent job losses at JLR were related to Brexit. When it was put to him that Speth said otherwise, and that Speth knew more about the car industry than he did, Johnson replied: Well actually, it\u2019s an interesting point. I\u2019m not certain he does, by the way. Johnson then cited a conversation he had with Speth when he was London mayor on the future of electric vehicles (EVs). He went on: I mean, I do not claim superior knowledge of every aspect of car manufacturing, okay. But, I simply said that I thought that EVs, electric vehicles, did represent the future, that we should be going down that road. And he said, \u2018no, no, no, diesel is great, and we will stick with this\u2019. And I\u2019m afraid, I hesitate to say this, but I think events have vindicated me on that point rather than him. According to my colleague Heather Stewart, the Labour MP Hilary Benn is coming under pressure to withdraw his amendment to the Brexit motion. On the Today programme this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, made it clear that he did not like the amendment because it could stop MPs having a \u201cstraight vote\u201d on Theresa May\u2019s deal. (See 9.33am.) Theresa May has come under further criticism from Welsh politicians over the claim, now retracted (see 10.25am and 12.39pm) that her party immediately accepted the result of the Welsh devolution referendum. This is from Mark Drakeford, the Labour Welsh first minister. One of the prime minister\u2019s earliest actions as an MP was to vote against the formation of the national assembly. Despite the majority vote in favour of Welsh devolution, the Conservative manifesto as late as 2005 committed the party to a second referendum on the matter. The then-first minister Rhodri Morgan reacted to the closeness of the result by reaching out to those opposed to the creation of the national assembly and worked to establish its legitimacy in their eyes. The success of that approach by Rhodri Morgan and Carwyn Jones was borne out in the emphatic majority to extend the National Assembly\u2019s powers in 2011. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more different approach to that taken by Mrs May towards the EU referendum. And this is from the Plaid Cymru leader at Wesminster, Liz Saville Roberts. The prime minister\u2019s Brexit desperation has led to her either having a selective memory, [to] deploy wilful hypocrisy or simply lie about the referendum on Welsh devolution. The Conservative party campaigned against devolution and then promised a second referendum six years after it was established. The prime minister herself voted against the legislation which created the national assembly for Wales, after the referendum. Unlike the unicorns of the Brexit referendum, the 1997 devolution vote was a clear question, with a clear outcome and clear consequences. The only party to attack its legitimacy was her party - this is hypocrisy of the highest order. Gareth Johnson\u2019s departure takes the total number of Conservative government resignations over Brexit to 13, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says. Dominic Raab has just finished a speech that can only be described as a leadership pitch, a carefully prepared address at a Centre for Policy Studies event that will have done his credibility within the Tory party no harm. The former Brexit secretary argued that Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell had \u201ctapped a vein of public support in their accusations of crony capitalism and markets rigged by vested interests\u201d and offered a prescription for free-market competition as an alternative. The MP\u2019s big idea was that there should be asbos for business: handing the Competition and Markets Authority a power to issue anti-competitive behaviour orders \u201cagainst firms ripping off consumers, with large fines for breach\u201d. Raab is currently polling somewhere between third and fifth to become next Tory leader, according to ESRC and ConHome surveys. He may struggle to get ahead of Boris Johnson, but judging by the content of his speech, his real goal could be to become chancellor. \u201cThat\u2019s who the free market is there to serve; the student, the pensioner, the family buying foreign currency to go on a hard-earned holiday,\u201d Raab added, framing his argument in a way intended to appeal to swing voters who he believes are at risk of falling into Labour hands. Raab also confirmed that he would vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal tomorrow, arguing that \u201cthe fundamental way we can get changes in the withdrawal agreement is to vote down the current bad terms\u201d and then go back to the EU to renegotiate. But Raab said there was no need to extend article 50, however, and argued that a no deal may be the only possible outcome. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get a deal, we\u2019d leave on WTO terms even if only transitionally,\u201d he said. And he even used a line once used by Theresa May, claiming that a no deal \u201cwon\u2019t be a walk in the park, but it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world\u201d. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, does not appear to have heard of Gareth Johnson, the latest Tory to join the rebellion against Theresa May\u2019s deal. (See 1.23pm.) Another question from BTL. This is from Trundler. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most powerful ally in the union movement, has proposed exactly this. But at the moment no one in parliament actively pushing this idea (even though there have been reports that No 10 has toyed with the idea.) The obvious problem is that the government would have to legislate for a May deal v no deal Brexit referendum, and there would be a strong chance of MPs or peers amending the bill as it went through parliament to include a remain option. Gareth Johnson has resigned as a Conservative whip today because he cannot support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. He says the deal \u201cprevents us taking back control and instead could leave us perpetually constrained by the European Union\u201d. My colleague Simon Jenkins thinks that MPs who say there is a better form of Brexit available than the one set out in Theresa May\u2019s plan are lying. He explains why here. In her speech Theresa May said this about a no-deal Brexit. With no deal we would have: no implementation period, no security co-operation, no guarantees for UK citizens overseas, no certainty for businesses and workers here in Stoke and across the UK, and changes to everyday life in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our union at risk. In his press statement, the DUP leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said May should clarify what she meant. He explained: The prime minister must explain this comment. What exactly would the government be changing? If this is nothing more than scaremongering, then the prime minister should cease from such foolish talk. Indeed, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that the Republic of Ireland is not making preparations for a hard border even in the event of no deal being agreed. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Wesminster, has put out a statement saying he thinks the Tusk/Juncker letter, far from reassuring his party about the backstop, has exacerbated their concerns. He said: Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the European Union, there are no \u201clegally binding assurances\u201d as the prime minister talked about in December. In fact, there is nothing new. Nothing has changed. Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns by confirming: 1. everything the attorney general said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands; 2. there has been no change to the withdrawal agreement and: 3. Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. Instead of meaningless letters, the prime minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the withdrawal agreement. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech and Q&amp;A. The full text of the speech is here. May refused to firmly rule out extending article 50. Asked about today\u2019s Guardian report saying EU leaders now expect that article 50 will have to be extended until July, and whether she was willing to \u201ccategorically\u201d rule that out, she replied: Look, we\u2019re leaving on 29 March. I\u2019ve been clear that I don\u2019t believe we should be extending article 50 and I don\u2019t believe we should be having a second referendum. (May could have said \u201cI am clear that I don\u2019t believe etc\u201d, but instead of using the present tense, she used the present prefect, \u201cI have been etc\u201d. That might just be a tic, but sometimes it is a sign that a politician realises that a position they have adopted until now might soon have to change.) She admitted that the assurances received from the EU today about the backstop will not go far enough for some MPS. She said: I fully understand that the new legal and political assurances which are contained in the letters from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker do not go as far as some MPs would like. She admitted the EU had rejected her demand to set a fixed end date for the backstop. She said: I also pursued in these discussions [with the EU, over Christmas] a proposal for a fixed date - with legal force - guaranteeing the point at which the future partnership would come into force. Because that is the way to bring an end to the backstop \u2013 by agreeing our new relationship. The EU\u2019s position was that - while they never want or expect the backstop to come into force - a legal time limit was not possible. She claimed that she had secured \u201cvaluable new clarifications and assurances\u201d in the Tusk/Juncker letter received today. She explained: We have secured valuable new clarifications and assurances to put before the House of Commons, including on getting our future relationship in place rapidly, so that the backstop should never need to be used. We now have a commitment from the EU that work on our new relationship can begin as soon as possible after the signing of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 in advance of the 29 March \u2013 and we have an explicit commitment that this new relationship does not need to replicate the backstop in any respect whatsoever. We have agreement on a fast-track process to bring the free trade deal we will negotiate into force if there are any delays in member states ratifying it, making it even more likely that the backstop will never need to be used. We now have absolute clarity on the explicit linkage between the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, putting beyond doubt that these come as a package. And finally the EU have confirmed their acceptance that the UK can unilaterally deliver on all the commitments made in our Northern Ireland paper last week, including a Stormont lock on new EU laws being added to the backstop, and a seat at the table for a restored Northern Ireland executive. The legal standing of the significant conclusions of the December Council have been confirmed. If the backstop were ever triggered it would only be temporary and both sides would do all they could to bring it to an end as quickly as possible. The letters published today have legal force and must be used to interpret the meaning of the withdrawal agreement, including in any future arbitration. They make absolutely clear the backstop is not a threat or a trap. May retracted her false claim that the result of the referendum on Welsh devolution was accepted by both main parties. (See 10.25am.) In extracts from the speech released overnight she said: When the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3%, on a turnout of just over 50%, to endorse the creation of the Welsh assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned. After it was pointed out that the Conservative party did contest the result of the 1997 referendum, she instead said this morning: When the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3%, on a turnout of just over 50%, to endorse the creation of the Welsh assembly, that result was accepted by parliament. She said that, if MPs vote down her deal, she thought it was \u201cmore likely\u201d that Brexit would be halted than that there would be a no-deal Brexit. She said: While no deal remains a serious risk, having observed events at Westminster over the last seven days, it is now my judgment that the more likely outcome [if MPs reject her deal] is a paralysis in parliament that risks there\u202a\u202a being no Brexit. She reiterated her opposition to the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU for good (which is one of Labour\u2019s key demands). She said: I have always been clear that we will not be in the customs union, because being in the customs union has with it other aspects which are not what people voted for. She said she was committed to maintaining high standards on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards after Brexit. I could not have been clearer that far from wanting to see a reduction in our standards in these areas, the UK will instead continue to be a world leader. We have committed to addressing these concerns and will work with MPs from across the house on how best to implement them, looking at legislation where necessary to deliver the best possible results for workers across the UK. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has put out this response to the Tusk/Juncker letter. He said: The prime minister has once again failed to deliver. This is a long way from the significant and legally effective commitment the prime minister promised last month. It is a reiteration of the EU\u2019s existing position. Once again, nothing has changed. And that\u2019s it. May has finished. I will post a summary shortly. Q: The EU are willing to extend article 50 until July. Do you rule that out? May says she does not believe the government should extend article 50 or have a referendum. May refuses to firmly rule out extending article 50. Q: Do you believe you can win the vote tomorrow? May says she is working to get MPs to vote for the deal tomorrow. She wants to avoid a situation where parliament tries to frustrate Brexit. May says no one in parliament has come up with an alternative Brexit deal that is negotiable and that delivers on the result of the referendum. Q: [From the Daily Mail] Will you go further, on a customs union or anything else, to get the support of Labour MPs? May says she is opposed to being in a customs union. The UK would not be able to run an independent trade policy if it stayed in the customs union, he says. Q: [From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand] You have had two years to reach out to MPs, and now you have nothing new to offer them. Why shouldn\u2019t parliament take control? May says she has been reaching out to MPs. She does not accept she has achieved nothing. The exchange of letters does does give further assurances. She says the government must deliver on the result of the referendum. It has a duty to deliver Brexit. That is what she will do, she says. May is now taking questions Q: [From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg] Do you really think you have a chance of changing MPs\u2019 minds? May says she has been speaking to MPs over the weekend, she will make a statement this afternoon, and she will close the debate tomorrow night. She says some MPs are changing their views. These assurances should give MPs more confidence that the backstop will not be implemented, she says. May says she has today published the outcome of her discussions with the EU about her concerns about the backstop. She says the EU have said throughout they would not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. She says she pursued proposals for putting a fixed end date on the backstop. The EU said that was not possible, she says. May admits EU rejected her demand for fixed end date to backstop. But she says she has secured \u201cvaluable new assurances\u201d. She says the EU has said work on the new relationship can start before 29 March. She says the EU has agreed that the new relationship will not need to mirror the backstop. She says there is now explicit clarity that the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration will come as a package. She says the EU has agreed that the plans for the \u201cStormont lock\u201d published by the government last week (pdf) can be implemented. And the EU has said the assurances on the backstop have legal force. May explains what new assurances on backstop she has received from EU. May says, in her judgment, if MPs were to vote down her deal, the most likely result would be a paralysis in parliament would \u201crisk there being no Brexit\u201d. May says Brexit could be halted if her deal gets voted down. Theresa May is delivering her Brexit speech now. She started by making the point about the need to honour the EU referendum result, citing the Welsh referendum example contained in the advance briefing (to Number 10\u2019s embarrassment). (See 10.25am.) As expected, the letter from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, does not contain anything substantially new on the backstop. Mostly it just amplifies the assurances about the backstop only being temporary that were set out by the EU 27 in the conclusions (pdf) to their summit in December. But Tusk and Juncker do stress that they are serious about trying to find technical solutions to the border issue that would make the backstop redundant. (This is a preoccupation of Brexiters.) They say: The European commission also shares your intentions for the future relationship to be in place as quickly as possible. Given our joint commitment to using best endeavours to conclude before the end of 2020 a subsequent agreement, which supersedes the protocol [ie, the backstop] in whole or in part, the commission is determined to give priority in our work programme to the discussion of proposals that might replace the backstop with alternative arrangements. In this context, facilitative arrangements and technologies will be considered. Any arrangements which supersede the protocol are not required to replicate its provisions in any respect, provided that the underlying objectives continue to be met. The Press Association has snapped these on the Tusk/Juncker letter. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and European council president Donald Tusk have released a letter offering \u201cclarifications\u201d to the UK\u2019s withdrawal agreement, stating that Brussels \u201cdoes not wish to see the backstop enter into force\u201d and confirming its \u201cdetermination\u201d to see it replaced. The letter to Theresa May from Juncker and Tusk states that \u201cwe are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement\u201d. The government has now published an exchange of letters between Theresa May and Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, about the withdrawal agreement and the backstop. The letter from May is here (pdf). And the response from Tusk and Juncker is here (pdf). Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, told LBC this morning that any move by parliament to frustrate Brexit would be seen by voters as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d by the \u201cdeep state\u201d. Speaking about what would happen if MPs tried to stop Brexit happening, he said: I think that people will feel betrayed. And I think they will feel that there has been a great conspiracy by the deep state of the UK, the people who really run the country. He also said MPs involved in these manoeuvres were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. Asked what would happen if MPs voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal, he replied: I think the deal goes down. I think, possibly, some colleagues are being scared by this idea that there might be no Brexit as a result of voting it down. I think that\u2019s nonsense. Britain will leave in March, absolutely, and that\u2019s the bottom line. A question from Antecedent BTL. Before Christmas some people seemed to think that, if Jeremy Corbyn lost a confidence motion, he would not be able to table one for another year. That is not correct. (Someone seems to have got this muddled with the Conservative party rules for no confidence votes in the leader.) There is no limit on how many no confidence motions Corbyn can table. By convention, the government has to allow time for them to be debated. But convention also dictates that the opposition should not table them casually, and the advice from Commons officials is that, if Corbyn were to table a second one when nothing much had changed since the first vote, the government would be entitled in thinking there was no need to put it to a vote. Obviously, if, for example, the DUP, or a cohort of Tory MPs, were to declare that they had changed their position, that would justify a second vote. On the subject of Welsh devolution and Brexit, the Welsh academic Richard Wyn Jones has posted a fascinating thread on Twitter saying that there was a lesson for Theresa May to learn from what happened in Wales after 1997, but that it is not the one flagged up in her speech. (See 10.25am.) It is about the importance of \u201closers\u2019 consent\u201d. The thread starts here and it sums up what is probably the key flaw in May\u2019s approach to Brexit superbly (although whether \u201closers\u2019 consent\u201d was ever possible in the context of Brexit is debatable). And here are some of his tweets. (\u201cThey\u201d are the Labour politicians at the time pushing devolution, led by the then Welsh secretary, Ron Davies.) Downing Street released overnight some extracts from the speech Theresa May will give later this morning. Here are the highlights. May will claim that, if her Brexit deal is rejected, no Brexit would be more likely than a no-deal Brexit. According to the briefing, May will say \u201cthat, based on the evidence of the last week, she now believes that MPs blocking Brexit is a more likely outcome than leaving with no deal.\u201d This is an argument that Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was making on Friday. In the past May has at times argued that the rejection of her deal could lead to either a no-deal Brexit or to no Brexit, and at other times argued that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March regardless. For her to effectively concede that parliament would block a no-deal Brexit (which is the implication of the briefing, although the direct quotes from her on this point have not yet been released) is significant. She will say MPs have a duty to honour the referendum result, citing Welsh devolution as an example of how even narrow referendum wins must be honoured. She will say: In June 2016, the British people were asked by MPs to take a decision: should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or should it leave? In that campaign, both sides disagreed on many things, but on one thing they were united: what the British people decided, the politicians would implement. In the run-up to the vote, the government sent a leaflet to every household making the case for remain. It stated very clearly: \u2018This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.\u2019 Those were the terms on which people cast their votes. If a majority had backed remain, the UK would have continued as an EU member state. No doubt the disagreements would have continued too, but the vast majority of people would have had no truck with an argument that we should leave the EU in spite of a vote to remain or that we should return to the question in another referendum. On the rare occasions when parliament puts a question to the British people directly we have always understood that their response carries a profound significance. When the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3%, on a turnout of just over 50%, to endorse the creation of the Welsh assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned ... Imagine if an anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people of Scotland or Wales that despite voting in favour of a devolved legislature, parliament knew better and would over-rule them. Or else force them to vote again. What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote? Unfortunately for May, there is a glaring problem with the Welsh devolution analogy; the Conservatives, and May herself, did for some time refuse to accept the result. Politico Europe\u2019s Jack Blanchard sums up the full awfulness of this error in his London Playbook briefing. As history student Joe Oliver pointed out in this Twitter thread last night, the Tories argued vehemently against the creation of the assembly following the Welsh referendum. And among the hundreds of Tory MPs voting against the Government Of Wales Bill in 1997 was, erm, the newly elected member for Maidenhead, Theresa May. Indeed, as the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush points out, as late as 2005 the Tories were promising a second referendum \u2014 a People\u2019s Vote, if you will \u2014 on whether to scrap the Welsh assembly. Which is all a bit awkward for No. 10. My colleague Peter Walker has more on this gaffe here. The Labour MP Jo Stevens has accused May of \u201cutter hypocrisy\u201d. Earlier I said that, if Theresa May loses the vote tomorrow by more than 100 votes, it will be the biggest government defeat for almost 100 years. I\u2019ve taken that from this Prospect article by the academic Philip Cowley setting out various benchmarks that can be used to establish how serious tomorrow\u2019s defeat (assuming May does lose) will be. Here is an excerpt. If, as is occasionally claimed, the government is looking at a defeat of by more than 100 votes, that will be something that has only happened three times in the last hundred years. All took place during the Labour minority government of 1924, when the government suffered three defeats of 166, 161 and 140. But Labour then held under 200 seats, governed only with the tacit support of the Liberals, and knew it could suffer heavy defeat at any point. Any MP who has been in parliament for a while will have lived through the odd crisis or two, but there is no precedent in recent times for anything quite as momentous as this. It is not just that, if Theresa May loses the vote on the Brexit deal tomorrow by more than a 100 votes (a distinct possibility), that will amount to the biggest government defeat for almost 100 years. It is not just that this is an issue that has polarised the country, and split both main parties (although particularly the Conservatives). It is not just that parliamentary conventions are being upturned, and that one possible outcome could involve economic catastrophe (although some people say otherwise - see below). What makes this situation particularly remarkable is that no one is even pretending to be able to predict with confidence what will happen. There is almost too much news. Here are the key developments overnight and early this morning. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, told the BBC that the government was \u201cunlikely\u201d to win the vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal tomorrow night. He also said that a no-deal Brexit would be \u201csurvivable\u201d, and far preferable to cancelling Brexit, which he said would be \u201ca disaster from which we might not recover\u201d. Referring to what the Tory pro-European Dominic Grieve said on Friday about a no-deal Brexit, Fox said: I don\u2019t regard no-deal as national suicide. This is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union. We need to find ways if there is no deal, of mitigating that. But the best way to do it is to accept the deal that the prime minister has negotiated. It gives us a way of leaving the European Union with minimum friction. I think no-deal would damage our economy - I\u2019ve been frank about that - but I think it\u2019s survivable. I think no Brexit, politically, is a disaster from which we might not recover. But Grieve told the Today programme that Fox was wrong to dismiss his claim about a no-deal Brexit being \u201cnational suicide\u201d. Grieve said: It would be national suicide. It will lead to the break up of the UK for starters. That seems to me to be a pretty clear indication of a form of national suicide. The economic damage which it will do to us will be immense, so that the most vulnerable in our society will be those who suffer most as a consequence. If you are going to head to a position where you are going to have an 8% cut probably in your GDP - which is a major recession - it is those with least in our society who will suffer most. I\u2019m not prepared to see that happening. Fox said May had been offered \u201cassurances\u201d from the EU about the backstop. They are expected to be published later today, in the form of a letter to May. Fox said: The prime minister will seek to make a statement in the House of Commons today outlining the assurances she had had from the European Union following discussions over the last few days and I hope my colleagues will listen to those and recognise the best way forward is to support the government\u2019s agreement because it delivers on the referendum result and does so in a way that minimises the risks to our economy. Three Conservative former ministers have revealed details of a bill to allow the Commons liaison committee to produce a Brexit plan if May cannot get hers through the Commons. Nick Boles explained on the Today programme how the scheme, also backed by Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan, would work. They have produced a EU withdrawal number 2 bill, he said. He went on: This bill would do the following: it would give the government three more weeks to get a compromise deal, a plan B, through parliament so that we are leaving the EU on time on March 29 with a deal. If that failed, it would then ask the liaison committee, which is the committee of all the chairs of select committees and other parliamentary committees, it would give the liaison committee the responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal, which would have to go back to the House for a vote. If the House passed that compromise deal, then the Government would be legally required to implement whatever it was that they had. Asked if the plan represented a \u201ccoup\u201d by MPs, Boles told Today: It\u2019s a funny kind of coup which requires a majority vote of democratically-elected MPs before the tanks start rolling. So, no, it isn\u2019t a coup, it\u2019s an expression of parliamentary will. But this morning the plan has been criticised by Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP who chairs the liaison committee (even though Wollaston, like Boles, Letwin and Morgan, is strongly committed to avoiding a no-deal Brexit. She posted these on Twitter. In the light of Wollaston\u2019s comments, the Boles plan may already be doomed. The Conservative MP Andrew Murrison is tabling an amendment to the motion that would approve the Brexit deal, \u201csubject to a legal codicil being added to the withdrawal agreement treaty which specifies that the backstop solution shall expire on 31 December 2022,\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham reports. This is the sort of ploy that will appeal to some in government because, if it were passed by the Commons, it would amount to an ultimatum to the EU, which would then have to decide whether to produce this codicil to make the deal acceptable to parliament. Twelve Conservative former ministers have written to Tory MPs urging them to vote against the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit deal. As the Sun reports, \u201cthe dozen, including Boris Johnson, demand in their plan B letter that the PM issue the EU with a final ultimatum for a better deal when hers is voted down on Tuesday \u2013 and then leave without one.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has suggested that Labour does not welcome the Hilary Benn amendment to the motion tomorrow night. Benn\u2019s amendment rejects May\u2019s deal and says the UK should not leave the EU without a deal. This is Labour policy but, if it gets pushed to a vote, it would mean there would be no yes/no vote on May\u2019s deal on its own and although the Benn amendment would probably pass, the government defeat would look smaller than otherwise because there are some Tory Brexiters who would oppose May\u2019s deal but who would not vote for the Benn amendment (because they would accept a no-deal Brexit). Hinting that Labour would like Benn to withdraw his amendment, McDonnell said it was \u201cperfectly sound\u201d but that he preferred a \u201cstraight vote\u201d on May\u2019s Brexit deal. The Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron has declared he will back May\u2019s Brexit deal. Writing in the Times (paywall), he said it was the only option that \u201ctruly enacts the promises that I made to my constituents and avoids the horror of a no-deal Brexit\u201d. Here is the agenda for the day. Mid morning: Theresa May gives a speech on Brexit. As Peter Walker and Dan Sabbagh report, she will tell MPs that voting down her proposals on Tuesday would destroy faith in politics, and could mean that Brexit does not happen. 11.30am: Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, gives a speech to the Centre for Policy Studies on the UK after Brexit. After 3.30pm: May gives a statement to MPs about Brexit. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although today I will be focusing almost entirely on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another after May\u2019s statement finishes, at around 6pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Steve Baker said: \u201cShe skilfully engineered her speech to ensure there were laughs in all the right places by not mentioning the deal.\u201d Just four Labour MPs have declared publicly that they could vote for May\u2019s Brexit deal: Ian Austin, John Mann, Jim Fitzpatrick and Kevin Barron. Corbyn urged his MPs to hold their nerve, addressing a packed meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on the eve of the vote. The Labour leader said the prime minister had comprehensively failed to scare his MPs into voting for her deal. \u201cTheresa May has attempted to blackmail Labour MPs to vote for her botched deal by threatening the country with the chaos of no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI know from conversations with colleagues that this has failed. The Labour party will not be held to ransom.\u201d Corbyn said May would \u201conly have herself to blame\u201d for two years of negotiating with her divided cabinet and backbenchers, rather than opening dialogue with Brussels, trade unions, businesses and parliament. \u201cThe Tory party\u2019s botched deal will be rejected by Parliament. We will then need an election to have the chance to vote for a government that can bring our people together and address the deep-seated issues facing our country,\u201d he said. A Labour source said MPs \u201cwon\u2019t have to wait very long\u201d for a confidence vote to be called but that would be the sole decision of Corbyn rather than the shadow cabinet. \u201cJeremy will choose the moment,\u201d the source said. However, the source said that should the vote be lost, it would not mean an immediate endorsement to campaign for a second referendum. \u201cThe composite identifies a public vote as one of the options; it doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s the preferred option or the default option. Obviously we will judge how to deal with the options and get the best result for the country on the basis of what happens in parliament,\u201d the source said. The Brexit select committee chair, Hilary Benn, was under pressure on Monday night to withdraw a no-deal amendment, tabled before Christmas, that some MPs feared could limit the scale of the government\u2019s defeat. Downing Street declined to say whether it could support an amendment tabled by the backbencher Andrew Murrison, chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, aimed at putting a formal end date on the Irish backstop. Such a sunset clause would be likely to run into trouble in Brussels, with the EU27 adamant that the backstop must apply \u201cunless and until\u201d an alternative arrangement is in place that avoids the need for a hard border. But the amendment\u2019s supporters believe it will strengthen the PM\u2019s hand if she returns to Brussels in search of fresh concessions after Tuesday. They also hope that if it passes, it could help limit the scale of the government defeat. Governments have been defeated by a margin of more than 100 votes only three times in the last century, according to professor Philip Cowley, of Queen Mary University of London \u2013 all of those during the minority Labour administration of 1924. The House of Lords had its own vote on the government\u2019s Brexit deal on Monday evening, rejecting it by a thumping 321 votes to 152 \u2013 a majority of 169. Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, called it \u201ca vote for common sense\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2019 because an earlier version referred to Jean-Claude Juncker as the EU council\u2019s president. Juncker is president of the European commission.",

      "body": "<p>The England and Wales Cricket Board staged what it described as a \u201cwhole game meeting\u201d at Millbank Tower in London on Monday, where it brought together representatives of all the nation\u2019s counties and clubs to talk through the five-year plan for the sport.</p> <p>The ECB presented a strategy document called Inspiring Generations that contained a lot of information on where the game is now and even more about where it wants it to get to, but rather less on how it is actually going to move between the two. The little details of what the ECB is actually going to do in order to deliver any of the many fine things it is promising will, it said, follow sometime soon.</p> <p>The first thing everyone wanted to talk about was the \u201cnew competition\u201d. It still does not have an official name and it is not clear what the teams will be called or exactly where the games will be played.</p> <p>However, the chief executive, Tom Harrison, was anxious to do what he described as \u201csome myth-busting\u201d about it. \u201cThe new competition is being designed to appeal to cricket fans first and foremost,\u201d Harrison said, \u201cbut then it\u2019s also for a broader audience.\u201d</p> <p>It is supposed to win them over by addressing the \u201cthree key challenges\u201d identified by the ECB: right now a lot of people who like sport do not like cricket because it is too long, too complex and too inaccessible.</p> <p>Harrison confirmed that the ECB has committed to spending \u00a3180m on the new competition over five years.

      "bodyText": "The England and Wales Cricket Board staged what it described as a \u201cwhole game meeting\u201d at Millbank Tower in London on Monday, where it brought together representatives of all the nation\u2019s counties and clubs to talk through the five-year plan for the sport. The ECB presented a strategy document called Inspiring Generations that contained a lot of information on where the game is now and even more about where it wants it to get to, but rather less on how it is actually going to move between the two. The little details of what the ECB is actually going to do in order to deliver any of the many fine things it is promising will, it said, follow sometime soon. The first thing everyone wanted to talk about was the \u201cnew competition\u201d. It still does not have an official name and it is not clear what the teams will be called or exactly where the games will be played. However, the chief executive, Tom Harrison, was anxious to do what he described as \u201csome myth-busting\u201d about it. \u201cThe new competition is being designed to appeal to cricket fans first and foremost,\u201d Harrison said, \u201cbut then it\u2019s also for a broader audience.\u201d It is supposed to win them over by addressing the \u201cthree key challenges\u201d identified by the ECB: right now a lot of people who like sport do not like cricket because it is too long, too complex and too inaccessible. Harrison confirmed that the ECB has committed to spending \u00a3180m on the new competition over five years. Even so he was keen to stress that it was \u201calready a profitable venture\u201d because it was a central part of the \u00a31.1bn TV rights deal. \u201cWe would not be onfree-to-air TV without that new competition and we would not have the premium that we got through the media rights process had that competition not been there.\u201d He was confident that, despite the scepticism expressed by Virat Kohli, who said last August, \u201cI feel somewhere the commercial aspect is taking over the real quality of cricket,\u201d the ECB would not have any trouble persuading players to take part. \u201cClearly it\u2019s a format which throws different challenges on to the table for cricketers,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI think new players will really want to test their ability in a format of the game which we think will provide more pressure at those key moments in games. It will be a very good training ground for international T20.\u201d He was also breezily confident that the ECB\u2019s existing T20 tournament, the Blast, \u201ccan coexist with the new competition and both can flourish\u201d because \u201cwe believe that the market can take further growth\u201d. And he promised that \u201cwe all understand the importance of the county championship\u201d, which he describes as \u201cour blue riband event\u201d. The counties will be assuaged, too, by \u00a3450m in direct funding over the five years, with \u00a350m of it set aside for improving venues and infrastructure. The new competition is only one part of the ECB\u2019s plan and Harrison seemed keen to ensure it did not dominate the discussions. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new format,\u201d he said \u2013 although he kept referring to it as exactly that \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a competition designed to do a certain job for a certain period of the season.\u201d There are other parts of what the ECB wants to do that, if it gets them right, will be more important for the future of the game. \u201cWe\u2019re not comfortable with where we are in schools,\u201d Harrison said. Right now cricket is played in only 22% of schools, which makes it the eighth most popular team sport. The detailed plan for what they are going to do about it is going to be released next year. Similarly the ECB has realised that it needs to broaden both its player base and audience. Right now, it says, cricket has 10.5 million \u201cfollowers\u201d but 82% of them are men, 94% of them are white and their average age is 50. \u201cWhat success looks like is that in five years\u2019 time people can say, \u2018Cricket is a game for me,\u2019\u201d Harrison said, \u201cwherever you are from in this country, regardless of background, religion, where you live or how old you are.\u201d He wants the sport to \u201cshed this curious tag of elitism and privilege which we carry around with us\u201d.

Richard Ratcliffe revealed his wife was calm as she began an initial three-day hunger strike in protest at the Iranian prison authorities\u2019 refusal to give her a clear written undertaking that she would receive medical help for a lump on her breast, as well as other concerns. He was speaking as the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, summoned the Iranian ambassador to demand the dual national, sentenced to five years in prison for espionage, was given proper medical help. Ratcliffe said it was \u201cnow or never\u201d for Hunt to escalate the situation by saying the British government would give his wife diplomatic protection, a means by which the row would be elevated to a state-to-state dispute, making an international legal claim for her to be visited by UK authorities in prison more likely to be granted. Later on Monday, Ratcliffe met Hunt for about 40 minutes and discussed the prospect of granting his wife diplomatic protection. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cThe foreign secretary discussed this course of action with Richard Ratcliffe today and will continue to actively consider the question of diplomatic protection, alongside all other options in Nazanin\u2019s case and the cases of other dual nationals detained in Iran.\u201d Ratcliffe said the foreign secretary vowed to \u201cdo all we can\u201d to return his wife.

The EU will yet again be trying to negotiate with an out of control country, from where Brexiters still bellow insults across the Channel, as Britain still tears itself apart over what \u201creal\u201d Brexit means amid endless claims of betraying the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. By then, what May calls \u201cour precious union\u201d will be cracking apart, Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland preferring the relative peace and prosperity of life inside the EU to the political hell on earth in what was once the United Kingdom. Before we do this terrible thing, the people should be asked if this is what they want. Yes, a referendum would be another hell of its own \u2013 we didn\u2019t need Benedict Cumberbatch to remind us of the depths to which referendums sink. People might still cleave to Brexit, but there is a growing chance voters will step back. Even that won\u2019t be the end, I\u2019m afraid. Even if remain wins, the noise will go on. The Tory party may split, as it should, with the Brexit axis ready to raise mayhem. Nigel Farage threatens a \u201cpeople\u2019s army\u201d, claiming dangerously that \u201cparliament is against the people\u201d. Boris Johnson stirs conspiracy paranoia by warning the \u201cdeep state\u201d is blocking Brexit. Chris Grayling warns of no-Brexit unrest, near-as-dammit inciting riot. No kind of Brexit will ever be enough for them. The only defence against their threats is asking the people to decide, the only hope of calming national furies when parliament can\u2019t. Alas, one option just isn\u2019t available \u2013 that Britain stops banging on about Europe any time soon. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

There is a growing humanitarian crisis at the border, but not for lack of a border wall \u2013 the crisis is growing because of the Trump administration\u2019s illegal and inhumane policies toward asylum seekers.</p> <p>As a law student enrolled in the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic, I spent the first week of the new year volunteering in Tijuana with an organization that provides legal services to asylum seekers. The organization, <a href=\"https://alotrolado.org/\">Al Otro Lado</a>, serves individuals who hope to present themselves to US officials at the port of San Ysidro, the largest land border crossing in the United States. I use the word \u201chope\u201d because the Trump administration has effectively prevented thousands of people \u2013 including many women and children \u2013 from exercising their legal right to apply for asylum by blocking their path to the port of entry itself.</p> <p>Under domestic and international law, any immigrant who arrives at a US port of entry has a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/trump-administration-illegally-turning-away-asylum-seekers\">right</a> to apply for asylum. The process is not easy and involves multiple interviews to determine whether an individual meets the narrow, categorical definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d under US law. Many asylum seekers will languish in detention while awaiting their turn before an immigration judge, without any opportunity to collect evidence or consult an attorney. Most will have their applications denied. But everyone is entitled to this process. The government must allow families at the border to present themselves and claim asylum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/09/border-wall-speech-trump-is-losing-the-macho-game-of-staring-himself-down-in-the-mirror\">Border wall speech: Trump is losing the macho game of staring himself down in the mirror | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Immigrants who arrive at the Mexican entrance to San Ysidro sign up for an informal waiting list and take a number. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-asylum-seekers-notebook-holds-key-to-entry-20180705-story.html\">La Lista</a>\u201d was developed and managed by Mexican immigration officials and others in response to the US government\u2019s policy of allowing only a small number of people to present themselves each day. It is a primitive system, recorded by hand in a composition notebook and relayed only by word of mouth. The numbers are scratched on to tiny pieces of scrap paper, which migrants guard closely as they wait their turn. The wait can take weeks or even months.</p> <p>This system should not have to exist; the situation that US policies have created is patently illegal and unquestionably responsible for the growing humanitarian crisis at the southern border. I met dozens of families with young children who were living in shelters and tent cities, patiently waiting for their numbers to be read off La Lista. These families had no food, income or access to basic needs like medical care. They expressed fear of street crime and the practical challenges of living without documentation. Those who could work had a disincentive to seeking employment in Tijuana, because any evidence of potential stability in Mexico might hurt their asylum cases in the United States.</p> <p>Moreover, the administration\u2019s policy of punishing families by making them wait at the border fails to deter migrants, many of whom are fleeing violence and repression from hostile government actors. I advised some families not to approach the border at all. I tried to be realistic about the hardships they would face even after they successfully crossed on to US soil. I will never forget the looks of desperation on the faces of the men and women I counseled. Fathers told me they had to take the chance for their little girls. Rape victims told me they could not return home and face their attackers. They all told me they understood the risks. But what choice did they have?</p> <p>If President Trump is genuinely concerned with the growing humanitarian crisis at the border, he should take immediate action to permit asylum seekers to present themselves to immigration officials. The law is clear on the issue \u2013 immigrants have the right to apply for asylum at any port of entry and between ports of entry. What\u2019s clearer is that his policies have had, and will continue to have, devastating effects on thousands of well-meaning families who have not even begun the long and difficult asylum process.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Amanda Chuzi is a student at Columbia Law School and a former homeland security staffer in the </em><em>US Senate</em></p></li> </ul>",

As a law student enrolled in the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic, I spent the first week of the new year volunteering in Tijuana with an organization that provides legal services to asylum seekers. The organization, Al Otro Lado, serves individuals who hope to present themselves to US officials at the port of San Ysidro, the largest land border crossing in the United States. I use the word \u201chope\u201d because the Trump administration has effectively prevented thousands of people \u2013 including many women and children \u2013 from exercising their legal right to apply for asylum by blocking their path to the port of entry itself. Under domestic and international law, any immigrant who arrives at a US port of entry has a right to apply for asylum. The process is not easy and involves multiple interviews to determine whether an individual meets the narrow, categorical definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d under US law. Many asylum seekers will languish in detention while awaiting their turn before an immigration judge, without any opportunity to collect evidence or consult an attorney. Most will have their applications denied. But everyone is entitled to this process. The government must allow families at the border to present themselves and claim asylum. Immigrants who arrive at the Mexican entrance to San Ysidro sign up for an informal waiting list and take a number. \u201cLa Lista\u201d was developed and managed by Mexican immigration officials and others in response to the US government\u2019s policy of allowing only a small number of people to present themselves each day. It is a primitive system, recorded by hand in a composition notebook and relayed only by word of mouth. The numbers are scratched on to tiny pieces of scrap paper, which migrants guard closely as they wait their turn. The wait can take weeks or even months. This system should not have to exist; the situation that US policies have created is patently illegal and unquestionably responsible for the growing humanitarian crisis at the southern border. I met dozens of families with young children who were living in shelters and tent cities, patiently waiting for their numbers to be read off La Lista. These families had no food, income or access to basic needs like medical care. They expressed fear of street crime and the practical challenges of living without documentation. Those who could work had a disincentive to seeking employment in Tijuana, because any evidence of potential stability in Mexico might hurt their asylum cases in the United States. Moreover, the administration\u2019s policy of punishing families by making them wait at the border fails to deter migrants, many of whom are fleeing violence and repression from hostile government actors. I advised some families not to approach the border at all. I tried to be realistic about the hardships they would face even after they successfully crossed on to US soil. I will never forget the looks of desperation on the faces of the men and women I counseled. Fathers told me they had to take the chance for their little girls. Rape victims told me they could not return home and face their attackers. They all told me they understood the risks. But what choice did they have? If President Trump is genuinely concerned with the growing humanitarian crisis at the border, he should take immediate action to permit asylum seekers to present themselves to immigration officials. The law is clear on the issue \u2013 immigrants have the right to apply for asylum at any port of entry and between ports of entry. What\u2019s clearer is that his policies have had, and will continue to have, devastating effects on thousands of well-meaning families who have not even begun the long and difficult asylum process.

A month later nothing has changed. The prime minister did secure a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/may-makes-final-case-for-brexit-deal-dont-let-the-people-down\" title=\"\">letter</a> of warm words from Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, and Donald Tusk, European council president, but it contained no significant revisions to the terms of Britain\u2019s Brexit package. The upshot is that parliament has lost a month of valuable time and on Tuesday MPs will almost certainly vote down Mrs May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in overwhelming numbers. The prime minister has only herself to blame. Mrs May\u2019s deal cannot command a majority in the Conservative party, let alone a majority in the Commons. She sheepishly told MPs her deal is not perfect.

She gave a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46856149\" title=\"\">preview</a> of her arguments in parliament which focus on the downsides of other options. Mrs May is gambling that all her adversaries will prove by voting against her deal is that they have the numbers to block it, but not the numbers in favour of an alternative \u2013 nor crucially the time for that to become a reality. The UK, Mrs May reminds us, will leave without a deal after 29 March unless that deadline is extended by mutual consent with the EU. This is a mistake. Mrs May has driven her party to <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/gareth-johnson-resigns-tory-whip-government-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-deal-vote-a4038371.html\" title=\"\">resignations</a> and recriminations. It would be better for her to realise the error of her ways and adopt a different, more inclusive approach within \u2013 and without \u2013 the Conservative party.</p> <p>If the prime minister ought to change tack, then so ought her opponents. If they are serious about pursuing a different strategy to that recommended by the prime minister, MPs must think not just of winning a Commons battle but also public opinion. To increase the chances of other potential outcomes, MPs have to change the optics over the Brexit debate. The public currently see the two major parties riven by dissent and offering little more than partisan pot shots at their opponents. It is hard to see in that context how voters will be happy to be told that they will have to vote again in another referendum on whether this country stays in or out of the EU because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/i-wont-ever-vote-again-stoke-bemoans-brexit-bickering\" title=\"\">squabbling politicians</a> have been unable to resolve the matter. Or for that matter be enthused about another general election that gets turned into a single-issue plebiscite. That is why there needs to be a change of tone in our politics: to lower the levels of conflict, cynicism and confrontation. What is required is space for consideration of evidence, meaningful debate and negotiation in good faith. Without it the probability of other potential outcomes from this Brexit process shrinks.</p> <p>There is also a need to understand that the <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/brexit-inequality-and-the-demographic-divide/\" title=\"\">drivers</a> of the Brexit vote \u2013 stagnant wages, inequality and feelings of powerlessness \u2013 were not caused by the European Union. They will not be solved by leaving it. What will be needed is bold new policies that respond to these challenges. These will not be forthcoming if MPs descend in the coming weeks to intra-party bickering and power grabs. This newspaper has made the case before that once Mrs May loses her vote, her first act ought to be to ask the EU to allow an extension of the Brexit deadline. We need a real dialogue via a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-the-government-has-failed-its-time-to-go-back-to-the-people\" title=\"\">citizens\u2019 assembly about where the country should go</a>. There is a danger that the parliamentary introspection blinds us to the road ahead. We ought not to conduct our policies on the assumption that the world is waiting for us interminably to solve our problems. It is not. Other nations have their own interests. Brexit has taught Britain\u2019s political class one important lesson: we should not start battles we are likely to lose.</p>",

Or for that matter be enthused about another general election that gets turned into a single-issue plebiscite. That is why there needs to be a change of tone in our politics: to lower the levels of conflict, cynicism and confrontation. What is required is space for consideration of evidence, meaningful debate and negotiation in good faith. Without it the probability of other potential outcomes from this Brexit process shrinks. There is also a need to understand that the drivers of the Brexit vote \u2013 stagnant wages, inequality and feelings of powerlessness \u2013 were not caused by the European Union. They will not be solved by leaving it. What will be needed is bold new policies that respond to these challenges. These will not be forthcoming if MPs descend in the coming weeks to intra-party bickering and power grabs. This newspaper has made the case before that once Mrs May loses her vote, her first act ought to be to ask the EU to allow an extension of the Brexit deadline. We need a real dialogue via a citizens\u2019 assembly about where the country should go. There is a danger that the parliamentary introspection blinds us to the road ahead. We ought not to conduct our policies on the assumption that the world is waiting for us interminably to solve our problems. It is not. Other nations have their own interests. Brexit has taught Britain\u2019s political class one important lesson: we should not start battles we are likely to lose.",

      "body": "<p>A mother has told a court how her five-year-old daughter was killed when her head became trapped in a faulty disability lift at their family home.</p> <p>Alexys Brown, who was described as a \u201cguardian angel\u201d to her disabled older brother, got into the lift to fetch his mobile phone from upstairs for him. She got her head stuck in a hole in a broken see-through door panel of the lift, and as it moved upwards she became caught between the lift and the ground-floor ceiling.</p> <p>Her grandmother was unable to operate the lift to free her and called 999. The girl could not be saved and she died at the scene from head and neck injuries.</p> <p>Alexys\u2019s mother, Lorraine Brown, told Bournemouth crown court on Monday that her son, Jack, who was 11 at the time, had been left traumatised and racked with guilt after watching his sister die at their home in Weymouth, Dorset.</p> <p>Brown gave a moving victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing of two companies that have been prosecuted for health and safety breaches over a \u201ccatalogue of failures\u201d involving the lift.</p> <p>The court heard that Alexys and Jack were at home with their grandmother, Sheila Green, on 13 August 2015 when he asked his sibling to fetch his phone from upstairs.</p> <p>Alexys decided to go up in the lift that had been installed at their housing association home. Green was sewing in another room when she heard Jack, who has a neuro-degenerative disease, \u201chysterically screaming\u201d.</p> <p>Brown, 33, told the court that her family had been left \u201cbroken\u201d. She said: \u201cThe heartache and emotion they have had to face of losing their sister and best friend and the circumstances of her death make it impossible. My son Jack had to witness something people wouldn\u2019t even be able to have nightmares about.</p> <p>\u201cHe is receiving treatment for PTSD, he doesn\u2019t sleep or eat. He carries a huge amount of guilt he just cannot let go of. What he witnessed we can only imagine.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cWe believed Alexys was sent to us for a reason at a time when we were given a horrible diagnosis with Jack. Alexys\u2019 arrival gave Jack something to look forward to. She was and is his guardian angel. She gave him a reason to fight, to be, to live, and that reason has gone, along with his fight.</p> <p>\u201cOur life is never sleeping due to thousands of \u2018What ifs?\u2019 and \u2018Why didn\u2019ts?\u2019. The silence is deafening, every day getting worse. As time goes by we just miss her more. We should have been able to protect her and that was taken away from us. It\u2019s just heartbreaking.\u201d</p> <p>An inspection of the lift carried out by an engineer three months before Alexys was killed identified that there was damage to the door, but nothing was done to fix this, the court heard.</p> <p>No key was provided, which would have allowed the parents to prevent the lift from being used unsupervised. There was also no emergency handle to allow the lift to be manually raised or lowered if needed.</p> <p>The lift should have been serviced every six months, but had not had a thorough inspection since January 2012, after an error led the insurance company to believe the lift had been removed, the court heard.</p> <p>Brown said: \u201cKnowing it could have been prevented turns my upset to anger. Someone failed our family and needs to take responsibility. The world kept moving and ours just stood still. The hurt in our hearts will never end. This is our new normal, hopping through puddles of emotions just to get through the day. Losing a child is beyond grief; there are no words.\u201d</p> <p>Sara Lawson, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said: \u201cThe catalogue of failures and lack of checks made by these companies led to Alexys\u2019 death.

      "bodyText": "A mother has told a court how her five-year-old daughter was killed when her head became trapped in a faulty disability lift at their family home. Alexys Brown, who was described as a \u201cguardian angel\u201d to her disabled older brother, got into the lift to fetch his mobile phone from upstairs for him. She got her head stuck in a hole in a broken see-through door panel of the lift, and as it moved upwards she became caught between the lift and the ground-floor ceiling. Her grandmother was unable to operate the lift to free her and called 999. The girl could not be saved and she died at the scene from head and neck injuries. Alexys\u2019s mother, Lorraine Brown, told Bournemouth crown court on Monday that her son, Jack, who was 11 at the time, had been left traumatised and racked with guilt after watching his sister die at their home in Weymouth, Dorset. Brown gave a moving victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing of two companies that have been prosecuted for health and safety breaches over a \u201ccatalogue of failures\u201d involving the lift. The court heard that Alexys and Jack were at home with their grandmother, Sheila Green, on 13 August 2015 when he asked his sibling to fetch his phone from upstairs. Alexys decided to go up in the lift that had been installed at their housing association home. Green was sewing in another room when she heard Jack, who has a neuro-degenerative disease, \u201chysterically screaming\u201d. Brown, 33, told the court that her family had been left \u201cbroken\u201d. She said: \u201cThe heartache and emotion they have had to face of losing their sister and best friend and the circumstances of her death make it impossible. My son Jack had to witness something people wouldn\u2019t even be able to have nightmares about. \u201cHe is receiving treatment for PTSD, he doesn\u2019t sleep or eat. He carries a huge amount of guilt he just cannot let go of. What he witnessed we can only imagine.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe believed Alexys was sent to us for a reason at a time when we were given a horrible diagnosis with Jack. Alexys\u2019 arrival gave Jack something to look forward to. She was and is his guardian angel. She gave him a reason to fight, to be, to live, and that reason has gone, along with his fight. \u201cOur life is never sleeping due to thousands of \u2018What ifs?\u2019 and \u2018Why didn\u2019ts?\u2019. The silence is deafening, every day getting worse. As time goes by we just miss her more. We should have been able to protect her and that was taken away from us. It\u2019s just heartbreaking.\u201d An inspection of the lift carried out by an engineer three months before Alexys was killed identified that there was damage to the door, but nothing was done to fix this, the court heard. No key was provided, which would have allowed the parents to prevent the lift from being used unsupervised. There was also no emergency handle to allow the lift to be manually raised or lowered if needed. The lift should have been serviced every six months, but had not had a thorough inspection since January 2012, after an error led the insurance company to believe the lift had been removed, the court heard. Brown said: \u201cKnowing it could have been prevented turns my upset to anger. Someone failed our family and needs to take responsibility. The world kept moving and ours just stood still. The hurt in our hearts will never end. This is our new normal, hopping through puddles of emotions just to get through the day. Losing a child is beyond grief; there are no words.\u201d Sara Lawson, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said: \u201cThe catalogue of failures and lack of checks made by these companies led to Alexys\u2019 death. The injuries suffered were horrific. The lift was in an unsatisfactory condition at the time it was in use. If either the hole had not been present or there had been adequate control of the key switch at the time, this incident would not have occurred. \u201cThe systems in place were not rigorous enough and problems with the emergency lowering system had existed since the start of the Brown family\u2019s tenancy and had not been addressed.\u201d Synergy Housing Limited, a housing association, and Orona Limited, a lift maintenance firm, have admitted charges of failing to discharge their health and safety duty, a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The hearing continues. The companies are expected to be sentenced on Tuesday. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2019. An earlier version misspelt Orona Limited as Orana Limited. This has been corrected.",

He ruled that the parents had misreported and exaggerated the child\u2019s medical symptoms.</p> <p>The judge, who rejected an application from the mother that he recuse himself from the case because of his earlier comments, repeated the phrase \u201cbullying and bombastic\u201d several times during the course of the hearing on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cWe were pleased to be invited [to my son\u2019s] school,\u201d the woman told the court. \u201cWe had not received any educational information from social services.

The mother responded: \u201cI had no doubt that this was an invitation within the order.\u201d</p> <p>But the judge ruled that the invitation from the school was \u201csent in error\u201d and had been passed on by the father to his wife. The judge ordered that the clause that allowed her to accept invitations from her son\u2019s school be removed.</p> <p>The mother was supported by the organisation <a href=\"http://legalactionforwomen.net/\">Legal Action for Women</a>, which had called for a different judge to be assigned to the case.</p>",

Westminster city council had urged Mr Justice Hayden to imprison the woman, who cannot currently be identified, for contempt of court in the latest twist in a long-running, contentious care case. Christopher Poole, counsel for Westminster, told the court that the boy\u2019s mother and father had gone to the sixth former\u2019s parents\u2019 evening last September in breach of the earlier court ruling. But giving evidence to the family court, the woman pointed out there was an exemption in the order allowing her to \u201cattend parents\u2019 evening at the request of the school\u201d. Hayden has presided over earlier hearings in the case during which he accused the mother of \u201cbullying and bombastic\u201d behaviour towards medical staff who were treating her son at Great Ormond Street hospital. He ruled that the parents had misreported and exaggerated the child\u2019s medical symptoms. The judge, who rejected an application from the mother that he recuse himself from the case because of his earlier comments, repeated the phrase \u201cbullying and bombastic\u201d several times during the course of the hearing on Monday. \u201cWe were pleased to be invited [to my son\u2019s] school,\u201d the woman told the court. \u201cWe had not received any educational information from social services. We were thrilled that we would find out from the school how [he] is doing.\u201d The woman said that she was banned from contacting social services about her son\u2019s case and could not therefore inquire whether she had been properly invited to the parent\u2019s evening. Asked by Poole how she felt about the fact that her husband could have contact with her son but she could not, she declined to answer. The barrister said she had arrived at the school, \u201carmed with a generic invite\u201d addressed to \u201cparent(s), carer(s)\u201d of the child. The mother responded: \u201cI had no doubt that this was an invitation within the order.\u201d But the judge ruled that the invitation from the school was \u201csent in error\u201d and had been passed on by the father to his wife. The judge ordered that the clause that allowed her to accept invitations from her son\u2019s school be removed. The mother was supported by the organisation Legal Action for Women, which had called for a different judge to be assigned to the case.",

      "bodyText": "Millennials may be reminded of the Give Yourself Goosebumps spin-off books. Older readers probably remember the 1970s Choose Your Own Adventure series by Bantam Books. Black Mirror fans may have caught the new-year release of Bandersnatch, Charlie Brooker\u2019s interactive drama on Netflix, in which the viewer is able to determine the show\u2019s ending(s). The choose-your-own-adventure format is said to allow \u201cfor a realistic sense of unpredictability, and leads to the possibility of repeat readings\u201d. It occurred to me that this sounds a lot like Brexit, in which everything is up in the air and we have had the same debate over and over again for months. Tomorrow sees parliament vote on Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement (all 585 pages of it), a vote she is expected to lose heavily. What happens after that? Well, who among us knows? (Nobody among us knows.) Jeremy Corbyn will no doubt call for a general election. May might well murmur about going back to the EU for amendments, even though all 27 countries are united over the fact that is not going to happen. Certain cabinet members and backbench factions may push variously for a Norway-plus solution; an extension or revocation of article 50; a second referendum or, for some absolute selfish masochists, no deal. CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE! Except the decisions remain in the hands of a political class seemingly obsessed with internecine wars, jostling for leadership and briefing the Sunday papers; the ending remains unwritten. The problem, really, is that some of the pages at the beginning were skipped. The Irish border issue, for instance, which none of us appeared to acknowledge. The 3.6 million EU citizens in the UK, now deemed queue jumpers by the prime minister, apparently weren\u2019t factored into any plans. Perhaps because there really was no plan. The truth is, probably none of us expected the two-year rollercoaster (so far) that has turned out to be Brexit \u2013 and at the moment it feels as if we are stuck hanging upside down on a loop.

Try again.\u201d</p> <p>Before we wade into the response with the defiance of a student <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-college-dance-video-discredit-backfires\" title=\"\">paying homage to The Breakfast Club on a college roof</a>, let\u2019s unpick this further. Ocasio-Cortez was responding to a CBS News producer revealing its team covering the 2020 US presidential campaign. Asian, Arab-American and Latino journalists were included, but no black reporter. This matters, not because of some facile quota system that says we need one of each race or it\u2019s not true representation. It matters because a functional understanding of race is central to US (and indeed UK) politics. And when the conspicuously absent race happens to be the one discriminated against and weaponised the most, that tells us something, too.</p> <p>This is why we need people in power, and holding power to account, who know about the complexities of race through lived experience. And it\u2019s why it takes someone like Ocasio-Cortez, who is Puerto Rican, to notice, understand and call it out. But oh, how the establishment loathes it when such truths are spoken. Especially by a bright young woman who the right are so obsessed by (ie fear) that Fox News spent more than two hours covering her first five days in Congress.</p> <p>The response is always some predictable shade of defensiveness. The politics editor of the National Journal, Josh Kraushaar, wrote: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hotlinejosh/status/1084284162654306306\" title=\"\">\u201cAnother thing AOC has in common with Trump: media scold.\u201d</a> He went on: \u201cIf there aren\u2019t strict racial quotas for every batch of hires, does it mean a company is racist?\u201d To which Ocasio-Cortez patiently explained: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1084290688794144768\" title=\"\">Do you understand how fundamental the black experience is to American politics?</a> One race isn\u2019t substitutable for another. It\u2019s not about \u2018quotas\u2019. It\u2019s about understanding the country you\u2019re living in.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/nyregion/ocasio-cortez-democrats-congress.html\" title=\"\">recent New York Times op-ed describes Ocasio-Cortez</a> as \u201ca potent symbol for a diversifying Democratic party: a young woman of colour who is giving as good as she gets in a political system that has rarely rewarded people who look like her.\u201d Like Barack Obama, Ocasio-Cortez did not choose to be a symbol, but who she is will always count as much as what she says. And, so far, what she says is thrilling. </p>",

Tweeting to her 2.4 million followers, Ocasio-Cortez wrote: \u201cThis [White House] admin has made having a functional understanding of race in America one of the most important core competencies for a political journalist to have, yet CBS News hasn\u2019t assigned a *single* black journalist to cover the 2020 election.\u201d In true AOC style \u2013 bold, snappy, forthright, instantly meme-able \u2013 she added: \u201cUnacceptable in 2019. Try again.\u201d Before we wade into the response with the defiance of a student paying homage to The Breakfast Club on a college roof, let\u2019s unpick this further. Ocasio-Cortez was responding to a CBS News producer revealing its team covering the 2020 US presidential campaign. Asian, Arab-American and Latino journalists were included, but no black reporter. This matters, not because of some facile quota system that says we need one of each race or it\u2019s not true representation. It matters because a functional understanding of race is central to US (and indeed UK) politics. And when the conspicuously absent race happens to be the one discriminated against and weaponised the most, that tells us something, too. This is why we need people in power, and holding power to account, who know about the complexities of race through lived experience. And it\u2019s why it takes someone like Ocasio-Cortez, who is Puerto Rican, to notice, understand and call it out. But oh, how the establishment loathes it when such truths are spoken. Especially by a bright young woman who the right are so obsessed by (ie fear) that Fox News spent more than two hours covering her first five days in Congress. The response is always some predictable shade of defensiveness. The politics editor of the National Journal, Josh Kraushaar, wrote: \u201cAnother thing AOC has in common with Trump: media scold.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf there aren\u2019t strict racial quotas for every batch of hires, does it mean a company is racist?\u201d To which Ocasio-Cortez patiently explained: \u201cDo you understand how fundamental the black experience is to American politics? One race isn\u2019t substitutable for another. It\u2019s not about \u2018quotas\u2019. It\u2019s about understanding the country you\u2019re living in.\u201d A recent New York Times op-ed describes Ocasio-Cortez as \u201ca potent symbol for a diversifying Democratic party: a young woman of colour who is giving as good as she gets in a political system that has rarely rewarded people who look like her.\u201d Like Barack Obama, Ocasio-Cortez did not choose to be a symbol, but who she is will always count as much as what she says. And, so far, what she says is thrilling.",

      "bodyText": "Name: The Egg. Age: Born on 4 January. Appearance: Bigger than Kylie Jenner. And how big is Kylie Jenner? Smaller than the Egg. Hey, this is Pass notes, not a zen koan. Sorry. About 1.68m (5ft 6in). That\u2019s a big egg! What are we talking here? Godzilla? Mutant emu? Instagram. Whoa! Instagram has the capacity to grow oviducts now? You\u2019re really stringing out the \u201cdeliberate misunderstanding\u201d part of this format today, aren\u2019t you? Shall I just explain what the Egg is? Yes please. The Egg is a picture of an egg that has just broken Kylie Jenner\u2019s record to become the most-liked Instagram post in all of history. And by \u201call of history\u201d you mean ... since Instagram was invented. So, eight years or so. What is so remarkable about this picture of an egg? That\u2019s just it. Nothing. It\u2019s just a stock photo of an egg, the only image ever posted by @world_egg_record, alongside the caption: \u201cLet\u2019s set a world record together and get the most-liked post on Instagram.\u201d Am I missing something? Yes. You\u2019re missing a deliberate hierarchical disruption. The Egg likely succeeded thanks to the same impulse that made Rage Against the Machine\u2019s Killing in the Name the Christmas No 1 in 2009. Users (self-identifying as #EggSoldiers), sick of Kylie Jenner\u2019s omnipresence, have got behind the most banal image imaginable, with the express intention of dethroning her. And now they have succeeded? Absolutely. Jenner\u2019s post received 18m likes, but the Egg is now at 26m and counting. And what was Jenner\u2019s most-liked post? A picture of her newborn daughter\u2019s hand grasping her finger. Ha! We\u2019re all deliberately undermining the happiest day of her life! Lolz! And the great thing about Instagram is that there definitely won\u2019t be any tedious copycat efforts. Clearly you haven\u2019t seen @world_record_eggsmotheer [sic], an account that has posted a picture of a chicken (\u201cthe mother of the egg\u201d) in an attempt to get more likes than @world_egg_record. It currently has just 17 likes, and five comments.. I really, really hate the internet sometimes. But isn\u2019t this fascinating? The whole thing is a compelling microcosm of our entire collective online behaviour, and, if we investigate it properly, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll discover \u2026 Nope. You\u2019re right. I hate the internet too. Do say: \u201cThe Egg has definitively proved that Instagram likes are not a genuine reflection of true worth.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cLook out for the Egg\u2019s new reality show, Negging the Egg, starting next week on E!\u201d",

If he moves a no-confidence vote and it fails, Labour has already at its conference mandated that the party seek a second referendum. And given that there is no majority in parliament for any currently envisaged version of Brexit, including no deal, it is entirely plausible that the current Brexit stasis could indeed be eventually \u201csettled\u201d by another referendum.</p> <p>So what would those who wish Britain to stay in the EU need to do differently to win it? <a href=\"https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/in-highsight-do-you-think-britain-was-right-or-wrong-to-vote-to-leave-the-eu/\" title=\"\">Recent tracker polls</a> have shown an increasing swing to remain, with the highest scores for \u201cBritain was wrong to leave the EU\u201d being recorded in the last two months.

For example, the older you are, the more likely you were to vote for Brexit.

Yet they seem wholly unaware that their Brexit electorate voted first for cultural, and second for economic, security. Whereas what Brexiteers offer exposes Britain to more migration from those countries that are further than European nations from the value system that Britain exemplifies: a situation that will arguably leave Britain open to the arrival of what some Brexit voters fear are hostile minorities.

      "bodyText": "If, as seems likely, the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal is rejected in parliament on Tuesday, it is arguably only the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who stands in the way of a second referendum. If he moves a no-confidence vote and it fails, Labour has already at its conference mandated that the party seek a second referendum. And given that there is no majority in parliament for any currently envisaged version of Brexit, including no deal, it is entirely plausible that the current Brexit stasis could indeed be eventually \u201csettled\u201d by another referendum. So what would those who wish Britain to stay in the EU need to do differently to win it? Recent tracker polls have shown an increasing swing to remain, with the highest scores for \u201cBritain was wrong to leave the EU\u201d being recorded in the last two months. But the long-term trends show that few voters are switching (remain\u2019s ranks are being swelled by new younger voters joining the electorate and their elders leaving it). If anything, positions may have hardened and polarised further. In the event of a second referendum, it will all be down to turnout and who can best activate their base \u2013 and that still looks like leave. For example, the older you are, the more likely you were to vote for Brexit. In the 2016 referendum, while 64% of those under 25 voted (and 70% of those voted to remain), 74% of the 55-to-64s went to the polls as did 90% of those aged over 65. Leave\u2019s hand could be further strengthened by the widespread sense of voters being thwarted by the establishment, it could reiterate the \u201ctake back control\u201d mantra, given it will have been so clearly lost to the EU and the Westminster \u201cremain elite\u201d. And leavers could run their own version of \u201cproject fear\u201d about the social consequences of \u201coverturning the vote\u201d of 2016. Meanwhile, remain risks looking miserably inept by recycling yet again a negative narrative about the economic cost of leaving the EU. Inexplicably, it has still not given or offered a positive patriotic account as to why Britain needs to stay in the EU, and how we could use Europe as a platform for the enduring influence of Britain on the world. After all, soft power surveys regularly place the UK as the first or second most powerful country in the world, and hard power rankings rightly argue that Britain remains a global power, while China is in effect still regional. Neither side has talked about how Brexit might deliver for the people who voted for it. Almost unfailingly, most leading Brexiteers are libertarians who will open up Britain even more to the globalised free market. Yet they seem wholly unaware that their Brexit electorate voted first for cultural, and second for economic, security. Whereas what Brexiteers offer exposes Britain to more migration from those countries that are further than European nations from the value system that Britain exemplifies: a situation that will arguably leave Britain open to the arrival of what some Brexit voters fear are hostile minorities. Similarly, the economic offer of Brexiteers threatens to make working lives even more insecure, as this is what globalisation has clearly done for lower- and middle-income groups in the developed western world. Yet remain continues to offer a simple return to the pre-referendum status quo \u2013 one that has inordinately benefited upper-middle-class liberals, while rendering everyone else\u2019s lives more insecure. Remainers have yet to offer any account as to how being in Europe will serve the interests of the poor and the middling. The liberal order, which has benefitted a self-serving cadre, is now discredited, and the message of both the referendum vote in the UK and populism in general, is that we have to care at a grand scale for all of our nation. To be assured of winning a second referendum, remain would have to appeal to leave voters to switch. This it can only do by forming a story of how Britain in Europe can serve the values and beliefs of leavers as well as increasing their economic capacity and security. Nationalism appeals because it is a collective expression of solidarity, that we as a group will look after our own. It is an integral part of the identity of any community that membership of it confers advantages and benefits rather than vulnerabilities and exposure. Those who voted to leave (as opposed to those who urged them to do so) are largely patriotic social conservatives who are also economically insecure and deeply concerned about the fate of their families and communities. The argument to be made to them is that Britain has always divided Europe in order to conquer the world, but now we have to join with Europe in order to maintain Britain as a leading world power and to defend the west from its enemies (something we can\u2019t do and never have done alone). In addition, by about 2050 Britain will have the largest population in Europe and, according to pre-Brexit economic trends (which can be restored) it will have the largest economy as well. In Europe this means the UK will be the largest player in a system where that has huge advantages, even if we are not members of the euro. We can in no small measure govern the Europe to come. How? Well, Europe is changing, its federalist direction of travel is being questioned by an increasing number of European nations.

      "body": "<p>My lifelong friend Marcus Cumberlege, who has died aged 80, was a prolific poet. He lived in Bruges, Belgium, for 46 years. Earlier he had had several poetry collections published in the UK. Another 20 collections were to follow in Bruges by the time his Selected Poems (1963-2009) was launched at the city hall in 2010.</p> <p>Born in Antibes, France, Marcus was the son of Nancy (nee Wooley), a Canadian, and Mike Cumberlege, later a decorated Royal Navy officer who worked for Special Operations in the Aegean. Mike was captured and eventually shot by the SS in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, Germany, two months short of the allied victory in Europe. Marcus, aged nine, collected his father\u2019s medals from King George in 1947. Mike\u2019s ghost was to remain with Marcus all his life. </p> <p>Marcus showed a precocious gift for poetry at Sherborne school, Dorset, where at 16 he received a long personal reply from TS Eliot to his own questioning letter about the poet Rimbaud. After studying English and French at St John\u2019s College, Oxford, graduating in 1961, Marcus went on to win an Eric Gregory award for promising young British poets in 1967, adjudicated that year by Ted Hughes.</p> <p>In the following decade he had four collections published in the UK by Anvil and Carcanet. Yeats, Pound, Neruda, Vallejo, Lorca and C\u00e9sar Calvo were among his early influences.</p> <p>Marcus travelled widely in Europe, South America, Canada and Japan; he was fluent in French, Spanish and Dutch. In the late 1960s he lived in France, Peru and western Ireland, teaching English and always writing. In 1965 he married Ava Paranjoti. They had a daughter, Eunice, before the marriage ended in divorce in 1969.</p> <p>Later, in London, Marcus met Maria Lefever, whose family were from Flanders. They settled in Bruges, marrying there in 1973. Marcus did translation work and taught adult classes. He was the official English translator at the Europees Po\u00ebziefestival, Leuven, for several years in the 1980s.</p> <p>But it was his poetry that drove him. He wrote every day, and used to refer to his poetry in later years as his \u201cwalking stick\u201d. Much of his adult life was beset by alcoholism and manic depression. He dealt with both courageously, drawing strength from his family, his friends and Japanese Shin Buddhism, of which he was a devotee for his last 20 years.</p> <p>A decade ago he wrote the prescient short poem At Eighty. The final stanza reads:</p> <p><em>I think I\u2019ll get there one day at a time,</em><br><em>Losing some minor defects on the way,</em><br><em>Slowly but surely learning how to live</em><br><em>In realms of light beyond my wildest dreams</em></p> <p>Marcus is survived by Maria, Eunice, and a granddaughter, Julia.</p>",

Marcus showed a precocious gift for poetry at Sherborne school, Dorset, where at 16 he received a long personal reply from TS Eliot to his own questioning letter about the poet Rimbaud. After studying English and French at St John\u2019s College, Oxford, graduating in 1961, Marcus went on to win an Eric Gregory award for promising young British poets in 1967, adjudicated that year by Ted Hughes. In the following decade he had four collections published in the UK by Anvil and Carcanet. Yeats, Pound, Neruda, Vallejo, Lorca and C\u00e9sar Calvo were among his early influences. Marcus travelled widely in Europe, South America, Canada and Japan; he was fluent in French, Spanish and Dutch. In the late 1960s he lived in France, Peru and western Ireland, teaching English and always writing. In 1965 he married Ava Paranjoti. They had a daughter, Eunice, before the marriage ended in divorce in 1969. Later, in London, Marcus met Maria Lefever, whose family were from Flanders. They settled in Bruges, marrying there in 1973. Marcus did translation work and taught adult classes. He was the official English translator at the Europees Po\u00ebziefestival, Leuven, for several years in the 1980s. But it was his poetry that drove him. He wrote every day, and used to refer to his poetry in later years as his \u201cwalking stick\u201d. Much of his adult life was beset by alcoholism and manic depression. He dealt with both courageously, drawing strength from his family, his friends and Japanese Shin Buddhism, of which he was a devotee for his last 20 years. A decade ago he wrote the prescient short poem At Eighty. The final stanza reads: I think I\u2019ll get there one day at a time, Losing some minor defects on the way, Slowly but surely learning how to live In realms of light beyond my wildest dreams Marcus is survived by Maria, Eunice, and a granddaughter, Julia.",

Surveys it has coordinated over 14 years have recorded more than 10m pieces of debris at 2,460 sites around the coastline, adding up to about 878 tonnes of rubbish \u2013 three-quarters of which is plastic.</p> <p>This plastic can range from drinking straws and plastic bottles to small fragments that clog the guts of seabirds, right up to discarded fishing nets. One study found that 9,000 of the ghost nets, found on beaches and in waters around Australia\u2019s Top End, had likely resulted in the death of between <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.12355\">4,866 and 14,600 turtles</a>.</p> <p>The best way to reduce some of this pollution is to educate people and make them care enough not to discard plastics and other waste.

Birds are equally abundant, from cormorants, pelicans and little penguins to shorebirds and waders such as oystercatchers, plovers, sandpipers and lapwings. Sadly, as Australia\u2019s population grows, beachside environments face many challenges. While water quality has improved at many beaches as deep ocean outfalls now carry sewage effluent far offshore (at Sydney\u2019s Bondi and Malabar beaches, for example), and protected species status for some coastal creatures, such as saltwater crocodiles, mean their populations have rebounded from historic lows, other problems have reached crisis point. Development, habitat loss, agricultural runoff, disruption of seabird nesting sites and four-wheel driving on beaches \u2013 as well as shark nets, drumlines and culling programs \u2013 are just some of the problems that now beset our coast. Climate change is driving a series of threats, including marine heatwaves, an increasing severity of storms and rising sea levels. There are also arguments that some of Australia\u2019s most famous beaches, including those on Fraser Island and at Noosa on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast, are being loved to death. In early January, gridlock at Hyams Beach (billed as having the world\u2019s whitest sand) in the Shoalhaven, New South Wales, saw tourists turned away after thousands of cars overwhelmed the area\u2019s 400-vehicle capacity. Australian beaches are more pristine than in many parts of the world, but plastic pollution has still reached epidemic levels, according to conservation group Tangaroa Blue Foundation. Surveys it has coordinated over 14 years have recorded more than 10m pieces of debris at 2,460 sites around the coastline, adding up to about 878 tonnes of rubbish \u2013 three-quarters of which is plastic. This plastic can range from drinking straws and plastic bottles to small fragments that clog the guts of seabirds, right up to discarded fishing nets. One study found that 9,000 of the ghost nets, found on beaches and in waters around Australia\u2019s Top End, had likely resulted in the death of between 4,866 and 14,600 turtles. The best way to reduce some of this pollution is to educate people and make them care enough not to discard plastics and other waste. Getting out and appreciating the nature along our coast and fostering in children a love of the wildlife they encounter is a significant step towards a brighter environmental future. Some of Australia\u2019s most awe-inspiring wildlife experiences can be found along our beaches. For me, these have included standing in the surf at Western Australia\u2019s Monkey Mia reserve as Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins cruised through the shallows; hearing the deep rumbling vocalisations of saltwater crocodiles in the Kimberley\u2019s remote Uunguu Indigenous protected area; watching green turtles forage and surface for air at the Low Isles on the Great Barrier Reef; and seeing dingoes stroll the sand and the silhouettes of sharks patrol the waves at Fraser Island. Elsewhere, you can feed stingrays or swim among them at WA\u2019s Hamelin Bay, walk past nesting seabirds at Queensland\u2019s Lady Elliot Island, watch little penguins return to roost at Phillip Island near Melbourne, take a guided walk through a colony of sea lions at South Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island, or chance upon kangaroos lazing on the sand at numerous locations, including Pebbly Beach at Jervis Bay. So, next time you\u2019re down at the beach, spend a bit of time looking out for the magnificent wildlife that surrounds you \u2013 and let it inspire you to take every step you can to diminish your impact on Australia\u2019s incredible environment.

      "bodyText": "An overwhelming majority of voters in the latest Guardian Essential poll say they support pill testing. The survey of 1,089 respondents, taken between 9 and 13 January found 63% of voters support pill testing where trained counsellors provide risk-reduction advice informed by on-site laboratory analysis of people\u2019s drugs. The strong level of support crosses party-political lines. The poll found 57% of Liberal/National voters support pill testing, though support is strongest among Labor (73%) and Greens (74%) voters. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Just 24% of voters oppose the idea, and roughly 12% say they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d if they support it or not. During the survey period, central coast teenager Alex Ross-King, 19, was taken to hospital from the Fomo festival at Parramatta Park in Sydney, suffering a suspected drug overdose. She subsequently died. It was the fifth drug-related festival death in four months and has reignited debate about the benefits or otherwise of pill-testing. Ross-King\u2019s relatives have called on New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian to introduce pill-testing immediately so other families would not suffer but Berejiklian said she remained opposed \u201cin the absence of evidence\u201d that it would make young people safer. The Essential poll \u2013 the first of 2019 \u2013 also shows Scott Morrison\u2019s attempt to gain voter support over the Christmas holiday period has been in vain. The Labor opposition remains ahead of the government on the two-party preferred measure by 53% to 47%. Three weeks ago, the numbers were the same, and at the beginning of December. The Coalition\u2019s primary vote is 38% and Labor is on 38%. Morrison\u2019s total approval rating has increased slightly. When asked if they approved or disapproved of the job he was doing as prime minister, 43% of voters said they approved, up from 42% in December. However, Morrison\u2019s disapproval rating has increased noticeably, at 39% (up 5 points from 34% in December). Just under a fifth of people (18%) could not give an opinion on his leadership of the country. Of Liberal/National voters, 77% approve of the job Morrison is doing (no change from December) compared to 24% of ALP voters, 24% of Greens and 36% of other voters. Bill Shorten\u2019s numbers follow a similar pattern. When asked if they approved or disapproved of the job he was doing as opposition leader, 35% approved (no change from last month), and 47% disapproved (up 4% points from 43%). Support among Labor voters for Shorten is not as high as support among Coalition supporters for Morrison. 66% of ALP voters approved of the job Shorten is doing, compared to 29% of Greens voters and 22% of Liberal/National voters. Shorten has positive approval among 18-34 year olds, with 41% approving and 34% disapproving. However 57% of those aged over 55 disapprove of his performance as opposition leader, and just 34% approved. Voters were also asked about the anti-immigration rally of far right extremists at Melbourne\u2019s St Kilda beach earlier this month. It found 74% of voters agreed with the statement \u201cthere is no place in Australian society for the use of racist and fascist symbols used by participants in the rally\u201d, while 17% disagreed and 9% said they did not know. However, a similar amount (73%) agreed with the statement \u201cAustralians have the right to peacefully protest, no matter how extreme their views\u201d, while 19% disagreed. Nearly two-thirds of voters (60%) said those attending the rally did not represent the views of the majority of Australians, while 27% believed they did. Almost half (48%) agreed that \u201cScott Morrison demonstrated poor leadership by not immediately condemning the rally, and those who attended it, in stronger terms\u201d. 36% disagreed with the statement, and 16% said they didn\u2019t know. Just 22% agreed that \u201cIt was appropriate for Queensland senator Fraser Anning to use taxpayer money to attend the rally\u201d, with 48% strongly disagreeing with this statement and 66% disagreeing overall.",

The information is all the more important as the federal government, with the support of the opposition, has given the thumbs up to the NSW government\u2019s plan to reconfigure the Menindee Lakes as part of a suite of projects to save water in the Murray Darling. The project involves shrinking the lakes and letting Lake Cawndilla run dry more often. The idea is to reduce evaporation from the shallow lake system, but there are serious questions over whether it will harm the important ecological values of the lake as a fish nursery. The NSW government can then count the water savings from reduced evaporation toward covering its shortfall of 345GL of water that it still needs to meet its obligations under the Murray Darling basin plan to deliver 1,312GL of water to the environment. The only other alternative is to buy back water licenses from irrigators \u2013 something both the NSW federal governments have been reluctant to pursue. But as Guardian Australia reported last year, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority\u2019s scientific staff delivered a scathing assessment of the project, which it said could do more harm than good. The document was part of an earlier Senate demand for papers and paints a picture of a poorly formulated project that lacks scientific rigour. \u201cGiven ecological objectives and targets have not been clearly articulated, the business case has been unable to describe their link with environmental watering requirements,\u201d the MDBA concluded. It said that further details on how the protection of ecological values of the site was required, warning that the Menindee Lakes system was a crucial nursery for juvenile fish that helped stock the entire river system. The MDBA said the NSW government\u2019s claim that identified risks were not \u201cintolerable\u201d, was far too high a bar on judging risks to the environment. It also found the proposal did not fully address potential risks and impacts to downstream water uses, including reliability of supply and water quality. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists analysed all 36 projects based on public information and concluded that only one met the MDBA\u2019s own stated criteria. But despite there being serious reservations about the Menindee Lakes project and its efficacy, the government, with the support of Labor, secured in-principle acceptance of the project and changes to the Murray Darling basin plan last year. The NSW state opposition water spokesman, Chris Minns, said Labor would put an end to the Menindee project. \u201cIf we are elected it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery piece of evidence says it can\u2019t work and won\u2019t work.\u201d Hanson-Young said she was worried that by withholding the information, Littleproud was following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Barnaby Joyce, and putting the agricultural sector ahead of the environment. \u201cAustralians want a healthy river system and a government that stands up for the environment. It\u2019s clear this government is concerned about keeping big cotton happy at the expense of the river we love,\u201d said Hanson-Young. The MDBA will convene a meeting of basin water officials on Tuesday to develop a response to the latest fish deaths.",

Orange segments If the radius of each semicircle is 5, what\u2019s the total shaded area? Solution: 100. If you rearrange the shading as below: The four triangles would fit together to make a square whose side length is the diameter of each semicircle (10). So the total area is 100. 2. Double spiral Ten equally spaced dots are joined by semicircles to make this spiral. Is more of it shaded red or orange? By how much? Solution: 4\u03c0 The insight here to imagine chopping the spiral along the blue line and shifting the right side up by 4.

Label the diameters of the two semicircles a and b, and add in lines x and y: We have three right-angled triangles here, which means we can use Pythagoras\u2019 theorem on each one. One has hypotenuse x, one has hypotenuse y and one has hypotenuse (a + b), since the angle on a circle subtended by a diameter is right angle. x2 = a2 + 22 y2 = b2 + 22 (a + b)2 = x2 + y2 If we combine these three equations to get rid of x and y we get. (a + b)2 \u2013 a2 \u2013 b2 = 8 The shaded area is the area of the large semicircle, which has radius (a + b)/2, minus a semicircle with radius a/2 minus a semicircle with radius b/2.

If the line does not go through the centre, it creates two right-angled triangles as below. a2 = x2 + 32 b2 = x2 + 12 Subtract the second equation from the first and we get a2 \u2013 b2 = 8. Since a is also the radius of the big circle, and b the radius of the small one, the shaded area is \u03c0a2 \u2013 \u03c0b2 = \u03c0(a2 \u2013 b2) = 8\u03c0. 5. Blue triangle The area of the bottom left square is 5. What\u2019s the area of the blue triangle? Solution: 10 We\u2019re going to need some extra lines as help. First, add the following diagonal to the big square. It is parallel to one of the sides of the triangle. If we call that side of the triangle its base, the triangle\u2019s height is the perpendicular distance between the base and the dotted line.

In this case, this means that if you keep the base of the blue triangle but move the apex along the dotted line, the area stays the same. So the blue triangle below has the same area as the blue triangle above. We can do the same again, this time considering the base of the blue triangle the line with the \\ slope through the middle square.

He has been active in the party for 15 years, a member for six years and president for two years.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s Wagga byelection was brought on by the resignation of former Liberal MP Daryl Maguire, after being caught <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/15/daryl-maguire-should-think-carefully-about-quitting-politics-berejiklian-says\">discussing potential developer \u201cdividends\u201d</a> over a multimillion-dollar property deal with Chinese developers and Canterbury city council.</p> <p>Taggart accused the Nationals of betraying the Coalition in order to take Wagga from the Liberal party, which had held it for 60 years. The deal meant if the Liberals lost the byelection, the Nationals would get to run at the state election \u2013 an outcome which Taggart says \u201cperversely incentivised\u201d the Nationals to disrupt the byelection.</p> <p>In his notice to Liberal members, Taggart wrote: \u201cThe National party cannot represent Liberals and the people of Wagga.</p> <p>\u201cBy initially threatening to cross the floor, the Nats caused an early byelection for which we were ill prepared \u2013 that was an act of bastardy: not what one would expect from friends and Coalition partners.</p> <p>\u201cThey undermined the Liberal campaign and in large part contributed to the defeat of our candidate.

He said he believed the Coalition agreement between the Liberals and the Nationals needed to be made public and voted on by the Liberal state council for approval.</p> <p>Taggart said the failure of the Liberal party to fully implement reforms that would see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/17/liberals-warned-party-will-split-if-nsw-preselection-reforms-rejected\">every member get a vote on preselections</a> reflected the \u201carrogance of party elites\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Liberals haven\u2019t respond well to calls for democratisation,\u201d he said. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/surprise-liberal-preselection-result-spells-end-of-jim-molan-s-senate-career-20181124-p50i3t.html\">They rolled [senator] Jim Molan</a>, a fine Australian, because we didn\u2019t get democratic reforms through.

Look at the management of the Murray-Darling. \u201cThey are a barnacle on the backside of a major party, they get less votes than the Greens, yet they exercise more power over us.\u201d The development presents another headache for McCormack in a difficult year for the Nationals. In the past 12 months, Barnaby Joyce was forced to step down as leader over sexual harassment allegations after his affair with a staffer and Andrew Broad will not recontest the next election following the \u201csugar baby\u201d revelations. The party is also facing serious questions over its management of the Murray-Darling at a federal and state level following a massive fish kill last week \u2013 an event the Nationals put down to low water levels due to drought. Taggart has invited Liberal members in the Wagga electorate to a meeting on Saturday to discuss the deal to allow a National candidate, Mackenna Powell, to run at the seat in the state election without a Liberal challenger. Normally, there would be a three-cornered contest in a non-Coalition seat. He said his branch largely blames the National party for undermining Liberal candidate Julia Ham in the 2017 state byelection, which saw the Liberals lose the seat to rural independent Joe McGirr. Taggart said he warned his friend and local federal MP, McCormack, at the time of the byelection in an email that it would cause trouble in the Coalition relationship. \u201cThe Nats were criticising the way she was dressing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was mean, spiteful and sexist.\u201d After the byelection result, a bitter fight broke out, with Nationals upper house MLC Wes Fang confirming to the Australian he had sent abusive text messages to fellow Liberal MLC Matthew Mason-Cox, after Mason-Cox was critical of the National party\u2019s role in the loss. The tension has now boiled over again, with members of the Wagga branch set to discuss the motion: \u201cIf the Liberal party will not run an endorsed candidate in March, this [State Electoral Conference] resolves to support an independent Liberal.\u201d In a members\u2019 email, Taggart wrote: \u201cWagga has never been represented by the Nats and never will be with your help and support.\u201d Taggart has vowed he will stand as an independent Liberal if no one else will represent Liberal party values \u2013 describing the Nationals as \u201cagrarian socialists\u201d. \u201cI think Joe will win, I know him well, he is a champagne socialist but a lovely bloke,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cBut I think we should be running an independent candidate to show Liberal voters we have an alternative to the Nats.\u201d He contacted Rohan Boehm, a co-founder of Anyone But Nats, even though the movement has campaigned strongly on issues such as climate change and coal seam gas, which Taggart described as \u201clefty\u201d issues. Taggart has also invited Cory Bernardi\u2019s Australian Conservatives, David Leyonhjelm and One Nation\u2019s Mark Latham into the seat ahead of the election. \u201cMy essential point is my enemy\u2019s enemy is my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI am in a bind because I want to vote for Coalition but I don\u2019t want a triple lock here \u2013 a Nat in the upper house in [upper house MLC] Wes Fang, Michael McCormack federally and then a Nat at state level. \u201cPeople need to know they have other choices.\u201d Taggart is a Belfast immigrant who publishes corporate magazines and moved to Wagga 15 years ago with his Wagga-born wife. He has been active in the party for 15 years, a member for six years and president for two years. Last year\u2019s Wagga byelection was brought on by the resignation of former Liberal MP Daryl Maguire, after being caught discussing potential developer \u201cdividends\u201d over a multimillion-dollar property deal with Chinese developers and Canterbury city council. Taggart accused the Nationals of betraying the Coalition in order to take Wagga from the Liberal party, which had held it for 60 years. The deal meant if the Liberals lost the byelection, the Nationals would get to run at the state election \u2013 an outcome which Taggart says \u201cperversely incentivised\u201d the Nationals to disrupt the byelection. In his notice to Liberal members, Taggart wrote: \u201cThe National party cannot represent Liberals and the people of Wagga. \u201cBy initially threatening to cross the floor, the Nats caused an early byelection for which we were ill prepared \u2013 that was an act of bastardy: not what one would expect from friends and Coalition partners. \u201cThey undermined the Liberal campaign and in large part contributed to the defeat of our candidate. They also deprived Liberals of the opportunity to put forward a candidate in March. \u201cLiberals cannot and will not reward that treachery by electing a Nat to the seat of Wagga. If the Nats are elected, Liberals will never be able to field a candidate again and the party is effectively dead in Wagga.\u201d He took action as president because of the \u201cwhite hot rage amongst the Liberal matriarchs\u201d, who had worked so hard raising money through cake stalls and card games. Taggart said that ideally the branch would like to see a Liberal candidate stand in a three-cornered contest in March and at every election but he admitted it was a little late to organise now as a result of the Coalition deal. But he said it was \u201cgalling\u201d to see the NSW Nationals leader, John Barilaro, McCormack and the National candidate all at the opening of stage three of the newly revamped Wagga Hospital when McGirr, the local independent member and doctor, was not even invited. He said the stoush would not be contained to the state election and also accused sections of his own party of arrogance. He said he believed the Coalition agreement between the Liberals and the Nationals needed to be made public and voted on by the Liberal state council for approval. Taggart said the failure of the Liberal party to fully implement reforms that would see every member get a vote on preselections reflected the \u201carrogance of party elites\u201d. \u201cThe Liberals haven\u2019t respond well to calls for democratisation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey rolled [senator] Jim Molan, a fine Australian, because we didn\u2019t get democratic reforms through. The party seems beset by this moderate faction, so they just say \u2018leave it up to the Nats\u2019.\u201d McCormack and Fang\u2019s offices both said Taggart\u2019s motion was an internal matter for the Liberal party. Guardian Australia has also sought comment from the NSW National party office. A spokesman for NSW Liberal party said the party had already announced its intention not to contest the Wagga byelection.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, UK stocks have ended the day in the red. The FTSE 100 index has closed 63 points lower at 6,855, down 0.9%. Worries over China\u2019s slowing economy, and the threat of a eurozone recession, weighed on markets. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC both shed around 0.4%. Donald Trump\u2019s optimism over a China trade deal (see here) hasn\u2019t prevented shares dropping on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 110 points, or 0.46%, at 23,885 points. The Nasdaq has shed almost 1%, amid worries that tech companies will suffer from China\u2019s slowdown. David Madden of CMC Markets says China\u2019s weak December trade data has hurt morale: The major indices are lower today as sentiment has been soured by the Chinese trade figures. The fall in Chinese exports will be welcomed by the Trump administration as it will be seen as a sign that the trade war strategy is working. Also, the gloomy import numbers show that the Chinese economy is slowing, and that might prompt Beijing to soften its stance with regards trade relations. Today\u2019s gloomy trade and factory output data has given investors plenty to worry about, as my colleague Richard Partington explains: Fears are growing over the state of the global economy after China recorded a shock plunge in exports, while European factory output slumped by the biggest margin in almost three years. In a sign of the world economy reaching a tipping point, official figures showed that Chinese exports dropped by 4.4% in December, in the largest fall since 2016, on the back of faltering demand in most of its key markets. Imports also slipped by 7.6% to reflect waning demand at home. The unexpected downturn for the biggest global exporter of manufactured products came as eurozone industrial output also tumbled in November, with the largest drop in factory activity since February 2016. The EU statistics office, Eurostat, estimated industrial production slipped by 1.7% in November compared with the previous month and by 3.3% on the year, reflecting the struggles facing several European economies in recent months. Financial markets around the world sold off sharply on Monday, with the FTSE 100 shedding about 70 points and losses on bourses across Europe. Reminder: The US and China only have until the end of February to reach a trade deal. Otherwise, president Trump will hike the tariff on over $200bn of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, probably triggering fresh retaliation from Beijing. US officials are continuing to work, despite the US government shutdown, reports journalist Edward Lawrence. Newsflash: Donald Trump has predicted that the US and China will reach a deal to end the trade war. Speaking to reporters in Washington, the US president claimed that his official are winning concessions that previous administrations would have been laughed at for requesting. Trump said that China is suffering hard times due to the tariffs on goods sold to America, adding: China wants to negotiate.... I have a great relationship with president Xi. Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets has dug into today\u2019s Chinese trade slowdown data. She\u2019s spotted that imports from the US slumped by a third in December, while imports from Brazil surged. She writes: Unsurprisingly, China\u2019s imports from the US have been hit hardest \u2013 flat in September, -2%y/y in Oct, -25%y/y in Nov and now -36%y/y in December (-$6bn) and Brazil appears to be the major beneficiary, with Chinese imports up over 40%y/y (+$2bn). US bank Citigroup has shown the impact of last autumn\u2019s market turmoil. Citi kicked off the Wall Street bank reporting season by revealing that income at its fixed-income arm (bond trading) slumped by a fifth in the last quarter of 2018. That helped to pull overall Q4 revenue by 2% to $17.1bn, below forecasts of $17.5bn. CEO Michael Corbat blamed market turbulence, which drove many clients to the sidelines, saying: \u201cA volatile fourth quarter impacted some of our market-sensitive businesses. CFO John Gerspach has told reporters that conditions have improved in January, adding that the slowdown in China has not been particularly disruptive. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s a chart showing the weak Chinese trade data that spooked markets overnight (exports down 4.4% in November, imports down over 7%). The US stock market is expected to drop around 1% when trading begins in 70 minutes time. The surprise drop in Chinese exports and the worse-than-expected eurozone factory output, is weighing on Wall Street - as the US government shutdown drags on. In London, the FTSE 100 is still in the red (currently down 60 points at 6855). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the day so far: Europe\u2019s Chinese concerns only ramped up as Monday went on, with the Dow Jones set to fret after the bell rings on Wall Street. Given that the commodity sector is rightly edgy every time some bad news comes out of Beijing, it stands to reason that the oil and mining-heavy FTSE was the worst hit of the major indices. As Brent Crude lost 1.5%, and copper dropped 1.3%, the FTSE fell back under 6850 thanks to a 1% slide, the likes of BP, Shell, Anglo American and Antofagasta causing the brunt of the decline. Simon Rabinovitch of The Economist has pointed out that the US-China trade gap has widened substantially since Donald Trump became president: Political turmoil in Greece has intensified. The confidence vote called by prime minister Alexis Tsipras following the withdrawal from office of the Independent Greeks party, will now take place on Wednesday afternoon. The uncertainty has caused shares on the Athens stock market to fall, amid investor fears that the uncertainty could lead to early elections, reports our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens. Bank shares dropped 3.8% this morning as investors digested the spectre of renewed political instability in the euro zone\u2019s most fragile member state. Much will depend on how Tsipras \u201cinterprets\u201d the vote which analysts believe he will win \u2013 if by a slim margin. In true Trumpian style, the Independent Greeks leader Panos Kammenos resorted to Twitter this morning to expel two of his MPs, including Elena Kondoura, the tourism minister, from his party\u2019s ranks after both confirmed that they will be backing Tsipras in the confidence vote- and the looming Macedonia name change deal which prompted the nationalist politician to withdraw from the leftist-led coalition. \u201cMrs Kontoura, with an official announcement, decided to exchange her vote and the name Macedonia for the ministerial chair. I am expelling her from AN.EL\u2019s parliamentary group,\u201d the tweet read. Alastair Neame, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says eurozone manufacturers are struggling as the global economy slows, As a major exporter, the state of the global economy matters to Eurozone manufacturers. The trade dispute that erupted during the summer between the US and China has dragged down global trade growth and has spilled over into wider supply chains. Although temporary factors like new emissions standards may be affecting car production, the rise of protectionism and uncertainty are likely to have a long lasting impact on the sector\u2019s fortunes.\u201c Newsflash: The OECD thinktank has just warned that growth momentum is \u201ceasing\u201d in most major economies. In a new assessment of the world\u2019s largest economies, the OECD says the biggest declines coming in France and Britain. The OECD said its composite leading indicators, gauges of economic activity that are designed to anticipate turning points relative to past performance for between six to nine months ahead, also showed easing growth momentum in the US, Germany, Canada, Italy and the euro area as a whole. The Paris-based thinktank says: In the United States and Germany, the tentative signs of easing growth momentum, that were flagged in last month\u2019s assessment, have been confirmed with easing growth momentum remaining the assessment for Canada, the United Kingdom and the euro area as a whole, including France and Italy. The OECD adds that Brazil appears to be slowing (after a period of growth) while China is now experiencing \u201cstable growth momentum\u201d (after a downturn). European stock markets have fallen deeper into the red, following the disappointing fall in eurozone factory output. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 66 points, or almost 1%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has shed 1.25%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is 0.75% lighter. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at Dutch bank ING, fears that some of Europe\u2019s largest economies could suffer a recession soon. He says November\u2019s decline in industrial production sinks hopes that growth picked up at the end of 2018: Fears of a technical recession in large Eurozone economies are mounting as industrial production in November provided a harsh reality-check for economists. The third quarter slowdown to just 0.2% GDP growth was expected to be followed by a bounce back in Q4, but the evidence is mounting that this is unlikely. Surveys have been dismal throughout the quarter, and actual production data is now confirming that bleak view on the Eurozone economy. Industrial production declined by -1.7% month-on-month in November and by -3.3% compared to November last year. Consumption looks to have performed somewhat better, but concerns about a technical recession in Germany and Italy are nonetheless rising. A \u201ctechnical recession\u201d is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Both Germany and Italy contracted in the third quarter of 2018 (by 0.2% and 0.1% respectively), so they\u2019re halfway there already.... This sharp fall in eurozone industrial production suggests the world economy faltered in the last few months, warns Teis Knithsen of Kirk Kapital: Ireland suffered the biggest drop in industrial production in November, down by 7.5% month-on-month. That was followed by Portugal (-2.5%), and Germany and Lithuania (both down 1.9%). On an annual basis, eurozone industrial production was 3.3% lower than in November 2017 - a hefty fall. Newsflash: Factories across the eurozone have suffered their biggest plunge in output in almost three years, in another sign that the world economy is slowing. Industrial production across the euro area shank by 1.7% in November, data body Eurostat just reported. That\u2019s the worst decline since February 2016, and worse than expected (economists had been braced for trouble, after weak data from Italy, Germany, France and Spain last week). The slump is broad-based, with production of heavy duty goods and consumer products both sliding. Eurostat says: In the euro area in November 2018, compared with October 2018, the production of capital goods fell by 2.3%, durable consumer goods by 1.7%, intermediate goods by 1.2%, non-durable consumer goods by 1.0% and energy by 0.6%. In the EU28, the production of capital goods fell by 1.6%, intermediate goods by 1.1%, durable consumer goods by 1.0%, non-durable consumer goods by 0.6% and energy by 0.5%. This is likely to fuel concerns that the eurozone economy is slowing, and could even suffer a recession in 2019 (Germany, its latest member, suffered a 0.2% drop in GDP in July-September 2018). More to follow.... Patrick Zweifel, chief economist at Pictet Asset Management, argues that China needs to strike a trade deal quickly, and also implement more growth-friendly policies. This chart highlights how China\u2019s export growth took a tumble last month, with the worst decline in two years: China\u2019s economy will probably slow sharply this year, taking a bite out of global growth, reckons Neil Shearing of Capital Economics. He writes: Both fiscal and monetary policy have been loosened over the past few months and this should start to feed through to the real economy by the second half of this year. However, the scale of the stimulus so far has been more limited than in 2015-16, and the effect on activity is likely to be correspondingly smaller. All of this means that, while China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t facing an imminent collapse, neither is it in a particularly good place. Growth in 2019 is likely to be weaker than in 2018 and this will play a significant role in the coming global slowdown. We estimate that slower growth in China will shave about 0.2%-points off world GDP growth this year compared to 2018. Shearing also argue that the slowdown is primarily due to \u201cdomestic headwinds\u201d \u2013 including tighter credit conditions \u2013 rather than the US trade war. Independent economist Shaun Richards agrees: European stock markets have all fallen in early trading, as China\u2019s weak trade performance last month spooks investors. In London the FTSE 100 has dipped by nearly 30 points, or 0.4%. Mining stocks are among the fallers, reflecting concerns that Chinese demand for iron ore, copper etc is fading. Across Europe, luxury goods makers are also under pressure, as China is a key growth market for many. LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton) is down 2%, while Prada has lost 5%. Today\u2019s trade data also shows that China\u2019s soybean imports fell by 7.9% during 2018. That\u2019s the first annual drop since 2011. China imposed tariffs on US soybeans last year, in response to US tariffs on its goods. That was a blow to American soybean farmers, for whom China was a crucial markets, and helps explain how China\u2019s trade surplus with the US actually grew last year. Ophir Gottleib of financial analyst group Capital Market Laboratories argues that its time for Washington and Beijing to end the trade war, before the situation worsens. Copper and aluminium prices are falling today, as China\u2019s weak trade figures spook the sector. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says: The December trade figures are hammering commodity markets lower as this data drives home just how negative of an impact trade war is having on the Chinese economy, and perhaps the global economy too. Investors are alarmed by the 4.4% tumble in China\u2019s exports last month, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: He fears Donald Trump\u2019s trade war is bringing the Chinese economy to its knees. The Chinese trade numbers released today got all the alarm bells ringing once again. If you ever need any evidence that how the trade spat can impact the country\u2019s economic health then this number is clearly a major factor here. The lower export number also means that lower jobs which means another direct impact on the economy. Donald Trump may be pleased to see these numbers because it shows that his policies have clearly brought China to its knees. Clearly, Beijing must do something to put a stop to this chaos. President Trump may actually beat his chest even more by looking at the fact that China\u2019s trade surplus with the US is at a 10-year high. What was that about trade wars being \u201cgood and easy to win\u201d, Mr President? Despite exports slumping in December, China\u2019s overall trade surplus with the US for 2018 swelled to $323bn \u2014 the highest on record. Reuters has the details: Exports to the U.S. rose 11.3% on-year in 2018, while imports from the U.S. to China rose a meagre 0.7% over the same period. China\u2019s overall trade surplus for 2018 was $351.76 billion, the government said. Exports in the whole of 2018 rose 9.9% from 2017 while imports grew 15.8% over the same period, official dollar-denominated data showed. That will not please Donald Trump. It shows that his policy of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods hasn\u2019t narrowed the lopsided trade gap. That\u2019s partly because the trade dispute has weakened the yuan against the US dollar, cushioning the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs (and making US goods less competitive in China). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the health of the global economy are sweeping through the markets today, after China reported a sharp drop in trade last month. Chinese exports shrank by 4 .4% year-on-year in December, official data shows, much worse than economists had expected. That\u2019s the worst decline in two years, indicating that global demand has been hit by the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington. Imports slumped by 7.6% year-on-year, which also suggests the world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling. Analysts had expected export growth to slow to 3% with imports up 5% year-on-year, according to Reuters data. It\u2019s the latest signal that China\u2019s economy could be stumbling; we already knew that car sales fell in 2018, and that factory output shrank in December. Zhou Hao, an economist with Commerzbank AG in Singapore, says the trade data shows a \u201cclear downward trend\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is not just due to the trade war and tariffs. On top of those, the major drag is slowing global demand.\u201d Asian stock markets have fallen into the red today, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index down 0.7%. Europe is also expected to open lower, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains. This morning\u2019s numbers showed that far from improving the trade picture deteriorated further with exports declining 4.4%, as the global economic picture became more worrying. Much more concerning for an economy supposedly rebalancing away from big industry the import data slowed as well, reflecting a sharp slowdown in internal demand sliding 7.6%, missing expectations of a 4.5% rise. Disappointment over this mornings data has seen Asia markets slip back and will see European markets open lower this morning. Also coming up today The pound could be volatile, as Theresa May launches a last-gasp effort to persuade MPs to back her Brexit bill ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote (which she\u2019s still expected to lose heavily). UK retailer Debenhams is locked in a battle for survival after its biggest shareholder, Mike Ashley of Sports Direct, forced its chairman out last week. There are fears that a rescue package could cost thousands of jobs. Greece faces fresh political instability, after the right-wing Independent Greeks party pulled out of the country\u2019s coalition government in a row over Greece\u2019s naming deal with neighbouring Macedonia. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras now faces a confidence vote in parliament later this week. That\u2019s not what the eurozone needs, on top of its slowdown worries. New industrial production figures due this morning are likely to be poor. The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone industrial production data for November",

But that does not mean the US cannot push the organisation to share power on a more equitable basis and make support conditional on its willingness to share power with other groups (Kurdish and Arab). The objective here would be to establish credible and legitimate governing structures as well as alternative partners to the YPG, who can then alleviate some of Turkey\u2019s concerns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/22/trump-syria-withdrawal-islamic-state-us-terror\">Trump\u2019s Syria withdrawal has handed a huge gift to Islamic State | Janine di Giovanni</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are limited alternatives.

      "bodyText": "Since last month\u2019s announcement that the US will imminently withdraw its troops from Syria, President Trump has backtracked. The White House has declared that the withdrawal may yet take a number of months, amid a series of other contradictory remarks from senior American officials over whether the US plans to withdraw its troops entirely or to maintain some presence in eastern Syria. On Sunday Trump generated further confusion by declaring plans for a \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria across the border with Turkey (without explaining who would enforce this zone, and where it would be located), even declaring that the US would \u201cdevastate Turkey economically\u201d if it attacked Syria\u2019s Kurds. A precipitous withdrawal would be indeed be bad news: it could pave the way for an Islamic State resurgence \u2013 the jihadist organisation is thought to still have 30,000 fighters at large in Syria and Iraq \u2013 as well as expanded Iranian influence. And both of these outcomes could be hastened if there is a conflict between Turkey and Syria\u2019s Kurds. Turkey has national security concerns over the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), the organisation that dominates the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has fought alongside the US under the auspices of the campaign to defeat Isis. The YPG is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for more than 40 years. The future of the YPG in Syria\u2019s north-east, where it established its own self-governed autonomous region during the civil war, is a thorn in Turkey-US relations that first emerged under the Obama administration. Yet the US has still failed to establish a sustainable, viable strategy that can alleviate Turkish concerns but also maintain the SDF as a buffer against the Assad regime and Iran, as well as the critical fighting force it has been in the war on Isis. It is not too late. A potential US withdrawal combined with widespread concerns of a bloody Turkish-YPG conflict has added urgency and impetus to the need to find a compromise with Ankara over the future of the SDF. The US, in concert with its European (particularly French) allies, should push Turkey and the YPG to make some difficult choices. Ankara\u2019s long-term approach to the Kurdish question in Syria would be to go back to the 2014 peace process aimed at ending its conflict with the PKK. That could still be revitalised down the line and provide a lasting solution. In the meantime, Turkey must be appreciative of the reality that US interests in Syria, and those of its allies, can only be secured if there are reliable on-the-ground partners who provide immediate solutions in a difficult landscape. The YPG has been that solution, filling a security void in 2014 at a critical moment for the international community. But that does not mean the US cannot push the organisation to share power on a more equitable basis and make support conditional on its willingness to share power with other groups (Kurdish and Arab). The objective here would be to establish credible and legitimate governing structures as well as alternative partners to the YPG, who can then alleviate some of Turkey\u2019s concerns. There are limited alternatives. Turkey lacks the capacity to suppress the YPG in eastern Syria (it has attempted, and failed, to defeat the PKK within and across its borders without success for decades). It would struggle to keep the peace in the Kurdish-dominated northeast if it deployed its already stretched armed forces, risking in the process a quagmire that enables the ascendancy of jihadist terrorist groups. The YPG could turn to and embrace the Syrian regime if it is left to choose between either a Turkish onslaught or negotiations with an administration that is in the process of normalising its relationship with the international community. The YPG is inseparable from Syria\u2019s security and governing structures, yet Turkey will lose the capacity to shape the landscape altogether if the YPG is forced into the regime\u2019s orbit of influence. Contrary to the hyperbole surrounding Turkish apprehensions toward the YPG, Ankara has in fact engaged the Democratic Union party (PYD), the YPG\u2019s political wing, before and has hosted its head, Salih Muslim. The Turkish government is not entirely averse to negotiating with the organisation, while Ankara found in the 90s that by cooperating with the US and by developing stronger relations with the Iraqi Kurds, it became far more capable of influencing events in Iraq. A compromise is not beyond reach. The US, Turkey and YPG all stand to lose if Assad and his backers take control of the east. It would be the worst outcome for the Syrian people and the region at large. \u2022 Ranj Alaaldin is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Doha",

Instead, every second is packed with singing, dancing, rap and rhyme. It can be a little overwhelming at first, especially for the more timid kids (and adults). But this is an infectiously immersive affair that encourages the children to lean into theatre and dance to their own beat. The show is set in Hip Hop Town, which designer Marcello Chiarenza has filled with model buildings plastered in vibrant graffiti. Oli Polidore Perrins (AKA MC Solocypher) is the show\u2019s pied piper and, backed by Kadialy Kouyate on the kora (a West African string instrument) and original music produced by Richard Edwards and co-composed with Kayoute, MC Solocypher leads the kids in a merry dance. Solocypher is also a teacher and, with quirky support from Katherine Vernez Gray and lyrics provided by hip-hop artist Breis, he creates a show that feels spontaneous and cheeky but always in control. Writer Tim Webb has woven in a story about a runaway pram, but it\u2019s really just a hook on which to hang a series of sparky musical performances. Each skit explores a different sense. At the Sound Shop, the kids bark out animal noises into a sound catcher; at the Cloth Shop they scream out rap rhymes as they\u2019re draped in fabric; at the Scent Shop they smell perfumes while (naturally) a puppet break-dances and sings; finally, we arrive at the Light Shop. A hall of mirrors is revealed and the kids scramble forward, eager to see themselves in a bold new light. Touring until 17 February. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2019 because an earlier version only credited Breis for the music in the show. Breis provided the lyrics and was the musical director; the music was composed and produced by Richard Edwards and co-composed with Kadialy Kouyate.",

      "body": "<p>Tuesday\u2019s vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is one of the most keenly anticipated Commons events in years. The result, and the scale of it, will trigger one or several of a series of outcomes. The precise choreography of what will happen is anyone\u2019s guess, but here are some of the possible scenarios.</p> \n<h2>May wins</h2> \n<p>The most straightforward, if unlikely, result of the vote. Should May somehow tempt enough rebels back to her view and prevail, there would be an agreed departure deal with which the EU could work, and it would be full steam ahead to 29 March. Yes, there would be more fierce and endless arguments on everything from the backstop to the future trade deal, but the basics would be there.</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood rating: 1/5</strong></p> \n<h2>May loses and pledges to try again</h2> \n<p>Barring a particularly big defeat for the prime minister, this is what many MPs believe will come next: May makes a rapid statement saying she will go back to Brussels and seek more concessions, notably on the backstop.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday\u2019s vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is one of the most keenly anticipated Commons events in years. The result, and the scale of it, will trigger one or several of a series of outcomes. The precise choreography of what will happen is anyone\u2019s guess, but here are some of the possible scenarios. May wins The most straightforward, if unlikely, result of the vote. Should May somehow tempt enough rebels back to her view and prevail, there would be an agreed departure deal with which the EU could work, and it would be full steam ahead to 29 March. Yes, there would be more fierce and endless arguments on everything from the backstop to the future trade deal, but the basics would be there. Likelihood rating: 1/5 May loses and pledges to try again Barring a particularly big defeat for the prime minister, this is what many MPs believe will come next: May makes a rapid statement saying she will go back to Brussels and seek more concessions, notably on the backstop. The thinking is that once the EU has seen the concrete evidence of MPs\u2019 views, it will be more likely to come up with something genuinely new, to try to avoid a no-deal departure. Those being most targeted for a change of heart would be the Democratic Unionist party, Tory waverers and Labour MPs from leave-minded seats. Likelihood rating: 3/5 Article 50 is extended Seen as a necessary adjunct to the above tactic \u2013 and perhaps needed in just about any scenario \u2013 this has now been unofficially promised by the EU. The most likely variant would be a \u201ctechnical\u201d extension until July or thereabouts, to allow more time for a second vote, and to pass other Brexit-related legislation. But if there was something new afoot, whether an election or a second referendum, a longer timetable could be offered. Likelihood rating: 4/5 May loses and a plan B emerges Some Conservative MPs predict that if the margin of defeat is heavy, May could finally decide \u2013 or be persuaded \u2013 to drop her long-held plan, seek an extension to article 50 and embark on a cross-party push for a more consensual Brexit, perhaps based on a Norway model.

Many argue that the most likely way to bring about a second referendum would be if Labour formally threw its weight behind the idea. However, Corbyn has made it plain that his preferred route would be to negotiate a different Brexit deal.

      "body": "<h2>LEAVE IT OUT</h2> \n<p>Traditionally more famous for his rants about referees than referendums, Neil Warnock has cut an uncharacteristically chilled out figure since securing promotion to the Premier League with Cardiff City last season. Having spent the past five months wandering from ground to ground openly marvelling at the how big and shiny and expensive everything seems, the 70-year-old has recently gone all Old Man Yells At Cloud \u2013 first with Nathaniel Clyne and then in a post-match lament about the European Union that might well have been entitled You Lost, Get Over It.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/neil-warnock-cardiff-city-brexit-leave\">Neil Warnock on Brexit: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to leave. To hell with the rest of the world\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Asked if the UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU at the end of March \u2013 just a month or two before Cardiff\u2019s scheduled exit from the Premier League \u2013 would harm the chances of top-flight clubs buying players from abroad, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/neil-warnock-cardiff-city-brexit-leave\">Warnock was decidedly outspoken</a> about folk who sided with the Leave campaign only to change their minds after discovering they\u2019d been fed a pack of lies. \u201cI don\u2019t know why politicians don\u2019t do what the country wanted, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d said Warnock from his position in front of an advert encouraging all present to Visit Malaysia. \u201cWe had a referendum and now we see different politicians and everybody else trying to put their foot in it with Theresa [May], instead of getting behind her, y\u2019know. Why did we have a referendum in the first bloody place? I can\u2019t wait to get out of \u2018em, if I\u2019m honest. I think we\u2019ll be far better off out of the bloody thing, me, in every aspect. And to hell with the rest of the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>The rest of the world, eh? Specifically anywhere that is not British, including the respective homelands of Cardiff\u2019s owner, chief suit and chairman, not to mention eight different countries represented by assorted players in his dressing room who have come over here to take the jobs of proper, more honest British footballers who have made their gaffer a very wealthy man.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, Warnock is at least consistent in his views unlike many of those he criticised.

      "bodyText": "LEAVE IT OUT Traditionally more famous for his rants about referees than referendums, Neil Warnock has cut an uncharacteristically chilled out figure since securing promotion to the Premier League with Cardiff City last season. Having spent the past five months wandering from ground to ground openly marvelling at the how big and shiny and expensive everything seems, the 70-year-old has recently gone all Old Man Yells At Cloud \u2013 first with Nathaniel Clyne and then in a post-match lament about the European Union that might well have been entitled You Lost, Get Over It. Asked if the UK\u2019s scheduled exit from the EU at the end of March \u2013 just a month or two before Cardiff\u2019s scheduled exit from the Premier League \u2013 would harm the chances of top-flight clubs buying players from abroad, Warnock was decidedly outspoken about folk who sided with the Leave campaign only to change their minds after discovering they\u2019d been fed a pack of lies. \u201cI don\u2019t know why politicians don\u2019t do what the country wanted, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d said Warnock from his position in front of an advert encouraging all present to Visit Malaysia. \u201cWe had a referendum and now we see different politicians and everybody else trying to put their foot in it with Theresa [May], instead of getting behind her, y\u2019know. Why did we have a referendum in the first bloody place? I can\u2019t wait to get out of \u2018em, if I\u2019m honest. I think we\u2019ll be far better off out of the bloody thing, me, in every aspect. And to hell with the rest of the world.\u201d The rest of the world, eh? Specifically anywhere that is not British, including the respective homelands of Cardiff\u2019s owner, chief suit and chairman, not to mention eight different countries represented by assorted players in his dressing room who have come over here to take the jobs of proper, more honest British footballers who have made their gaffer a very wealthy man. If nothing else, Warnock is at least consistent in his views unlike many of those he criticised. Following his side\u2019s defeat at the hands of Wolves last April, Warnock repeatedly told his Portuguese opposite number, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo to \u201cEff off!\u201d for not shaking his hand immediately after the game. \u201cIf that\u2019s how they\u2019re taught in Portugal fair enough, but not in Britain!\u201d Disquiet at Cardiff in the wake of his more recent comments suggest the Yorkshireman may have got a carpeting and that anyone expecting to see assorted misleading Leave campaign slogans adorning the side of the team bus any time soon is likely to be disappointed. \u201cComments made by our manager following Saturday\u2019s fixture are representative of his personal political stance,\u201d read a statement. \u201cThese comments do not reflect the political position of Cardiff City Football Club, nor its board of directors.\u201d They do, however, reflect the political position of a man who began his life as a footballer over 50 years ago on the right-wing and remains there to this day. TONIGHT ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton from 8pm GMT for hot minute-by-minute action from Manchester City 2-1 Wolves. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWhen they went down, he spent \u00a350m odd to get them back up, of his own money.

Brexiters fear this will turn out to be a permanent arrangement, standing in the way of Britain pursuing an independent trade policy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As you know, since the suspension of the debate in my parliament, I have proposed a legal commitment to have our future partnership in place by the end of 2021 at the very latest.</p> </blockquote> <p>The prime minister has been fruitlessly seeking a deadline for the completion of trade talks to ensure that the backstop would only ever last for 12 months were it to come into force.</p> <h2><strong>What Tusk and Juncker </strong><strong>said:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s reply to Theresa May\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Response From President Juncker and President Tusk to the Prime Minister\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/397428786/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=false&access_key=key-MXfXoogFx0py58Mgsxxj\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"null\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As you know, we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>The EU has insisted that the deal agreed with May is the final deal, and there will not be a renegotiation, or any legal interpretation that cuts across it. That includes attempts by May to secure a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop, or a time limit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On 13 December, the European council (article 50) decided on a number of additional assurances.</p> </blockquote> <p>The 27 heads of state and government offered warm words on the temporary nature of the backstop at the last summit, and went further than before in promising to get out of the arrangement as quickly as possible should it be triggered. The EU fears that the importance of this pledge, which would have legal standing, has not been fully appreciated in parliament.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Should national ratifications be pending \u2026 the commission is ready to propose provisional application of relevant parts of the future relationship.</p> </blockquote> <p>The EU is promising to bring the trade deal into force before the parliaments of the 27 member states have ratified its terms.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The commission can confirm that, just like the United Kingdom, the European Union does not wish to see the backstop enter into force.

      "bodyText": "The legal and political assurances promised by Theresa May on the backstop before Tuesday\u2019s vote are detailed in an exchange of letters between the prime minister and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Donald Tusk, the European council president. The EU\u2019s letter is not legally binding, but the UK could use it as evidence in any future dispute over the triggering or termination of the backstop. What the prime minister said: The deal is at risk \u2026 because of concerns in the UK parliament about how we are delivering on our commitments in relation to Northern Ireland\u2019s border with Ireland. The Irish backstop solution for avoiding a hard border involves the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU if an alternative arrangement cannot be found. Brexiters fear this will turn out to be a permanent arrangement, standing in the way of Britain pursuing an independent trade policy. As you know, since the suspension of the debate in my parliament, I have proposed a legal commitment to have our future partnership in place by the end of 2021 at the very latest. The prime minister has been fruitlessly seeking a deadline for the completion of trade talks to ensure that the backstop would only ever last for 12 months were it to come into force. What Tusk and Juncker said: As you know, we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement. The EU has insisted that the deal agreed with May is the final deal, and there will not be a renegotiation, or any legal interpretation that cuts across it. That includes attempts by May to secure a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop, or a time limit. On 13 December, the European council (article 50) decided on a number of additional assurances. The 27 heads of state and government offered warm words on the temporary nature of the backstop at the last summit, and went further than before in promising to get out of the arrangement as quickly as possible should it be triggered. The EU fears that the importance of this pledge, which would have legal standing, has not been fully appreciated in parliament. Should national ratifications be pending \u2026 the commission is ready to propose provisional application of relevant parts of the future relationship. The EU is promising to bring the trade deal into force before the parliaments of the 27 member states have ratified its terms. The commission can confirm that, just like the United Kingdom, the European Union does not wish to see the backstop enter into force. Were it to do so, it would represent a suboptimal trading arrangement for both sides. Rather than hoping to trap the UK into the backstop, the EU fears that the lack of parity in terms of level-playing commitments could lead to the UK having an economic advantage. A temporary shared customs territory would also raise complications for Brussels when it sought to strike trade deals with the rest of the world. Facilitative arrangements and technologies will be considered. The political declaration on the future trade deal suggests that the permanent solution for avoiding a hard border would build on the customs union in the backstop. This clause in the letter emphasises that this need not be the case and the EU is open to the technological solutions backed by a large number of Brexiters, if they can be shown to work. The commission is committed to providing the necessary political impetus and resources to help achieving the objective of making this period as short as possible. The heads of state and government removed the suggestion in its December communique that the backstop would be in place for a \u201cshort\u201d period, for fear that this could not be guaranteed due to the vagaries of the negotiations. The commission has done its best to shoehorn the phrase back in, and is offering biannual EU-UK summits to check on progress.",

A team of more than 50 people spent two years examining pollinators and plants in Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds and Reading.</p> <p>The results enabled them to work out the best ways to support a rich mix of pollinator species that will be resilient to climate change and other challenges. The best strategy is increasing the number of allotments, the report says. Planting preferred flowers in gardens also helps, as does mowing grass in public parks less frequently, allowing flowers to bloom.</p> <p>Allotments are particularly good places for pollinators because they provide a mix of fruit and vegetable flowers, plus weedy corners full of native plants. \u201cAllotments are incredibly important at a city level, despite their small area,\u201d said Katherine Baldock at the University of Bristol, who led the research. \u201cThey are a good place for pollinators to hang out and provide a win-win situation, as they are also good for food growing and for people\u2019s health.\u201d</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0769-y\">published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution</a>, found allotments and gardens often had 10 times more bees than parks, cemeteries and urban nature reserves. Baldock said nature reserves were important for other wildlife but were often less suitable for pollinators, being dominated by trees rather than meadows.</p> <p>The scientists also identified the flowers most visited by bees, hoverflies and other pollinators. Native favourites included brambles, buttercups, dandelions, creeping thistle, common hogweed and ox-eye daisies. \u201cPeople tend to think of these as weeds, but they are really important for pollinators,\u201d said Baldock.</p> <p>She said gardeners had an important role to play in pollinator conservation, with the non-native plants that attracted the most pollinators being lavender, borage, butterfly bushes and common marigolds. Hydrangeas and forget-me-nots were among the least favourite. The researchers found that gardens in more affluent neighbourhoods harboured more pollinators, thanks to there being more flowers and a richer variety of plants.</p> <p>Stephanie Bird, of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u201cThis new paper shows that gardens are a hugely important resource for pollinators in urban areas.

      "bodyText": "Allotments, weedy corners and fancy gardens are all urban havens for bees and other pollinators, a study has found. The widespread decline of bees resulting from the loss of wild areas and pesticide use has caused great concern in recent years, but towns and cities have been suggested as potential sanctuaries. The first research to examine all types of land use in cities has identified pollinators\u2019 favourite places and flowers, many of which are often considered weeds. A team of more than 50 people spent two years examining pollinators and plants in Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds and Reading. The results enabled them to work out the best ways to support a rich mix of pollinator species that will be resilient to climate change and other challenges. The best strategy is increasing the number of allotments, the report says. Planting preferred flowers in gardens also helps, as does mowing grass in public parks less frequently, allowing flowers to bloom. Allotments are particularly good places for pollinators because they provide a mix of fruit and vegetable flowers, plus weedy corners full of native plants. \u201cAllotments are incredibly important at a city level, despite their small area,\u201d said Katherine Baldock at the University of Bristol, who led the research. \u201cThey are a good place for pollinators to hang out and provide a win-win situation, as they are also good for food growing and for people\u2019s health.\u201d The research, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, found allotments and gardens often had 10 times more bees than parks, cemeteries and urban nature reserves. Baldock said nature reserves were important for other wildlife but were often less suitable for pollinators, being dominated by trees rather than meadows. The scientists also identified the flowers most visited by bees, hoverflies and other pollinators. Native favourites included brambles, buttercups, dandelions, creeping thistle, common hogweed and ox-eye daisies. \u201cPeople tend to think of these as weeds, but they are really important for pollinators,\u201d said Baldock. She said gardeners had an important role to play in pollinator conservation, with the non-native plants that attracted the most pollinators being lavender, borage, butterfly bushes and common marigolds. Hydrangeas and forget-me-nots were among the least favourite. The researchers found that gardens in more affluent neighbourhoods harboured more pollinators, thanks to there being more flowers and a richer variety of plants. Stephanie Bird, of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u201cThis new paper shows that gardens are a hugely important resource for pollinators in urban areas. We would encourage the UK\u2019s 27 million gardeners to pack in a variety of plants, as not all pollinators can access the nectar of each plant, and consider introducing plants to bloom across all seasons.\u201d The RHS is now working with the University of Bristol to find which plants produce the most nectar. Gardens cover between a quarter and a third of cities, far more than allotments, which cover less than 1%. But increasing the area of allotments gives the biggest boost to pollinators per unit area, the study found. \u201cIt would be great if government made an effort to free up more land for allotments,\u201d said Prof Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex. \u201cCurrently there are about 90,000 people on waiting lists to get one. Given that these areas also produce healthy fruit and veg for local, zero-food-miles consumption, and get people out in the open air taking exercise, it would seem that allotments perform vital roles in our cities.\u201d Bee-harming pesticides have been banned from farm fields across the EU but some are still sold to gardeners. \u201cIf we really want to maximise the value of urban areas for wildlife, we would do well to stop using pesticides in our gardens and parks,\u201d Goulson said. Urban pollinators have been less studied than those in rural areas, so the importance of cities and towns to their survival is only now being worked out. The most comprehensive study to date found little difference in their abundance, perhaps because both are poor habitats, with many rural areas dominated by farmland and cities dominated by concrete and tarmac. \u201cPerhaps we could come to see our cities as giant nature reserves, places where man and nature can live side by side,\u201d said Goulson.",

A case in point is the bank robber who was baffled to be caught after rubbing lemon juice into his face in the belief it would make him invisible to security cameras. Fernbach believes that his findings, reported in Nature Human Behaviour, could have major implications for science and policy communication. One long-held, but rather unsuccessful, belief in the field of communications is that better education is the way to counter anti-scientific attitudes. \u201cOur research shows that you need to add something else to the equation,\u201d Fernbach said. \u201cExtremists think they understand this stuff already, so they are not going to be very receptive to education. You first need to get them to appreciate the gaps in their knowledge.\u201d Graham O\u2019Dwyer, a politics lecturer at Reading University with a specific interest in human irrationality, welcomed the study. \u201cIt carries a clear argument that is very convincing, and it also feeds into a wider set of concerns in relation to ignorance, overconfidence, and erroneous views in our present times.\u201d Beyond parallels with the Dunning-Kruger effect, O\u2019Dwyer said two other cognitive biases may feed into the trend Fernbach observed. The first is \u201cactive information avoidance\u201d, where people reject information that would help them understand the world because it clashes with their existing beliefs. The second is the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d, which describes how people can become entrenched in their original positions after rejecting new information. \u201cThis is often used to explain why many Americans refuse to believe in evolution and why so many Americans feel that vaccination is harmful to children,\u201d O\u2019Dwyer said. \u201cIt also figures into the debates on global warming and makes correcting erroneous beliefs highly challenging.\u201d",

And so he ran. He ran like no one they\u2019d ever seen run before: faster and faster until somehow, eight seconds later and 70 metres away, he was standing before them roaring, and Athletic were 2-0 up with five minutes left, Sevilla beaten.

Sevilla were title contenders, Athletic fighting to avoid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/24/aritz-aduriz-athletic-bilbao-la-liga\">a first-ever relegation</a>, desperation gripping. They knew Williams was fast, but they didn\u2019t expect him to move quite like that, still less anticipate the finish, the precision with the pace. Athletic were desperate for goals, but they weren\u2019t getting them: only Valencia and Huesca had fewer. Aritz Aduriz was out, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda too. They needed Williams badly but they sometimes feared goals weren\u2019t really his thing, not here. Goals like this are not really anybody\u2019s thing.</p> \n<p>Not so long ago, a small boy had waited hours to meet the Athletic striker in the team hotel. \u201cI bet you score loads of goals,\u201d Williams said, crouching down, arm around the boy\u2019s shoulder, adding: \u201cmore than me.\u201d His league totals for the past four seasons read: one, eight, five, seven. Coming into Sunday\u2019s match against Sevilla, he had five. He was playing his 100th consecutive game for Athletic \u2013 a feat no player had matched at any club in 25 years \u2013 but still no one at San Mam\u00e9s had seen him score there for over two years. On Sunday, at last, they did. Twice.</p> \n<p>Williams\u2019s last 15 league goals had come away from home, the latest at Vigo on Monday; it had been 770 days and 41 games since his last home goal. With every passing week, it got more bizarre, but the way he broke it was brilliant. First, with 22 minutes gone, he dashed up the left, cut inside, and crashed in a 20-yard shot <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1084722032447840256\">that almost took the net with it</a>. Then, with 84 gone, he did something better. When the ball came to him 15 metres or so inside his own half, Athletic led 1-0 but they were hanging on. Quincy Promes had bent one just wide and the nerves had taken over. It was played out towards Williams again. All game, he had fought, alone, and he was spent. But he spun, and then he started to shift. And then vooooooosh, he was gone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ElevenSports_UK/status/1084498596605640705\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">| GOAAAL! |<br><br>Inaki Williams has done it again! \ud83d\ude0d<br><br>Shows strength and pace and he gets his reward!

Jorge Valdano once said that when the Brazilian attacked, it was like the whole herd attacked: a one-man stampede. This was smoother, more graceful, more continuous, and genuinely exhilarating. It was strangely collective too, as if another thousand people stood and ran too, an entire ground shouting <em>go-go-go</em> before the realisation that, bloody hell, he\u2019s going to get there. He began behind G\u00f3mez, but was soon ahead, speeding between two men, the acceleration <em>astonishing</em>, until there he was flying past the goalkeeper, the ball in the net.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The TV claimed he had run 62.3 metres.

For the first time in a year they\u2019ve won two in a row: that\u2019s five weeks unbeaten now, 11 points from 15 under Garitano, as many as they picked up from the previous 42 possible with Eduardo Berizzo. They have a three-point cushion over relegation; they\u2019re also \u2013 get this \u2013 just six points off a European place. No wonder there was release as well as joy.

He was, though, going to run. Very, very fast.</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 It was only a penalty but Valencia managed to turn it into a piece of performance art, a moving portrait of their season. It was 0-0 against Real Valladolid, Valencia had won just four times all season, drawing 10 of their 18 games, and they desperately needed a win when they were presented with the chance to take a vital lead. Rodrigo Moreno, the striker who has scored just once since the opening day, had decided thatthought penalties might offer him a way back, so he had spent the week practicsing them. Now that they got one, he asked Dani Parejo to let him taken it instead. Parejo, scorer of 18 out of 22 from the spot in the league, let him. Over on the bench, Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, rubbed his eyes, barely able to watch as Rodrigo ran up and \u2026 produced just about the weakest shot you could imagine, the ball rebounding back to Santi Mina, who somehow put it wide, their entire year distilled in daftness. Eventually, Parejo did get a goal, running off waving his arms about wildly, and dashing to the bench to embrace the under-pressure manager, but thatit was not enough. They\u2019d escaped, but only momentarily; for Valencia, there\u2019s always a way back in to the labyrinth and with their only shot of the whole game Valladolid got an equaliser, thanks to an extraordinary free kick from Alcaraz. \u201cThis is the point we have leas deserved this season,\u201d Sergio admitted, and yet impossible though it seemed, it was also somehow inevitable. Valencia had miss after miss and ended where they always do: with a draw. No one in Spain has a worse goals-per-shot ratio than them; no one has scored fewer, and no one can understand it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time. Or the second, or the third, or the fourth. Or even the fifth,\u201d Marcelino said. \u201cWe get smacked in the face every time,\u201d Marcelino said.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cHe\u2019ll reach 500 too,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/psg-amiens-milan-sampdoria-european-football-roundup\">after Leo Messi scored his 400<sup>th</sup> league goal</a>.

      "bodyText": "When the ball came to I\u00f1aki Williams and he spun, turning it sharply around Sergi G\u00f3mez and into the centre circle, a single thought and word occurred to everyone inside San Mam\u00e9s, I\u00f1aki included: Run! And so he ran. He ran like no one they\u2019d ever seen run before: faster and faster until somehow, eight seconds later and 70 metres away, he was standing before them roaring, and Athletic were 2-0 up with five minutes left, Sevilla beaten. All around they went wild, as breathless as he was. Few expected this. Sevilla were title contenders, Athletic fighting to avoid a first-ever relegation, desperation gripping. They knew Williams was fast, but they didn\u2019t expect him to move quite like that, still less anticipate the finish, the precision with the pace. Athletic were desperate for goals, but they weren\u2019t getting them: only Valencia and Huesca had fewer. Aritz Aduriz was out, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda too. They needed Williams badly but they sometimes feared goals weren\u2019t really his thing, not here. Goals like this are not really anybody\u2019s thing. Not so long ago, a small boy had waited hours to meet the Athletic striker in the team hotel. \u201cI bet you score loads of goals,\u201d Williams said, crouching down, arm around the boy\u2019s shoulder, adding: \u201cmore than me.\u201d His league totals for the past four seasons read: one, eight, five, seven. Coming into Sunday\u2019s match against Sevilla, he had five. He was playing his 100th consecutive game for Athletic \u2013 a feat no player had matched at any club in 25 years \u2013 but still no one at San Mam\u00e9s had seen him score there for over two years. On Sunday, at last, they did. Twice. Williams\u2019s last 15 league goals had come away from home, the latest at Vigo on Monday; it had been 770 days and 41 games since his last home goal. With every passing week, it got more bizarre, but the way he broke it was brilliant. First, with 22 minutes gone, he dashed up the left, cut inside, and crashed in a 20-yard shot that almost took the net with it. Then, with 84 gone, he did something better. When the ball came to him 15 metres or so inside his own half, Athletic led 1-0 but they were hanging on. Quincy Promes had bent one just wide and the nerves had taken over. It was played out towards Williams again. All game, he had fought, alone, and he was spent. But he spun, and then he started to shift. And then vooooooosh, he was gone. Afterwards, it was likened to Ronaldo, but this was different. Jorge Valdano once said that when the Brazilian attacked, it was like the whole herd attacked: a one-man stampede. This was smoother, more graceful, more continuous, and genuinely exhilarating. It was strangely collective too, as if another thousand people stood and ran too, an entire ground shouting go-go-go before the realisation that, bloody hell, he\u2019s going to get there. He began behind G\u00f3mez, but was soon ahead, speeding between two men, the acceleration astonishing, until there he was flying past the goalkeeper, the ball in the net. The TV claimed he had run 62.3 metres. He reached 38.8km/h, they said. Which might not have been that scientific \u2013 the morning\u2019s papers were talking 57 metres and a peak of 34.5km/h \u2013 but whatever it was, it was fast. It is hard to recall a run like it; impossible, in fact. Add in everything that went with it, the emotion, the significance, the timing, and very few goals have carried you along like this. Eventually, his teammates reached him. There\u2019s something in this photo that explains everything: Williams, tongue between his teeth, chest out, screaming. Iker Muniain on his back, screaming. Dani Garc\u00eda to his left, screaming. Ibai G\u00f3mez to his right, the new arrival from Alav\u00e9s, the one man not subjected to the mounting pressure, gazing at him wearing a smile that says wow. \u201cWilliams pulls on his superhero\u2019s cloak,\u201d Marca read. \u201cWilliams, unchained,\u201d said AS. El Pa\u00eds called it a work of art. He was \u201ca lightning bolt,\u201d \u201ca bullet\u201d, \u201ca rocket,\u201d a \u201cpanther\u201d, a \u201cgazelle\u201d. \u201cAll we can do is surrender to a great player,\u201d said the Sevilla coach Pablo Mach\u00edn. \u201cHe beat us in the air, on the floor, and for pace.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a sprinter, he needs space, and he has more away from home,\u201d manager Gaizka Garitano said. \u201cA striker lives off goals and you see when he\u2019s more confident. He scored two goals of great quality and it\u2019s good for him to take that \u2018rucksack\u2019 off his back.\u201d It was good for all of them: as they stood there, celebrating the second, victory secure, and Athletic climbed to 15th. For the first time in a year they\u2019ve won two in a row: that\u2019s five weeks unbeaten now, 11 points from 15 under Garitano, as many as they picked up from the previous 42 possible with Eduardo Berizzo. They have a three-point cushion over relegation; they\u2019re also \u2013 get this \u2013 just six points off a European place. No wonder there was release as well as joy. They\u2019d all suffered. Williams especially. \u201cI felt like crying,\u201d he admitted afterwards. \u201cWhen things go badly, it\u2019s like you\u2019re no use for anything. When you score, everyone pats you on the back; when you don\u2019t, no one says a word to you. But faith moves mountains and I fought for that ball as if it was the last. I worked like a devil. I feel like I\u2019ve taken a weight off my shoulders. Today was incredible.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to hide. He was, though, going to run. Very, very fast. Talking points \u2022 It was only a penalty but Valencia managed to turn it into a piece of performance art, a moving portrait of their season. It was 0-0 against Real Valladolid, Valencia had won just four times all season, drawing 10 of their 18 games, and they desperately needed a win when they were presented with the chance to take a vital lead. Rodrigo Moreno, the striker who has scored just once since the opening day, had decided thatthought penalties might offer him a way back, so he had spent the week practicsing them. Now that they got one, he asked Dani Parejo to let him taken it instead. Parejo, scorer of 18 out of 22 from the spot in the league, let him. Over on the bench, Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, rubbed his eyes, barely able to watch as Rodrigo ran up and \u2026 produced just about the weakest shot you could imagine, the ball rebounding back to Santi Mina, who somehow put it wide, their entire year distilled in daftness. Eventually, Parejo did get a goal, running off waving his arms about wildly, and dashing to the bench to embrace the under-pressure manager, but thatit was not enough. They\u2019d escaped, but only momentarily; for Valencia, there\u2019s always a way back in to the labyrinth and with their only shot of the whole game Valladolid got an equaliser, thanks to an extraordinary free kick from Alcaraz. \u201cThis is the point we have leas deserved this season,\u201d Sergio admitted, and yet impossible though it seemed, it was also somehow inevitable. Valencia had miss after miss and ended where they always do: with a draw. No one in Spain has a worse goals-per-shot ratio than them; no one has scored fewer, and no one can understand it. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time. Or the second, or the third, or the fourth. Or even the fifth,\u201d Marcelino said. \u201cWe get smacked in the face every time,\u201d Marcelino said. \u2022 \u201cHe\u2019ll reach 500 too,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said after Leo Messi scored his 400th league goal. So maybe we\u2019ll talk about him then, then. \u2022 Cristiano Ronaldo called him \u201cmini me\u201d, his shirt calls him RDT, and his fans are calling him their saviour. Ra\u00fal De Tom\u00e1s scored a sensational hat-trick on Friday as Rayo Vallecano won their third game in a row. Not that they\u2019re out of the relegation zone yet, mind. The battle at the bottom has become quite something. Genuinely, there are 10 teams that could be dragged into it yet. \u2022 A penalty. Jan Oblak. Antoine Greizmann. 1-0. Stop here if you\u2019ve heard this one before. \u2022 \u201cUnfortunately, it went in,\u201d Dani Ceballos mumbled after his late free kick somehow gave Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over his former club Real Betis laston Sunday night. It was about the only time Madrid touched the ball in the second half, and it ended in the back of the net, Ceballos\u2019s hands up in apology as all-around him his \u201chome\u201d whistled him. \u2022 Two days later, and this column still hasn\u2019t worked out what actually happened in the final 50 seconds or so in Villarreal, where the Yellow Submarine missed four chances and then Toko Ekambi missed a penalty against Getafe. \u2022 What a weekend for goals, by the way. Not just Williams, but RDT, Daniel Parejo, Cristhian Stuani, Jorge Molina, \u00c1ngel, and Luis Su\u00e1rez. Woof. Pick that lot out! \u2022 But the best goal of all, five days after Nick Blackman scored for Sporting against Valencia, came from Spanish football\u2019s only other Englishman.

      "bodyText": "Paul Pogba has paid tribute to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r for bringing the sunshine back to his life at Manchester United. \u201cBefore the coach arrived I was in the shadows, on the bench, and I accepted that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a pleasure to play again. Now I am always smiling.\u201d The Frenchman\u2019s charismatic performance at Wembley, coming from a positive place and more proactive position, was one of the catalysts of United\u2019s 1-0 win over Spurs, their most impressive since Solskj\u00e6r took over. The feelgood factor is evident for Pogba, who giggled when he recalled the nickname the youth prospects all knew about when Solskj\u00e6r worked with them a few years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to be reunited with him. I knew him from the academy and the reserves, when his nickname was \u2018Supersub\u2019. \u201cHe is doing a really good job. As a player he knew the mentality of this club. He has come back to help us and it is going very well.\u201d Performance levels have been much-improved across the pitch, from the imperious David de Gea, via the tactically astute Ander Herrera protecting from deep, through Pogba\u2019s influence and forward to Marcus Rashford, whose finishing looks inspired at the moment. \u201cThroughout the training sessions in Dubai he\u2019s been practising his finishing with the manager,\u201d said Jesse Lingard. \u201cIt\u2019s prepared him for big games and moments like that.\u201d De Gea understandably dominated the limelight with one of those flawless exhibitions of the goalkeeper\u2019s art and Lingard was quick to urge the Spaniard to extend his stay at Old Trafford beyond 2020. \u201cWe want him to stay,\u201d Lingard said. \u201cHaving a keeper like that gives you extra confidence. They looked like scoring but he saved us. Some of his saves, you\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my god.\u2019 He\u2019s one of the best keepers in the world, if not the best.\u201d Tottenham are focusing on picking themselves up from this setback, though they face a period without two key players, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Son is joining up with South Korea at the Asian Cup while Kane suffered an ankle injury against United, though the prognosis remains unclear. \u201cThese two guys are just massive for us,\u201d said Jan Vertonghen. \u201cEspecially over the last couple of months, they\u2019ve been immense. We hope they\u2019ll both be back soon. It\u2019s one of those things but that\u2019s why we have the other guys, the other guys have to stand up now.\u201d",

Why\u2019s it taken so long to sort out? It\u2019s what the majority of people voted for. Would there have been all this to-do if the remainers had won?\u201d</p> \n<p>With 74 days until Britain leaves the EU, there is little sign of sentiment changing in the city dubbed the Brexit capital of Britain. It was a label coined by Paul Nuttall, the former Ukip leader, during an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/24/labour-sees-off-ukip-threat-to-win-stoke-on-trent-central-byelection\">ill-fated attempt</a> to win the Stoke-on-Trent byelection in 2017.</p> \n<p>A local newspaper poll of 326 voters on Monday found 84% opposed May\u2019s deal, describing it as \u201cnot Brexit\u201d, with only 16% backing her withdrawal agreement. The airwaves and letters pages were similarly febrile, with one Sentinel reader writing that \u201cdemocracy was dead\u201d and that the Queen should dissolve parliament if Brexit was not enacted.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/theresa-may-refuses-to-rule-out-brexit-article-50-extension\">May spoke</a> to a room of journalists and about 100 Portmeirion pottery workers, Tony Walley, 54, a supermarket worker, said he felt powerless to influence any of the decisions made in Westminster. He chose not to vote in the EU referendum, which he felt was pushed by \u201cHooray Henrys in London\u201d who were \u201cthe first to drop it\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac3464a8368441217e7c6269d2228148017c5c1a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac3464a8368441217e7c6269d2228148017c5c1a/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The edge of the Portmeirion factory in Stoke-on-Trent, where Theresa May made her speech.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The edge of the Portmeirion factory in Stoke-on-Trent, where Theresa May made her speech.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI think it took them by surprise and if there was another vote it would fail. They seem to be making a right hash of it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Walley reflects an apathy that has gripped Stoke for years. Stoke-on-Trent Central had the lowest turnout in the country in the 2015 general election, at 49.9%, falling to 38.2% in a byelection two years later. It may only be two hours by train to London, but the Staffordshire city feels a world away from Westminster.</p> \n<p>Opening up his family-run carpet store near Stoke minster, Adam Norris doubted whether leaving the EU would affect places like Stoke.

      "bodyText": "As Theresa May swept on to a factory floor on the edge of Stoke, Patricia Clewlow admonished herself for what she was about to say. \u201cI\u2019ve voted every year since I was 18 because it\u2019s right that I should,\u201d said the 79-year-old. \u201cParticularly for the brave women that won us the vote. But I honestly feel that if this goes by the board, I shan\u2019t ever vote again. It\u2019s naughty to feel like that but that\u2019s how I feel.\u201d Clewlow was one of the 69.4% of voters in Stoke-on-Trent who backed leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Almost everyone Clewlow knows voted to leave. Their only regret is that it has not happened already. \u201cI don\u2019t understand all the mess,\u201d she said outside the city\u2019s library on Monday morning. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand what the problem is. Why\u2019s it taken so long to sort out? It\u2019s what the majority of people voted for. Would there have been all this to-do if the remainers had won?\u201d With 74 days until Britain leaves the EU, there is little sign of sentiment changing in the city dubbed the Brexit capital of Britain. It was a label coined by Paul Nuttall, the former Ukip leader, during an ill-fated attempt to win the Stoke-on-Trent byelection in 2017. A local newspaper poll of 326 voters on Monday found 84% opposed May\u2019s deal, describing it as \u201cnot Brexit\u201d, with only 16% backing her withdrawal agreement. The airwaves and letters pages were similarly febrile, with one Sentinel reader writing that \u201cdemocracy was dead\u201d and that the Queen should dissolve parliament if Brexit was not enacted. As May spoke to a room of journalists and about 100 Portmeirion pottery workers, Tony Walley, 54, a supermarket worker, said he felt powerless to influence any of the decisions made in Westminster. He chose not to vote in the EU referendum, which he felt was pushed by \u201cHooray Henrys in London\u201d who were \u201cthe first to drop it\u201d. \u201cI think it took them by surprise and if there was another vote it would fail. They seem to be making a right hash of it,\u201d he said. Walley reflects an apathy that has gripped Stoke for years. Stoke-on-Trent Central had the lowest turnout in the country in the 2015 general election, at 49.9%, falling to 38.2% in a byelection two years later. It may only be two hours by train to London, but the Staffordshire city feels a world away from Westminster. Opening up his family-run carpet store near Stoke minster, Adam Norris doubted whether leaving the EU would affect places like Stoke. He voted to leave, backs May\u2019s deal, but feels it will make little difference. \u201cNothing really changes apart from shops closing down,\u201d said the 63-year-old, whose family business, Norris Carpets, has been fixture of the cities since 1985. \u201cIn the market it\u2019s gone terrible for them. It\u2019s gone very quiet.\u201d \u201cAt last!\u201d declared the front page of Monday\u2019s Sentinel, above the news that 200 homes have been promised on the site where the city\u2019s ceramics giant Royal Doulton closed its headquarters 15 years ago, with the loss of 525 jobs. \u201cIt was a hammer blow for the town and one from which it has never recovered,\u201d the paper reported. Unemployment in Stoke is higher than average, and the average property price is \u00a3105,000, compared with \u00a3230,000 in the rest of the UK. \u201cThere\u2019s no jobs about hardly,\u201d complained Adele Smith, 42, outside a busy Stoke cafe. \u201cI voted to stay in so there would be more jobs.\u201d Asked what she would tell the prime minister, Smith said: \u201cI\u2019d tell her bugger off.

      "bodyText": "Several people have been killed and about 200 arrested as police in Zimbabwe fired live ammunition and teargas during running battles with groups of young people trying to enforce a nationwide shutdown to protest against the rising cost of living. The clashes were the worst outbreak of disorder in the southern African country since the aftermath of elections last year, when six civilians were shot dead by police. They came on the first day of a three-day general strike called by unions amid an intensifying economic crisis. The security minister Owen Ncube confirmed there had been deaths but did not give a figure. There were clashes in the capital, Harare, and in Bulawayo, a city in the south, as police attempted to disperse groups of youths who had lit fires in streets, erected barricades and, in some cases, looted shops. Other protesters blocked highways and tried to force companies that had remained open to comply with the shutdown. In Chitungwiza, a satellite town of the capital where anti-government feeling runs high, a police station was reportedly besieged and automatic gunfire was heard. In the poor neighbourhood of Mabvuku, four civilians were reportedly shot and injured by police. One catalyst for the discontent was the government\u2019s decision to increase the price of fuel by 150% on Saturday. There are already acute shortages of imported goods and soaring inflation for basic foodstuffs. Legacies of the 37-year rule of Robert Mugabe, which ended with a military takeover in November 2017, include massive unemployment, huge government debts, an acute shortage of hard currency and a crumbling infrastructure. \u201cWe have suffered enough,\u201d said a bystander at the protest at Bulawayo. \u201cThe government is now aware that we are not happy with their stupid policies like the fuel price increase.\u201d President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a stalwart of the ruling Zanu-PF party who took over on Mugabe\u2019s resignation and won contested elections in July, has been unable to bring about the economic turnaround he promised voters and investors. \u201cWe are now seeing the results of a volatility that has been building for some time and that everyone has been very complacent about,\u201d said Piers Pigou, an expert in Zimbabwe with the International Crisis Group.

This is what happens when you push people,\u201d said Jacob Mafume, an MDC spokesperson. The government has accused the strike organisers of pushing a political \u201cregime change\u201d agenda and engaging in \u201csubversive political activities\u201d. \u201cIt has become obvious that there is deliberate plan to undermine and challenge the prevailing constitutional order,\u201d said a government spokesman, Nick Mangwana, in a statement late on Sunday night. He said the government would \u201crespond appropriately\u201d against \u201call those who have been conspiring to subvert peace, law and order in the country\u201d. The mainstream opposition in Zimbabwe appeared to have been taken by surprise by the disorder. \u201cThe opposition appears not to be in charge or leading this,\u201d said Pigou. \u201cThe conditions are such that there is a real opportunity for violent disruptive elements, either from within the opposition ranks or some kind of destabilising operation.\u201d Mnangagwa has struggled to revive Zimbabwe\u2019s ailing economy, and is currently travelling in Asia and Europe in an effort to attract foreign direct investment. Although the 2018 elections were not marred by the type of violence experienced under Mugabe, alleged irregularities during the count and repression after the vote resulted in lukewarm support for Mnangagwa and Zanu-PF from major international powers. Early efforts by the government to stabilise Zimbabwe\u2019s economy appear to have exacerbated the situation, triggering massive devaluation of its surrogate and electronic currencies. The country abandoned its own currency in 2009 after it was wrecked by hyperinflation and adopted the dollar and other currencies such as sterling and the South African rand. But there is not enough hard currency in the country to back up the $10bn of electronic funds trapped in local bank accounts, prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for cash that can be deposited and used to make payments. Zimbabwe\u2019s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks\u2019 cover for imports, central bank data show. Mthuli Ncube, the finance minister, told a townhall meeting on Friday the a new local currency would be introduced in less than 12 months. Zimbabweans are haunted by memories of the Zimbabwean dollar, which became worthless as inflation spiralled to reach 500bn per cent in 2008, the highest rate in the world for a country not at war, wiping out pensions and savings.",

I\u2019ve got a healthy backlog of legumes and dry goods. Closer to the time I\u2019ll get some proteins (European cheeses and meat substitutes mostly) and some high-demand groceries we don\u2019t grow much of \u2013 onions and tomatoes, for example. I started hormone replacement therapy in September as a trans person. I had to do this myself \u2013 \u201cDIY\u2019d\u201d without a prescription \u2013 so I\u2019ve also started stockpiling medicine. I\u2019m sitting on the worse side of a 16-month waiting list (which I\u2019m told usually looks more like 24, once all the tests and paperwork have sat on someone\u2019s desk for long enough). I also have very bad anxiety and I can\u2019t really wait another two years.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a helpless feeling \u2013 watching your life and body and years go in the wrong direction. I have about four months left of medication at this point. I\u2019ve no idea how much I should order to stockpile. There is the possibility of a bridging prescription; a harm-reduction prescription that goes between DIYing and a gender identity clinic prescription. Whether my GP in particular will issue one is doubtful. I\u2019m so happy to be on HRT [hormone replacement therapy] at last, but having to do it in this way, in the current climate, it\u2019s a scary thing to do. <strong>Lilidh, Aberdeen</strong></p> <h2>\u2018We live in unprecedented times, so unprecedented things can happen\u2019</h2> <p>We have been buying extra tins of food alongside pasta, rice, water and other goods, and we have a specific cupboard in our tiny kitchen that we call the Brexit cupboard. Everyone, including myself, jokes about it, but I feel a responsibility to make sure we have a month\u2019s supply of food in the event of a worst-case scenario. We have a food budget each week of \u00a350 for four people. Inevitably we end up buying own-brand supermarket goods, including a lot of tinned goods and dry pasta, and we cook from scratch, but it\u2019s unclear what supply chain changes will have for these.</p> <p>I\u2019m also buying cheap medicine such as liquid paracetamol for the children. I have faith that a deal will be done, but I think it\u2019s prudent to make sure we can survive in a worst-case scenario. I don\u2019t understand how people find this laughable because to me it just seems like common sense. We live in unprecedented times, so unprecedented things can happen. Preparing for Brexit by stockpiling is the only way I feel I can have any control over what happens to my family in the event of a no-deal situation. <strong>Louise, Cotswolds</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m concerned for my wife, who has MS\u2019</h2> <p>My wife is disabled with secondary progressive MS [multiple sclerosis]. It has many effects, but one of the most depressing is urinary incontinence. To deal with this, she has to perform intermittent catheterisation when she goes to the lavatory. She uses about six catheters a day. The catheters are manufactured by a Danish company, Coloplast, whose factory is in Hungary. We are naturally concerned that these could be in short supply in the event of a no-deal Brexit, so we are asking our GP for a three-month supply ahead of 29 March.</p> <p>We voted remain and the irresponsibility, mendacity and selfishness of those pressing for a no-deal is breathtaking, frightening and makes us ashamed to be British. <strong>Nigel, Oxfordshire</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2ddc3c723a2815d8079e1fc014b0d808b5307d4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ddc3c723a2815d8079e1fc014b0d808b5307d4d/0_102_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A syringe, insulin and blood tester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A syringe, insulin and a blood tester, which are used to treat diabetes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alfsky/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018We have been ordering the maximum amount of insulin allowed\u2019</h2> <p>One of my adult children has type 1 diabetes. We do not trust the government to ensure the availability after a no-deal Brexit of the two types of insulin he requires every day in order to survive. Very little insulin is manufactured in the UK, and not the types that he uses. Daily insulin doses are variable, depending on various factors; carbohydrate intake, activity levels etc.</p> <p>For the past five months we have been ordering the maximum amount of insulin allowed on his repeat prescription, which is about double the amount he typically uses. By March we should have enough insulin to last up to eight months. I hope this will be sufficient. We do not feel selfish about this. At the moment insulin is freely imported into the UK, so the fact that we are stockpiling does not make less available to others. We will not waste any of the insulin as it has a long shelf life. <strong>Jane, Derbyshire</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/26/how-will-your-mp-vote-on-theresa-mays-brexit-deal\">How will your MP vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018My plan is to have three months\u2019 food supply by the end of March\u2019</h2> <p>I started stockpiling a few months ago, buying tinned and long-life products each week when they were on offer.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Health has signed two contracts for warehouse space to store drugs in case of a no-deal Brexit. With 10 weeks to go until the UK leaves the EU, officials are still planning to try to secure another warehouse for storage. With the government also suggesting food prices could rise and supermarkets stockpiling tinned food and warning that supplying fresh food may be an issue under a no-deal Brexit, we asked you to tell us what, if any, actions you were taking. Several readers said they were stockpiling store cupboard items such as tinned food and dried milk. Families with concerns about medicine supplies said they were doing what they could to get more information, but in some cases stockpiling would be impossible. We also heard from many readers who were pragmatic about actions necessary at home but increasingly frustrated by the perceived lack of a unified plan from the government. You can read some of your stories below. \u2018I started hormone replacement therapy and have started stockpiling medicine\u2019 I\u2019m already stockpiling. I\u2019ve got a healthy backlog of legumes and dry goods. Closer to the time I\u2019ll get some proteins (European cheeses and meat substitutes mostly) and some high-demand groceries we don\u2019t grow much of \u2013 onions and tomatoes, for example. I started hormone replacement therapy in September as a trans person. I had to do this myself \u2013 \u201cDIY\u2019d\u201d without a prescription \u2013 so I\u2019ve also started stockpiling medicine. I\u2019m sitting on the worse side of a 16-month waiting list (which I\u2019m told usually looks more like 24, once all the tests and paperwork have sat on someone\u2019s desk for long enough). I also have very bad anxiety and I can\u2019t really wait another two years. It\u2019s such a helpless feeling \u2013 watching your life and body and years go in the wrong direction. I have about four months left of medication at this point. I\u2019ve no idea how much I should order to stockpile. There is the possibility of a bridging prescription; a harm-reduction prescription that goes between DIYing and a gender identity clinic prescription. Whether my GP in particular will issue one is doubtful. I\u2019m so happy to be on HRT [hormone replacement therapy] at last, but having to do it in this way, in the current climate, it\u2019s a scary thing to do. Lilidh, Aberdeen \u2018We live in unprecedented times, so unprecedented things can happen\u2019 We have been buying extra tins of food alongside pasta, rice, water and other goods, and we have a specific cupboard in our tiny kitchen that we call the Brexit cupboard. Everyone, including myself, jokes about it, but I feel a responsibility to make sure we have a month\u2019s supply of food in the event of a worst-case scenario. We have a food budget each week of \u00a350 for four people. Inevitably we end up buying own-brand supermarket goods, including a lot of tinned goods and dry pasta, and we cook from scratch, but it\u2019s unclear what supply chain changes will have for these. I\u2019m also buying cheap medicine such as liquid paracetamol for the children. I have faith that a deal will be done, but I think it\u2019s prudent to make sure we can survive in a worst-case scenario. I don\u2019t understand how people find this laughable because to me it just seems like common sense. We live in unprecedented times, so unprecedented things can happen.

      "body": "<p>Jo Elgarf doesn\u2019t look like you would imagine a prepper to look. She\u2019s not a libertarian, camouflaged and armed to the eyeballs, crawling around the woods in Montana, skinning a squirrel for breakfast and fuelling up for the apocalypse. She lives with her husband and three young children in a sleepy suburb of south-west London.</p> <p>Elgarf is happy to call herself a prepper, though; she is a member \u2013 and a moderator \u2013 of one of a growing number of prepper groups on social media. Hers \u2013 an anti-Brexit Facebook group called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/598938460485991/\" title=\"\">48% Preppers \u2013</a> gets between 100 and 200 requests a day to join. Everyone wants to be ready for a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>The stockpiling is not too extreme in Elgarf\u2019s case; it just means the kitchen cupboards are stuffed full of pasta, sauces, rice, tins, milk powder and washing powder. There are a few things she wouldn\u2019t normally get \u2013 such as tinned vegetables \u2013 which can go to a food bank if they\u2019re not needed. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a bit more of the usual. Elgarf reckons they have got enough to last the family from a month to six weeks.</p> <p>The group is not about scaremongering, she says. Quite the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s about calming like-minded people down, and about promoting an old-fashioned larder mentality. \u201cHave a look in your cupboard; if you got snowed in for a month, could you cope? We\u2019re not predicting you won\u2019t get anything. What we\u2019re saying is: you may walk into a shop and can\u2019t find any rice. Have you got something at home to replace it?</p> <p>\u201cIn Switzerland, they tell people to have, I think, two weeks\u2019 stuff,\u201d she says. People are vulnerable there, not just because they\u2019re more likely to get snowed in, but also because they have a hard border. Elgarf\u2019s degree was in European studies.

One of her four-year-old twins, Nora, who has been sitting happily on her mum\u2019s lap as we talk, has a rare brain condition called polymicrogyria. She has lots of prescriptions, but without two of them \u2013 Epilim and Keppra \u2013 for her epilepsy, she would have multiple seizures a day. \u201cShe can\u2019t do without them,\u201d says Elgarf. Both Epilim and Keppra are imported.</p> <p>If she could stockpile these medicines, she would. But they are controlled, and she can only get a month\u2019s supply at a time. \u201cIt should be all right,\u201d she has been told by doctors and the pharmacists. But when it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s life that\u2019s at stake, \u201cit should be all right\u201d isn\u2019t good enough.</p> <p>Many of the people who join the Facebook group have concerns about medicines, Elgarf says. There are a lot of diabetics and coeliacs among them. What they need is some reassurance. \u201cWe need to know for certain they have got a proper plan in place for anybody who depends on meds.\u201d<strong> </strong>She has heard rumours that the most critical medicines may have to be collected from central hubs, which would be stocked on the basis of lists provided by GPs.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s clearly something she has given thought to.</p> <p>Elgarf is also clear about why she is talking to me. \u201cSo come April and there\u2019s no Epilim in the country, I\u2019ll say: \u2018Where\u2019s that Guardian man?\u2019 And you guys are going to be interested because this little child you saw in January now has no meds.\u201d Nora has fallen asleep on her mum.</p> <p>And so to another unlikely prepper, and member of the same group, in Cardiff. \u201cI don\u2019t identify as a prepper, but I am prepping,\u201d says Helena, who doesn\u2019t want her surname published. \u201cI always thought preppers were a bit batshit crazy and am quite surprised to find myself in this position.\u201d</p> <p>Helena, who has a politics degree and works for a charity, doesn\u2019t come across as crazy. None of the people I speak to do. Informed: tick. Cautious: tick. Organised: tick. Very organised, in Helena\u2019s case: she has \u2013 and shares with me \u2013 a spreadsheet, colour-coded according to what is fully purchased (eg tinned tomatoes and loo paper, alongside a note that the average person uses 110 rolls a year), part-purchased (eg cereal), waiting delivery (powdered coconut), or pending testing (dried falafel mix). Falafel! I\u2019m going straight round to Helena\u2019s. She also has booze and biscuits. Brexit party in Cardiff on Friday 29 March, everyone. And she\u2019s got makeup! We\u2019re going to be looking good as the good ship Britannia goes down.</p> <p>Helena is not just prepping for herself. She is doing it for her dog, Charlie, too.

It\u2019s a just-in-time economy. This is a source of a lot of efficiency gains and improvements in productivity ever since the 1980s, and it means that people don\u2019t hold stocks of stuff any more.

      "bodyText": "Jo Elgarf doesn\u2019t look like you would imagine a prepper to look. She\u2019s not a libertarian, camouflaged and armed to the eyeballs, crawling around the woods in Montana, skinning a squirrel for breakfast and fuelling up for the apocalypse. She lives with her husband and three young children in a sleepy suburb of south-west London. Elgarf is happy to call herself a prepper, though; she is a member \u2013 and a moderator \u2013 of one of a growing number of prepper groups on social media. Hers \u2013 an anti-Brexit Facebook group called 48% Preppers \u2013 gets between 100 and 200 requests a day to join. Everyone wants to be ready for a no-deal Brexit. The stockpiling is not too extreme in Elgarf\u2019s case; it just means the kitchen cupboards are stuffed full of pasta, sauces, rice, tins, milk powder and washing powder. There are a few things she wouldn\u2019t normally get \u2013 such as tinned vegetables \u2013 which can go to a food bank if they\u2019re not needed. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a bit more of the usual. Elgarf reckons they have got enough to last the family from a month to six weeks. The group is not about scaremongering, she says. Quite the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s about calming like-minded people down, and about promoting an old-fashioned larder mentality. \u201cHave a look in your cupboard; if you got snowed in for a month, could you cope? We\u2019re not predicting you won\u2019t get anything. What we\u2019re saying is: you may walk into a shop and can\u2019t find any rice. Have you got something at home to replace it? \u201cIn Switzerland, they tell people to have, I think, two weeks\u2019 stuff,\u201d she says. People are vulnerable there, not just because they\u2019re more likely to get snowed in, but also because they have a hard border. Elgarf\u2019s degree was in European studies. And she worked in the food industry; she knows how just-in-time it operates. Chris Grayling\u2019s little lorry exercise didn\u2019t reassure her. Nor the chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry saying that a no-deal Brexit \u201cshould be avoided at all costs\u201d. Because it\u2019s not just about food for Elgarf and her family. One of her four-year-old twins, Nora, who has been sitting happily on her mum\u2019s lap as we talk, has a rare brain condition called polymicrogyria. She has lots of prescriptions, but without two of them \u2013 Epilim and Keppra \u2013 for her epilepsy, she would have multiple seizures a day. \u201cShe can\u2019t do without them,\u201d says Elgarf. Both Epilim and Keppra are imported. If she could stockpile these medicines, she would. But they are controlled, and she can only get a month\u2019s supply at a time. \u201cIt should be all right,\u201d she has been told by doctors and the pharmacists. But when it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s life that\u2019s at stake, \u201cit should be all right\u201d isn\u2019t good enough. Many of the people who join the Facebook group have concerns about medicines, Elgarf says. There are a lot of diabetics and coeliacs among them. What they need is some reassurance. \u201cWe need to know for certain they have got a proper plan in place for anybody who depends on meds.\u201d She has heard rumours that the most critical medicines may have to be collected from central hubs, which would be stocked on the basis of lists provided by GPs. It\u2019s clearly something she has given thought to. Elgarf is also clear about why she is talking to me. \u201cSo come April and there\u2019s no Epilim in the country, I\u2019ll say: \u2018Where\u2019s that Guardian man?\u2019 And you guys are going to be interested because this little child you saw in January now has no meds.\u201d Nora has fallen asleep on her mum. And so to another unlikely prepper, and member of the same group, in Cardiff. \u201cI don\u2019t identify as a prepper, but I am prepping,\u201d says Helena, who doesn\u2019t want her surname published. \u201cI always thought preppers were a bit batshit crazy and am quite surprised to find myself in this position.\u201d Helena, who has a politics degree and works for a charity, doesn\u2019t come across as crazy. None of the people I speak to do. Informed: tick. Cautious: tick. Organised: tick. Very organised, in Helena\u2019s case: she has \u2013 and shares with me \u2013 a spreadsheet, colour-coded according to what is fully purchased (eg tinned tomatoes and loo paper, alongside a note that the average person uses 110 rolls a year), part-purchased (eg cereal), waiting delivery (powdered coconut), or pending testing (dried falafel mix). Falafel! I\u2019m going straight round to Helena\u2019s. She also has booze and biscuits. Brexit party in Cardiff on Friday 29 March, everyone. And she\u2019s got makeup! We\u2019re going to be looking good as the good ship Britannia goes down. Helena is not just prepping for herself. She is doing it for her dog, Charlie, too. And while she has about three months\u2019 worth of supplies for herself, she is looking at more like a year for the dog, as she doesn\u2019t see that pet food will be a priority. \u201cI don\u2019t really trust the government to look after me; I certainly don\u2019t trust them to look after my dog,\u201d she says. As well as dog food, there are treats and toys on the spreadsheet. Charlie is going to enjoy a hard Brexit. Helena sees it as an insurance policy. \u201cUnless there\u2019s enormous panic buying, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be nothing on the shelves at Asda,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do think there\u2019s a very good chance that choice is going to be limited.\u201d Helena\u2019s dad agrees.

I\u2019d be super-happy if, a year from now, I\u2019m sitting here thinking: \u2018Bloody hell, I\u2019ve still got tinned potatoes on the shelf.\u2019 I hope that my mother is right and Brexit is a fantastic success \u2026 the land of milk and honey.\u201d As opposed to the land of powdered milk and \u2026 \u201cgolden syrup\u201d, she says. Actually, there\u2019s honey and golden syrup on the spreadsheet. In Cambridge, Diane says she is also stockpiling, though she doesn\u2019t want to go into too much detail. \u201cI\u2019m a bit cautious about being presented as an idiot who has a cupboard full of stuff,\u201d she says. She\u2019s OK about using her surname, though: she is Diane Coyle, OBE, FACSS, the economist, Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge, former adviser to the Treasury, vice-chair of the BBC Trust, member of the Competition Commission, winner of the Indigo prize \u2026 in short, really not an idiot. \u201cThe point about supply chains,\u201d she explains, \u201cis that the things you buy in the supermarket today were on the road last night.

West, who was due to be announced as a headliner on 3 January asked Coachella co-founder Paul Tollett on 1 January for a custom-built dome stage in the middle of the festival grounds. The dome was to be designed by West\u2019s collaborator John McGuire, allowing for an in-the-round performance featuring hi-tech production and immersive video.

When Coachella parent company Goldenvoice explained the impossibility of doing so to West, he is said to have become irritated, saying that he was an artist with a creative vision who shouldn\u2019t be spending his time discussing toilets, a source told Billboard magazine. West had complained that the festival\u2019s main stage was not big enough for his performance. Goldenvoice reminded him that previous headliners including Lady Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 who brought more than 100 performers to her now-legendary 2018 headline slot \u2013 had found it accommodating. The company decided to end talks with West and seek a new headliner. Ariana Grande replaced the rapper on the bill, and will headline the final night of the festival. Grande is represented by manager Scooter Braun, who also worked with West until December 2018. A headline slot by West may well have proved controversial owing to the rapper\u2019s defiant support of Donald Trump, which has divided his fans. His last album, Ye, released in summer 2018, was critically panned. It was not the only last-minute reshuffle for the festival, which takes place in the California desert across two weekends in April. Despite a muted critical and commercial reception for his 2018 album, Man of the Woods, Justin Timberlake was due to headline one night, but had to cancel after his rescheduled tour dates \u2013 having delayed performances to treat bruised vocal cords \u2013 conflicted with the festival\u2019s radius clause. He has been replaced by Australian psychedelic band Tame Impala, who are expected to release their fourth album this year. The controversial radius clause restricts performers from playing other North American festivals during a 100-day period, in addition to not performing in seven southern California counties during that period. Childish Gambino \u2013 AKA Donald Glover \u2013 will join Grande and Tame Impala in headlining the festival. Guardian staff and writers voted his single This Is America the best song of 2018.",

Speaking in Stoke-on-Trent as she announced an exchange of letters between the UK and the EU giving assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop arrangements, May said she did not believe the UK should delay leaving the EU, but did not say she would never accept such a delay. The Guardian reported on Sunday that EU officials were laying the groundwork for an extension to article 50 until July this year, to allow all the necessary legislation to pass. The prime minister suggested this would not be desirable, but also stressed the need for an orderly exit. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving on 29 March, I\u2019ve been clear I don\u2019t believe we should be extending article 50 and I don\u2019t believe we should be having a second referendum,\u201d May said. \u201cWe have an instruction from the British people to leave and it\u2019s our duty to deliver on that, but I want to do it in a way that is smooth and orderly and protects jobs and security.\u201d In the speech at Portmeirion pottery in the heart of the leave-voting city, May also warned MPs of the consequences of being seen to defy the referendum result. \u201cThe deal honours the vote in the referendum by translating the people\u2019s instruction into a detailed and practical plan for a better future,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one else has put forward an alternative which does this \u2026 With no deal we would have no implementation period, no security cooperation, no guarantees for UK citizens overseas, no certainty for businesses and workers here in Stoke and across the UK, and changes to everyday life in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our union at risk. \u201cAnd with no Brexit ... we would risk a subversion of the democratic process.\u201d The speech was overshadowed on Monday morning by a blunder in the key section of the prime minister\u2019s final plea to MPs, which said they had always respected the vote in previous referendums, including ones where there was a much narrower margin, such as the creation of the Welsh assembly.

That was changed in the speech delivered in Stoke. May said the \u201cresult was accepted by parliament\u201d, though without mentioning that it was opposed by Conservative MPs. May\u2019s speech came as a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk was received from Brussels, one that May insisted gave legally binding assurances on the backstop. The prime minister had promised she would secure additional \u201clegal and political assurances\u201d from Brussels when she delayed a vote on her deal in December. In the letter, Brussels rejected May\u2019s demand for a 12-month time limit to the Irish backstop, but the letter emphasised that a technological solution for avoiding a hard border was possible and both sides wanted to avoid entering the arrangement. The EU also pledged to start negotiations on a trade agreement as soon as possible after the UK parliament backs the deal \u2013 meaning talks could technically begin on Wednesday \u2013 and to bring that agreement provisionally into force even before the parliaments of the 27 EU member states have fully ratified its terms. The letter also emphasised the backstop will not form the basis for the future relationship negotiations, one of the key concerns of Dominic Raab when he resigned as Brexit secretary over the deal. May conceded in her speech that she had not achieved the desired outcome \u2013 a firm date for an end to the backstop \u2013 but said there were still \u201cvaluable new clarifications and assurances\u201d. \u201cIf the backstop were ever triggered, it would only be temporary and both sides would do all they could to bring it to an end as quickly as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe letters published today have legal force and must be used to interpret the meaning of the withdrawal agreement, including in any future arbitration. The prime minister said she knew the changes \u201cdo not go as far as some MPs would like\u201d, but the letter \u201cmake absolutely clear the backstop is not a threat or a trap\u201d. May will return to Westminster to give a statement to the Commons before the debate on her deal resumes. Speaking in Stoke, one of the few Conservative gains from Labour in the 2017 general election, May said the vote was a chance \u201cto move beyond division and come together\u201d. \u201cI ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,\u201d she said.",

The NGO maintains an extensive network of contacts among Russia\u2019s LGBT community.</p> <p>The new wave of persecution began in late December, according to the Russian LGBT Network, after an administrator for an online group for LGBT people on the social network VKontakte was detained. Police used the contacts in his phone to round up others.</p> <p>Those detained included both men and women, said Igor Kochetkov, the programme director for the Russian LGBT Network. Police used a jail in the town of Argun to hold the prisoners, took their documents to prevent them from leaving the region, and threatened violence against relatives to prevent them from speaking publicly about the crackdown.</p> <p>\u201cThe persecution of men and women suspected of homosexuality never ceased,\u201d Kochetkov said. \u201cThe only thing that has changed is its scale.\u201d</p> <p>The reports were partially confirmed by the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which said its sources confirmed a new crackdown on LGBT people in Chechnya and quoted a message posted on one VKontakte group: \u201cI ask everyone who is still free to treat this message seriously and get out of the republic as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Previous victims have described the brutal tactics used by Chechen law enforcement against LGBT people in the republic. One young Chechen man said he had been beaten with metal rods, subjected to electric shocks and verbally abused for his sexual orientation. Three young men were reportedly killed in that crackdown.</p> <p>Another victim, Maksim Lapunov, said he had been beaten with batons while having a plastic bag pulled over his head. He was the first to make a formal complaint to Russia\u2019s investigative committee, which so far has not opened a criminal case in relation to the reports.</p> <p>The reports led to international outrage and sanctions against Kadyrov, who was targeted in late 2017 under the US Magnitsky Act for supporting \u201cextrajudicial killings\u201d and an \u201canti-gay purge\u201d.</p> <p>Kadyrov has denied the purge took place but also told one interviewer that gay people in Chechnya should be removed \u201cto cleanse our blood\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two people have been killed and nearly 40 detained in a new crackdown on LGBT people in Russia\u2019s Chechnya region, activists have said. The deaths were reportedly caused by the use of torture by police. The reports on Monday echo those from 2017, when hundreds of gay men were rounded up by police in Chechnya and subjected to beatings and electric shocks in secret prisons, provoking international condemnation and sanctions. If confirmed, the new detentions and killings would show that pressure on Russia and the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, has not dissuaded him from presiding over modern-day pogroms against LGBT people in the conservative republic. The Russian LGBT Network, a St Petersburg-based NGO that campaigns for equal rights for sexual minorities in Russia, led an effort to evacuate LGBT people from Chechnya in 2017. The NGO maintains an extensive network of contacts among Russia\u2019s LGBT community. The new wave of persecution began in late December, according to the Russian LGBT Network, after an administrator for an online group for LGBT people on the social network VKontakte was detained. Police used the contacts in his phone to round up others. Those detained included both men and women, said Igor Kochetkov, the programme director for the Russian LGBT Network. Police used a jail in the town of Argun to hold the prisoners, took their documents to prevent them from leaving the region, and threatened violence against relatives to prevent them from speaking publicly about the crackdown. \u201cThe persecution of men and women suspected of homosexuality never ceased,\u201d Kochetkov said. \u201cThe only thing that has changed is its scale.\u201d The reports were partially confirmed by the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which said its sources confirmed a new crackdown on LGBT people in Chechnya and quoted a message posted on one VKontakte group: \u201cI ask everyone who is still free to treat this message seriously and get out of the republic as soon as possible.\u201d Previous victims have described the brutal tactics used by Chechen law enforcement against LGBT people in the republic. One young Chechen man said he had been beaten with metal rods, subjected to electric shocks and verbally abused for his sexual orientation. Three young men were reportedly killed in that crackdown. Another victim, Maksim Lapunov, said he had been beaten with batons while having a plastic bag pulled over his head. He was the first to make a formal complaint to Russia\u2019s investigative committee, which so far has not opened a criminal case in relation to the reports. The reports led to international outrage and sanctions against Kadyrov, who was targeted in late 2017 under the US Magnitsky Act for supporting \u201cextrajudicial killings\u201d and an \u201canti-gay purge\u201d. Kadyrov has denied the purge took place but also told one interviewer that gay people in Chechnya should be removed \u201cto cleanse our blood\u201d.",

This means that \u00a31.36bn in advertising and marketing spend will disappear from the market. If a deal can be struck, the report forecasts the total spend on UK media \u2013 from TV and newspapers to online, radio and billboards \u2013 will rise by 2.7% to \u00a323.9bn. This would still be down on 2018\u2019s 4.7% growth. \u201cThe advertiser response [to a no-deal Brexit] will be to become more tactical in allocating advertising spend,\u201d said Matti Littunen, a senior research analyst at Enders. The worst-hit area would be display advertising \u2013 including TV, newspapers and their websites, outdoor sites such as billboards and on buses, on radio and online \u2013 which will be stripped of almost \u00a31bn in a no-deal scenario compared with how it would fare under the orderly withdrawal model. Television advertising, including spending on catch-up services such as ITV Hub and All4, is expected to fall by more than 9% in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 a drop of almost \u00a3500m on the \u00a35.1bn spent on TV last year. TV advertising is still expected to fall even if there is a Brexit deal, but only by 2.9%. \u201cAs a first indicator of 2019\u2019s fortunes the first quarter looks dismal [for TV advertising],\u201d said Littunen. The Enders report says that even hitherto unstoppable growth in the spend in online display advertising, such as on Facebook and YouTube, would stagnate in the case of no deal. Even in the much more severe ad recession of 2009, when the market shrank by 13%, online advertising remained resilient. \u201cUnlike in 2008-09, online display growth would almost completely stall,\u201d said Littunen. \u201cHowever, with declines across all other media, on a relative basis the shift [of ad spend] online would accelerate. Search advertising would be less affected.\u201d",

In the original version of the speech given on Monday at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent before the Brexit vote in the House of Commons the following day, the prime minister was due to say the result of the narrowly won 1997 referendum to create a Welsh assembly was \u201caccepted by both sides\u201d and the legitimacy of the vote was never questioned. But when the relevant bill was put to the Commons after the Welsh referendum, many Tory MPs, including the then newly elected May, voted against it. More uncomfortable still for May\u2019s arguments against a second EU referendum, the Conservatives went into the 2005 general election with a manifesto pledging a new vote for the people on Wales, to include an option to abolish the assembly. The emergence of the contradiction led to changes to parts of May\u2019s speech on Monday, in which the prime minister urged MPs to back her deal and warned that if it were rejected, Brexit might not happen. \u201cOn the rare occasions when parliament puts a question to the British people directly, we have always understood that their response carries a profound significance,\u201d she said. Extracts of the speech released overnight by No 10 had May arguing: \u201cWhen the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3%, on a turnout of just over 50%, to endorse the creation of the Welsh assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned.\u201d However, after journalists and academics questioned the veracity of this account, the paragraph was changed, removing the suggestion that the referendum result was accepted without question.

Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, is standing trial alongside Duckenfield, on two counts of breaching his duties under safety legislation. Relatives of some of those who died at Hillsborough were at Preston crown court to see the trial begin with the process of selecting a jury of 12 people from 100 who filed into the courtroom. The judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, told them jury service was \u201ca necessary public duty which must be undertaken by ordinary citizens like yourselves\u201d, then read 10 questions they must answer to determine whether they were likely to be suitable to reach \u201cindependent and impartial\u201d verdicts. The questions included whether they, or close relatives or friends, knew Duckenfield or Mackrell; were police officers; employees of any criminal justice agency; were employed by the Football Association, Sheffield Wednesday football club or Sheffield city council; were supporters of Liverpool, Everton, Sheffield Wednesday or Nottingham Forest; lived in or near Skelmersdale or Ormskirk \u2013 areas close to Liverpool that are within the Preston court\u2019s jury service catchment area \u2013 or were students between 1984 and 2003 of Edge Hill University, where substantial academic work on the disaster was undertaken. The questionnaire also asked people whether they or close family or friends had been at the match or were close to somebody killed or injured; or \u201cwhether there is anything that will prevent you from returning independent and impartial verdicts in these proceedings based only on the evidence you will hear\u201d. Openshaw told them that question was not \u201can easy way out\u201d of jury service, but they must declare if they had \u201ca settled opinion\u201d about the Hillsborough case. Duckenfield and Mackrell sat not in the dock but in the body of the court among their lawyers as the trial began. Duckenfield, newly promoted to chief superintendent by South Yorkshire police when he took charge of the semi-final on 15 April 1989, is charged with failing in his duty to take reasonable care for the safety of spectators at the Leppings Lane and north stand areas of Hillsborough designated for 24,000 Liverpool supporters. The indictment alleges that Duckenfield\u2019s failure to protect the spectators from overcrowding and crushing amounted to gross negligence, and was \u201ca substantial cause\u201d of the deaths. Mackrell is charged with failing to agree with the police the number of turnstiles for Liverpool supporters\u2019 admission to the Leppings Lane terrace, and failing to take reasonable care under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, including by failing to draw up contingency plans for coping with a large build-up of spectators outside the ground. Both men have already pleaded not guilty to the charges. Duckenfield is charged with manslaughter in relation to only 95 of the people who died at Hillsborough. No charge could be brought in relation to the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, who was maintained on life support in hospital for four years until it was lawfully withdrawn in 1993.

      "bodyText": "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s nostalgic evocation of a 1970s Mexican childhood emerged as the big winner at the Critics\u2019 Choice film awards on Sunday, picking up four awards including best film, and solidifying its place as a serious contender for the big Oscar prizes next month. As well as best picture, Roma won best director and best cinematography for Cuar\u00f3n personally, and best foreign language film. The Critics\u2019 Choice pick for best picture has coincided with the Oscars\u2019 seven times in the last decade, and as such is seen as a vital indicator for which way the Academy will jump. Despite not being eligible for best picture at the Golden Globes, Roma\u2019s Oscar odds shortened after its three-award performance there, currently at 6/4 for best picture. The Favourite, the scabrous black comedy of power struggles at the court of Queen Anne in the early 18th century, had led the nominations list with 14 nods, but took home only two: best actress in a comedy for Olivia Colman, who plays Anne, and best acting ensemble. Colman failed to win the best actress award, which was shared by Glenn Close for her remarkable turn as the frustrated wife of a Nobel prize-winning author in The Wife, and Lady Gaga as the newly discovered singer in A Star Is Born. Voted for by the 300-strong Broadcast Film Critics Association, the awards lineup also found room for more commercially-oriented releases. Afro-futurist superhero movie Black Panther won for best production design, best costume design and best visual effects, Singapore-set romcom Crazy Rich Asians taking best comedy, Mission Impossible \u2013 Fallout taking best action movie and dialogue-light alien thriller A Quiet Place taking best sci-fi or horror movie. In the TV section of the awards, the final series of deep-cover spy series The Americans dominated the drama categories (winning best drama series, best actor in a drama series for Matthew Rhys, and best supporting actor for Noah Emmerich) with 50s-set standup comedy series The Marvelous Mrs Maisel ruling the roost in comedy (best comedy series, best actress in a comedy series for Rachel Brosnahan, and best supporting actress in a comedy series for Alex Borstein). The TV awards also produced a tie, with Amy Adams (Sharp Objects) and Patricia Arquette (Escape at Dannemora) receiving joint best actress in a limited series or TV movie. Barry and The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story won two awards each: Bill Hader and Henry Winkler took best actor and supporting actor in a comedy series, while American Crime Story won best limited series and best actor for Darren Criss.

Various regimes at the City Ground have subsequently tried to entice O\u2019Neill back to the club and he was prominent in Forest\u2019s thoughts before the appointment of Aitor Karanka last January. Until now, however, Forest have never been able to get their man. O\u2019Neill is hoping to bring in Roy Keane, another former Forest favourite, as his assistant.</p> <p>Marinakis has significant transfer funds available for the new manager and the Greek shipping magnate is understood to have been hugely impressed when he met O\u2019Neill to discuss the possibility of filling the void left by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/11/nottingham-forest-manager-aitor-karanka-leaves-club\" title=\"\">Karanka\u2019s departure last week</a>. Sources say Marinakis, with firm plans to re-establish the club at the top level, was \u201cblown away\u201d by O\u2019Neill\u2019s energy and drive to succeed in the city where he first came as a young apprentice in 1971.</p> <p>The hierarchy at Forest have noted the way O\u2019Neill won promotion at Leicester City and transformed a second-tier side into one that secured four top-10 finishes in the Premier League, reaching three League Cup finals, winning two and lifting the club\u2019s first silverware since 1964.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill went on to win seven trophies with Celtic, as well as reaching the Uefa Cup final, before returning to English football to take control at Aston Villa, who finished 11th, up from 16th, in his first campaign and then sixth in each of his last three seasons at the club, qualifying for Europe and, in 2010, the League Cup final.</p> <p>The only downside in his club career in management goes back to his time in charge at Sunderland, the team he supported as a boy, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/30/martin-oneill-parts-company-sunderland\" title=\"\">he was sacked in 2013</a> after a poor run of results. O\u2019Neill subsequently took the Republic of Ireland job and led a willing but limited group of players to the knockout stages of Euro 2016, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/26/france-republic-ireland-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">they were eliminated by France</a>. He also took Ireland to the qualifying play-offs for the last World Cup, at the expense of the Wales side that reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/14/republic-of-ireland-denmark-world-cup-2018-play-off-match-report\" title=\"\">they lost to Denmark </a>and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/21/martin-oneill-roy-keane-leave-republic-of-ireland-jobs\" title=\"\">left his position last November </a>after an unsuccessful campaign in the European Nations League.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill has since faced heavy criticism from the Irish media about his style of play, whereas Forest have taken the alternative view that he inherited the least talented group of players the country has produced for many years and in fact overachieved by taking them to a major tournament, beating Italy and Germany, the world champions, in the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b06dd3210491df9b20525390dd49b7f7e35232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b06dd3210491df9b20525390dd49b7f7e35232/0_164_2448_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin O\u2019Neill, centre, during his days as a Nottingham Forest player.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin O\u2019Neill, centre, during his days as a Nottingham Forest player.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marinakis was left with the clear impression that O\u2019Neill had the force of personality to give Forest a new impetus and, though the Irishman is 66, that is still younger than Claudio Ranieri, Neil Warnock and Roy Hodgson, three managers working in the Premier League. O\u2019Neill\u2019s enthusiasm was a key factor in winning over Marinakis and the club believe there is time, with 19 games remaining, for Forest to overcome a slump that has seen them win only one of their past seven league matches, leaving them ninth in the Championship.</p> <p>As for O\u2019Neill\u2019s style of play, the feeling within Forest is that for the vast majority of his career there were seldom any complaints. At Villa, for example, his team scored more times, 71, in the 2007-08 season than any other year since the title-winning campaign of 1980-81. O\u2019Neill was arguably the most popular manager in Leicester\u2019s history until Ranieri\u2019s team won the title in 2016 and is still revered at Celtic.</p> <p>Speaking last month, he said: \u201cI know I\u2019m a good manager and I will always back myself, in whatever job I take next. There\u2019s a perception now that I\u2019m not only too old but that I\u2019m on the outside looking in. There\u2019s an age element to it but people also believe you\u2019ve closed your mind to things. It couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. I\u2019ve still got things to do in this game. I feel young, hungry.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill, an integral part of the Forest side that won the European Cup in 1979 and 1980, is seen as having the motivational qualities to refocus the players and staff at a time when Karanka\u2019s drawn-out departure has led to a period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/04/nottingham-forest-flux-aitor-karanka-chelsea-third-round-fa-cup\" title=\"\">uncertainty behind the scenes</a>. Karanka\u2019s fallout with senior figures at the club led to him asking to be released from his contract on two separate occasions last week.</p> <p>For the previous few weeks players have reported he had become detached and was taking a less hands-on role. Training is said to have deteriorated, leading to a listless 2-0 defeat at second-from-bottom Reading on Saturday, when Forest finished with nine men because of red cards for Danny Fox and Tendayi Darikwa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/jan/09/ten-football-league-teenagers-watch-2019\">Ten Football League teenagers to watch in 2019 | Ben Fisher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Neill, who attended that game, is likely to bring in Steve Guppy as part of his backroom staff as he contemplates taking charge for the first time in Forest\u2019s home game against Bristol City on Saturday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Martin O\u2019Neill is poised to become the new manager of Nottingham Forest in a move that would return him to the club where he won two European Cups during the Brian Clough years. Evangelos Marinakis, the Forest owner, has held talks with O\u2019Neill in Birmingham and London over the last 48 hours and the club are optimistic about finalising a deal for the man they have identified as the outstanding candidate to take over a team four points outside the Championship play-offs. If everything goes to plan, an announcement is expected on Tuesday to end a 25-year pursuit for Forest that first saw them try to appoint O\u2019Neill as Clough\u2019s successor in 1993. Various regimes at the City Ground have subsequently tried to entice O\u2019Neill back to the club and he was prominent in Forest\u2019s thoughts before the appointment of Aitor Karanka last January. Until now, however, Forest have never been able to get their man. O\u2019Neill is hoping to bring in Roy Keane, another former Forest favourite, as his assistant. Marinakis has significant transfer funds available for the new manager and the Greek shipping magnate is understood to have been hugely impressed when he met O\u2019Neill to discuss the possibility of filling the void left by Karanka\u2019s departure last week. Sources say Marinakis, with firm plans to re-establish the club at the top level, was \u201cblown away\u201d by O\u2019Neill\u2019s energy and drive to succeed in the city where he first came as a young apprentice in 1971. The hierarchy at Forest have noted the way O\u2019Neill won promotion at Leicester City and transformed a second-tier side into one that secured four top-10 finishes in the Premier League, reaching three League Cup finals, winning two and lifting the club\u2019s first silverware since 1964. O\u2019Neill went on to win seven trophies with Celtic, as well as reaching the Uefa Cup final, before returning to English football to take control at Aston Villa, who finished 11th, up from 16th, in his first campaign and then sixth in each of his last three seasons at the club, qualifying for Europe and, in 2010, the League Cup final. The only downside in his club career in management goes back to his time in charge at Sunderland, the team he supported as a boy, when he was sacked in 2013 after a poor run of results. O\u2019Neill subsequently took the Republic of Ireland job and led a willing but limited group of players to the knockout stages of Euro 2016, where they were eliminated by France. He also took Ireland to the qualifying play-offs for the last World Cup, at the expense of the Wales side that reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals, but they lost to Denmark and he left his position last November after an unsuccessful campaign in the European Nations League. O\u2019Neill has since faced heavy criticism from the Irish media about his style of play, whereas Forest have taken the alternative view that he inherited the least talented group of players the country has produced for many years and in fact overachieved by taking them to a major tournament, beating Italy and Germany, the world champions, in the process. Marinakis was left with the clear impression that O\u2019Neill had the force of personality to give Forest a new impetus and, though the Irishman is 66, that is still younger than Claudio Ranieri, Neil Warnock and Roy Hodgson, three managers working in the Premier League. O\u2019Neill\u2019s enthusiasm was a key factor in winning over Marinakis and the club believe there is time, with 19 games remaining, for Forest to overcome a slump that has seen them win only one of their past seven league matches, leaving them ninth in the Championship. As for O\u2019Neill\u2019s style of play, the feeling within Forest is that for the vast majority of his career there were seldom any complaints. At Villa, for example, his team scored more times, 71, in the 2007-08 season than any other year since the title-winning campaign of 1980-81. O\u2019Neill was arguably the most popular manager in Leicester\u2019s history until Ranieri\u2019s team won the title in 2016 and is still revered at Celtic. Speaking last month, he said: \u201cI know I\u2019m a good manager and I will always back myself, in whatever job I take next. There\u2019s a perception now that I\u2019m not only too old but that I\u2019m on the outside looking in. There\u2019s an age element to it but people also believe you\u2019ve closed your mind to things. It couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. I\u2019ve still got things to do in this game. I feel young, hungry.\u201d O\u2019Neill, an integral part of the Forest side that won the European Cup in 1979 and 1980, is seen as having the motivational qualities to refocus the players and staff at a time when Karanka\u2019s drawn-out departure has led to a period of uncertainty behind the scenes. Karanka\u2019s fallout with senior figures at the club led to him asking to be released from his contract on two separate occasions last week. For the previous few weeks players have reported he had become detached and was taking a less hands-on role. Training is said to have deteriorated, leading to a listless 2-0 defeat at second-from-bottom Reading on Saturday, when Forest finished with nine men because of red cards for Danny Fox and Tendayi Darikwa. O\u2019Neill, who attended that game, is likely to bring in Steve Guppy as part of his backroom staff as he contemplates taking charge for the first time in Forest\u2019s home game against Bristol City on Saturday.",

The Spanish government\u2019s representative in the region, Mar\u00eda G\u00e1mez, said the rescue team was looking into \u201cevery technical possibility\u201d given that the hole was too narrow for an adult to enter. \u201cNo one is technically prepared to rescue someone from such a narrow hole, but the technology exists to get into places as narrow and deep as this, and everything is being considered,\u201d G\u00e1mez said. By midday on Monday, the team had removed 30cm of earth from the shaft. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about getting down there, it\u2019s also about keeping the hole open so that the rescue can happen,\u201d G\u00e1mez added. Bernardo Molt\u00f3, a spokesman for the M\u00e1laga Guardia Civil, said the teams were trying to clear the layer of wet sand but were also looking into sinking a parallel shaft to locate and rescue Yulen. \u201cSo far, what we\u2019ve managed to do is drill into that blockage a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to clear the earth with a truck-mounted machine and try to dig a parallel tunnel, but to do that, we need to shore up the shaft to reach the boy.\u201d",

(<em><a href=\"https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chumbawamba/tubthumping.html\">He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a latte drink</a></em>.) Her 19-year-old daughter, Mae, comes into the kitchen to make toast. She knows \u201cembarrassingly little\u201d about Chumbawamba, or Tubthumping. \u201cI\u2019ve always known mum as a writer,\u201d she says. Because that\u2019s what Alice Nutter is now. A writer of plays, and a TV screenwriter, most recently on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/12/trust-review-john-paul-getty-iii-abduction-drama-danny-boyle\">Trust</a>, the entertaining drama series about the kidnapping of Jean Paul Getty III.</p> <p>Alice always knew she was going to be a writer, ever since a teacher told her mum and dad that their daughter had an extraordinary command of the English language. But Nutter (or Anne Holden as she was before she punked herself up by deed poll, taking the name of a woman who was hanged in 1612 for witchcraft) didn\u2019t get off to the brightest of starts. Born to a working-class family in Burnley, she had a bad relationship with her dad, got involved with drugs and left school with only a couple of O levels. Fortunately, she started hanging around with a more aspirational group of kids and that basically saved her. Together they became Chumbawamba. (<em>I get knocked down, but I get up again.</em><em>)</em></p> <p>Alice, now 57, was with the band for 22 of their 30 years in existence, singing, playing percussion, jumping around. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly musical,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019m a good dancer and I\u2019m theatrical, I could get away with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36e7c4b636310e3b3632a9d66b8cd7316f59e236\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e7c4b636310e3b3632a9d66b8cd7316f59e236/0_0_2384_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Nutter (back, centre) with Chumbawamba in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tubthumpers \u2026 Alice Nutter (back, centre) with Chumbawamba in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayley Madden/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For 20 years they lived in a squat in Leeds, sharing (very little) money, and ideas, becoming vegans (long before everyone became a vegan), getting involved with political causes \u2013 South Africa, Northern Ireland, the miners\u2019 strike.

Ironic perhaps, but equally shared. Alice left the band in 2004, because \u201cif you\u2019re jumping about in your mid-40s, you look fucking stupid\u201d.

Plus she\u2019d written short stories, a play for a Bradford anarchist group, and \u2013 with the band \u2013 a pantomime for the kids of striking miners in south Wales. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know owt about theatre, we were making it up as we went along.

She would give me a lift to the station, but her car has a puncture. Is there an Uber service in Leeds, I wonder? Yes, but she doesn\u2019t use them, on principle. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve got the prices down they drive everyone else out.\u201d She calls a local cab company instead.

Murray being Murray, he continues to scramble, drawing on those unrivalled retrieval skills, but it\u2019s not enough any more. Bautista Agut softens up his prey before earning three match points with a smash. He wallops a forehand down the line.

Murray, determined not to let the moment pass, nails an ace for 30-15. Back to Judy. Frowning. Jamie Murray, Andy\u2019s big brother, also looks fretful. Bautista Agut wins the next point thanks to a lucky net cord. Then a huge return from the Spaniard causes Murray to net a tired forehand. It\u2019s the first match point. Murray being Murray, though, he keeps running, keeps hustling, keeps pouring his soul into all he does, and he saves it with a brilliant volley. Judy\u2019s smiling now. Somehow Murray holds, serving superbly. One more clenched fist. A small victory for Murray but it looks like it means the world to him. Bautista Agut will serve for it.

In a way \u2013 IN. A. WAY. \u2013 we\u2019ve grown up together. He\u2019s famous, I\u2019m ... not. He\u2019s a millionaire, I\u2019m ... not. We\u2019re exactly alike! Honest. I even had a dream we were best mates once. Went to the pub and shot the breeze. My wife thought about leaving me when I told her. </p> \n  <p>Am I sharing too much? Maybe. But this is a nostalgic moment, isn\u2019t it? I remember watching the teenage Murray when he took on David Nalbandian at Wimbledon in 2005. He faded after taking the first two sets \u2013 but what a talent! And he was back the next year, even stronger as he destroyed Andy Roddick. At that point you knew he was going to be special; he just needed a few things to come together.</p> \n  <p>It took a while, of course, and he had to go through plenty of setbacks before scratching that itch. There were times when you thought he might not make it, especially when he kept losing to The Other Three at the business end of grand slams. </p> \n  <p>But then we stayed up with him until the early hours when he won the US Open in 2012, two months after weeping on Centre Court following his defeat to Roger Federer in his first Wimbledon final. A year later he tortured us as he won that first Wimbledon title after outlasting Novak Djokovic in the heat.</p> \n  <p>There have been so many great moments. You can\u2019t help but wish him well.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3c3cfde4b02fb91ff13f7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-14T07:41:09.818Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u201cAs remarkable as they are, the bare statistics of Murray\u2019s career don\u2019t even begin to do him justice,\u201d Simon McMahon says. </strong>\u201c3 Grand Slams. 11 Grand Slam finals. World No. 1. Two Olympic golds. 14 Masters 1000. The Davis Cup. Favourite memories?

Maybe, against all the odds, against all available logic and reason, this is going to be the start of a fairytale run for the wonderful Andy Murray. Over the next fortnight, maybe his body won\u2019t conspire against him, allowing his best tennis to flourish. He\u2019ll win match after match. Roger Federer is on his side of the draw, but he\u2019ll beat the defending champion. He\u2019ll keep winning in gutsy fashion, drawing on his and he\u2019ll make it to his sixth Australian Open final. He\u2019ll win his first Australian Open title, cry a bit on the podium \u2013 okay, cry <em>a lot</em> on the podium \u2013 announce his retirement from the sport knowing that he has nothing left to achieve and skip happily off into the sunset. Is that too much to ask?</p> \n  <p>Answer: probably. Sigh. Because, unfortunately, we all know that we could be about to watch Andy Murray\u2019s final ever match. Hankies at the ready, everyone, because this could be emotional. Even if Murray knows there is more to life than tennis, this has all been desperately hard to take. He\u2019s put us through the wringer on so many occasions in the past and he was at it again last week, revealing in a painful and poignant press conference that the hip injury that has dogged him for the past two years has simply become too much to handle. He says he can barely tie his shoelaces without feeling pain any more. He says he\u2019ll see if he can make it to Wimbledon later this year. He knows that might not happen. He accepts he\u2019s likely to lose this first-round match to Roberto Bautista Agut, the 22nd seed. He knows this particular journey is approaching its final destination with unforgiving speed.</p> \n  <p>The weirdness here is that the thought of Bautista Agut beating peak Murray is pretty laughable. Even Bautista Agut\u2019s nearest and dearest know that. Murray leads his head-to-head with the Spaniard 3-0 and two years ago he arrived at this tournament as the world No1, having overtaken Novak Djokovic and risen to the top of the tree after a magnificent end to 2016. He seemed poised for a long rule; little did we know. The decline has been sharp, rapid and cruel, and it has left Murray physically and spiritually shattered. Even for as someone as stubborn and tough as the former three-time grand slam champion, Davis Cup winner and double Olympic gold medalist, this still feels like a long shot.</p> \n  <p>Then again, it <em>is</em> Andy Murray. Let\u2019s not rule out the preposterous yet.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Anyway, that\u2019s all from me. We\u2019ve been treated to an Andy Murray classic, a see-sawing five-setter which has been utterly draining to watch. If this was his final match, he\u2019s bowed out in style. It ended in defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut, but this was the ultimate moral victory for Murray. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. You\u2019ll probably want to know that Roger Federer has beaten Denis Istomin in straight sets, while Bernard Tomic is out after losing to Marin Cilic. Rafael Nadal also sailed through after beating Australia\u2019s James Duckworth. Caroline Wozniacki, the defending women\u2019s champion, is also through to the second round. That\u2019s all from Andy Murray. Now he gets to drag himself off for an ice bath. You know, it\u2019s probably for the best he doesn\u2019t have to play on Wednesday. He looked in agony by the end. Four hours and nine minutes that took. What now? The likelihood is that was Murray\u2019s final match. He\u2019s hinting at having an operation to deal with his chronic right hip. He\u2019d love to play one more match at Wimbledon, which would be a fitting venue for his farewell. But how much more can he take? More from Murray! \u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate in mny ways - and unlucky, I guess - to compete in an era with the guys around. Roger, Novak, Rafa, I have great respect for them. I\u2019ve had some great battles. To have the respect of your peers is very important.\u201d Now we\u2019ve heard from Andy Murray, he gets to look up the big screen, where they\u2019re showing a montage of tributes from his colleagues. \u201cYou\u2019ve done Scotland proud, you\u2019ve done Britain proud, you\u2019re a sir - who can say that?\u201dRoger Federer says. Over to Novak Djokovic, who remembers the time Murray \u201ckicked my butt\u201d at Wimbledon in 2013. \u201cThank you always for leaving your heart and every last drop of energy on the court,\u201d the world No1 adds. \u201cJudy raised such a fine young gentleman,\u201d Sloane Stephens says. Caroline Wozniacki says she can coach him. \u201cTake care, buddy,\u201d Federer says. \u201cThank you, my friend,\u201d Djokovic adds. \u201cAll the best.\u201d Andy Murray, his voice wobbling and his bottom lip trembling, speaks! \u201cAmazing. I think I\u2019m going to be all right. Thank you so much to everyone who came out tonight. I\u2019ve loved playing here over the years. If this was the last match it was an amazing way to end. I gave literally everything I had. It wasn\u2019t enough tonight, so congratulations to Roberto and his team. I don\u2019t really have anything else to say. Thanks to everyone. My team, my family, everyone who helped me down the years. Maybe I\u2019ll see you again. I\u2019ll do everything possible to try. If I want to go again I need to have a big operation which there\u2019s no guarantee I\u2019ll come back from but I\u2019ll give it my best shot. Roberto Bautista Agut, who plays Australia\u2019s John Millman next, speaks! \u201cToday was incredible. Andy deserves this atmosphere. Andy deserves all the people who came to watch him. It was an unbelievable match. He is a tough fighter. He gave everything he had until the last point and I want to congratulate him for everything he did for tennis.\u201d Andy Murray\u2019s off his chair to accept the crowd\u2019s acclaim. Nobody\u2019s going anywhere. Judy\u2019s managing to smile as she watches her brilliant son. This, then, could be the final game of Sir Andy Murray\u2019s career. Here we are. We don\u2019t want to be here. But here we are. It\u2019s been one hell of a ride, but the finishing line is hovering into view, with Bautista Agut quick to establish a 30-0 lead. Murray being Murray, he continues to scramble, drawing on those unrivalled retrieval skills, but it\u2019s not enough any more. Bautista Agut softens up his prey before earning three match points with a smash. He wallops a forehand down the line. Murray gets a racket to it - of course he does - but it\u2019s not going over the net. It\u2019s over. Bautista Agut roars and the pair embrace at the net. There were two winners out there today. Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 2-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): After four hours of sweat, huge applause greets Murray as he steps up to serve. He looks like he has something in his eye. They\u2019re a little red. Judy looks emotional. Murray holds his racket high to signal his appreciation for a tremendous ovation. Then he gets down to business, winning the first point. The camera pans back to Judy, who\u2019s just about managing to hold it together. Just. Murray, determined not to let the moment pass, nails an ace for 30-15. Back to Judy. Frowning. Jamie Murray, Andy\u2019s big brother, also looks fretful. Bautista Agut wins the next point thanks to a lucky net cord. Then a huge return from the Spaniard causes Murray to net a tired forehand. It\u2019s the first match point. Murray being Murray, though, he keeps running, keeps hustling, keeps pouring his soul into all he does, and he saves it with a brilliant volley. Judy\u2019s smiling now. Somehow Murray holds, serving superbly. One more clenched fist. A small victory for Murray but it looks like it means the world to him. Bautista Agut will serve for it. He\u2019s going to win this match, surely, but he hasn\u2019t managed to crush Murray\u2019s spirit. Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut holds to love. He\u2019s a game from victory. Murray will serve to stay in it. It is likely to be his last ever service game at the Australian Open, a tournament he love so much. Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Fuel\u2019s leaking all over the place now. From 30-0, Murray dips again and Bautista Agut fights back to earn a break point. Murray nets a backhand. He looks cooked. There\u2019s surely no way back now. Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): A love hold consolidates the break for Bautista Agut. Are we witnessing the end for Murray? Or is there another twist on the way? Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): It\u2019s worth remembering that this will go to a champion\u2019s tie-break if it goes to 6-6; it would be first to 10 points in that scenario. But it might not get that far. At 15-30, Murray makes a couple of questionable choices. A drop shot isn\u2019t good enough and a hopeful lob\u2019s gobbled up by Bautista Agut, who finds himself with two break points. Murray saves the first with a polished smash, but he cracks on the second, a driven forehand down the line from Bautista Agut enough to break through. Murray needs more heroics now. But has he got anything left in the tank? Fifth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): This is Murray at his best. Bautista Agut drop shots. Murray\u2019s there. Bautista Agut lobs. Murray scampers back and manages to scoop the ball over his head and into the air. They rally and Bautista Agut ends up knocking a backhand wide. Murray, exhausted, holds a fist aloft. This is wonderful theatre and Murray, with the bit between his teeth, can smell blood in the water. He drop shots now and Bautista Agut sends a ragged forehand wide. This is threatening to get away from the Spaniard - but he manages to fight back to 30-all. Murray\u2019s level drops and Bautista Agut holds to 30. Fifth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 1-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): This could be the final set of Andy Murray\u2019s career. Or it could be one of the most memorable he\u2019s ever played. Either way, it\u2019s extraordinary he\u2019s managed to keep the argument going this long. You\u2019re almost tempted to make him the favourite now. Bautista Agut\u2019s been driven to distraction by his brilliantly stubborn opponent, who opens by holding to 15 amid an increasingly boisterous atmosphere. Fourth set tie-break: Murray* 7-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray slices a serve to the forehand and Bautista Agut nets a sliced return! \u201cYeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaarrrggghhhhhh!\u201d Murray cries. He\u2019s forced a fifth set! Can you believe it? No. But also yes. Because it\u2019s Andy Murray, so the illogical makes sense. Fourth set tie-break: Murray* 6-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray nets a backhand. It\u2019s edgy now. Three set points have come and gone. Fourth set tie-break: Murray 6-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Stout volleying from Bautista Agut keeps this alive. Fourth set tie-break: Murray 6-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray nets a slice. One down. Fourth set tie-break: Murray* 6-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray earns five set points after leaving Bautista Agut stranded with a drop shot. Fourth set tie-break: Murray* 5-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): A magnificent volley from Murray reminds you why he was No1 in the world two years ago. Don\u2019t retire! Fourth set tie-break: Murray 4-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut\u2019s in danger of falling apart here. He knocks a backhand long. Murray\u2019s in charge now. Fourth set tie-break: Murray 3-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut nets a forehand! Fourth set tie-break: Murray* 2-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Bautista Agut sends a return long. Murray is so pumped up. Fourth set tie-break: Murray* 1-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray knocks a poor backhand long. \u201cNo!\u201d he cries. Bad miss. Fourth set tie-break: Murray 1-0 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray hits ferociously and accurately and Bautista Agut ends up wafting a forehand long. Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-6 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray has to wait before serving here, because they\u2019re letting off fireworks at the MCG. Once the distant noise fades away, they get going again. Murray makes it 15-0 and then he volleys superbly for 30-0. He\u2019s serving so well. He holds to love. Another tie-break! Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 5-6 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): \u201cMake that ball,\u201d Murray shouts after missing a forehand for 15-0. He\u2019s struggling to make an impact in Bautista Agut\u2019s service games. The Spaniard holds with minimal fuss. Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 5-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray holds to love. He mooches back to the court, his shoulders sagging, his gait weary, and asks for a towel. It\u2019s amazing he\u2019s still going. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 4-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Professionalism\u2019s required from Bautista Agut, plus a bit of inspiration of the kind that flares when he raps a superb passing shot past Murray for 30-0. He does it again moments later, making Murray shake his head in frustration. Another hold for Bautista Agut, who\u2019s a game from victory. Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 4-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray\u2019s service games are where much of the intrigue lies. While Bautista Agut\u2019s holding easily, it\u2019s more of a struggle for Murray to keep going. He must be knackered. But one way to keep fatigue at bay is to keep making serves; you never know, maybe he\u2019s going to stave off retirement by becoming a power server in the Anderson or Isner mould. He holds to 15. Bautista Agut, who\u2019s getting absolutely no support from the crowd, must be wondering when this guy\u2019s going to fold. He\u2019s not alone. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 3-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut makes a statement with a love hold. Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 3-3 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): All of a sudden, it\u2019s 0-30. Another sniff of a chance for Bautista Agut. Murray needs all his grit now. He also needs a bit of luck. A drop shot at 15-30\u2019s begging for punishment, only for Bautista Agut to whip a forehand wide. Another dink from Bautista Agut goes wide, making it 40-30, and Murray serves well to hold. Grit levels: still high. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Serving well, Bautista Agut holds without ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m currently in work, so not able to actually watch the match,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cReading your reports of the various things Murray is shouting at himself has reminded me of my all time favourite Andy Murray on-court quote. From the French Open, 5 or 6 years ago, a plaintive cry of \u2018I\u2019m trying my tits off out here!\u2019 Magnificent work from a magnificent tennis player.\u201d Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 2-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): In other news, Roger Federer took half an hour to win the first set against Denis Istomin. For once, though, Federer isn\u2019t the biggest story. Two years after the Swiss\u2019s incredible comeback at this tournament, it\u2019s another hall-of-famer who\u2019s grabbing the limelight, with Murray still plugging away and doing his best to gulp in as much as oxygen as possible between points. He quickly moves to 40-0. He looks in control. Appearances, as we\u2019ve seen today, can be deceiving. Bautista Agut creeps back into the game and Murray double-faults at 40-30, letting it go to deuce. A little slump\u2019s created an opening. Somehow, though, Murray manages to keep the door shut. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 1-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): \u201cDammit, Andy, why aren\u2019t you coming in there?\u201d Murray says after netting a backhand at 30-all. Just another one of those conversations he likes to have with himself in public. The stoical Bautista Agut looks at his eccentric opponent quizzically and goes on to hold with more unfussy tennis. \u201cFollowing the match from Zurich, where the normally excellent Swiss national broadcaster is disappointingly showing Roger Federer\u2019s match instead of Murray\u2019s,\u201d James Ferguson says. \u201cFortunately, no one was in my office to hear my yelp of excitement and pride when Andy grabbed the third set! Could a big Scottish heart be enough for a bit more magic? If Andy wins this match, I\u2019ll give up Swiss chocolate for the rest of 2019.\u201d Fourth set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 1-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray loses the first point. He wins the next four. Just give him the title now. He\u2019s earned it. Fourth set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 0-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut gets back to work, holding comfortably. As dramatic as the end of the third set was, it\u2019s still hard to see Murray pulling this off. He surely doesn\u2019t have the stamina for it. Third set tie-break: Murray 7-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray serves out wide. Bautista Agut lofts his return into the air and Murray, limping and looking like he\u2019s run seven marathons over the weekend, shows him how to hit a drive volley! Ha. There is in no limit to his depths of absurdity. Into a fourth we go! Third set tie-break: Murray 6-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut wipes out the first with a drop shot. It\u2019s Murray to serve, Third set tie-break: Murray 6-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Incredible! Murray makes Bautista Agut play one more shot and the Spaniard loses his nerve, smashing an easy drive volley way long! Murray has two set points! Third set tie-break: Murray* 5-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Bautista Agut wipes out the mini-break, running round a forehand to pick Murray off down the line. Third set tie-break: Murray* 5-3 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Or not. Murray produces another ace, his 14th so far. Bautista Agut challenges to no avail. Third set tie-break: Murray 4-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray\u2019s doubled over again when Bautista Agut polishes off a grinding rally with a drop shot. He might be running out of juice. Third set tie-break: Murray 4-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray challenges a Bautista Agut serve. It clipped the line. Murray has one challenge left. Third set tie-break: Murray* 4-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Bautista Agut sends a forehand long at the end of a tense rally. Murray\u2019s doubled over at the end of it, wheezing away. Third set tie-break: Murray* 3-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray sends an ace out wide. Third set tie-break: Murray 2-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut sends an ace down the middle. Third set tie-break: Murray 2-0 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): The first mini-break goes to Murray, a clever slice doing the trick. Third set tie-break: Murray* 1-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray takes the first point. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 6-6 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray returns brilliantly to make it 0-15. Bautista Agut, annoyed with the way this is heading, smacks a brutal forehand away for 15-all. Another one makes it 30-15. The Spaniard holds. Tie-break. How much does Murray have left? Third set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 6-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray, refusing to go quietly, slams a couple of aces away to hold again. He\u2019s earned himself a tie-break at the very least. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 5-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Out of nowhere, in a totally weird turnaround, Bautista Agut\u2019s serving to stay in the set. Against, remember, a man who\u2019s going to retire soon. At 15-0, Murray wins another mini-duel. More fist pumping. The fans are loving this. \u201cYou can do it, Andy!\u201d someone shouts. The game goes to 30-all. Bautista Agut manages to dig out a volley for 40-30. Murray forces deuce. He hops a bit, because he\u2019s absurd, and he has a break point when Bautista Agut knocks a forehand wide. Bautista Agut nets a first serve. Then a serve down the middle\u2019s called out, only for the umpire to correct the call. Biting his hand, Murray challenges to no avail and Bautista Agut gets his first serve back. On they go. A long rally ensues. The tension builds. It\u2019s classic Murray, but he can\u2019t make the breakthrough and nets a forehand. Judy nods, smiles kindly and says \u201cCome on.\u201d Mum knows best. Yet Bautista Agut holds on. \u201cOne last time, Jacob,\u201d Simon McMahon says. \u201cCOME ON ANDY!!!!!\u201d Third set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 5-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. Bautista Agut wants to get this done. With Murray rooted to the spot, the Spaniard drives a backhand down the line for 15-30. This is a tight battle at the moment, though, and Murray serves well for 30-all. He\u2019s digging deep. He nets a forehand, handing over a break point, but he saves it with a stunning backhand for deuce. An ace raises his spirits. Another one has him leaping into the air, letting it all hang loose, emotion pouring out of him as he roars and shakes his fists. It\u2019s like he\u2019s just won Wimbledon! This is how much it means to him. Murray just will not give up. He doesn\u2019t know how to give up. It isn\u2019t in his DNA. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 4-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut holds easily. \u201cWhenever I have watched tennis, most of my attention has been on the likes of Federer and Nadal,\u201d Abhijato Sensarma says. \u201cYet, without realising it, I have always cared to check his progress through a tournament whenever I get the opportunity. He has not been a \u201cfavourite\u201d for many because of the even more dominant legends he has played it. Yet, he always remained in the back of the mind of everybody. There is something quite inexplicably beautiful about his game when he is in form. \u201cHis first Wimbledon win was perhaps his greatest achievement and he deserved every bit of it, along with all the other accolades which he has won in his life. The game is seemingly slipping away now. It is painful to watch for even the most causal of viewers once you knew the emotional context dominating this match. Perhaps, he has told himself to enjoy what might be his last professional match - and we must egg him on. We shall hope for one last miracle match from him, yet know he has done enough to not ask anymore from him. No matter what happens today, live on, Mr Murray!\u201d Third set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 4-3 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray holds to 15, slicing an ace out wide to keep this going. Are you totally sure you want to bet against him?! Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 3-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut restores some order, holding comfortably. Elsewhere defending women\u2019s champion Caroline Wozniacki has beaten Alyson van Uytvanck on Rod Laver Arena, where they await the arrival of Roger Federer and Denis Istomin. Third set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 3-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Murray yelps as he moves into a 40-0 lead. If this is the end, he\u2019s decided he might as well go out fighting. He might as well swing a bit, land a few blows, have some fun, give a supportive crowd something to remember him by. He holds with an ace, the cue for more whooping in the stands, and returns to his chair for a well-earned rest. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 2-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Out of nowhere, Murray clambers back from 30-0 to win three straight points and earn a break point! Roared on by the crowd, the wounded hero takes his chance by surprising Bautista Agut with a drop shot. Bautista Agut replies with a dink, but the space is there for Murray to prod a backhand down the line and break for the first time! You\u2019ve got to love him. Murray\u2019s whipping up the crowd and Judy\u2019s on her feet, a big smile on her face as she applauds her ridiculous son. How does he find the will? Third set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 1-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): A drop shot from Bautista Agut draws Murray forward, enabling the Spaniard to send a forehand past his stranded opponent for 0-15. Murray\u2019s increasingly desperate. Soon it\u2019s 0-30. The error\u2019s are stacking up. Murray tries a drop shot, but Bautista Agut\u2019s too quick and he earns three break points with a granite volley. Murray\u2019s serve crumbles again. There\u2019s a whiff of tragedy about this now. As hard as Murray\u2019s trying, there\u2019s little enjoyment to be found in seeing a champion struggle this way. Third set: Murray 4-6, 4-6, 1-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): A routine love hold for Bautista Agut, who doesn\u2019t look likely to throw this away. Third set: Murray* 4-6, 4-6, 1-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray has come back from two sets down on nine occasions. This would be a good time to round it up to 10, wouldn\u2019t it? He starts this set with a deft volley. He responds to an incredible lob from Bautista Agut for 15-all by moving to 40-30. He holds when the Spaniard sends a forehand wide. It\u2019s on! A skidding forehand from Bautista Agut makes it 15-0. Soon it\u2019s 30-0. It\u2019s all a bit tragic. Bautista Agut doesn\u2019t do anything special, but he doesn\u2019t really need to be inspired to beat a man who\u2019s basically playing on one leg. That hobbling opponent does have a lot of heart, though, and he somehow drags himself back to 30-all. Yet Bautista Agut quickly earns a set point and converts it by whacking a serve past Murray, who\u2019s heading for a first-round exit. Second set: Murray* 4-6, 4-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, Murray makes himself feel better with a feathery drop shot for 30-15. Another powerful serve makes it 40-15. He holds. Second set: Murray 4-6, 3-5 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut continues to give nothing away on serve. Murray will serve to stay in the set. Second set: Murray* 4-6, 3-4 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Ignoring the rising pain and fatigue rippling through his battered body, Murray somehow summons the will to go from 0-15 to 40-15, a lovely backhand down the line a reminder of better times. In the stands, his mum looks concerned for her boy. But Judy will be pleased to see him celebrate holding to 30. If nothing else, Murray can be pleased with himself for refusing to roll over out there. He\u2019s clearly outmatched, but his effort is setting an example for others to follow. Second set: Murray 4-6, 2-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): While I\u2019m distracted by my editors disgracefully walking over to talk about West Ham\u2019s win over Arsenal on Saturday, Bautista Agut consolidates the break easily. Second set: Murray* 4-6, 2-3 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Bautista Agut is calm and focused and on the prowl when he moves into a 0-30 lead, with Murray looking increasingly stiff. These are worrying moments for Murray and netting a weary backhand at 15-30 gifts Bautista Agut two break points. The first one\u2019s cancelled out with an ace. You fear for Murray in the extended duels, though. He tries a break point, but it\u2019s got too much air on it, allowing Bautista Agut to race forward and pick Murray off at the net. There\u2019s the break. The end is nigh. This is a decent effort from Murray given the circumstances, but you\u2019re starting to see why he hasn\u2019t got long left. Second set: Murray 4-6, 2-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): A comfortable hold for Bautista Agut flashes by. \u201cGreetings from a fraught sofa in Strathaven as me and the kids watch what seems increasingly likely to be Andy Murray\u2019s last match,\u201d James McNulty says. \u201cMy youngest (9) has just declared that \u2018he can\u2019t watch this any more\u2019 and has flounced off to school. But hasn\u2019t Murray always been hard to watch? Isn\u2019t that - maybe uniquely among the top rank of British sportspeople - what makes him so totally compelling? The hip injury obviously make a critical difference - and this time he won\u2019t be able shake it off. But over the years, the ebb and flow of emotion on-court and off it is what keeps us watching - right to the end. Honest, grumpy, tenacious, fragile and unflinchingly Scottish. We will miss him.\u201d Second set: Murray* 4-6, 2-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray strains and grimaces and clenches his fist after bashing a forehand from right to left for 30-0. He\u2019s got a right to celebrate that one and he keeps moving with an ace for 40-0. Another one sees him hold to love. Second set: Murray 4-6, 1-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): At 15-all, Murray comes up with a wondrous forehand return, rousing the crowd with a glorious angled shot from right to left. Bautista Agut\u2019s left scrambling. This has come from nowhere - and Murray uses the adrenaline to win the next point, hitting an inside-out forehand down the line for two break points. He\u2019s still got it, you know. His natural talent, however, is fighting a losing battle with his right hip and Bautista Agut wipes out both break points before holding on to his serve with more accurate hitting. Second set: Murray* 4-6, 1-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray\u2019s not going to give up easily. He comes through a tough game, holding to love. If he\u2019s hurting, he\u2019s hiding it well. \u201cCompletely agree with your views on Murray,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cThe early snobbishness about him, the whole \u2018Scottish if he loses\u2019 schtick, the desire to see him as a plucky underdog (rather than someone who fought their way to the flipping Number 1 ranking!), the weirdly nasty fallout from that \u2018Whoever\u2019s playing England\u2019 joke, people have used all manner of sticks to try and beat him with. But he\u2019s played some magnificent tennis, he\u2019s given some of the best, most insightful tennis press conferences I\u2019ve ever seen, and (this can\u2019t be overstated) he\u2019s won multiple Grand Slams. He\u2019s played in the same era as Federer, Djokovic and Rafa, and he\u2019s proved himself alongside them. All while seeming genuinely down-to-Earth. If you don\u2019t miss him when he\u2019s gone, then you are, frankly, wrong.\u201d Serving for the set, Bautista Agut makes it 15-0 with a cute volley. Murray walks to his chair. But only to get a new racket. He\u2019s still fighting. But as much as he tries to hustle and scramble across the baseline, it just isn\u2019t enough. Bautista Agut doesn\u2019t take long to carve out three set points. In other news, Hawkeye has stopped working. The umpire has to phone a friend to find out if a Bautista Agut serve was out. It was - but it only delays the inevitable. Murray hits long and, as has so often been the case throughout his career, his he\u2019s going to have to do this the hard way. First set: Murray* 4-5 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Having spurned a chance to break, the heat\u2019s on Murray when he nets a forehand on the run to lose the first point of this crucial game. The tension builds as it goes to 30-all, though Murray does remember to congratulate Bautista Agut on a good crosscourt backhand. He has to admire the Spaniard\u2019s level on the next point, too, with a well-judged backhand volley enough to earn Bautista Agut his first break point. Murray misses a first serve. Now he\u2019s in a bit of a bind. Sure enough, Murray nets a forehand at the end of a lengthy rally. Bautista Agut will serve for the first set. Ah. \u201cRemember back in c. November 2016 when we were nearly convinced that Roger Federer was going to be the first member of the Big Four to retire?\u201d Aditi Modi says. \u201cGut wrenching as that episode is going to be when it eventually does occur, Murray\u2019s retirement is painful in its own way... Man, is he going to be missed.\u201d First set: Murray 4-4 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Murray pumps his fists after seizing the initiative early in the rally, giving him the chance to punch a forehand past Bautista Agut for 15-all. You can tell he wants to use the atmosphere, to put on a bit of a show, to make the crowd get into his opponent\u2019s head. There\u2019s a sense it might be working when Bautista Agut, normally so accurate, drops a poor forehand long for 30-all. Murray\u2019s firing himself up. He whips a forehand from right to left and earns a break point when Bautista Agut slices into the net. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Murray roars. \u201cNo!\u201d he cries after netting a backhand for deuce. How badly he wants this! But Bautista Agut isn\u2019t going to just give it to him. He holds out after a tight backhand error from Murray. First set: Murray* 4-3 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Realising that he needs to be efficient, Murray doesn\u2019t hesitate to wallop a forehand past Bautista Agut for 15-0. But he\u2019s grunting and groaning during the next point, letting out a strained cry as Bautista Agut bashes a forehand down the line. Murray somehow gets it back, but Bautista Agut wins the point to make it 15-all. Those are the moments when you can sense the damage in his right hip. He\u2019s battling away, though, and holds to 15. First set: Murray 3-3 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): At 30-15, Murray clips a lovely back from left to right and moves to the net, only to misjudge Bautista Agut\u2019s clever backhand reply. Off balance, Murray sticks a disappointing backhand wide for 40-15. There are sighs. But the applause is louder when Murray rips a backhand down the line for 40-30. He\u2019s in the game. The next rally\u2019s along one. But it ends with Murray dragging a forehand wide. He isn\u2019t convincing when Bautista Agut gets him moving from side to side. First set: Murray* 3-2 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray\u2019s forehand is showing signs of vulnerability, two tame errors handing Bautista Agut a 0-30 lead. His supporters try to rouse him. There\u2019s relief when Bautista Agut drills an attempted winner wide, a challenge from the Spaniard confirming it was out. 15-30 rather than 0-40, then, allowing Murray to relax and serve well for 30-all. \u201cCome on!\u201d he cries, trying to gee himself up and get rid of the early nerves. Then he looks to quicken the pace, dropping in a bit of serve-volley, which hurries Bautista Agut into a wayward backhand for 40-30. Continuing with that approach sees Murray hold, much to the crowd\u2019s approval. He\u2019s got a spring in his step as he bounces back to his chair. There\u2019s a long way to go, but he\u2019s giving this all he\u2019s got. First set: Murray 2-2 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): Bautista Agut is giving nothing away on serve. Murray tries a forehand lob but the Spaniard reads it and puts a smash away for 40-0. Murray responds by hitting his forehand with more venom and makes it 40-15. He continues with that tactic \u2013 but then he admonishes himself after sending one well past the baseline. The timing\u2019s a little off. First set: Murray* 2-1 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): Murray\u2019s having a bit of a chunter about something or other after moving into a 30-0 lead. Still as grumpy as ever. After a chat with the umpire about whatever\u2019s bothering him, he whacks an ace down the middle for 40-0. He holds comfortably. First set: Murray 1-1 Bautista Agut* (*denotes server): One of the challenges for Bautista Agut is to play the match rather than the occasion. It would be easy for him to be distracted by the carnival atmosphere. Yet he looks focused early on, easily moving into a 40-0 lead. Murray wastes a challenge after a backhand drifts just wide and Bautista Agut holds to love. First set: Murray* 1-0 Bautista Agut (*denotes server): With cries of encouragement from the crowd ringing in his ears, Murray steps up to serve after winning the toss. The first point\u2019s a long baseline grind, just like Bautista Agut likes it, just as Murray used to like it, and the Spaniard takes it when he watches a forehand sail long. The camera pans to Judy Murray, who\u2019s got her poker face on. Back to the action. Murray wins the next point when Bautista Agut nets a return. Big roar. Then Murray fires an ace down the middle. Optimism soars. The game goes to 30-all, Bautista Agut spanking a forehand deep into the left corner, but Murray holds out with a couple of solid serves. He\u2019ll be relieved to be on the board straight away. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. Whatever happens over the next few hours, try to remember the good times with Andy Murray. Try to remember the time the balls fell out of his pocket during his match against Marcos Baghdatis at Wimbledon in 2012. Or the time he lost a point in a US Open semi-final because his cap fell off. Or all the swearing. In a list of great eccentric athletes, he\u2019s up there. He isn\u2019t the best tennis player of all time, but there haven\u2019t been many with as interesting and beguiling a character as him. But it feels like a tall order. Roberto Bautista Agut has started the year well. He\u2019s a good mover, a solid hitter and he\u2019ll be confident after his recent triumph in Doha, when he beat Novak Djokovic in the semis before seeing off Tomas Berdych to take the title. Here come the players! Roberto Bautista Agut is the first to emerge. He gets a nice cheer but it\u2019s nothing that compares to the roar that greets Andy Murray on Hisense Arena. There are plenty of Scots in the crowd. Plenty of Saltires lifted aloft on a sunny Melbourne evening. The stands are full to the brim. It\u2019s going to be a great atmosphere. You just hope Murray has something left in the locker. Simon\u2019s email gets me thinking about all these years I\u2019ve spent watching Andy Murray. I like to think we have a connection because I\u2019m only a couple of months older than him. In a way \u2013 IN. A. WAY. \u2013 we\u2019ve grown up together. He\u2019s famous, I\u2019m ... not. He\u2019s a millionaire, I\u2019m ... not. We\u2019re exactly alike! Honest. I even had a dream we were best mates once. Went to the pub and shot the breeze. My wife thought about leaving me when I told her. Am I sharing too much? Maybe. But this is a nostalgic moment, isn\u2019t it? I remember watching the teenage Murray when he took on David Nalbandian at Wimbledon in 2005. He faded after taking the first two sets \u2013 but what a talent! And he was back the next year, even stronger as he destroyed Andy Roddick. At that point you knew he was going to be special; he just needed a few things to come together. It took a while, of course, and he had to go through plenty of setbacks before scratching that itch. There were times when you thought he might not make it, especially when he kept losing to The Other Three at the business end of grand slams. But then we stayed up with him until the early hours when he won the US Open in 2012, two months after weeping on Centre Court following his defeat to Roger Federer in his first Wimbledon final. A year later he tortured us as he won that first Wimbledon title after outlasting Novak Djokovic in the heat. There have been so many great moments. You can\u2019t help but wish him well. \u201cAs remarkable as they are, the bare statistics of Murray\u2019s career don\u2019t even begin to do him justice,\u201d Simon McMahon says. \u201c3 Grand Slams. 11 Grand Slam finals. World No. 1. Two Olympic golds. 14 Masters 1000. The Davis Cup. Favourite memories? The irresistible rise to World No. 1, when Murray seemed to win tournament after tournament, in what now appears to be his last great effort before his body finally gave out. Final point in Davis Cup final, when Murray collapsed on to the clay and was then swamped by teammates but still had the class to get up and commiserate with Goffin. Winning Wimbledon against Djokovic. Olympic final against Del Potro. Somehow beating Robredo in Valencia. The chuntering. Thank you Andy. A sad day, but remarkable memories of a glittering career. Britain\u2019s greatest ever sportsman? I\u2019d say he\u2019s in the top one.\u201d A semi-finalist here last year, a first-round loser this time. A day to forget for Kyle Edmund after being comprehensively outplayed by a beaming Berdych, who\u2019s rolled back the years with a performance that showed why he\u2019s a former top 10 player and grand slam finalist. Berdych has gone deep in this tournament in the past, reaching the last four in 2015 (who beat him? You know who beat him), and the Czech will take a lot of positives from this win after his recent injury problems. \u201cCome on Jacob, Dan Evans has served his time, report his win!\u201d Simon Parmenter says. Whoops. You are correct. Dan Evans, having made it through qualifying, did indeed secure a very good win over Japan\u2019s Taro Daniel earlier. A boost for British tennis! Which is just as well, because... Hold that thought. A killer forehand down the line seals the crucial break for Tomas Berdych, who clenches his fist after stomping into a 6-5 lead in the third. The Czech will serve for it. Kyle Edmund\u2019s on the brink. Though he has a mountain to climb to reach the second round, Kyle Edmund is fighting hard in the third set on Hisense Arena. He had a set point when Berdych was serving at 4-5, but couldn\u2019t take. It\u2019s 5-5 now and Edmund has just saved a break point. If you don\u2019t get Andy Murray, we can\u2019t be friends. Sorry. You can always judge someone\u2019s character based on whether they like the Scot, who\u2019s made himself more than a tennis player with his unapologetic feminism and lack of machismo. While we wait for Murray, who\u2019s been spotted warming up with his team, why not read Nick Kyrgios on what it was like playing his friend? In better news for the Brits, though, at least Katie Boulter is through to the second round after beating the tough Russian Ekaterina Makarova in three sets. The 22-year-old has a difficult one coming up, though: she faces Aryna Sabalenka next. Pre-match reading Let\u2019s hope this isn\u2019t a sign of things to come for the Brits. Day one of the 2019 Australian Open hasn\u2019t gone too well so far. Harriet Dart was thrashed 6-0, 6-0 by Maria Sharapova earlier and Heather Watsona also lost badly to Petra Martic. On the men\u2019s side, meanwhile, British No1 Kyle Edmund is currently being whooped by Tomas Berdych, who leads 6-3, 6-0, 2-2 on Hisense Arena. Murray and Bautista Agut are next up on this court. Hello. Maybe, just maybe, this is all building up to the unlikeliest of happy endings. Maybe, against all the odds, against all available logic and reason, this is going to be the start of a fairytale run for the wonderful Andy Murray. Over the next fortnight, maybe his body won\u2019t conspire against him, allowing his best tennis to flourish. He\u2019ll win match after match. Roger Federer is on his side of the draw, but he\u2019ll beat the defending champion. He\u2019ll keep winning in gutsy fashion, drawing on his and he\u2019ll make it to his sixth Australian Open final. He\u2019ll win his first Australian Open title, cry a bit on the podium \u2013 okay, cry a lot on the podium \u2013 announce his retirement from the sport knowing that he has nothing left to achieve and skip happily off into the sunset. Is that too much to ask? Answer: probably. Sigh. Because, unfortunately, we all know that we could be about to watch Andy Murray\u2019s final ever match. Hankies at the ready, everyone, because this could be emotional. Even if Murray knows there is more to life than tennis, this has all been desperately hard to take. He\u2019s put us through the wringer on so many occasions in the past and he was at it again last week, revealing in a painful and poignant press conference that the hip injury that has dogged him for the past two years has simply become too much to handle. He says he can barely tie his shoelaces without feeling pain any more. He says he\u2019ll see if he can make it to Wimbledon later this year. He knows that might not happen. He accepts he\u2019s likely to lose this first-round match to Roberto Bautista Agut, the 22nd seed. He knows this particular journey is approaching its final destination with unforgiving speed. The weirdness here is that the thought of Bautista Agut beating peak Murray is pretty laughable. Even Bautista Agut\u2019s nearest and dearest know that. Murray leads his head-to-head with the Spaniard 3-0 and two years ago he arrived at this tournament as the world No1, having overtaken Novak Djokovic and risen to the top of the tree after a magnificent end to 2016. He seemed poised for a long rule; little did we know. The decline has been sharp, rapid and cruel, and it has left Murray physically and spiritually shattered. Even for as someone as stubborn and tough as the former three-time grand slam champion, Davis Cup winner and double Olympic gold medalist, this still feels like a long shot. Then again, it is Andy Murray. Let\u2019s not rule out the preposterous yet.",

Largely spared a formal education, and entirely innocent of the university Eng Lit or creative writing courses, <a href=\"https://www.exploreyork.org.uk/event/finding-the-words-poetry-with-sophie-kingsley-andrew-lambeth-and-peter-white/\">Andrew Lambeth</a> is a typographer and <a href=\"https://www.strixleeds.com/about/\">editor</a>, still comparatively new to writing poetry. Regulars of this blog will already know how good and original a poet he is from the distinctive work he posts below the line. Publication is not a priority for him, but it\u2019s still good to see that his work is beginning to be more widely recognised. Recently, for example, he was published by Helen Mort and Stuart Maconie in their anthology of pub-related poetry, <a href=\"http://www.poetrybusiness.co.uk/shop/960/one-for-the-road\">One for the Road</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s surprising, at first glance, to find him writing about a swan. Swans, after all, are the most literary of birds. A substantial and high-quality swan-poem anthology would begin with <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50405/the-silver-swan\">Orlando Gibbons</a> and welcome into its pages, among others, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43288/the-wild-swans-at-coole\">WB Yeats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/swans\">Sara Teasdale</a>, <a href=\"http://robertfrostsbanjo.blogspot.com/2010/02/bereaved-swan.html\">Stevie Smith</a> and Baudelaire with his almost unbearably tragic <a href=\"https://fleursdumal.org/poem/220\">Le Cygne</a>. These poetic swans are variously symbolic: in Teasdale\u2019s verses, for example, they are a silent chorus, an unspoken erotic commentary. Swans aren\u2019t always associated with grief and death, an association born of the once widely held but baseless notion that they sing only when about to die. The Greek legend in which Apollo\u2019s soul becomes a swan may be more significant; write about a swan, and you\u2019re inevitably writing about high art. Whatever they symbolise, poetry\u2019s swans are rarely non-iconic. As in real life, a swan is a powerful, ambivalent presence, both coarse and ethereal, with a neck like a weaponised question mark.</p> <p>Lambeth\u2019s title, Why the swan, could be interpreted as a question, possibly about the swan\u2019s status as poetic material, with the ensuing couplets (all of which, apart from the last, start with \u201cBecause\u201d) forming a list of unpredictable answers. The poem may want to explain each time, \u201cthis is why<em> </em>swans are supercharged visual and literary emblems\u201d and perhaps, also, explain why they shouldn\u2019t be so stereotyped. But it also seems, at least sometimes, that the poem is asking plaintively why <em>this particular swan</em> has been singled out, not for poetry, but for abuse. Early on, the truncated-seeming lines, with their unexpected breaks and unsettling para-rhyme, intimate mortality: \u201cthe swan has no life / off past the cut-off\u201d, it \u201cis a knife/ turned in on itself.\u201d Stanza four glances aside, in homage to immaculate whiteness. But the death-resonance sounds increasingly as the poem develops. The swan becomes an ominous sign, \u201clike a specked cough\u201d (note the spitty alliteration of \u201cexpect\u201d and \u201cspecked\u201d). It\u2019s hard at this point not to think of the terminally sick, expectorating Keats. The figure of the tubercular poet, like the swan, attracts false romanticism.</p> <p>Readers of Strix will have the advantage of comparing Why the swan with the neighbouring poem, Towpath (tinnitus). The latter, earthier and more subjective, focuses on a \u201cstrange singing\u201d that wrests the poet\u2019s descriptive powers into inventive analogy. The sound is \u201cLike singing / backwards. Like whistling inside croaking\u201d and later becomes \u201ca whistle stretched / to a fine scream\u201d. There\u2019s no swan on the canal in this poem, although other birds are noted, but perhaps it\u2019s the unnerving, unidentifiable (and possibly internally produced) singing heard in Towpath (tinnitus) that forms the background music, and the impetus, of Why the swan.</p> <p>The poet\u2019s visually trained eye brilliantly connect the bird\u2019s shape with listening and hearing. When the swan sleeps, with its head buried in the feathers of its back, the outline resembles that of a large ear. But the resemblance involves simultaneous denial. This particular swan or its image \u201cisn\u2019t / drawn like an ear\u201d, a statement underlining the bird\u2019s essential distance from the human species, and possibly the pathos of superhuman sensory awareness combined with the inability to interpret the noise of threat.</p> <p>Offstage, out of the picture, some seeming drama occurs. \u201cIt \u2026 won\u2019t look up in time. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s stuck.\u201d Stanzas eight and nine begin with the ominous noise of sirens and their \u201cshushing\u201d and silencing by collusive air, and end with the drab rawness of \u201cwhat\u2019s left of the swan\u201d.</p> <p>The final couplet defines \u201cwhat\u2019s left\u201d not as physical remains, but as \u201csong\u201d. This isn\u2019t a comfortingly aesthetic return to tradition: the song is equated with something mundane and industrial, \u201cthe long stretch between locks\u201d. That \u201clong stretch\u201d may consist of the canal\u2019s water, the towpath, or life itself; the \u201clocks\u201d may be the kind that enable passage, or frustrate it. The phrase reminds us of the Orlando Gibbons lyrics, in which death has \u201cunlocked\u201d the swan\u2019s throat. Inevitably, \u201cstretched\u201d suggests Baudelaire\u2019s caged swan, escaped and lost in a Parisian street, desperately straining its neck towards the sky.</p> <p>Lambeth\u2019s poem, as the bird\u2019s latest wounded incarnation, earns an honourable place in the later pages of our swan anthology, as an elusive emblem appropriate to the place and time.</p> <p>\u2022 Why the swan is one of the two poems by Andrew Lambeth published in <a href=\"https://www.strixleeds.com/about/\">Issue #5 of Strix</a>.</p>",

It\u2019s as if it\u2019s stuck.\u201d Stanzas eight and nine begin with the ominous noise of sirens and their \u201cshushing\u201d and silencing by collusive air, and end with the drab rawness of \u201cwhat\u2019s left of the swan\u201d. The final couplet defines \u201cwhat\u2019s left\u201d not as physical remains, but as \u201csong\u201d. This isn\u2019t a comfortingly aesthetic return to tradition: the song is equated with something mundane and industrial, \u201cthe long stretch between locks\u201d. That \u201clong stretch\u201d may consist of the canal\u2019s water, the towpath, or life itself; the \u201clocks\u201d may be the kind that enable passage, or frustrate it. The phrase reminds us of the Orlando Gibbons lyrics, in which death has \u201cunlocked\u201d the swan\u2019s throat. Inevitably, \u201cstretched\u201d suggests Baudelaire\u2019s caged swan, escaped and lost in a Parisian street, desperately straining its neck towards the sky. Lambeth\u2019s poem, as the bird\u2019s latest wounded incarnation, earns an honourable place in the later pages of our swan anthology, as an elusive emblem appropriate to the place and time. \u2022 Why the swan is one of the two poems by Andrew Lambeth published in Issue #5 of Strix.",

Or an earthquake or a contagious bleeding disorder or some sort of super aggressive wolf attack. Any of these would have perfect, because every single character on Friends from College is a full-blast turbo git and this is exactly what they all deserve. You remember Friends from College. Oh, come on, you remember it. It arrived a year and a half ago on Netflix, and quickly got buried under a barrage of one-star reviews. Entertainment Weekly called it \u201cone of the year\u2019s biggest disappointments\u201d. Vox called it \u201ca near-total misfire\u201d. Julia Raeside, quite memorably, called it \u201ca televisual arsehole safari\u201d. The first series didn\u2019t fail because all the characters were smug and vain and self-obsessed and horrible \u2013 after all, that describes everyone in Succession, which was wonderful. It failed because the writers Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco didn\u2019t seem to realise this. They called it Friends from College because it was literally about their friends from college.

When I saw that, I knew that I had to do something more.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, when LaDonna Brave Bull Allard and others launched the camps protesting the Dakota Access pipeline, they could not have known some of the indirect consequences of their actions \u2013 including prompting a young woman from New York City to run for office.

Significantly, the Green New Deal is not Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s creation. As Standing Rock prompted her to run for office, the <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/\">Sunrise Movement</a> created the climate vision she carried into Congress.

By deciding to walk out for smaller class sizes, more support staff, fewer standardized tests and charter school regulation, LA\u2019s teachers have ensured that California will be the next state hit by a strike wave that shows no signs of ebbing anytime soon.

However, as Murray\u2019s body faded in inverse proportion to his soaring spirit and the exhortations of the packed Melbourne Court Arena, he had to bow to the inevitable.</p> \n<p>The former world No 1 revealed before the match he would have to return to the operating table sooner rather than later to fix his stubbornly ailing hip. Even then the odds on his carrying on would be marginal. He would love to say goodbye at Wimbledon, he said, but he is more likely to have a microphone in his hand than a racket on his next visit.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, with his mother, Judy, and his older brother, Jamie, watching every sweating point Murray flirted with the impossible yet again. Afterwards he said courtside of the match and his reception: \u201cThat was incredible. Thank you so much to everyone who came out tonight. Honestly I\u2019ve loved playing here over the years. It\u2019s an amazing place to play tennis. If it was my last match, it was an amazing way to end. I literally gave everything I had.

He is a tough fighter, he gave everything until the last point and I want to congratulate him for all he did for tennis.\u201d</p> \n<p>There followed a filmed tribute from several of Murray\u2019s friends and rivals.

We had quite a journey, from the age of 12.\u201d Rafael Nadal, who has known him since they met as teenagers in Barcelona, was similarly effusive, as were John Isner, Nick Kyrgios, Alexander Zverev and Caroline Wozniacki, who revealed: \u201cYou always had the best jokes.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\" data-alt=\"social media\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\">social media</a> \n</figure> \n<p>In the original Scottish play the general comes to grief through hubris, something of which this son of Glasgow could never be accused. Here his honesty was written in every wince and gesture. It was like watching a performance with a sad ending and a familiar narrative, each twist and turn hurling him back from the edge of the stage for one more encore, the place he has been the past two years.</p> \n<p>When he could not deliver the dagger after grabbing an early break point, then moments later dumped a backhand, Act I did not offer much promise. Act II drifted further towards a bad place, as Bautista Agut broke early and kept his tennis tidy. Murray, straining in every exchange, failed to find the necessary magic to stay in the longer rallies. The instincts were rock-solid, the racket met the ball with familiar certainty but not as often as needed, and the hip remained stubbornly unreliable.</p> \n<p>Bautista Agut stretched him wide and deep, just as Murray used to do in his pomp, when he won three majors, two Olympic gold medals and a Davis Cup. But he was suffering now. He always suffered. Suffering was something he embraced and was a weapon he employed to make opponents kneel before him. Yet this seemed cruel.</p> \n<p>It was Bautista Agut who chose when the exchanges ended. After an hour and a half Murray was two sets down and running out of ammunition. Pinned near the baseline, he could no longer find the right angles. His lateral speed was diminished, his balance not always perfect. The inexorable draining of his resources was interrupted by fleeting recreations of his past and he raised a fist each time. Even if it were Federer across the net, the crowd would have been with Murray on this wonderful night.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/jan/14/own-limited-edition-andy-murray-print-from-photographer-tom-jenkins\">Own a limited edition Andy Murray print from photographer Tom Jenkins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One could almost hear the final curtain being cranked to descend as Act III got underway. In a quarter of an hour Bautista Agut was up another break, his fourth from five opportunities. Murray waited, playing each ball on merit as if these were the last of his career. Then, against all expectations but his own, he won four points in a row, broke back in the eighth game, held to love and was in front. As the denouement crept closer, Murray discovered his old fighting rhythm. His tormentor got another look on his serve but Murray saved with an inch-perfect backhand \u2013 followed by another, then a clinching cross-court forehand.</p> \n<p>A couple of cracking ground strokes on both wings in the 10th game got him to within two points of extending the drama. Another hush fell \u2013 then the roar ripped around the arena as Murray blasted a backhand for deuce. He got his first set point but found the tape. A drop-shot from deep fell short. A forehand swirled wide. On they went to the tie-break.</p> \n<p>Murray had won 194 shootouts in 853 matches, Agut 87 from 400. The Scot, seen having a flutter in the local casino at the weekend, gambled on all-out attack. When he thrashed the winner to seal the set, an expletive slipped from his lips; true to himself, as ever. It was the ninth time he had recovered from two sets down to keep the fight going.</p> \n<p>Murray double-faulted for the first time but fought through deuce to level at 2-2 in the fourth.

      "bodyText": "The Andy Murray story is not quite over. However, even a losing comeback to stand comparison with the best of his gilded career should not disguise the reality that his time left on the main stage is not a deal he can negotiate in good faith indefinitely, and he is honest enough to say so. The world No 23, Roberto Bautista Agut, who arrived at the Australian Open in excellent form, should have buried him inside two hours but Murray dragged him into a dogfight that lasted four hours and nine minutes, before the 30-year-old Spaniard prevailed 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-2. On a pleasant Melbourne Monday evening Murray launched a fightback that gave Bautista Agut repeated cause to believe he would lose to him for a fourth time. However, as Murray\u2019s body faded in inverse proportion to his soaring spirit and the exhortations of the packed Melbourne Court Arena, he had to bow to the inevitable. The former world No 1 revealed before the match he would have to return to the operating table sooner rather than later to fix his stubbornly ailing hip. Even then the odds on his carrying on would be marginal. He would love to say goodbye at Wimbledon, he said, but he is more likely to have a microphone in his hand than a racket on his next visit. Nevertheless, with his mother, Judy, and his older brother, Jamie, watching every sweating point Murray flirted with the impossible yet again. Afterwards he said courtside of the match and his reception: \u201cThat was incredible. Thank you so much to everyone who came out tonight. Honestly I\u2019ve loved playing here over the years. It\u2019s an amazing place to play tennis. If it was my last match, it was an amazing way to end. I literally gave everything I had. It wasn\u2019t enough tonight, so congratulations to Roberto and his team. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you again. I\u2019ll do everything possible to try. If I want to go again, I\u2019ll need to have a big operation where there are no guarantees I will be able to come back. I will give it my best shot.\u201d Bautista Agut said: \u201cAndy deserves this atmosphere, deserves all the people who came to watch him. It was an unbelievable match, a really good fight. He is a tough fighter, he gave everything until the last point and I want to congratulate him for all he did for tennis.\u201d There followed a filmed tribute from several of Murray\u2019s friends and rivals. Roger Federer said: \u201cAn amazing career. Congratulations, buddy.\u201d Novak Djokovic said: \u201cThank you, my friend. All the best. We had quite a journey, from the age of 12.\u201d Rafael Nadal, who has known him since they met as teenagers in Barcelona, was similarly effusive, as were John Isner, Nick Kyrgios, Alexander Zverev and Caroline Wozniacki, who revealed: \u201cYou always had the best jokes.\u201d In the original Scottish play the general comes to grief through hubris, something of which this son of Glasgow could never be accused. Here his honesty was written in every wince and gesture. It was like watching a performance with a sad ending and a familiar narrative, each twist and turn hurling him back from the edge of the stage for one more encore, the place he has been the past two years. When he could not deliver the dagger after grabbing an early break point, then moments later dumped a backhand, Act I did not offer much promise. Act II drifted further towards a bad place, as Bautista Agut broke early and kept his tennis tidy. Murray, straining in every exchange, failed to find the necessary magic to stay in the longer rallies. The instincts were rock-solid, the racket met the ball with familiar certainty but not as often as needed, and the hip remained stubbornly unreliable. Bautista Agut stretched him wide and deep, just as Murray used to do in his pomp, when he won three majors, two Olympic gold medals and a Davis Cup. But he was suffering now. He always suffered. Suffering was something he embraced and was a weapon he employed to make opponents kneel before him. Yet this seemed cruel. It was Bautista Agut who chose when the exchanges ended. After an hour and a half Murray was two sets down and running out of ammunition. Pinned near the baseline, he could no longer find the right angles. His lateral speed was diminished, his balance not always perfect. The inexorable draining of his resources was interrupted by fleeting recreations of his past and he raised a fist each time. Even if it were Federer across the net, the crowd would have been with Murray on this wonderful night. One could almost hear the final curtain being cranked to descend as Act III got underway. In a quarter of an hour Bautista Agut was up another break, his fourth from five opportunities. Murray waited, playing each ball on merit as if these were the last of his career. Then, against all expectations but his own, he won four points in a row, broke back in the eighth game, held to love and was in front. As the denouement crept closer, Murray discovered his old fighting rhythm. His tormentor got another look on his serve but Murray saved with an inch-perfect backhand \u2013 followed by another, then a clinching cross-court forehand. A couple of cracking ground strokes on both wings in the 10th game got him to within two points of extending the drama. Another hush fell \u2013 then the roar ripped around the arena as Murray blasted a backhand for deuce. He got his first set point but found the tape. A drop-shot from deep fell short. A forehand swirled wide. On they went to the tie-break. Murray had won 194 shootouts in 853 matches, Agut 87 from 400. The Scot, seen having a flutter in the local casino at the weekend, gambled on all-out attack. When he thrashed the winner to seal the set, an expletive slipped from his lips; true to himself, as ever. It was the ninth time he had recovered from two sets down to keep the fight going. Murray double-faulted for the first time but fought through deuce to level at 2-2 in the fourth. After nearly three hours, at 0-30 down on his serve, he banged his injured right leg hard on the court, as if trying to kickstart an old jalopy. It spluttered into life. Serving to stay in the set, the match, the championship \u2013 and the sport, perhaps \u2013 Murray strained all working sinews (and some that maybe were not). He held and, as fireworks from the nearby MCG lit up the night sky, he did so again to force another tie-break, the highlight of which was a checked volley that took him to 5-1 on his way to dragging the bemused Bautista Agut into a deciding set. Bautista Agut broke for 2-1. From there to the end he steadily dismantled Murray\u2019s resistance, forcing a final tired backhand from him that ballooned just short of the net.",

      "body": "<p>As attitudes towards cannabis shift, the fastest-growing group of users is over 50 \u2013 and marijuana\u2019s popularity among seniors is beginning to change the American experience of old age.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/18/marijuana-cannabis-edibles-overdose-too-much\">'You're not going to die': how to survive an edible marijuana overdose</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why are more seniors getting high? It might make more sense to ask: \u201cWhy not?\u201d As adults reach retirement, they age out of drug tests and have far more time on their hands. Some feel liberated to abandon long-held proprieties.</p> <p>Elegant vape pens and other attractive, discreet products have helped de stigmatize the drug among older Americans. \u201cLegalization seems to make non-users seem a little less scared of it, and perhaps less judgmental,\u201d says Jo, a 56-year-old cannabis user who preferred not to use her real name.</p> <p>The seniors using cannabis today aren\u2019t your parents\u2019 grandparents. The generation that camped out at Woodstock is now in its seventies. They\u2019ve been around grass long enough to realize it\u2019s not going to kill them, and are more open to the possibility it will come with health benefits. (By contrast, in a survey of one, my 100-year-old grandmother recently said she had no interest in medical marijuana.)</p> <p>Seniors\u2019 affinity for weed is beginning to ripple across the US healthcare system. A <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1661\">2016 study</a> found that in states with access to medical marijuana, those using Medicare part D \u2013 a benefit primarily for seniors \u2013 received fewer prescriptions for other drugs to treat depression, anxiety, pain, and other chronic issues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a8fd340d094f147f7cca05a9a6a739b0645747e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a8fd340d094f147f7cca05a9a6a739b0645747e/0_0_1057_549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Seniors prefer it to the medications they would otherwise be taking.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"519\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Seniors prefer it to the medications they would otherwise be taking.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: George Wylesol/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, scientific research has not confirmed marijuana as an effective treatment for these conditions. But proven or not, a number of seniors evidently prefer it to the medications they would otherwise be taking. A <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/where-marijuana-is-legal-opioid-prescriptions-fall/\">study published last year</a> in in the Journal of the American Medical Association found opioid prescriptions for Medicare part D recipients dropped 14% after a state legalized medical marijuana \u2013 a hopeful sign amid the opioids crisis.</p> <p>While some doctors have expressed concerns about seniors self-medicating with weed, virtually everyone agrees the public health consequences of opioids are far worse. And the most serious health concerns associated with marijuana, such as impaired brain development, tend to affect younger people.</p> <p>For the industry, seniors\u2019 newfound interest in cannabis is a business opportunity. The Colorado edibles company <a href=\"https://wanabrands.com/\">Wana Brands</a>, among many others, sells cannabis products <a href=\"https://wanabrands.com/product/cbd-xrcapsules-colorado-rec/\">reminiscent of medicines</a> familiar to seniors. Wana sells extended release capsules as well as products with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/28/what-is-cbd-cannabidiol-cannabis-medical-uses\">different ratios of THC and CBD</a>, which intoxicate users to different degrees and can have a variety of effects on ailments.</p> <p>For someone who hasn\u2019t seen a joint in 40 years, the modern dispensary can be a dizzying experience replete with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/17/marijuana-cannabis-concentrates-dabbing\">dozens of products</a> \u2013 topicals (lotions), tinctures, sprays \u2013 all promising to help you feel better, but also to get you stoned. Whether or not marijuana helps seniors to alleviate their conditions, many may enjoy a sense of control over their own wellbeing. Meanwhile, dispensaries in California and elsewhere cater to older clientele with discounts and shuttle busses.<strong> </strong>Dispensary owners like to brag about how many older women come in as evidence that they\u2019re created an attractive and welcoming store.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t escaped the pharmaceutical industry that marijuana <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/tilray-goes-global-with-novartis-marijuana-sales-partnership\">could soon be seen as a viable replacement for many of its products</a>. Perhaps someday soon it will be normal for seniors to pass their last decades in a cannabis-induced haze.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Got a question about cannabis?

      "bodyText": "As attitudes towards cannabis shift, the fastest-growing group of users is over 50 \u2013 and marijuana\u2019s popularity among seniors is beginning to change the American experience of old age. Why are more seniors getting high? It might make more sense to ask: \u201cWhy not?\u201d As adults reach retirement, they age out of drug tests and have far more time on their hands. Some feel liberated to abandon long-held proprieties. Elegant vape pens and other attractive, discreet products have helped de stigmatize the drug among older Americans. \u201cLegalization seems to make non-users seem a little less scared of it, and perhaps less judgmental,\u201d says Jo, a 56-year-old cannabis user who preferred not to use her real name. The seniors using cannabis today aren\u2019t your parents\u2019 grandparents. The generation that camped out at Woodstock is now in its seventies. They\u2019ve been around grass long enough to realize it\u2019s not going to kill them, and are more open to the possibility it will come with health benefits. (By contrast, in a survey of one, my 100-year-old grandmother recently said she had no interest in medical marijuana.) Seniors\u2019 affinity for weed is beginning to ripple across the US healthcare system. A 2016 study found that in states with access to medical marijuana, those using Medicare part D \u2013 a benefit primarily for seniors \u2013 received fewer prescriptions for other drugs to treat depression, anxiety, pain, and other chronic issues. For the most part, scientific research has not confirmed marijuana as an effective treatment for these conditions. But proven or not, a number of seniors evidently prefer it to the medications they would otherwise be taking. A study published last year in in the Journal of the American Medical Association found opioid prescriptions for Medicare part D recipients dropped 14% after a state legalized medical marijuana \u2013 a hopeful sign amid the opioids crisis. While some doctors have expressed concerns about seniors self-medicating with weed, virtually everyone agrees the public health consequences of opioids are far worse. And the most serious health concerns associated with marijuana, such as impaired brain development, tend to affect younger people. For the industry, seniors\u2019 newfound interest in cannabis is a business opportunity. The Colorado edibles company Wana Brands, among many others, sells cannabis products reminiscent of medicines familiar to seniors. Wana sells extended release capsules as well as products with different ratios of THC and CBD, which intoxicate users to different degrees and can have a variety of effects on ailments. For someone who hasn\u2019t seen a joint in 40 years, the modern dispensary can be a dizzying experience replete with dozens of products \u2013 topicals (lotions), tinctures, sprays \u2013 all promising to help you feel better, but also to get you stoned. Whether or not marijuana helps seniors to alleviate their conditions, many may enjoy a sense of control over their own wellbeing. Meanwhile, dispensaries in California and elsewhere cater to older clientele with discounts and shuttle busses. Dispensary owners like to brag about how many older women come in as evidence that they\u2019re created an attractive and welcoming store. It hasn\u2019t escaped the pharmaceutical industry that marijuana could soon be seen as a viable replacement for many of its products. Perhaps someday soon it will be normal for seniors to pass their last decades in a cannabis-induced haze. Got a question about cannabis?

      "body": "<p>Rocket. What a wonderful name for a leaf. Wild rocket is even better, suggesting an untamed missile of heat and flavour. It was a bit disappointing, then, to find out the name has nothing to do with space travel or fireworks, but comes from the French <em>roquette</em>, diminutive of the Latin <em>eruca</em>, which \u2013 according to my dictionary \u2013 was originally an early variety of cabbage. Like cabbage (and broccoli, sprouts, kale, radish, turnips, mizuna, horseradish and watercress), rocket is part of the brassica, crucifer or mustards family, all with their different degrees of heat and pepperiness. Rocket is the higher end of the scale, the rascal of the salad bowl.</p> <p>I found my first leaf of rocket in a salad in Pizza Express on Coptic Street in central London when I was about 13. As if the place, with its white tiles, tiered topping station, Italian waiters and dough balls wasn\u2019t exciting enough, there were hot leaves under the special house dressing. A few years later, when Pizza Express expanded to the home counties like middle-age spread, my brother would work there and we\u2019d learn the secret of the house dressing, which I am sure had changed by then, so it was doubly disappointing. Back to the leaf at 13, though, which wasn\u2019t disappointing. It was saw-edged, peppery and as Italian as the waiter.</p> <p><em>Eruca </em><em>sativa</em> has grown in the Mediterranean since Roman times, when it was considered an aphrodisiac. Nowadays, Italians have at least six names for this much-loved peppery leaf \u2013 <em>ruga</em>, <em>arugula</em>, <em>rucola</em>, <em>ricola</em>, <em>ruchetta</em>, <em>rughetta</em>. In Rome, it is generally <em>rughetta</em> and either <em>domestica</em> (cultivated) or <em>selvatica</em> (wild) \u2013 which, contrary to expectation, is often milder tasting.</p> <p>As much as I like it, I don\u2019t want rocket everywhere. Some sandwiches and salads are better off without. Rocket works well in a mix of leafy but mild-mannered and bitter leaves. It is even better tangled round small, sweet tomatoes or with parmesan \u2013 as my partner says, \u201cthe dreaded shavings\u201d \u2013 and especially with seared strips of beef, which make the rocket wilt. In Puglia, rocket is mixed with tomato sauce at the end of cooking to eat with pasta. I also enjoy it cooked \u2013 as so many green vegetables are in Puglia \u2013 with olive oil, garlic and chilli, also for pasta.</p> <p>Then there is soup. This is a meeting of two of my favourites: leek and potato, and watercress, with rocket standing in as the leafy green. It\u2019s a standard recipe to start. Then, my bit: some rocket pesto to add to the soup in the last minutes of cooking. This isn\u2019t blobbing a neat garnish on top; it is stirring a good amount of rocket puree into soup, which makes it speckled and insistently, brilliantly green. It also means two layers of rocket: some cooked along with the leek and starchy potato; the rest a bright, peppery, almost raw, rocket chaser at the end.</p> <h2>Rocket, leek and potato soup</h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>40 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 bunches of rocket</strong> (about 100g)<br><strong>8 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>1 onion</strong>, diced<br><strong>1 large leek</strong>, sliced<br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>2 potatoes</strong> (about 500g), diced<br><strong>1 bay leaf</strong><br><strong>1.2 litres water or vegetable stock</strong><br></p> <p>Pick over the rocket and trim away any tough stems, then divide in two.</p> <p>In a large, heavy-based pan, gently fry the onion, leek and a pinch of salt in four tablespoons of olive oil until soft and translucent.

In a sign that the worldwide slowdown is gathering pace, official figures showed Chinese exports were down 4.4% in December \u2013 the largest fall since 2016 \u2013 on the back of faltering demand in most of its key markets. Imports fell 7.6% to reflect waning domestic demand. The unexpected downturn for the biggest global exporter of manufactured products came as eurozone industrial output shrank in November. The EU statistics office, Eurostat, estimated industrial production slipped 1.7% in November compared with the previous month, and 3.3% on the year, reflecting the struggles facing several European economies in recent months. The latest snapshot confirmed disappointing readings of industrial output in several major eurozone nations, raising the prospect of some of the EU\u2019s biggest economies, including Germany and Italy, slipping into recession in the second half of 2018. Several major European economies, including the UK, have struggled with faltering levels of car production in recent months as factories adjust to handling new vehicle emissions tests introduced after the VW scandal. Demand for diesel vehicles has dwindled, while car sales in China last year fell for the first time since 1992, compounding the woes of European manufacturers that had previously benefited from the growth of the world\u2019s biggest vehicle market. However, economists said some of the factors behind the decline were likely to have been temporary, such as work stoppages due to the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests in France. Vanda Szendrei, an economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said manufacturing orders were improving in Germany and unemployment was at a decade-long low, supporting a view that \u201cindustrial activity will improve\u201d in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Financial markets around the world sold off sharply on Monday, with the FTSE 100 shedding 63 points \u2013 a fall of 0.9% \u2013 and losses on bourses across Europe. The Dow Jones had shed more than 70 points, a fall of 0.3%, by early afternoon trading in New York. Fears have been mounting over the health of the world economy for several months, as the US-China trade dispute serves as a handbrake on global trade. Although there are early signs of a breakthrough in talks between Washington and Beijing, global economic growth has taken a knock. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned most of the world\u2019s biggest economies are showing signs of easing growth momentum, with the biggest declines in France and Britain. The British economy has edged closer to stalling point in recent months as the risks connected to Brexit begin to materialise. UK growth has, however, outpaced many of the largest EU economies. The OECD said its composite leading indicators \u2013 gauges of economic activity that anticipate turning points for between six and nine months ahead \u2013 also showed easing growth momentum in the US, Germany, Canada, Italy and the euro area as a whole. Despite the disappointing data from China, the OECD said the country\u2019s industrial sector was still showing signs of \u201cstable growth momentum\u201d. Although factory output declined in December, total Chinese trade last year increased by 12.6% compared with 2017, to stand at $4.6tn (\u00a33.6tn). Exports rose 9.9%, while imports increased 15.8%.

Solskj\u00e6r exploited that, setting Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial to peel wide and attack those areas, which meant Jesse Lingard in effect ended up as a false nine between them. Few teams go to Wembley and take on Tottenham with two up front, the result of which was the two centre-backs, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, repeatedly finding themselves two-on-two, a situation in which few modern defenders are comfortable.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s acuity should not be a surprise. After all, he made a career of sitting on the bench working out where he should best target his runs \u2013 all he\u2019s doing now is advising others rather than his own legs where to make them. Sir Alex Ferguson always said, for that reason, that he expected Solskj\u00e6r to be a successful manager.</p> \n<p>But this was also a Fergusonian strategy, in its boldness \u2013 risking losing the midfield battle \u2013 and in the fact that the Scot always encouraged forwards to attack from out to in, something that reached its peak in 2007-08 when Cristiano Ronaldo was the central figure dropping deep, with Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney exploiting the space he created from the flanks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45314e55759d3befd4cbe7fe72f0b5e37911db5d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45314e55759d3befd4cbe7fe72f0b5e37911db5d/0_160_3901_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Rashford fires Manchester United ahead against Spurs.

But in that strike, driven low across Hugo Lloris into the bottom corner, and his goal at Newcastle, there is the sense of Rashford feeling a weight of critical inspection lifted from his shoulders, and blossoming as a forward.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\" data-alt=\"social media\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\">social media</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Early in the second half at Wembley came Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s response. Tottenham abandoned the diamond and switched to a 4-2-3-1. Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen moved wide, Spurs\u2019 full-backs dropped deeper. The space into which Rashford and Martial had romped was gone. It became about hanging on. Solskj\u00e6r couldn\u2019t check the shift in momentum. Only the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/manchester-united-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-david-de-gea-tottenham\" title=\"\">excellence of David de Gea</a> prevented Spurs not just levelling but winning.</p> \n<p>Pochettino called the second half the best 45 minutes Tottenham had produced under him \u2013 which may have been designed as a reminder to those who matter that he had not been tactically outwitted. But it was also possibly true. In terms of the battle of wits in the dugouts, then, a draw.</p> \n<p>But the gap from Spurs to the leaders, Liverpool, is now nine points. Six games have been lost this season.

Winks, perhaps not surprisingly, was the only other Tottenham player substituted, withdrawn after 81 minutes.

      "bodyText": "He could smile, be gracious, look pleased to be there and deliver the letter U in a pleasing Scandi-Manc. He could make some of the best footballers in the world seem happy to be paid million of pounds a year to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world \u2013 a feat of psychological alchemy quite beyond his predecessor. But could Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r do it on a chilly Sunday evening in January, against one of the Premier League\u2019s sharper tactical minds? It turns out, just about, that he could. When Tottenham play as they started on Sunday, with a midfield diamond, there is a vulnerability wide, behind the full-backs. Solskj\u00e6r exploited that, setting Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial to peel wide and attack those areas, which meant Jesse Lingard in effect ended up as a false nine between them. Few teams go to Wembley and take on Tottenham with two up front, the result of which was the two centre-backs, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, repeatedly finding themselves two-on-two, a situation in which few modern defenders are comfortable. Perhaps Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s acuity should not be a surprise. After all, he made a career of sitting on the bench working out where he should best target his runs \u2013 all he\u2019s doing now is advising others rather than his own legs where to make them. Sir Alex Ferguson always said, for that reason, that he expected Solskj\u00e6r to be a successful manager. But this was also a Fergusonian strategy, in its boldness \u2013 risking losing the midfield battle \u2013 and in the fact that the Scot always encouraged forwards to attack from out to in, something that reached its peak in 2007-08 when Cristiano Ronaldo was the central figure dropping deep, with Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney exploiting the space he created from the flanks. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s time at Cardiff perhaps deserves reassessment: he would not be the first manager to find his competence unfairly questioned after failing to overcome enormous differentials of resources and being relegated. Perhaps it\u2019s too easy to see evidence of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s work in Rashford\u2019s finish, to say there are signs he has brought technical improvement. But in that strike, driven low across Hugo Lloris into the bottom corner, and his goal at Newcastle, there is the sense of Rashford feeling a weight of critical inspection lifted from his shoulders, and blossoming as a forward. Early in the second half at Wembley came Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s response. Tottenham abandoned the diamond and switched to a 4-2-3-1. Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen moved wide, Spurs\u2019 full-backs dropped deeper. The space into which Rashford and Martial had romped was gone. It became about hanging on. Solskj\u00e6r couldn\u2019t check the shift in momentum. Only the excellence of David de Gea prevented Spurs not just levelling but winning. Pochettino called the second half the best 45 minutes Tottenham had produced under him \u2013 which may have been designed as a reminder to those who matter that he had not been tactically outwitted. But it was also possibly true. In terms of the battle of wits in the dugouts, then, a draw. But the gap from Spurs to the leaders, Liverpool, is now nine points. Six games have been lost this season. Defeat at home to United follows home reverses against Liverpool and Manchester City. They are not title challengers and probably never were. The squad is beginning to look a little threadbare: Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko looked weary in Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final but here they were again, asked to drag themselves through another game until the Frenchman suffered a muscular problem just before half-time. Winks, perhaps not surprisingly, was the only other Tottenham player substituted, withdrawn after 81 minutes. With Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama injured and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 seemingly on his way to Beijing Guoan, there are few options. Attacking reserves may soon be an issue as well, depending how serious Harry Kane\u2019s ankle injury is, particularly with Son joining up with South Korea at the Asian Cup. Perhaps this is an unusual set of circumstances. Most clubs, after all, would struggle with five first-teamers out. But it does yet again highlight the lack of transfer spending in the summer and raise the question of just what, realistically, is achievable at Spurs. The mood, though, seems subtly to have shifted and while it would be misleading to say there is any certainty Pochettino will stay at Tottenham in the summer, that does now seem the slight probability. That means United will have to assess their options and at least consider options beyond Pochettino. And as each week goes by, the man in possession of the job is looking a stronger and stronger candidate. There are still questions, of course \u2013 can Solskj\u00e6r devise a way of controlling a game against a top side? Does he have a mode other than firefight?

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: US president\u2019s warning over Turkish threat to Kurds Donald Trump has said the US will \u201cdevastate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Ankara decides to attack Kurdish forces following the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. In a tweet, the president also urged the Kurds not to \u201cprovoke\u201d Turkey. A spokesman for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, replied that it was a \u201cfatal mistake\u201d for Trump to confuse Syrian Kurds \u2013 who have allied with the US during the Syrian conflict \u2013 with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), a longstanding enemy of the Turkish state. Isis endures? Trump said the Syria pullout was \u201clong overdue\u201d but promised to hit any remaining Isis strongholds \u201chard, and from many directions\u201d. Iran strikes. The White House asked the Pentagon to draw up options for military strikes against Iran last year after militia attacks close to US facilities in Iraq, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Christian nationalists push new legislation in states Rightwing religious hardliners have introduced new bills in at least six US states to \u201cprotect religious freedom\u201d as part of a Christian nationalist political strategy known as Project Blitz. So-called \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d bills have been introduced in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and South Carolina in the early days of 2019, demanding the phrase be emblazoned in various public spaces. In Missouri, Florida and North Dakota there are new bills that would require public high schools to offer Bible-study classes. Counter-offensive. Texas and Georgia lawmakers will also shortly consider new religious bills, but civil rights activists are preparing to launch a counter-offensive to Project Blitz on 16 January, which is Religious Freedom Day. Is Kamala Harris preparing to run for president? Kamala Harris, the junior Democratic senator from California, certainly looks and sounds like a 2020 presidential candidate. She recently published a political memoir. And, appearing at a sold-out theatre in Los Angeles as part of her national book tour on Sunday, she said that, were she elected president, she would fight back against the \u201cpowerful voices that are trying to sow hate and division\u201d. Unlike fellow senator Elizabeth Warren, however, Harris is yet to throw her hat into the ring for the Democratic nomination. Young contenders. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran and the US representative from Hawaii, both announced this weekend that they would seek the Democratic presidential nomination. American dreamer? The former US congressman from Maryland John Delaney announced he would run back in 2017. He spoke to David Smith. Trump and Republicans blamed for continuing shutdown Trump has reportedly told aides he believes the battle over funding for his border wall is a political win for him. The American public disagrees, according to a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, which found that 53% of respondents blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the partial government shutdown, now in its 24th day. Just 29% blamed Democrats, while 13% blamed a combination of the two. However, overall support for a border wall has increased from 34% to 42% since January 2018. Out of dough. Canadian air traffic controllers have bought hundreds of pizzas for their US counterparts in recent days to support the 10,000 or so American controllers going unpaid amid the shutdown. Crib sheet Trump has said it is \u201cinsulting\u201d to be asked if he ever worked on behalf of the Kremlin \u2013 while failing to give a yes or no answer to the question \u2013 following bombshell reports on his relationship with Russia in the New York Times and Washington Post. Five people died in the Midwest, almost 200,000 were left without power in Virginia and Carolina, and more than 250 flights were cancelled at Washington DC airports as a snowstorm struck the mid-Atlantic region over the weekend. The EU is preparing to postpone the March deadline for Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc until at least July, as prime minister Theresa May awaits a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday, which she is expected to lose by a wide margin. James Watson, the Nobel prize-winning scientist who helped discover DNA, has been stripped of all titles and honours by the New York laboratory he once led, over his \u201creprehensible\u201d comments claiming a link between race and intelligence. Listen to Today in Focus: China\u2019s Muslim detention camps China faces international condemnation for its mass detention of up to a million Muslims in camps in the country\u2019s Xinjiang province. But authorities are nonetheless expanding the camps and increasing surveillance on ethnic minorities, as Lily Kuo reports. Must-reads Trump\u2019s alleged assaults turned into \u2018Pussy Grabber Plays\u2019 The journalist Natasha Stoynoff was one of more than a dozen women to accuse Trump of sexual assault during the 2016 election campaign. Now she has helped to turn that experience into a stage play, which debuts in New York this week, she tells Lauren Gambino. The Sopranos at 20: how Tony and co transformed a genre It is two decades since Tony Soprano first appeared on HBO, reshaping the gangster genre and the entire TV landscape. But Charles Bramesco says the show\u2019s legacy includes plenty of bastard offspring that learned all the wrong lessons from The Sopranos. Should California be moving the homeless into sheds? The city of Oakland has cleared homeless communities off the street and rehoused them in basic, purpose-built cabins. Sam Levin asks whether this \u201cinnovative\u201d solution to a vast crisis is actually improving lives, or just pushing the problem further out of sight. Mutiny on the sex raft: a 70s social experiment gone wrong In 1973, a Mexican anthropologist decided to expand his research on the links between violence and sexuality in monkeys by sailing the Atlantic with 10 attractive young people. Their voyage is now the subject of a remarkable documentary, as Stuart Jeffries reports. Opinion A Silicon Valley-based university has been lauded for its \u201cradically new\u201d fee plan that allows graduates to pay back debts in increments determined by their salary. That\u2019s been the tuition fee model in England for decades, says Amelia Tait, so why do we keep praising the tech industry for \u201cinventing\u201d old ideas? Not only are these products nowhere near as revolutionary as they sound, these companies and their inventors often ignore the majority of people to improve lives for a privileged minority. Sport Underrated by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Marcus Rashford shone under Manchester United\u2019s new manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, as he put the club 1-0 up against Spurs on Sunday. That\u2019s one of 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action in the Premier League. Maroon 5, Big Boi and Travis Scott will provide the half-time entertainment at this year\u2019s Super Bowl, at which \u2013 following this weekend\u2019s playoffs \u2013 one of the New Orleans Saints or LA Rams will face either Kansas City or the Patriots.

The early legal moves have been tracked from Alaska to Florida as mostly Republican legislators make use of off-the-shelf \u2018model bills\u2019 generated by Christian nationalists in a playbook called Project Blitz. So-called \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d bills have already been introduced this year in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and South Carolina, which, if they became law, would see the phrase emblazoned on public buildings, hung in schools and displayed on public vehicles including police cars.

Georgia is expected to try to pass a \u2018religious freedom\u2019 act which would give cover to people who run businesses, or agencies which provide adoption or foster care services, if they refuse to serve LGBTQ people on religious grounds. And in South Carolina, Republican governor Henry McMaster is appealing to the Trump administration to allow Miracle Hill Ministries to keep its federal funding even though it refuses to allow non-Christians to use its foster-care service, a breach of Obama-era regulations. However, civil rights activists are preparing to use Religious Freedom Day on January 16 as a moment to mount an attack against Project Blitz. Frederick Clarkson, senior research analyst at Political Research Associates, a think-tank which studies the political right, was the first to draw attention to the Project Blitz playbook last year. He first revealed that the 140-page playbook had been shared by a group called the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (CPCF) set up by a former Republican congressman with the stated aim to \u201cprotect religious freedom, preserve America\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and promote prayer\u201d. Now civil rights, human rights and atheist groups are coming together to organise against the emboldened Christian hardliners. Clarkson said: \u201cIt has taken time, but organized opposition is mounting.\u201d A law passed in 1992 gives the president the duty to proclaim January 16 as Religious Freedom Day. It is supposed to be a moment to celebrate all faiths (or none) in the US, recognizing the freedoms first written by Thomas Jefferson, and enshrined in the Constitution and the First Amendment. But last year, Donald Trump, heavily influenced by Christian Evangelicals used his proclamation to advance a Christian nationalist message that religious freedom was under threat from courts and legislatures \u201cforcing people to comply with laws that violate their core religious beliefs\u201d. Trump claimed: \u201cno American \u2013 whether a nun, nurse, baker or business owner \u2013 should be forced to choose between the tenets of faith or adherence to the law.\u201d He was providing explicit support for those who would refuse to serve LGBTQ customers, deny reproductive rights to women, or block gay couples from adopting children or becoming foster parents. Americans United for Separation of Church and State is making opposition to Project Blitz a priority in 2019. It has been tracking bills and working with other activist groups to track new laws and organise opposition against them. Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United said: \u201cProject Blitz is one of the foremost organised efforts to infiltrate state legislatures with religion.\u201d By shining a light on the Project Blitz playbook, Americans United wants to clearly \u201challmark\u201d In God We Trust bills as the creation of the CPCF. Laser said the aim was \u201cto demonstrate to state legislatures that they are very much part of a Christian nationalism plan to codify a far right Evangelical Christian America and allow religious liberty to be used as a sword to harm others, instead of as a shield to protect people.\u201d Opponents have tracked at least 75 bills brought forward in more than 20 states since Trump became president which stem from the Project Blitz playbook. Clarkson\u2019s work last year revealed one of the steering team behind Project Blitz as David Barton, the Texas-based founder of an organisation called WallBuilders, which takes its inspiration from the Old Testament in describing a mission of \u201crebuilding our nation\u2019s foundations\u201d. In a recording of a call with state legislators, he described in detail the strategy behind Project Blitz, which he said packages together about two dozen bills in separate categories based on the type of opposition they are likely to receive. The first category of \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d bills are likely to trigger opposition by saying the bills are a waste of time, or the sponsor of the bill \u201cjust wants to fight culture wars and divide people\u201d. Category two include bills for a range of proclamations or resolutions \u2013 declaring a religious freedom day or Christian heritage week that can then be used to get religious teaching into schools. Category three bills will have the greatest impact but will be \u201cthe most hotly contested\u201d the playbook says \u2013 they include resolutions in favour of \u201cbiblical values concerning marriage and sexuality\u201d, such as \u201cestablishing public policy favoring adoption by intact heterosexual, marriage-based families\u201d and \u201cestablishing public policy favoring intimate sexual relations only between married, heterosexual couples\u201d. Laser said: \u201cWhen a lot of state legislators see \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 they think that is harmless patriotism, but it is part of an intentional plan to build momentum for establishing a Christian America.\u201dLaser said there are real concerns about a momentum behind Christian nationalism, which she said Trump has bolstered with the appointment of pro-life Supreme Court judges Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The only religious advisory board Trump has is an all Evangelical Christian advisory board. Last year the administration announced a religious liberty task force at a religious liberty summit event attended entirely by social conservatives.

      "body": "<p>On a dank day in January, a small slice of Walsall is blooming. Marie and Tony Newton\u2019s back garden is filled with summery colour: miniature mauve cyclamens, frilly red camellias, graceful hellebores, seasonal snowdrops and the bright green sheaths of bulbs promising more flowers to come. A few winters back, their first daffodil bloomed on Boxing Day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically chaotic,\u201d says Tony of the new climatic normal. \u201cIt\u2019s non-stop flowers from now on. Winters are milder on average and there\u2019s every opportunity to have a riot of lovely flowers from December right through till spring.\u201d</p> <p>Deadly floods in Bangladesh, devastating wildfires in California, melting glaciers in Greenland, coral bleaching in the oceans \u2013 this is climate change in action. Highlighting far more benign changes in Britain, long blessed with a moderate climate, may appear trivial or downright insensitive. Our gentle extremes \u2013 the beast from the east, or summer 2018 being England\u2019s hottest ever \u2013 are far from drastic. But they still pose challenges, and there is more change coming.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s 27 million gardeners could be the canaries in our coalmine. How are gardeners experiencing climate change in Britain and how is it transforming our gardens? And can adapting our gardening styles mitigate the negative impacts of climate change?</p> <p>Marie and Tony couldn\u2019t see their garden when they first viewed the house in 1982 because it was covered by a snowdrift. In the years since, as their south-facing quarter-acre evolved from a children\u2019s play-space to a <a href=\"http://fourseasonsgarden.co.uk/www.fourseasonsgarden.co.uk/Home.html\" title=\"\">\u201cfour-seasons garden\u201d</a> with an all-year-round rainbow of flowers, shrubs and trees, they have witnessed the Midlands climate become steadily milder. Autumn frosts are much later, if they strike at all, and September is a summer month now. Their begonias continue until October. \u201cThat would never have happened in the past; we\u2019d barely get through September without air frosts,\u201d says Tony. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s warming up, you\u2019ve got to plan for the extremes. We\u2019re still going to get very severe winters and it will wipe out many gardeners\u2019 new species.\u201d</p> <p>They know about this only too well. Their garden features a jungle area of bamboo, palm trees, a banana tree and the stumps of several Tasmanian tree ferns. These ferns survived the winter of 2009, the coldest for 30 years, but a run of -15C nights and sub-zero days the following December killed them off. \u201cIt\u2019s a mortgage to replace them,\u201d grimaces Marie. Climate change is encouraging many gardeners to buy exotic plants but \u201cwe still need truly hardy varieties,\u201d says Tony. Their banana is wrapped in black cloth over winter. He ensures that whenever they add a shrub to the 3,000 in their garden it can survive at -15C. </p> <p>Marie and Tony\u2019s garden fared better during last summer\u2019s drought. Their clay soils retain moisture, which helps, but they didn\u2019t lose a single plant to the weather, despite being on holiday for two weeks. This may be because they are obsessive mulchers. Mulch is material added to the surface of the soil to increase organic matter and repress weeds. The Newtons have added 108 cubic metres of tree bark to their soil over the years; each year they also compost all their garden leaves and cuttings, reapplying this to their soil.

But the community group that organises Truro\u2019s displays took his advice. In what the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) described as the \u201ctoughest year for community gardening in 54 years\u201d, Truro\u2019s blend of exotic, drought-tolerant plants, including palms and Mediterranean herbs, serviced by a solar-powered rainwater-harvesting system, thrived.

He began gardening as a boy in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely milder and wetter,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difficult thing we have with the climate is the more changeable weather. Last winter was probably one of the wettest on record here and then we went into one of the driest summers. The capricious nature of the weather is very hard to anticipate and work with.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t think of mild winters as extreme weather events, but <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/december2015_temperature\" title=\"\">December 2015 was the most anomalous month ever recorded</a>, 5.1C above average, and the warmest in the Met Office\u2019s central England temperature dataset, which stretches back to 1659. Shoesmith notices how pollinating insects, such as solitary bees, often emerge during these mild midwinters. If there are no flowers, and no nectar, they will perish. \u201cClimate change is a big issue and as gardeners we can all do our bit to help by planting the garden so it\u2019s flowering throughout the year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all want that anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Wildlife-friendly gardening focuses on native flowers, but Shoesmith argues we have long had non-native plants \u2013 particularly in milder Cornwall \u2013 and many exotic species are just as attractive to pollinators. In general, Britain\u2019s 400,000 garden plant species provide genetic diversity, enabling more selection and breeding to adapt to future extremes. But Shoesmith also has a motto \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t go silly buying too much frilly\u201d \u2013 because certain varieties of exotic flowers with lots of petals lose their nectar-holding sexual organs and so become useless for pollinators. Daisies, aconites, crocus, hellebores are good for winter-waking bees.</p> <p>Allotment holders are also adapting to the increasingly capricious climate. <a href=\"https://www.incrediblevegetables.co.uk/\">Mandy Barber</a> has turned to growing perennial produce on her plot in Ashburton, Devon. \u201cAnnual vegetables needed a lot more watering and it was touch and go whether they would make it last summer, but perennial vegetables have a lot more resilience to temperature changes,\u201d she says. Barber is experimenting with crops including Taunton Deane kale; poireau perp\u00e9tuel, a perennial leek; and <em><a href=\"https://www.incrediblevegetables.co.uk/hablitzia-tamnoides-how-to-grow/\" title=\"\">Hablitzia tamnoides</a></em>, or Caucasian spinach, which is grown in Scandinavia and can survive -25C. \u201cThe <em>Hablitzia tamnoides</em> plants go on for decades, they are like a rampant triffid, but you get a crop between February and June every year and the leaves are a bit like baby spinach,\u201d says Barber.

Allan Trigg has been growing vegetables for more than 40 years and has an allotment in Chelmsford, Essex. \u201cThis is my little patch of England,\u201d he smiles. Fewer frosts means his fellow allotment holders plant out runner beans, sweetcorn and potatoes earlier. With an extended growing season, Trigg can grow more, and second crops, although last year he grew less because he was spending so much time watering his vegetables. The dry weather produced lower yields of crops such as potatoes. After 2017, his potatoes lasted him and his wife through to February; this winter, they were eaten by November. And allium leaf miner and leek moth are a growing problem. \u201cI used to grow loads of leeks but now I don\u2019t bother,\u201d he says. He pulls one up to show the damage below ground. \u201cWe never used to have this trouble years ago.\u201d</p> <p>In Walsall the Newtons are accepting of their growing losses to pests such as the lily beetle and the lace bug. \u201cIt went absolutely berserk after the hot summer,\u201d says Tony. \u201cI thought it was going to kill all the plants in the garden.\u201d Barber is beset by voles (which survive the milder winters), while in Cornwall, Shoesmith has noticed the spread of <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=512\" title=\"\">fuchsia gall mite</a> along the hedges. \u201cIt had the opportunity to come to Britain for decades, but only arrived this century because of the milder winters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same amount of frosts now and so we get many more fungal problems.\u201d</p> <p>These observations precisely match the more scientific language of <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/science/gardening-in-a-changing-world/climate-change\" title=\"\">Gardening in a Changing Climate</a>, a 2017 RHS report that outlines the challenges \u2013 milder winters, more unpredictable extremes and more pests \u2013 posed by climate change. But the RHS also asks how gardeners might help save the planet. The way we garden is still sometimes part of the problem \u2013 using precious water in pursuit of a perfect lawn during a drought springs to mind \u2013 but it can be part of the solution. Gardeners can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mitigate pollution and flooding, and help increase their neighbourhood\u2019s resilience.</p> <p>\u201cWater use in gardens is going to be a major issue in the future,\u201d says Alistair Griffith, director of science at the RHS. <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_environment_strategy.pdf\" title=\"\">London is forecast to require 100m litres a day more than it can supply in 2020</a>, with this deficit rising to 400m litres a day by 2040. The use of energy-intensive mains water on gardens is still socially acceptable and Britain lags behind more water-stressed countries where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/21/greywater-systems-can-they-really-reduce-your-bills\" title=\"\">grey-water recycling</a> is commonplace. But hosepipe bans could become perpetual for some regions in coming decades.</p> <p>Apart from using only rainwater \u2013 even a small balcony can catch and store rainwater with a mini-reservoir \u2013 Griffith recommends gardeners provide \u201cas much greenery as possible\u201d. He suggests planting hedges instead of fencing and planting trees. Trees not only dispel pollution but can alleviate flash flooding and provide shade for a home during heatwaves. Perhaps the most overlooked way gardening can benefit the climate is via the soil: adding organic matter (mulch from home-composting, not peat) can create a soil that stores more carbon and retains more water, also making gardens more resilient in flood and droughts.</p> <p>Griffith\u2019s final practical suggestion for climate-friendly gardening is to make everything permeable. Unfortunately, paving gardens for parking continues (in 2015, the RHS found that the number of paved, plant-free front gardens had tripled in 10 years from 1.5m to 4.6m). Even car park gardens can be permeable and planted with trees and shrubs around the edge. But, according to Griffith, people resist, citing a lack of time and a nervousness about failing at gardening. \u201cGardening is always trial and error,\u201d he says. \u201cGive it a go.\u201d</p> <p>Gardening won\u2019t stop climate change, but it could make our local communities more resilient when faced with extreme floods, heat \u2013 and mild weather. In troubled times, it is also a fundamentally optimistic gesture.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a dank day in January, a small slice of Walsall is blooming. Marie and Tony Newton\u2019s back garden is filled with summery colour: miniature mauve cyclamens, frilly red camellias, graceful hellebores, seasonal snowdrops and the bright green sheaths of bulbs promising more flowers to come. A few winters back, their first daffodil bloomed on Boxing Day. \u201cIt\u2019s basically chaotic,\u201d says Tony of the new climatic normal. \u201cIt\u2019s non-stop flowers from now on. Winters are milder on average and there\u2019s every opportunity to have a riot of lovely flowers from December right through till spring.\u201d Deadly floods in Bangladesh, devastating wildfires in California, melting glaciers in Greenland, coral bleaching in the oceans \u2013 this is climate change in action. Highlighting far more benign changes in Britain, long blessed with a moderate climate, may appear trivial or downright insensitive. Our gentle extremes \u2013 the beast from the east, or summer 2018 being England\u2019s hottest ever \u2013 are far from drastic. But they still pose challenges, and there is more change coming. Britain\u2019s 27 million gardeners could be the canaries in our coalmine. How are gardeners experiencing climate change in Britain and how is it transforming our gardens? And can adapting our gardening styles mitigate the negative impacts of climate change? Marie and Tony couldn\u2019t see their garden when they first viewed the house in 1982 because it was covered by a snowdrift. In the years since, as their south-facing quarter-acre evolved from a children\u2019s play-space to a \u201cfour-seasons garden\u201d with an all-year-round rainbow of flowers, shrubs and trees, they have witnessed the Midlands climate become steadily milder. Autumn frosts are much later, if they strike at all, and September is a summer month now. Their begonias continue until October. \u201cThat would never have happened in the past; we\u2019d barely get through September without air frosts,\u201d says Tony. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s warming up, you\u2019ve got to plan for the extremes. We\u2019re still going to get very severe winters and it will wipe out many gardeners\u2019 new species.\u201d They know about this only too well. Their garden features a jungle area of bamboo, palm trees, a banana tree and the stumps of several Tasmanian tree ferns. These ferns survived the winter of 2009, the coldest for 30 years, but a run of -15C nights and sub-zero days the following December killed them off. \u201cIt\u2019s a mortgage to replace them,\u201d grimaces Marie. Climate change is encouraging many gardeners to buy exotic plants but \u201cwe still need truly hardy varieties,\u201d says Tony. Their banana is wrapped in black cloth over winter. He ensures that whenever they add a shrub to the 3,000 in their garden it can survive at -15C. Marie and Tony\u2019s garden fared better during last summer\u2019s drought. Their clay soils retain moisture, which helps, but they didn\u2019t lose a single plant to the weather, despite being on holiday for two weeks. This may be because they are obsessive mulchers. Mulch is material added to the surface of the soil to increase organic matter and repress weeds. The Newtons have added 108 cubic metres of tree bark to their soil over the years; each year they also compost all their garden leaves and cuttings, reapplying this to their soil. This organic matter has steadily improved soil quality and, crucially, helps it retain moisture. When Liam Shoesmith, deputy parks manager of Truro city council, saw how dry 2018 summer\u2019s long-term forecast looked, he suggested the city\u2019s gardeners should plant succulents and cacti for their Britain in Bloom competition entry. \u201cIt was a bit of a joke really,\u201d he says.

This might mean another referendum, which is just a can-kicking exercise, or renegotiation on a single market or customs union terms. It would almost certainly mean postponing EU departure. Tuesday\u2019s opportunity to move forward would be lost.</p> <p>The parliamentary coup is a desperate stagger through a quagmire. It further excuses MPs from confronting reality and sustains their mendacity. The leavers want a hard Brexit, on the pretence that the referendum was a vote for tariffs, hard borders and passport controls. All poll evidence says it was not. Remainers cling to the pretence that the referendum was not sensible and, by some device, can be reversed. It cannot.</p> <p>The polarising tendency of modern politics, the aversion to responsibility, compromise and common sense has never been so glaring. MPs should vote for the deal and do what they were elected to do, which is govern the country. If not, they will present the country with a profession in disarray.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Parliament is about to lie to those who elected it two years ago. It is about to pretend that there is a better way of leaving the EU than is outlined in Theresa May\u2019s deal. It knows there is not. If it votes down May\u2019s deal, it will lie. The deal is not a settlement but a transition. It is a way of moving forward, of leaving the EU pending negotiation of a long-term trading relationship. It is not a compromise but in reality a defeat for the \u201chaving our cake and eating it\u201d school of Brexit fantasists. But it is the only deal on offer. All else is a Westminster miasma of personal ambition, party advantage and endemic hysteria. MPs are charged with governing the country well. Never in my experience have they shown less interest in that cause. Last week a still small voice spoke through the gloom. It was of a backbench MP, George Freeman, speaking of his evident despair over Brexit, but of the obligation on an MP to \u201ccross the party divide and embrace the lost art of compromise\u201d. The responsible next step was to leave as pledged by parliament in March, and move on to negotiate a future outside the EU. To vote against the deal was merely to shut one\u2019s eyes and hope someone else gets the blame for the chaos. Fresh hope has been given to the stallers with a \u201ccoup\u201d plan from three moderate Tories, Nicky Morgan, Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles. Assuming May\u2019s plan fails on Tuesday \u2013 and they will be voting against her deal \u2013 they want a three-week delay, another vote and then the chairs of parliament\u2019s committees to decide what to do next. This might mean another referendum, which is just a can-kicking exercise, or renegotiation on a single market or customs union terms. It would almost certainly mean postponing EU departure. Tuesday\u2019s opportunity to move forward would be lost. The parliamentary coup is a desperate stagger through a quagmire. It further excuses MPs from confronting reality and sustains their mendacity. The leavers want a hard Brexit, on the pretence that the referendum was a vote for tariffs, hard borders and passport controls. All poll evidence says it was not. Remainers cling to the pretence that the referendum was not sensible and, by some device, can be reversed. It cannot. The polarising tendency of modern politics, the aversion to responsibility, compromise and common sense has never been so glaring. MPs should vote for the deal and do what they were elected to do, which is govern the country. If not, they will present the country with a profession in disarray. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Nothing dates faster than humour. The Russian writer Teffi (born Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya in 1872, the sixth child of a lawyer) had the misfortune not only to be an astringently witty and fiercely professional female author \u2013 an unusual breed in 19th-century Russia \u2013 but almost untranslatably so.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Duncan, why go barefoot when tights have been invented?\u201d (You\u2019re smiling? Neither am I.)</p> <p>After her death in Paris in 1952 \u2013 keenly awaited by Teffi herself, who compared God to a dentist who had mixed up the order of his patients\u2019 appointments \u2013 her status as an international celebrity was forgotten until, in 2014, a group of skilful, determined and humour-alert translators took up Teffi\u2019s cause, assisted by Pushkin Press.</p> <p> What followed was <em><a href=\"https://www.pushkinpress.com/product/subtly-worded-and-other-stories/\" title=\"\">Subtly Worded</a></em>, an exquisitely published collection of sharp-eyed vignettes culled from Teffi\u2019s enormous output that earned their author comparisons to Chekhov. In 2016, <em>Memories: From Moscow to the Black Sea</em>, an audaciously jaunty series of articles recalling Teffi\u2019s hazard-strewn journey towards Europe in 1918, became a Radio 4 book of the week. Commanding awe for her irreverent ability to laugh in the face of tragedy, Teffi was back.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Haber brings into view a formidable woman who worked as hard as an entire army of scribes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What was dimly apparent to any careful reader or listener was the protective wall behind which a brilliant and painfully self-aware writer had buried every trace of her personal existence. In 2019, Teffi\u2019s Wikipedia entry still hesitates over her precise date of birth. Her innumerable lovers go unmentioned. Her second husband is nowhere in evidence.</p> <p>Edythe Haber has been engaged with Teffi\u2019s life and work for 40 years. Her biography is a masterpiece of sober and diligent scholarship that flatly refuses to disguise Teffi\u2019s failings. Instead of cooing over Teffi\u2019s jokes, Haber brings into view a formidable woman who worked as hard as an entire army of scribes and who bewitched her lovers as effortlessly as she abandoned them. Chekhov might have to give way to Colette or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/13/biography.features\" title=\"\">Madame de St\u00e4el</a> when we next start seeking comparisons for a writer who charmed Tsar Nicholas II, rebuffed an amorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/06/rasputin-douglas-smith-review-myth-murder-russia-mad-monk-biography-romanovs\" title=\"\">Rasputin</a> and was praised by Lenin (an \u201cobsessed maniac\u201d in Teffi\u2019s disgusted view).</p> <p>Haber\u2019s meticulous research raises as many questions as it answers. A personal request to Tolstoy that Prince Andrei in <em>War and Peace</em> should be kept alive (Teffi was just 13) surely connects to the loss of her own father, just one year earlier. Defending her brusque abandonment of a husband and three children in 1898, after six years of marriage, Teffi pleaded that she had no choice: \u201cIn essence I was good\u2026 circumstances drove me from home.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it more likely that domesticity stifled her hunger to create?</p> <p>Moving back to St Petersburg, Teffi rapidly found her metier in comedy. (\u201cLaugh! It brings us money,\u201d ordered her publishers.) Laughter was at a premium in those febrile times. On stage, Teffi\u2019s wittily topical skits (<em>The Woman Question</em>; <em>Love Through </em><em>the Ages</em>) made her a star. By 1917, she was producing three bright columns a week for <em>Russkoe slovo</em>, Moscow\u2019s most popular newspaper, while bringing a welcome spirit of apolitical playfulness to the country\u2019s leading comic magazine, <em>Satirikon</em>. Arkady Averchenko was billed as <em>Satirikon</em>\u2019s comic star, but it was the dashingly irreverent Teffi whose work most delighted readers. Her name became ubiquitous. Admirers dabbed their wrists with Teffi perfume and nibbled on Teffi chocolates.</p> <p>Habitually savvy \u2013 as Haber\u2019s photographic archive shows \u2013 about her public image, Teffi was equally skilful in concealing a ribald private life. The discovery of her second marriage has come to light only recently, buried within the dying request in 1919 of a dashing White Russian officer, Dmitry Shcherbakov, that his wife \u201c\u00e9crivain connu Teffy\u201d (sic) should be informed of his demise.

      "bodyText": "Nothing dates faster than humour. The Russian writer Teffi (born Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya in 1872, the sixth child of a lawyer) had the misfortune not only to be an astringently witty and fiercely professional female author \u2013 an unusual breed in 19th-century Russia \u2013 but almost untranslatably so. \u201cMiss Duncan, why go barefoot when tights have been invented?\u201d (You\u2019re smiling? Neither am I.) After her death in Paris in 1952 \u2013 keenly awaited by Teffi herself, who compared God to a dentist who had mixed up the order of his patients\u2019 appointments \u2013 her status as an international celebrity was forgotten until, in 2014, a group of skilful, determined and humour-alert translators took up Teffi\u2019s cause, assisted by Pushkin Press. What followed was Subtly Worded, an exquisitely published collection of sharp-eyed vignettes culled from Teffi\u2019s enormous output that earned their author comparisons to Chekhov. In 2016, Memories: From Moscow to the Black Sea, an audaciously jaunty series of articles recalling Teffi\u2019s hazard-strewn journey towards Europe in 1918, became a Radio 4 book of the week. Commanding awe for her irreverent ability to laugh in the face of tragedy, Teffi was back. What was dimly apparent to any careful reader or listener was the protective wall behind which a brilliant and painfully self-aware writer had buried every trace of her personal existence. In 2019, Teffi\u2019s Wikipedia entry still hesitates over her precise date of birth. Her innumerable lovers go unmentioned. Her second husband is nowhere in evidence. Edythe Haber has been engaged with Teffi\u2019s life and work for 40 years. Her biography is a masterpiece of sober and diligent scholarship that flatly refuses to disguise Teffi\u2019s failings. Instead of cooing over Teffi\u2019s jokes, Haber brings into view a formidable woman who worked as hard as an entire army of scribes and who bewitched her lovers as effortlessly as she abandoned them. Chekhov might have to give way to Colette or Madame de St\u00e4el when we next start seeking comparisons for a writer who charmed Tsar Nicholas II, rebuffed an amorous Rasputin and was praised by Lenin (an \u201cobsessed maniac\u201d in Teffi\u2019s disgusted view). Haber\u2019s meticulous research raises as many questions as it answers. A personal request to Tolstoy that Prince Andrei in War and Peace should be kept alive (Teffi was just 13) surely connects to the loss of her own father, just one year earlier. Defending her brusque abandonment of a husband and three children in 1898, after six years of marriage, Teffi pleaded that she had no choice: \u201cIn essence I was good\u2026 circumstances drove me from home.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it more likely that domesticity stifled her hunger to create? Moving back to St Petersburg, Teffi rapidly found her metier in comedy. (\u201cLaugh! It brings us money,\u201d ordered her publishers.) Laughter was at a premium in those febrile times. On stage, Teffi\u2019s wittily topical skits (The Woman Question; Love Through the Ages) made her a star. By 1917, she was producing three bright columns a week for Russkoe slovo, Moscow\u2019s most popular newspaper, while bringing a welcome spirit of apolitical playfulness to the country\u2019s leading comic magazine, Satirikon. Arkady Averchenko was billed as Satirikon\u2019s comic star, but it was the dashingly irreverent Teffi whose work most delighted readers. Her name became ubiquitous. Admirers dabbed their wrists with Teffi perfume and nibbled on Teffi chocolates. Habitually savvy \u2013 as Haber\u2019s photographic archive shows \u2013 about her public image, Teffi was equally skilful in concealing a ribald private life. The discovery of her second marriage has come to light only recently, buried within the dying request in 1919 of a dashing White Russian officer, Dmitry Shcherbakov, that his wife \u201c\u00e9crivain connu Teffy\u201d (sic) should be informed of his demise. Haber also establishes that Shcherbakov was literate enough to review two of his wife\u2019s plays. That her spouse also happened to be gay was a likely plus, given Teffi\u2019s unquenchable relish for extramarital love affairs. Three decades of exile in Paris \u2013 where, typically, she opened the first \u00e9migr\u00e9 salon \u2013 brought Teffi a new and devoted audience. But estrangement from her homeland blunted the author\u2019s relish for satire. \u201cWe have died,\u201d she wrote of refugee life in her essay Nostalgia. \u201cWe feared a Bolshevik death \u2013 and have met our death here.\u201d The playfulness remained intact. Grateful for a daughter\u2019s thoughtful gift of cosy slippers in icy winter, an ageing Teffi quipped that her thawing toes were getting ready for a spot of Liszt. \u2022 Teffi: A Life of Letters and of Laughter by Edythe Haber is published by IB Tauris (\u00a320).

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, declined to say precisely when this would happen, but indicated it would be soon. \u201cThe call will be made tomorrow after that vote,\u201d he told Today.</p> \n<p>With May and her ministers refusing to outline what alternative plan might be put forward if her proposal was defeated, a series of backbench ideas have been unveiled to seize control of the process from government.</p> \n<p>Om Monday, a cross-party group of MPs from the Lib Dems, Labour, Conservatives and SNP were publishing two draft bills designed to pave the way for a new referendum. One of these would give voters the option of voting for the government\u2019s deal or staying in the EU.</p> \n<p>Separately, three senior Conservative backbenchers drafted a bill that would give the liaison committee, which groups together the MPs who chair various select committees, a key role in coming up with a new plan.</p> \n<p>Nick Boles, who has come up with the idea along with Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, said all three would vote for the PM\u2019s deal on Tuesday, but would act if it failed.</p> \n<p>Boles told Today their planned bill would give May a further three weeks to come up with a compromise deal and get it through parliament. If that failed the liaison committee would be given \u201cthe responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIf the house passed that compromise deal, then the government would be legally required to implement whatever it was that they had.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boles is among Tory backbenchers accused by some newspapers of trying to stage a \u201ccoup\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is unlikely to have her Brexit deal passed on Tuesday, a senior member of her cabinet has admitted, as EU officials warned that a letter of assurances on the Irish backstop due to be unveiled on Monday contains nothing new. In a statement to the Commons on Monday afternoon, the prime minister will try to win round MPs to her deal by publishing correspondence with the EU\u2019s most senior officials. The prime minister had promised she would secure additional \u201clegal and political assurances\u201d from Brussels when she delayed a vote on her deal and fought off a challenge to her leadership. In a joint letter, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, presidents of the European commission and European council, are understood to emphasise that the backstop is a fallback option that they do not intend to trigger. The customs union envisaged in the backstop, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, would only be a temporary solution, and the EU would do its utmost to make swift progress on alternatives, they are expected to add. The efforts that the commission will make to advance the trade talks will be spelled out in detail. But EU officials have admitted that the letter will fall short of offering a date by when the backstop arrangements will be lifted, and fear that the prime minister has put too much faith in the last-minute gambit. The British government will also publish a letter of intent when May stands up in the Commons. It is likely to lay out the dates by when the UK will seek to have a trade deal finalised, making the backstop irrelevant. Juncker said on Friday, while in Bucharest for the opening of the Romanian presidency of the EU, that he would not offer anything that could be \u201cconfused with a renegotiation\u201d. In an admission of the weakness of the prime minister\u2019s position before her Commons statement at 3.30pm, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, conceded on Monday that while it was not impossible for the government to win the vote, it was nevertheless unlikely. Fox also went on the attack to claim that parliament was \u201cdominated by politicians that wish to remain in the European union\u201d adding that \u201cthis is the basis of the problem we have\u201d. Fox called on MPs to show \u201chumility\u201d and \u201chonour and respect\u201d the referendum result. He added that blocking Brexit would \u201cshake to its foundations the relationship between parliament and the voters of the country\u201d. A no-deal Brexit was \u201csurvivable\u201d, he said, and those affected by it would adapt over time to the disruption. He echoed the recent claims of the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, by saying that a \u201cno Brexit\u201d would see a rise of \u201cthe populism we have seen in continental Europe\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t regard no-deal as national suicide. This is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI think no-deal would damage our economy \u2013 I\u2019ve been frank about that \u2013 but I think it\u2019s survivable. I think no Brexit, politically, is a disaster from which we might not recover.\u201d May would outline to MPs \u201cthe assurances she had had from the European Union following discussions over the last few days\u201d, Fox added. If May is defeated she is likely to face a no-confidence vote tabled by Labour. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, declined to say precisely when this would happen, but indicated it would be soon. \u201cThe call will be made tomorrow after that vote,\u201d he told Today. With May and her ministers refusing to outline what alternative plan might be put forward if her proposal was defeated, a series of backbench ideas have been unveiled to seize control of the process from government. Om Monday, a cross-party group of MPs from the Lib Dems, Labour, Conservatives and SNP were publishing two draft bills designed to pave the way for a new referendum. One of these would give voters the option of voting for the government\u2019s deal or staying in the EU. Separately, three senior Conservative backbenchers drafted a bill that would give the liaison committee, which groups together the MPs who chair various select committees, a key role in coming up with a new plan. Nick Boles, who has come up with the idea along with Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, said all three would vote for the PM\u2019s deal on Tuesday, but would act if it failed. Boles told Today their planned bill would give May a further three weeks to come up with a compromise deal and get it through parliament. If that failed the liaison committee would be given \u201cthe responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal\u201d. He added: \u201cIf the house passed that compromise deal, then the government would be legally required to implement whatever it was that they had.\u201d Boles is among Tory backbenchers accused by some newspapers of trying to stage a \u201ccoup\u201d. Asked about this, Boles said: \u201cIt\u2019s a funny kind of coup which requires a majority vote of democratically elected MPs before the task starts rolling. So, no, it isn\u2019t a coup, it\u2019s an expression of parliamentary will.\u201d Similar accusations have also been levelled against the Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve, one of the MPs tabling the proposed bill on a new referendum. At the weekend, some newspapers said he was leading a coup against Brexit in alliance with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. Grieve, whose amendment obliging May to respond to the defeat of her plan within three days was passed by MPs last week, told the Guardian the reports were \u201crubbish\u201d, and had resulted in him receiving death threats. \u201cI can emphatically say it is totally untrue that I am in a conspiracy with the Speaker either to stop Brexit or to change the standing orders of the house,\u201d he said. In her speech, at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent, where more than two-thirds of people voted to leave the EU, May will reiterate her claim that a rejection of her proposals on Tuesday would destroy faith in politics, and could mean that Brexit does not happen. \u201cI ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,\u201d she is due to say. \u201cWhat if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote? People\u2019s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 1993, New York author Lee Israel found herself staring down the barrel of a prison sentence. Following an investigation by the FBI, she had been busted as a literary forger. For the past two years, the 53-year-old biographer and journalist had made a killing \u2013 not a fortune, but enough to pay the arrears on her rent and get her beloved sick cat treated by the vet \u2013 by inventing letters from well-known wits of the mid-20th century. In a series of clever fakes bashed out on vintage Remingtons and Adlers sourced from local junk shops, Israel had ventriloquised funny one-pagers from the likes of No\u00ebl Coward, the actor Fanny Brice and, her particular favourite, the satirist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jun/16/the-wicked-wit-and-enigma-of-dorothy-parker-50-years-on\" title=\"\">Dorothy Parker</a>. With Israel in charge, Brice, of<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/29/sheridan-smith-funny-girl-musical-comedy-savoy-theatre-london\" title=\"\">Funny Girl</a></em> fame, quipped about the size of her nose, Parker apologised for being drunk yet again \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sure that I must have said something terrible\u201d \u2013 and Coward was bitchy about Marlene Dietrich, that \u201ccanny old Kraut\u201d, whom he nonetheless professed to cherish. These amuse-bouches were then fenced for cash by Israel in those venerable independent bookshops of Manhattan that did a bit of literary memorabilia-dealing on the side. As long as the signature looked OK \u2013 and Israel practised those to perfection \u2013 no one bothered to ask searching questions about provenance.</p> <p>In the end, Israel didn\u2019t see the inside of a cell, getting off instead with six months\u2019 house arrest and five years\u2019 probation. Nor did she go down as one of the great forgers of literary history: no one mentioned her in the same breath as Thomas Chatterton or even the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/hitler-diaries-fake-forged-sunday-times\" title=\"\">Hitler diaries</a>\u201d. In fact, no one mentioned her at all, which for any writer is galling, but for one with Israel\u2019s ego was simply unbearable. She was justly proud of her work, of the way she had immersed herself in her subjects\u2019 lives and writing in order to absorb their voices by osmosis before sending them out again into the world, duly refreshed. Nor did she regard this is as a mere sideline, but instead turned out fakes on an industrial scale, generating 400 letters in a year and a half.</p> <p>\u201cMy success as a forger was somehow in sync with my erstwhile success as a biographer,\u201d Israel wrote later. \u201cI had for decades practised a kind of merged identity with my subjects; to say I \u2018channelled\u2019 is only a slight exaggeration.\u201d She was careful to add just enough juice to make her documents piquant without making them so improbable that flags would be raised. In Israel\u2019s letters, Coward snipes mildly about Julie Andrews\u2019 overbite, while Ernest Hemingway grumbles about Spencer Tracy being cast in <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>. Israel remained unrepentant about these literary larcenies: \u201cThe forged letters were larky and fun and totally cool.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad3dd1e1745bed43434e73ec380cce72ec4f3f56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad3dd1e1745bed43434e73ec380cce72ec4f3f56/0_368_3283_4101/801.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy Parker\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothy Parker was one of Lee Israel\u2019s targets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2008, a safe 15 years since she had been up in court and nearly 25 years since her last legitimate publication, Israel published <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me? Memoirs of a Literary Forger</em>. Do not be fooled by the apparent cringe of the title. \u201cCan you ever forgive me?\u201d is a line that Israel invented for Dorothy Parker in one of the letters, where she shows the legendary wit faux-abasing herself for drunken shenanigans the night before. The real Parker would never have apologised and nor, indeed, would Israel. Instead, <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em> is a bold, braggy account of how Israel was able to outscam the scammers.</p> <p>In the pre-internet early 1990s, the trade in literary memorabilia was a sketchy cottage industry powered by a fair amount of greed and bad faith. A proportion of the dealers came to suspect that Israel was passing off fakes, but they were happy to slip her $50 in cash before selling them on for three times that amount to any passing punter who professed a soft spot for Coward, Parker, playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/22/lillian-hellman-childrens-hour-sarah-churchwell\" title=\"\">Lillian Hellman</a> or film star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/30/pandoras-box-review-gw-pabst-louise-brooks\" title=\"\">Louise Brooks</a>.</p> <p>No one was getting hurt and, what\u2019s more, Israel felt that she was being paid for her professional skills in a way that had become closed to her elsewhere. \u201cLee Israel\u2019s story is intimately bound up with the fact that the publishing industry no longer wanted her kind of writing. She was disappearing from her own landscape,\u201d explains Marielle Heller, director of the Oscar-buzzed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy\" title=\"\">film version of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/10/can-you-ever-forgive-me-review-melissa-mccarthy\" title=\"\">Can You Ever Forgive Me?</a>,</em> starring Melissa McCarthy, which goes on UK release next month. What Heller means is that Israel\u2019s way of working \u2013 she had been the author of three biographies, two of which were critically acclaimed, with one making the New York Times bestseller list \u2013 was going out of style. Years of patient sleuthing in the archives, followed by the crafting of a meticulous narrative in which the subject of the biography \u2013 Israel\u2019s 1972 life of the actor Tallulah Bankhead was probably her best work \u2013 is given precedence over the whimsy and ego of the author, was becoming unfashionable. Kitty Kelley had recently published muckraking expos\u00e9s on Jackie Kennedy and Frank Sinatra, and it was increasingly clear that, without a fair dollop of vicious smut and a breathlessly scandalised narrative voice, a well-turned biography didn\u2019t stand much of a chance.</p> <p>Nor, in this newly commodified market, did Israel have either the knack or desire to turn herself into a \u201cbrand-name author\u201d. She wasn\u2019t merely bad at publicity, she was bad at life, managing to offend just about everyone, including her own agent. There\u2019s a wonderful scene at the beginning of the film where she turns up semi-drunk to her agent\u2019s smart party and stumbles across smooth-as-silk thriller writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/tom-clancy-thriller-writer\" title=\"\">Tom Clancy</a> holding forth about the secret of his success. Snorting in derision, she stomps out of the building, but not before stealing a particularly nice coat from the cloakroom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d30b1cb929b9e77cecedcf11166742275a63ef91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30b1cb929b9e77cecedcf11166742275a63ef91/107_0_3188_1914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McCarthy with Richard E Grant in Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McCarthy with Richard E Grant in Can You Ever Forgive Me?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Fox Searchlight</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The apartment to which Israel returns is, somewhat incongruously, on upmarket Riverside Drive. The early 1990s was still a time when artists and writers were able to live in nice bits of Manhattan thanks to the long reach of rent control and reasonably accessible welfare benefits. It is this aesthetic of a New York that is both grand and shabby that Heller has worked so hard to show in her film. \u201cSome of those old bookshops, which have been in the same family for generations, are still there and you can feel 20th-century literary history dripping off the walls,\u201d explains Heller, who shot on location in the places where Israel plied her nefarious trade.</p> <p>The fact that Israel\u2019s Upper West Side apartment was in a state of chaos, with cat shit piling up under her bed, suggests that her mid-life plunge into criminality was less a dramatic moral decline than a symptom of decaying mental health. Israel\u2019s inability to sell a new book to her sneering agent, who suggested she \u201cfind another way to make a living\u201d, her armoured loneliness \u2013 her ex-girlfriend did not return her calls \u2013 and her alcoholism were tipping her from eccentric cat lady into social nuisance. She had recently taken to phoning up leading publishing people pretending to be the essayist and screenwriter Nora Ephron and yelling \u201cstar fucker\u201d when they came breathlessly to the phone.

      "bodyText": "In 1993, New York author Lee Israel found herself staring down the barrel of a prison sentence. Following an investigation by the FBI, she had been busted as a literary forger. For the past two years, the 53-year-old biographer and journalist had made a killing \u2013 not a fortune, but enough to pay the arrears on her rent and get her beloved sick cat treated by the vet \u2013 by inventing letters from well-known wits of the mid-20th century. In a series of clever fakes bashed out on vintage Remingtons and Adlers sourced from local junk shops, Israel had ventriloquised funny one-pagers from the likes of No\u00ebl Coward, the actor Fanny Brice and, her particular favourite, the satirist Dorothy Parker. With Israel in charge, Brice, of Funny Girl fame, quipped about the size of her nose, Parker apologised for being drunk yet again \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m sure that I must have said something terrible\u201d \u2013 and Coward was bitchy about Marlene Dietrich, that \u201ccanny old Kraut\u201d, whom he nonetheless professed to cherish. These amuse-bouches were then fenced for cash by Israel in those venerable independent bookshops of Manhattan that did a bit of literary memorabilia-dealing on the side. As long as the signature looked OK \u2013 and Israel practised those to perfection \u2013 no one bothered to ask searching questions about provenance. In the end, Israel didn\u2019t see the inside of a cell, getting off instead with six months\u2019 house arrest and five years\u2019 probation. Nor did she go down as one of the great forgers of literary history: no one mentioned her in the same breath as Thomas Chatterton or even the \u201cHitler diaries\u201d. In fact, no one mentioned her at all, which for any writer is galling, but for one with Israel\u2019s ego was simply unbearable. She was justly proud of her work, of the way she had immersed herself in her subjects\u2019 lives and writing in order to absorb their voices by osmosis before sending them out again into the world, duly refreshed. Nor did she regard this is as a mere sideline, but instead turned out fakes on an industrial scale, generating 400 letters in a year and a half. \u201cMy success as a forger was somehow in sync with my erstwhile success as a biographer,\u201d Israel wrote later. \u201cI had for decades practised a kind of merged identity with my subjects; to say I \u2018channelled\u2019 is only a slight exaggeration.\u201d She was careful to add just enough juice to make her documents piquant without making them so improbable that flags would be raised. In Israel\u2019s letters, Coward snipes mildly about Julie Andrews\u2019 overbite, while Ernest Hemingway grumbles about Spencer Tracy being cast in The Old Man and the Sea. Israel remained unrepentant about these literary larcenies: \u201cThe forged letters were larky and fun and totally cool.\u201d In 2008, a safe 15 years since she had been up in court and nearly 25 years since her last legitimate publication, Israel published Can You Ever Forgive Me? Memoirs of a Literary Forger. Do not be fooled by the apparent cringe of the title. \u201cCan you ever forgive me?\u201d is a line that Israel invented for Dorothy Parker in one of the letters, where she shows the legendary wit faux-abasing herself for drunken shenanigans the night before. The real Parker would never have apologised and nor, indeed, would Israel. Instead, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a bold, braggy account of how Israel was able to outscam the scammers. In the pre-internet early 1990s, the trade in literary memorabilia was a sketchy cottage industry powered by a fair amount of greed and bad faith. A proportion of the dealers came to suspect that Israel was passing off fakes, but they were happy to slip her $50 in cash before selling them on for three times that amount to any passing punter who professed a soft spot for Coward, Parker, playwright Lillian Hellman or film star Louise Brooks. No one was getting hurt and, what\u2019s more, Israel felt that she was being paid for her professional skills in a way that had become closed to her elsewhere. \u201cLee Israel\u2019s story is intimately bound up with the fact that the publishing industry no longer wanted her kind of writing. She was disappearing from her own landscape,\u201d explains Marielle Heller, director of the Oscar-buzzed film version of Can You Ever Forgive Me?, starring Melissa McCarthy, which goes on UK release next month. What Heller means is that Israel\u2019s way of working \u2013 she had been the author of three biographies, two of which were critically acclaimed, with one making the New York Times bestseller list \u2013 was going out of style. Years of patient sleuthing in the archives, followed by the crafting of a meticulous narrative in which the subject of the biography \u2013 Israel\u2019s 1972 life of the actor Tallulah Bankhead was probably her best work \u2013 is given precedence over the whimsy and ego of the author, was becoming unfashionable. Kitty Kelley had recently published muckraking expos\u00e9s on Jackie Kennedy and Frank Sinatra, and it was increasingly clear that, without a fair dollop of vicious smut and a breathlessly scandalised narrative voice, a well-turned biography didn\u2019t stand much of a chance. Nor, in this newly commodified market, did Israel have either the knack or desire to turn herself into a \u201cbrand-name author\u201d. She wasn\u2019t merely bad at publicity, she was bad at life, managing to offend just about everyone, including her own agent. There\u2019s a wonderful scene at the beginning of the film where she turns up semi-drunk to her agent\u2019s smart party and stumbles across smooth-as-silk thriller writer Tom Clancy holding forth about the secret of his success. Snorting in derision, she stomps out of the building, but not before stealing a particularly nice coat from the cloakroom. The apartment to which Israel returns is, somewhat incongruously, on upmarket Riverside Drive. The early 1990s was still a time when artists and writers were able to live in nice bits of Manhattan thanks to the long reach of rent control and reasonably accessible welfare benefits. It is this aesthetic of a New York that is both grand and shabby that Heller has worked so hard to show in her film. \u201cSome of those old bookshops, which have been in the same family for generations, are still there and you can feel 20th-century literary history dripping off the walls,\u201d explains Heller, who shot on location in the places where Israel plied her nefarious trade. The fact that Israel\u2019s Upper West Side apartment was in a state of chaos, with cat shit piling up under her bed, suggests that her mid-life plunge into criminality was less a dramatic moral decline than a symptom of decaying mental health. Israel\u2019s inability to sell a new book to her sneering agent, who suggested she \u201cfind another way to make a living\u201d, her armoured loneliness \u2013 her ex-girlfriend did not return her calls \u2013 and her alcoholism were tipping her from eccentric cat lady into social nuisance. She had recently taken to phoning up leading publishing people pretending to be the essayist and screenwriter Nora Ephron and yelling \u201cstar fucker\u201d when they came breathlessly to the phone. Ephron\u2019s lawyers had to send a letter instructing her to cease and desist. Another time, humiliated by a bookseller who refused to buy the second-hand books she had schlepped across town, Israel concocted a delicious revenge. Having ascertained that he had an expensive dog that he adored, she called the shop from a phonebox pretending to be one of his neighbours, and screaming that their block was on fire and that his beloved pet was about to become toast. The clerk was last seen hysterically hailing a cab to take him to the non-existent Armageddon. Israel is hardly an obviously sympathetic character and both Heller and co-scriptwriter Nicole Holofcener put her spikiness front and centre. \u201cSure, she comes across in her memoir as unlikable, but she\u2019s also brave enough to reveal her vulnerabilities too. You have to admire a woman who is prepared to tell you that the pest exterminator refused to enter her apartment until she had cleaned up,\u201d says Holofcener. For Heller, making a film about an unlovely woman is important since, in real life, most of us are unlovely in one way or another. \u201cHollywood traditionally hasn\u2019t been interested in telling the stories of women like Lee Israel unless it is to punish them,\u201d she says.

If one of the gifts of fiction is to proffer unfamiliar footwear in which to walk a while, Bilan\u2019s story is an eye-opening adventure, with one sandalled foot in atmospheric realism and a toe-hold in the mythical. To thwart the debt collector, plucky young Asha has to find her father, missing in the faraway city. As her desperation turns to real danger (policemen, blizzards, wolves) help is on hand in the form of the powerful lamagaia bird \u2013 known less atmospherically as the bearded vulture \u2013 and a green-eyed tiger. Could these be the spirits of Asha\u2019s ancestors?</p> <p>Equally saturated with sense-impressions is <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/how-high-the-moon-9780241346891.html\" title=\"\">How High the Moon</a></strong> (Puffin), the debut by Karyn Parsons, who, having graced the small screen in <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em>, now produces children\u2019s animated films. In 1943, small-town South Carolina has its problems \u2013 segregation, distant war \u2013 but the creek is full of fish and the garden, corn; friends and church picnics abound.</p> <p>All young Ella wants, though, is to be reunited with her jazz singer mother in Boston, and to quiz her about the father she has never met. Parsons is great at unfurling the pleasures of the freer northern states through biracial Ella\u2019s eyes, but also adept at handling the subtleties of layered storytelling. Back in the south, meanwhile, one of Ella\u2019s friends is framed for murdering two white girls. And might Ella\u2019s father be closer at hand than she believes? The framing is a true story: 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/17/black-14-year-old-exonerated-70-years-after-south-carolina-put-him-to-death\" title=\"\">George Stinney</a> was the youngest person ever executed for murder in the US; in 2014, he was declared not to have had a fair trial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"357a99b246d5b35d6cb3cb3fea5a37855a468d5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/357a99b246d5b35d6cb3cb3fea5a37855a468d5a/0_0_7311_4701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mountain in the Himayalas, the setting for Jasbinder Bilan\u2019s \u2018eye-opening\u2019 Asha and the Spirit Bird\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mountain in the Himayalas, the setting for Jasbinder Bilan\u2019s \u2018eye-opening\u2019 Asha and the Spirit Bird.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in the present day, there are more tales of time travel and transformation.

Like Kafka\u2019s man-roach Gregor Samsa and fly guy Jeff Goldblum before him, nine-year-old Charlie McGuffin transforms unexpectedly into a spider (and a pigeon and a rhino). It happens when he is in a flap, which he often is: the school play is nigh. Charlie\u2019s quest to control his nerves is the best kind of silly: tricksily, Charlie never actually changes into a chicken (MacGuffin alert!). He does, though, turn into a \u201cdanger noodle \u2013 which, as everyone knows, is the actual scientific name for a snake\u201d.</p> <p><em>The Goldfish Boy</em> author Lisa Thompson returns with <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/world-without-maxwell.html\" title=\"\">The Day I Was Erased</a></strong> (Scholastic), one of two books here that plays with alternative futures. Anyone who has flounced about yelling \u201cI wish I\u2019d never been born!\u201d might empathise with Maxwell, who leaves havoc in his wake. He\u2019s not a great friend. His only confidant is an elderly neighbour whose memory isn\u2019t what it used to be, and whose weird old trinkets aren\u2019t what they seem, either. Maxwell\u2019s misbehaviour sets off a chain of events that finds him never having been born. Getting back to normal entails resourcefulness and \u2013 crucially \u2013 empathy.</p> <p>How awesome is Ross Welford? Consistently original, believable and filmable (please), the author of <em>Time Travelling </em><em>With a Hamster</em> et al does it again with <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dog-who-saved-the-world.html\" title=\"\">The Dog That Saved the World</a></strong> (HarperCollins) (just one caveat \u2013 the stereotypical shopkeeper). The promise and threat of science looms large here. Young Georgina\u2019s life just gets more complicated: her new stepmum is allergic to the rescue dog Georgie loves. Then there\u2019s the advanced VR rig she and her friend Ramzy are persuaded to test for an eccentric American IT renegade.</p> <p>Things get very real when a deadly canine disease leaps from dogs to humans.

      "bodyText": "Can you judge a book by its cover? Often, in children\u2019s fiction. Set in the foothills of the Himalayas, Asha and the Spirit Bird (Chicken House) \u2013 the debut from Jasbinder Bilan, winner of her publisher\u2019s children\u2019s fiction competition in 2017 \u2013 hits you with lush tropical artwork: namaste, illustrator Aitch and designer Helen Crawford-White. The words do justice to the pictures. If one of the gifts of fiction is to proffer unfamiliar footwear in which to walk a while, Bilan\u2019s story is an eye-opening adventure, with one sandalled foot in atmospheric realism and a toe-hold in the mythical. To thwart the debt collector, plucky young Asha has to find her father, missing in the faraway city. As her desperation turns to real danger (policemen, blizzards, wolves) help is on hand in the form of the powerful lamagaia bird \u2013 known less atmospherically as the bearded vulture \u2013 and a green-eyed tiger. Could these be the spirits of Asha\u2019s ancestors? Equally saturated with sense-impressions is How High the Moon (Puffin), the debut by Karyn Parsons, who, having graced the small screen in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, now produces children\u2019s animated films. In 1943, small-town South Carolina has its problems \u2013 segregation, distant war \u2013 but the creek is full of fish and the garden, corn; friends and church picnics abound. All young Ella wants, though, is to be reunited with her jazz singer mother in Boston, and to quiz her about the father she has never met. Parsons is great at unfurling the pleasures of the freer northern states through biracial Ella\u2019s eyes, but also adept at handling the subtleties of layered storytelling. Back in the south, meanwhile, one of Ella\u2019s friends is framed for murdering two white girls. And might Ella\u2019s father be closer at hand than she believes? The framing is a true story: 14-year-old George Stinney was the youngest person ever executed for murder in the US; in 2014, he was declared not to have had a fair trial. Back in the present day, there are more tales of time travel and transformation. Agent turned scribe Sam Copeland is another debut novelist whose Charlie Changes Into a Chicken (Puffin) has been sold in 17 languages. Like Kafka\u2019s man-roach Gregor Samsa and fly guy Jeff Goldblum before him, nine-year-old Charlie McGuffin transforms unexpectedly into a spider (and a pigeon and a rhino). It happens when he is in a flap, which he often is: the school play is nigh. Charlie\u2019s quest to control his nerves is the best kind of silly: tricksily, Charlie never actually changes into a chicken (MacGuffin alert!). He does, though, turn into a \u201cdanger noodle \u2013 which, as everyone knows, is the actual scientific name for a snake\u201d. The Goldfish Boy author Lisa Thompson returns with The Day I Was Erased (Scholastic), one of two books here that plays with alternative futures. Anyone who has flounced about yelling \u201cI wish I\u2019d never been born!\u201d might empathise with Maxwell, who leaves havoc in his wake. He\u2019s not a great friend. His only confidant is an elderly neighbour whose memory isn\u2019t what it used to be, and whose weird old trinkets aren\u2019t what they seem, either. Maxwell\u2019s misbehaviour sets off a chain of events that finds him never having been born. Getting back to normal entails resourcefulness and \u2013 crucially \u2013 empathy. How awesome is Ross Welford? Consistently original, believable and filmable (please), the author of Time Travelling With a Hamster et al does it again with The Dog That Saved the World (HarperCollins) (just one caveat \u2013 the stereotypical shopkeeper). The promise and threat of science looms large here. Young Georgina\u2019s life just gets more complicated: her new stepmum is allergic to the rescue dog Georgie loves. Then there\u2019s the advanced VR rig she and her friend Ramzy are persuaded to test for an eccentric American IT renegade. Things get very real when a deadly canine disease leaps from dogs to humans. To say more would spoil a terrific adventure, with all the suspense of a medical thriller.

It\u2019s convenient! It\u2019s affordable! It\u2019s a bus.</p> <p>Tweets mocking Lyft Shuttle instantly went viral, but there\u2019s actually very little that\u2019s funny about it. Not only is the whole idea arguably classist (online, <a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/lyft-s-new-shuttle-service-is-more-convenient-than-lyft-1796167137\" title=\"\">people have praised Lyft Shuttle</a> for allowing them to get around without sitting next to common riff-raff), in practice, the service could harm investment in existing public transport.

Last year, the fashion company Atoms promised to \u201cmodernise the footwear experience\u201d by offering tennis shoes in quarter sizes (for the bargain price of \u00a3140!). In 2017 a team of Swedish inventors released their Pause Pod \u2013 a \u201cprivate pop-up space\u201d where busy employees could relax, which \u2013 yes, yes, you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 was just a tent. \u201cWe never claimed that it\u2019s not a tent,\u201d the Scandinavian developers offered in their defence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/08/silicon-valley-history-society-book-ohlone-native-americans\">Long before tech bros, Silicon Valley had a highly developed society</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/24/the-five-most-pointless-tech-solutions-to-non-problems\" title=\"\">examples are in fact endless</a>: in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-welive-wall-street-co-living-photos-tour?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">We Work launched co-living spaces</a> which were essentially just student dorms with added yoga; a startup\u2019s brand new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/tech-startup-bodega-corner-stores\" title=\"\">Bodega boxes</a> were just vending machines; and no one will ever forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down\" title=\"\">Juicero</a> (rest in peace), the \u00a3300 machine that \u2013 investors realised all too late \u2013 essentially just poured juice.

It\u2019s just egos and the language employed by Silicon Valley are automatically annoying. While products might be marginal improvements on their predecessors, they often come with a host of new problems \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/874262251871645696\" title=\"\">Lyft\u2019s dystopian insistence</a> that a driver who gave birth on the job was somehow \u201cimpressive\u201d, instead of a victim of lax modern labour laws.</p> <p>Not only are these products nowhere near as revolutionary as they sound, these companies and their inventors often ignore the majority of people to improve lives for a privileged minority. They\u2019re too busy operating in a bubble of their own perceived brilliance to know what might work \u2013 old and new \u2013 in the wider world.</p> <p>\u2022 Amelia Tait is a freelance features writer</p>",

It\u2019s convenient! It\u2019s affordable! It\u2019s a bus. Tweets mocking Lyft Shuttle instantly went viral, but there\u2019s actually very little that\u2019s funny about it. Not only is the whole idea arguably classist (online, people have praised Lyft Shuttle for allowing them to get around without sitting next to common riff-raff), in practice, the service could harm investment in existing public transport. As Salon writer Keith A Spencer pointed out in 2017, by competing with existing infrastructure, Lyft Shuttle could leave poorer people with fewer and worse transit options than they had already. Not only is Silicon Valley wrapping up an old idea in a new bow, they\u2019re threatening much-needed public services. Then again, some \u201cinventions\u201d are just funny. Last year, the fashion company Atoms promised to \u201cmodernise the footwear experience\u201d by offering tennis shoes in quarter sizes (for the bargain price of \u00a3140!). In 2017 a team of Swedish inventors released their Pause Pod \u2013 a \u201cprivate pop-up space\u201d where busy employees could relax, which \u2013 yes, yes, you\u2019ve guessed it \u2013 was just a tent. \u201cWe never claimed that it\u2019s not a tent,\u201d the Scandinavian developers offered in their defence. The examples are in fact endless: in 2017 We Work launched co-living spaces which were essentially just student dorms with added yoga; a startup\u2019s brand new Bodega boxes were just vending machines; and no one will ever forget Juicero (rest in peace), the \u00a3300 machine that \u2013 investors realised all too late \u2013 essentially just poured juice. Most recently, everyone\u2019s favourite Silicon Valley cyborg, Elon Musk, was mocked for his loop system, which provides underground tracks for cars. Australians felt this borrowed heavily from Adelaide\u2019s O-Bahn system, which has existed for buses since 1986. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with attempting to improve old inventions (though I have to politely insist that the relevant parties bring back pre-sugar tax Irn Bru). It\u2019s just egos and the language employed by Silicon Valley are automatically annoying. While products might be marginal improvements on their predecessors, they often come with a host of new problems \u2013 such as Lyft\u2019s dystopian insistence that a driver who gave birth on the job was somehow \u201cimpressive\u201d, instead of a victim of lax modern labour laws. Not only are these products nowhere near as revolutionary as they sound, these companies and their inventors often ignore the majority of people to improve lives for a privileged minority. They\u2019re too busy operating in a bubble of their own perceived brilliance to know what might work \u2013 old and new \u2013 in the wider world. \u2022 Amelia Tait is a freelance features writer",

In December 2017 they were beaten 5-1 at the Amex by J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side; this time around they were still in it to the end, eventually throwing centre-back Shane Duffy up front, but a narrow defeat did not leave anybody feeling too down. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be punished [with] three or four because they can embarrass you,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAt half-time we said we had to stay in the game as long as possible because we might get a chance, but it didn\u2019t happen today.\u201d But Brighton deserve credit. They are running the top sides closer these days and it is not as if all those games have been contested from inside their shell.

Claudio Ranieri claimed his side deserved a point, though he admitted Fulham managed only three goal attempts for all their passing and movement outside the box. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask that many questions,\u201d Sean Dyche said, which was a bit rich coming from the manager of a winning side unable to muster a single shot on target. \u201cWe played well, we will not give up,\u201d Ranieri said, putting a brave face on the fact that his side can ill-afford to squander points against fellow strugglers.

But spare a thought for Ken Sema, the man who Cleverley replaced after 68 minutes: not such an unusual thing, until you realise that Sema himself came off the bench, introduced when Will Hughes suffered concussion after a collision with Mamadou Sakho on 19 minutes. Sema was not injured , but did manage to pick up a booking shortly before Javi Gracia decided to replace him, 49 minutes later. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision but in that moment I thought I had to do it,\u201d Gracia said, when asked about substituting a substitute. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry because I don\u2019t like to do it but I had to do it.\u201d <strong>Nick Miller</strong></p> <p>\u2022<em> Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace 1-2 Watford</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a45b413d9ea8cc99ca1b779d0896338a3b79f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a45b413d9ea8cc99ca1b779d0896338a3b79f02/50_79_4218_2532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Zouma celebrates after scoring for Everton v Bournemouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurt Zouma celebrates after giving Everton the lead.

The contributions of Kurt Zouma and Andr\u00e9 Gomes were not lost on the Everton manager, both overcoming subdued starts to bring much-needed strength, a finishing touch in front of goal in the defender\u2019s case, and composure to the display. Not that Gomes should have seen out the 90 minutes, however, with the midfielder fortunate to escape a second yellow card. The two took responsibility that other senior Everton players did not, a concern for Silva given that both are at the club on loan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the conditions to sign them [permanently],\u201d the Everton manager explained. \u201cIn that moment a loan was the best and maybe the only solution. Let\u2019s see what we can do in the future with these two players.\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/everton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 2-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p> <h2>7) Hasenh\u00fcttl gives Saints new resolve</h2> <p>Southampton\u2019s gutsy 2-1 victory over Leicester felt like the sort of game that they would have lost prior to Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s appointment. There was more than half an hour remaining when Leicester, who were playing with an extra man following Yan Valery\u2019s dismissal, halved the deficit and it was easy to fear for Southampton at that point. Yet it says much for the renewed belief that Hasenh\u00fcttl has instilled, and in particular the way that the team is organised defensively, that Southampton saw the game out without ever looking that uncomfortable. The Austrian has been in charge for only seven league matches but he has already won as many (three) as Mark Hughes. \u201cThe difference has been unbelievable,\u201d said James Ward-Prowse, who scored the opener. \u201cWe have a clear structure and a plan of what do with and without the ball.\u201d <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 1-2 Southampton</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/unai-emery-arsenal-mesut-ozil\">Unai Emery knocks Mesut \u00d6zil off his star-status pedestal at Arsenal</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8) Lukaku out in the cold as Rashford shines</h2> <p>The sight of Romelu Lukaku in tracksuit and raincoat as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial fed off the passing of Paul Pogba pinpointed the most marked change in Manchester United since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho settled his bill at the Lowry hotel. After returning from the leave of absence he took over Christmas, the Belgian has yet to fit into Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s strategy, which at Wembley seemed little more sophisticated than playing on the break and hitting those fleet-footed forwards as quickly as possible. Despite scoring in his last three matches, a target man does not fit United\u2019s requirements, and just as Solskj\u00e6r had to accept from Sir Alex Ferguson, goals cannot guarantee a starting place if the team is better served by players who bring more overall. Meanwhile, it remains a mystery why Mourinho failed to see much in Rashford. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/tottenham-0-1-manchester-united-player-ratings-from-wembley\">Spurs 0-1 Manchester United: player ratings</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c25d70f62b809c00d05ba5a4bf20200bc67ea5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c25d70f62b809c00d05ba5a4bf20200bc67ea5b/0_126_3793_2276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samir Nasri made his first Premier League start for West Ham against Arsenal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samir Nasri made his first Premier League start for West Ham against Arsenal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Nasri could be the bargain of the season</h2> <p>Samir Nasri had a point to prove during West Ham\u2019s impressive victory over Arsenal. Not only was Nasri fuelled by the desire to silence the constant taunts from the away end, where Arsenal\u2019s fans relished the opportunity to jeer a player who left them for Manchester City in acrimonious circumstances in 2011, he was also energised by the task of demonstrating why Manuel Pellegrini was determined to sign him. Given a second chance after returning from an 18-month doping ban, Nasri has embraced the challenge of showing that he has lost none of his technical ability. He still needs games to improve his fitness after his long exile but the Frenchman sparkled in the No 10 role and produced a composed assist for Declan Rice\u2019s winner. Much more of this and West Ham will feel that they have landed the bargain of the season. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/west-ham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 1-0 Arsenal</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/unai-emery-arsenal-mesut-ozil\">Unai Emery knocks Mesut \u00d6zil off his star-status pedestal at Arsenal</a></p> <h2>10) Son shows Spurs what they\u2019ll be missing</h2> <p>It was the final bow of Son Heung-min\u2019s extended farewell before he belatedly headed to the Asian Cup. Tottenham will miss the awareness of space and weight of passing that set up Harry Winks for an early, missed chance. With Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 off to the Chinese Super League, Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama still absent with long-term ailments and Moussa Sissoko suffering a hamstring twang in the first half, resources are stretched to breaking point. A quartet of Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Son hauled Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team through seven wins in eight matches during the most gruelling part of the season but their energy levels have visibly flagged; Kane limped off in pain at full-time. Whichever of Lucas Moura or Erik Lamela replaces Son has big shoes to fill but there is nobody to step in for the other three. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Spurs 0-1 Manchester United</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

Yet it says much for the renewed belief that Hasenh\u00fcttl has instilled, and in particular the way that the team is organised defensively, that Southampton saw the game out without ever looking that uncomfortable. The Austrian has been in charge for only seven league matches but he has already won as many (three) as Mark Hughes. \u201cThe difference has been unbelievable,\u201d said James Ward-Prowse, who scored the opener. \u201cWe have a clear structure and a plan of what do with and without the ball.\u201d Stuart James \u2022 Match report: Leicester 1-2 Southampton 8) Lukaku out in the cold as Rashford shines The sight of Romelu Lukaku in tracksuit and raincoat as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial fed off the passing of Paul Pogba pinpointed the most marked change in Manchester United since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho settled his bill at the Lowry hotel. After returning from the leave of absence he took over Christmas, the Belgian has yet to fit into Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s strategy, which at Wembley seemed little more sophisticated than playing on the break and hitting those fleet-footed forwards as quickly as possible. Despite scoring in his last three matches, a target man does not fit United\u2019s requirements, and just as Solskj\u00e6r had to accept from Sir Alex Ferguson, goals cannot guarantee a starting place if the team is better served by players who bring more overall. Meanwhile, it remains a mystery why Mourinho failed to see much in Rashford. John Brewin \u2022 Spurs 0-1 Manchester United: player ratings 9) Nasri could be the bargain of the season Samir Nasri had a point to prove during West Ham\u2019s impressive victory over Arsenal. Not only was Nasri fuelled by the desire to silence the constant taunts from the away end, where Arsenal\u2019s fans relished the opportunity to jeer a player who left them for Manchester City in acrimonious circumstances in 2011, he was also energised by the task of demonstrating why Manuel Pellegrini was determined to sign him. Given a second chance after returning from an 18-month doping ban, Nasri has embraced the challenge of showing that he has lost none of his technical ability. He still needs games to improve his fitness after his long exile but the Frenchman sparkled in the No 10 role and produced a composed assist for Declan Rice\u2019s winner. Much more of this and West Ham will feel that they have landed the bargain of the season. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: West Ham 1-0 Arsenal \u2022 Unai Emery knocks Mesut \u00d6zil off his star-status pedestal at Arsenal 10) Son shows Spurs what they\u2019ll be missing It was the final bow of Son Heung-min\u2019s extended farewell before he belatedly headed to the Asian Cup. Tottenham will miss the awareness of space and weight of passing that set up Harry Winks for an early, missed chance. With Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 off to the Chinese Super League, Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama still absent with long-term ailments and Moussa Sissoko suffering a hamstring twang in the first half, resources are stretched to breaking point. A quartet of Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Son hauled Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team through seven wins in eight matches during the most gruelling part of the season but their energy levels have visibly flagged; Kane limped off in pain at full-time. Whichever of Lucas Moura or Erik Lamela replaces Son has big shoes to fill but there is nobody to step in for the other three. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Spurs 0-1 Manchester United",

The league\u2019s infatuation with finding \u201cthe next Sean McVay\u201d has now reached comedic heights. The Cardinals hired Kliff Kingsbury late last week, a coach who was fired from his collegiate alma mater (Texas Tech) with a sub .500 record, despite a trio of seasons with Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield as his quarterbacks. Kingsbury was hired because he\u2019s cool: he\u2019s young, runs a fun offense, looks good, and is liked by everyone in the football world. He may wind up being great, but nothing on his CV suggests he is qualified for the position. Hot-shot, so-called innovative coaches are all the range, thanks to the success of McVay and Matt Nagy. And teams are going to laugh-out-loud lengths to draw some similarity between their young coach and the NFL\u2019s wunderkind. \u201cKingsbury is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BonaguraESPN/status/1082760386024157185\">friends with Rams coach Sean McVay</a>,\u201d the release announcing the hire on AZCardinals.com originally stated, without irony.</p>",

Garrett isn\u2019t the Cowboys\u2019 biggest problem, but he\u2019s not the solution either. In his eight seasons as coach, the Cowboys have averaged one playoff win every four years. See you in 2022, Dallas. -- Reportedly, Patriots defensive coordinator Brian Flores is the Dolphins\u2019 top target for their head coaching vacancy. Flores is expected to be announced as the team\u2019s new coach once the Patriots\u2019 season ends. If Miami buck the trend this hiring cycle, the NFL would finish the season with only four minority head coaches, including three who are black, down from eight at the start. -- Group think is alive and well in the NFL. The league\u2019s infatuation with finding \u201cthe next Sean McVay\u201d has now reached comedic heights. The Cardinals hired Kliff Kingsbury late last week, a coach who was fired from his collegiate alma mater (Texas Tech) with a sub .500 record, despite a trio of seasons with Patrick Mahomes and Baker Mayfield as his quarterbacks. Kingsbury was hired because he\u2019s cool: he\u2019s young, runs a fun offense, looks good, and is liked by everyone in the football world. He may wind up being great, but nothing on his CV suggests he is qualified for the position. Hot-shot, so-called innovative coaches are all the range, thanks to the success of McVay and Matt Nagy. And teams are going to laugh-out-loud lengths to draw some similarity between their young coach and the NFL\u2019s wunderkind. \u201cKingsbury is friends with Rams coach Sean McVay,\u201d the release announcing the hire on AZCardinals.com originally stated, without irony.",

      "body": "<p>If you have upped your training routine, returned to exercise after some time off or given a new activity a go, the chances are you have felt the characteristic ache of delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms). Usually kicking in around 24 to 48 hours after exercise, muscles feel tender and sore as a result of microscopic damage to the muscle fibres, which occurs when you force your muscles to work harder than they are used to, or use muscle groups that you don\u2019t often reach in your regular workout. It can leave you feeling achy and stiff, with a walk around the office taking on a John Wayne feel.</p> <p>Any exercise to which you\u2019re unaccustomed can result in a bout of Doms, says Dr Mark Wotherspoon, a consultant in sport, exercise and musculoskeletal medicine. Simply put, he says, it suggests you are \u201cdoing too much too soon\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look [at a normal muscle] under an electron microscope, you see that there\u2019s a normal architecture and normal structure to the muscle fibre,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look under the electron microscope with Doms, the whole architecture is disrupted. Essentially, it is true muscle damage, but it\u2019s at the muscle fibre level as opposed to a muscle tear that you would get when you\u2019re running and your hamstring goes.\u201d</p> <p>Doms can last up to five days, with the effects usually worst on day two or three, then gradually improving without treatment. It is a normal part of building muscle strength and stamina, but coach Nick Anderson warns that it could be telling you it\u2019s time to review your workout. \u201cA lot of people like [Doms] because it means they\u2019ve worked really hard and it\u2019s a great feeling, but if it\u2019s excessive and you\u2019re getting it all the time then I would be questioning either your recovery strategies or your training plan.\u201d</p> <p>Any changes should be gradual to allow muscles to adapt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get rid of that tightness and allow the muscle fibres to repair, you are more susceptible to injury for a period afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>In the days following the onset of Doms, Anderson says, \u201cdon\u2019t hammer the same muscle group again\u201d. Instead, he suggests using other muscle groups for a few days at the gym or, if you\u2019re a runner, simply lessening the intensity. He also suggests incorporating a progressive warm-up, in which movements become gradually more intense, and not to skimp on the warm down. Good quality sleep also plays a factor, when it comes to recovery.</p> <p>Although you will want to go easy on tender muscles, Wotherspoon doesn\u2019t recommend completely abandoning your fitness routine. Instead, he advises incorporating light exercises. \u201cIf I ran on Monday and then on Tuesday was sore, I might go for a light bike ride or a little jog on Wednesday,\u201d he says \u201cSo, exercising through it isn\u2019t a bad thing, but exercising and ignoring it, and exercising hard, probably is not the best thing.\u201d</p> <p>Do avoid any hard workouts and the temptation to \u201cpush through it\u201d when muscles are vulnerable, he says. \u201cYour muscle capability is reduced, your muscle power is reduced and your muscles are tender.\u201d</p> <p>While nutrition can\u2019t prevent Doms as \u201ca natural part of the training adaptation process\u201d, it may help reduce the effects, says <a href=\"https://www.thesportsdietitian.co.uk/\">sports dietitian and ultrarunner Alexandra Cook</a>. \u201cMost nutritional interventions to reduce Doms are closely related to inflammatory response and aiding the rebuilding of damaged muscles.\u201d</p> <p>She recommends a portion of protein \u2013 the main nutrient needed for muscular repair \u2013 at each meal as well as snacks to support the recovery and muscle adaptation process. \u201cRegular intake of carbohydrate is vital to replace muscle glycogen depleted during exercise. If you skimp on the carbohydrate, you run the risk of excessive protein (muscle) breakdown, which won\u2019t contribute positively to the training process.\u201d</p> <p>Ted Munson, a performance nutritionist at Science in Sport, agrees that carbohydrate intake is key, although the amount to consume \u201cdepends on what you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re undertaking high-intensity, prolonged-duration exercise like a half-marathon, you may need to consume 8-10g of carbs per kg of body mass per day. For shorter-duration, lower-intensity exercise, the demand may be reduced.\u201d</p> <p>Both Munson and Cook agree that eating something as soon as you can post-exercise is beneficial, with muscles primed to take on nutrients within 30 minutes of finishing exercise. Cook advises a simple carbohydrate and protein-based snack, while Munson suggests preparing a shake in advance; both recommend following this with a balanced meal within the next hour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-recovering-from-a-marathon\">Everything you need to know about recovering from a marathon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Water is, as usual, key, says Cook. Because muscles are made up of a high percentage of water, \u201ceven mild dehydration can make your Doms worse\u201d. But although staying hydrated may reduce symptoms, it won\u2019t speed up repair from muscle damage.</p> <p>Besides nutrition, elite athletes and novices alike swear by a number of recovery techniques, such as wearing compression clothing, using a foam roller and taking ice baths (who remembers the image of Andy Murray in an ice bath, clutching his Wimbledon trophy?) \u2013 but their effectiveness is debatable.</p> <p>Anderson is a fan of compression clothing and massage, but advises caution when it comes to foam rollers, which he believes can be \u201cmassively overvalued by people ... It\u2019s a very personal thing: some people get on with it very well, some people don\u2019t, some people do too much of it and actually cause more bruising through the foam rolling than they would have caused through the exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Wotherspoon \u2013 currently lead medical officer at Southampton FC, and a medical officer for the England cricket team for more than a decade \u2013 says that, while compression stockings, ice baths, light exercises and sports massage play a part in the recovery programmes of elite athletes, it may be all in the mind.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that it doesn\u2019t matter which one of them you use, because the most effective recovery component is psychological,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, in other words, whatever makes you feel better, do. If you\u2019re absolutely convinced that recovery stockings are the thing that helps you, crack on and use them; if you want to get in an ice bath, happy days. There\u2019s no good scientific evidence that any one of those is any better.\u201d</p> <p>The best way to deal with Doms is to avoid it in the first place, he says. \u201cIf you do a very slow, graduated exercise programme, you\u2019re much less likely to get Doms. It\u2019s all about trying to ease people into exercise at a slow, steady pace.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you have upped your training routine, returned to exercise after some time off or given a new activity a go, the chances are you have felt the characteristic ache of delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms). Usually kicking in around 24 to 48 hours after exercise, muscles feel tender and sore as a result of microscopic damage to the muscle fibres, which occurs when you force your muscles to work harder than they are used to, or use muscle groups that you don\u2019t often reach in your regular workout. It can leave you feeling achy and stiff, with a walk around the office taking on a John Wayne feel. Any exercise to which you\u2019re unaccustomed can result in a bout of Doms, says Dr Mark Wotherspoon, a consultant in sport, exercise and musculoskeletal medicine. Simply put, he says, it suggests you are \u201cdoing too much too soon\u201d. \u201cIf you look [at a normal muscle] under an electron microscope, you see that there\u2019s a normal architecture and normal structure to the muscle fibre,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look under the electron microscope with Doms, the whole architecture is disrupted. Essentially, it is true muscle damage, but it\u2019s at the muscle fibre level as opposed to a muscle tear that you would get when you\u2019re running and your hamstring goes.\u201d Doms can last up to five days, with the effects usually worst on day two or three, then gradually improving without treatment. It is a normal part of building muscle strength and stamina, but coach Nick Anderson warns that it could be telling you it\u2019s time to review your workout. \u201cA lot of people like [Doms] because it means they\u2019ve worked really hard and it\u2019s a great feeling, but if it\u2019s excessive and you\u2019re getting it all the time then I would be questioning either your recovery strategies or your training plan.\u201d Any changes should be gradual to allow muscles to adapt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get rid of that tightness and allow the muscle fibres to repair, you are more susceptible to injury for a period afterwards.\u201d In the days following the onset of Doms, Anderson says, \u201cdon\u2019t hammer the same muscle group again\u201d. Instead, he suggests using other muscle groups for a few days at the gym or, if you\u2019re a runner, simply lessening the intensity. He also suggests incorporating a progressive warm-up, in which movements become gradually more intense, and not to skimp on the warm down. Good quality sleep also plays a factor, when it comes to recovery. Although you will want to go easy on tender muscles, Wotherspoon doesn\u2019t recommend completely abandoning your fitness routine. Instead, he advises incorporating light exercises. \u201cIf I ran on Monday and then on Tuesday was sore, I might go for a light bike ride or a little jog on Wednesday,\u201d he says \u201cSo, exercising through it isn\u2019t a bad thing, but exercising and ignoring it, and exercising hard, probably is not the best thing.\u201d Do avoid any hard workouts and the temptation to \u201cpush through it\u201d when muscles are vulnerable, he says. \u201cYour muscle capability is reduced, your muscle power is reduced and your muscles are tender.\u201d While nutrition can\u2019t prevent Doms as \u201ca natural part of the training adaptation process\u201d, it may help reduce the effects, says sports dietitian and ultrarunner Alexandra Cook. \u201cMost nutritional interventions to reduce Doms are closely related to inflammatory response and aiding the rebuilding of damaged muscles.\u201d She recommends a portion of protein \u2013 the main nutrient needed for muscular repair \u2013 at each meal as well as snacks to support the recovery and muscle adaptation process. \u201cRegular intake of carbohydrate is vital to replace muscle glycogen depleted during exercise. If you skimp on the carbohydrate, you run the risk of excessive protein (muscle) breakdown, which won\u2019t contribute positively to the training process.\u201d Ted Munson, a performance nutritionist at Science in Sport, agrees that carbohydrate intake is key, although the amount to consume \u201cdepends on what you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re undertaking high-intensity, prolonged-duration exercise like a half-marathon, you may need to consume 8-10g of carbs per kg of body mass per day. For shorter-duration, lower-intensity exercise, the demand may be reduced.\u201d Both Munson and Cook agree that eating something as soon as you can post-exercise is beneficial, with muscles primed to take on nutrients within 30 minutes of finishing exercise. Cook advises a simple carbohydrate and protein-based snack, while Munson suggests preparing a shake in advance; both recommend following this with a balanced meal within the next hour. Water is, as usual, key, says Cook. Because muscles are made up of a high percentage of water, \u201ceven mild dehydration can make your Doms worse\u201d. But although staying hydrated may reduce symptoms, it won\u2019t speed up repair from muscle damage. Besides nutrition, elite athletes and novices alike swear by a number of recovery techniques, such as wearing compression clothing, using a foam roller and taking ice baths (who remembers the image of Andy Murray in an ice bath, clutching his Wimbledon trophy?) \u2013 but their effectiveness is debatable. Anderson is a fan of compression clothing and massage, but advises caution when it comes to foam rollers, which he believes can be \u201cmassively overvalued by people ... It\u2019s a very personal thing: some people get on with it very well, some people don\u2019t, some people do too much of it and actually cause more bruising through the foam rolling than they would have caused through the exercise.\u201d Wotherspoon \u2013 currently lead medical officer at Southampton FC, and a medical officer for the England cricket team for more than a decade \u2013 says that, while compression stockings, ice baths, light exercises and sports massage play a part in the recovery programmes of elite athletes, it may be all in the mind. \u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that it doesn\u2019t matter which one of them you use, because the most effective recovery component is psychological,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, in other words, whatever makes you feel better, do. If you\u2019re absolutely convinced that recovery stockings are the thing that helps you, crack on and use them; if you want to get in an ice bath, happy days. There\u2019s no good scientific evidence that any one of those is any better.\u201d The best way to deal with Doms is to avoid it in the first place, he says. \u201cIf you do a very slow, graduated exercise programme, you\u2019re much less likely to get Doms. It\u2019s all about trying to ease people into exercise at a slow, steady pace.\u201d",

This can be due to factors such as stress, fatigue, lack of privacy or opportunity, or perhaps hormonal changes. Becoming a mother can also change a woman\u2019s self-perception so that the sense of herself as a sexual being can be naturally and temporarily lost. If you think these things apply to you, correct them by trying to get more rest and help with childcare, and try to reconnect with your earlier romantic and erotic feelings. That might mean occasionally returning to the kind of dating experiences you once enjoyed and creating time and space for your partner and you to enjoy yourselves. It is never easy to transition from being a couple to being a family of four. Resentments and anxieties can arise, sometimes remaining unspoken, and these can lead to a loss of sexual interest. What are your deep feelings about your new situation? Do you feel, for example, that your partner is pulling his weight? Your sex life will depend on the balance of your life and the viability of your partnership. Sometimes, however, there can be deeper psychological issues that arise during parenthood, perhaps related to unconscious matters or early trauma, and these usually require treatment. Fortunately, the fact that you began your relationship with a healthy sexual partnership makes it very likely that you will be able to restore it again.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto://private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

I occasionally give in out of guilt for him and \u201clet him\u201d, but I feel violated and often cry throughout in the dark. We are arguing more and more, although I am not an argumentative person. I am feeling hatred rising inside me and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to ruin everything again. I don\u2019t know what to do ... Is this something you can help with? Parents of very young children often experience low libido. This can be due to factors such as stress, fatigue, lack of privacy or opportunity, or perhaps hormonal changes. Becoming a mother can also change a woman\u2019s self-perception so that the sense of herself as a sexual being can be naturally and temporarily lost. If you think these things apply to you, correct them by trying to get more rest and help with childcare, and try to reconnect with your earlier romantic and erotic feelings. That might mean occasionally returning to the kind of dating experiences you once enjoyed and creating time and space for your partner and you to enjoy yourselves. It is never easy to transition from being a couple to being a family of four. Resentments and anxieties can arise, sometimes remaining unspoken, and these can lead to a loss of sexual interest. What are your deep feelings about your new situation? Do you feel, for example, that your partner is pulling his weight? Your sex life will depend on the balance of your life and the viability of your partnership. Sometimes, however, there can be deeper psychological issues that arise during parenthood, perhaps related to unconscious matters or early trauma, and these usually require treatment. Fortunately, the fact that you began your relationship with a healthy sexual partnership makes it very likely that you will be able to restore it again. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

When she and other unsheltered women set up an encampment they called the Housing and Dignity Village, she felt safe, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sanctuary we created for ourselves,\u201d said Bee, whose daughters are ages 16 and 21. \u201cI\u2019m trying to protect my kids as best I can \u2026 There is literally nowhere for us to go.\u201d The city, however, evicted her group last month, resulting in them moving into cars and tents. The court battle and eviction process wore them out, she added. \u201cWe\u2019re all sick as fuck.\u201d Bee and her 16-year-old have been staying in a camper vehicle, regularly moving spots to try to find safe locations that aren\u2019t too far from a bathroom or her daughter\u2019s school. The city\u2019s shutdown of her campsite made her lose trust in any government efforts, she said, adding she would never consider living in a shed. \u201cThey do not want the working class in Oakland any more.\u201d The city also said the sheds have served 200 people, and that out of 133 people who have left the sheds, 93 of them (70%) have gone into some form of housing. The city declined to comment on individual cases, but said that people are removed if they violate rules prohibiting violence, weapons, drug sales and other activities. DeVries said the program gives people \u201cmultiple chances\u201d if there are problems, and that officials don\u2019t toss people\u2019s belongings and will give them tents and other supports after they are kicked out. He said some voluntarily move out: \u201cWe do lose people who aren\u2019t ready. I\u2019ve been heartbroken about a couple people.\u201d Alone on the street Clark\u2019s son, a 32-year-old teacher in Oakland who asked not to be identified, said his removal from the sheds made his father deflated and angry in a way he hadn\u2019t seen before. It was hard to even think about him forced back on the street: \u201cHonestly, I was just kinda numb myself. It\u2019s not easy to see him like that. There is so much potential lost.\u201d It was especially painful since the sheds initially seemed to be a positive force in his father\u2019s life, the son said: \u201cIn retrospect, it may have been better if he never went.\u201d These days, Clark spends many hours in his car with his energetic pitbulls, Pree and Shay, hanging out in the front seats. He often passes the time by playing Total War, a strategy game on his computer that takes his mind off everything else. Clark would love to get back into trucking, but if the city doesn\u2019t help him get a roof over his head, he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll turn things around. \u201cIf I had a place,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019d be a lot easier to start.\u201d",

The bill \u2013 introduced by the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, in October \u2013 makes minor changes to the regulatory scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals to provide simpler processes for chemicals of low concern.

On Monday Littleproud promised a $5m recovery package and review of the Murray-Darling River crisis. In May the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg wrote an opinion piece trumpeting the appointment of a threatened species commissioner.

Available water is distributed to users via water rights administered by the basin states, and the total amount is capped. The rights can be traded in the water market and the government can also buy back entitlements for environmental flows. There are two main types: water entitlements that give rights to an ongoing share of the total amount of water available in a river system and water allocations that are for an actual amount of water available under water access entitlements in a given season.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the key water efficiency systems? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has shifted focus towards funding projects that result in more efficient use of water, such as reducing evaporation by covering irrigation channels, encouraging crop varieties that need less water, and removing human-made structures that impede water reaching wetlands.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are environmental water flows? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder manages water purchased for the environment.

      "bodyText": "The Murray Darling Basin Authority shelved its native fish strategy six years ago and ended its sustainable rivers audit program after New South Wales pulled 60% of its funding from a basinwide program to monitor the health of fish in the river. For 10 years the MDBA made much of its fish strategy, releasing a glossy brochure that claimed the strategy required a \u201csustained commitment\u201d of 50 years in order to rehabilitate native fish in the river. It announced a goal of \u201crestoring native fish stocks to 60% of its pre-European levels.\u201d But in 2013 it was shelved. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The federal minister for water, David Littleproud, has just announced a new fish recovery strategy in response to a fish kill that has seen up to 1 million die at Menindee on the Lower Darling River, including 70-year-old Murray cod and hundreds of thousands of perch. The NSW opposition has announced it will set up a special commission of inquiry \u2013 equivalent to a royal commission \u2013 to investigate the environmental catastrophe at Menindee. The NSW and federal governments continue to blame the drought for the crisis but multiple documents suggest the fish kill in the Darling River is also due to policy choices by the NSW government and the MDBA. In 2013, after a critical article in the Deniliquin Times, the MDBA fired off a release saying that the cuts to the fish strategy program \u201cwere made by the NSW state government, not the MDBA.\u201d \u201cLast year, the NSW state government cut 60% of its share of funding for the joint management of the River Murray system,\u201d the MDBA said. \u201cHistorically, all the basin governments have pitched in and shared this funding and the MDBA, as \u2018the agent\u2019, has managed the river, maintained the dams, locks and weirs and managed the NRM [natural resource management] programs on behalf of all six governments. \u201cAfter the NSW state government cut its funding, the basin governments made the decision to cut the native fish strategy and the sustainable rivers audit, and delayed maintenance programs,\u201d it said. The end to the fish strategy has deprived federal and state authorities of crucial information to manage the Murray-Darling and its fish stocks. A Menindee Lakes expert, Dr Richard Kingsford, from the University of NSW said environmental outcomes had taken a back seat to water management. \u201cThese are complex systems and our knowledge of them only scratches the surface,\u201d he said. The Menindee Lakes are important breeding grounds for golden perch throughout the river. Yet the lake has been increasingly managed as a water storage, with little regard for the impacts on the fish stocks. Asked about the cancelled fish strategy, the MDBA said parts of the strategy had been taken over by other arms of the authority. In 2012 Katrina Hodgkinson, then NSW agriculture minister, put in place the Barwon Darling water-sharing plan. The plan has been heavily criticised by downstream farms, environmental groups, Indigenous groups and scientists. The circumstances around its formation, in which cotton interests pushed for late amendments after the public consultation period, is now believed to be under investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. A submission on the Barwon Darling water-sharing plan by the fisheries division of the NSW Department of Primary Industry warned of \u201cinadequate protection for threatened species of fish within the endangered aquatic ecological community\u201d and advised there should be amendments to protect low flows. The NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, has claimed his predecessor addressed these concerns in the final plan but the state opposition leader, Michael Daley, said the fish deaths of last week showed that the plan remained inadequate to protect the environment. He has promised a commission of inquiry if he wins the state election in March. The Australia Institute said its research has shown that the Lower Darling and Menindee Lakes had been mismanaged by many over a long period of time. \u201cApproximately two Sydney Harbours worth of water has been taken out of the region in the last two years,\u201d said research director, Rod Campbell. \u201cRepeated policy failure in the management of the Lower Darling and Menindee Lakes has implications for major projects, irrigation and the environment throughout the basin. \u201cThe hundreds of thousands of fish like the Murray cod have been sacrificed for interests elsewhere. The Australian public deserve an open account of how we have gotten to this point and the proposed inquiry is a good start. \u201cThe river of dead fish is symbolic of the death of public trust in the management of the Murray-Darling basin plan.\u201d",

That same month, the Met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/youtube-deletes-30-music-videos-after-met-link-with-gang-violence\">announced that it had successfully lobbied YouTube</a> to remove 30 rap videos because of their violent content.

The marginal status of the working-class black boys and young men who make drill means there has been little high-profile opposition to the Met\u2019s new experiments in censorship.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are deeper problems going on in the communities, and until those problems are solved, the violence is going to keep going on,\u201d the south London drill rapper AM said when I spoke to him in 2018.</p> \n<p>He pointed to the longstanding causes of gang crime and violence in working-class areas in London. For him, drill was finally documenting some brutal realities that had been ignored for too long: it was an act of catharsis and a cry for help as much as anything.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe media, the government \u2013 the people at the top \u2013 they don\u2019t want public attention on those negative externalities of the economy, they don\u2019t want people to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the public can see those problems right now, because drill music is drawing attention to it. Their attitude is, \u2018If we can shut down the music, everyone will feel safer\u2019, but that doesn\u2019t mean [the violence] is not going to still go on.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It is easy to forget, with Brexit dominating the headlines and the Olympic summer of 2012 held up as the \u201cgood times\u201d, that only one year before the Olympics the city was ablaze. Though the rioting and looting of early August 2011 began in north London, it quickly spread south: Camberwell saw similar scenes, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-spread-second-night\">a fight broke out in King\u2019s College hospital</a> between rival gangs visiting stabbing victims.</p> \n<p>It is striking how much the London riots have been erased from political memory, especially as the marginalisation of the poor neighbourhoods where the riots took place has only intensified since. Austerity and gentrification have stretched the longstanding inequality between London\u2019s rich and poor to grim new extremes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>To keep cutting youth services after the London riots in 2011 is wrong.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHe was a bit of a challenging boy, but there was a nice side to him,\u201d says Andy Walker, founder of Southside Young Leaders\u2019 Academy in Camberwell, south London, of Latwaan Griffiths. Griffiths joined Southside when he was seven years old; 11 years later he was dead \u2013 the 16th teenager, and 88th person, murdered in London last year. He was seen slumped while riding pillion on the back of a moped as it careered down Denmark Road, just streets away from Southside. After he slipped off at a junction, passersby heard the driver shout \u201cHelp him, he\u2019s been stabbed\u201d before speeding off. Residents emerged from their homes and attempted CPR, but Griffiths could not be saved. The teenager was \u201cjokey and lively\u201d but didn\u2019t do well in school, recalls Walker. \u201cQuite what happened after he left Southside, I don\u2019t know. There are more and more families grieving: I went to his funeral, there was a crowd of 200 people there, and the message that came out loud and clear was \u2018This community is suffering\u2019.\u201d A week after Griffiths was killed, his friend Siddique Kamara, 23, was found stabbed to death 10 minutes\u2019 walk away on Warham Street. Another of their friends, 17-year-old Rhyhiem Barton, had been found shot dead on the exact same street in May. Violent crime is a constant in any big city, and crime statistics can be misleading shorn of context or recording methods. But as London approaches megacity status (its population is projected to pass 10 million in 2027), pressure on resources is increasing, as are certain types of violent crime. Last year was a grim one for the city: 135 people were murdered, which, although well short of of the 221 murders recorded in 2003, was the highest murder rate in a decade. Knife crime in particular is up. After 18 murders were recorded in February alone, London\u2019s murder rate briefly eclipsed that of New York City. The US president, Donald Trump, declared London was \u201cas bad as a military war zone hospital\u201d. He mimed stabbing someone. \u201cKnives, knives, knives, knives,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLondon hasn\u2019t been used to that. They\u2019re getting used to it. It\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d (He said nothing when New York\u2019s murder rate once again overtook London\u2019s.) Clockwise from top: Siddique Kamara, Latwaan Griffiths and Rhyhiem Barton. Much of the media coverage of the deaths of Griffiths, Kamara and Barton zeroed in on one thing they had in common. Griffiths was a member of the drill rap group Harlem Spartans, performing as SA, or Splash Addict (\u201csplashing\u201d is slang for stabbing). Barton and Kamara were members of an allied drill group, Moscow17, based a five-minute walk away. Drill music was barely familiar even to most music journalists a year ago. For the last 12 months it has dominated headlines. News bulletins, politicians, judges and senior police officers condemned it for inciting youth violence: \u201cthe brutal rap that fuels gang murder\u201d, said a headline in the Spectator; \u201cdisturbing\u201d, said the Daily Mail; the Times called it \u201cdemonic\u201d. In May, the chief of the Metropolitan police, Cressida Dick, condemned \u201cgangs who make drill videos\u201d with \u201clyrics which are about glamorising violence, serious violence \u2013 murder, stabbings\u201d, and said social media companies had a \u201csocial responsibility\u201d to stop this virus spreading. That same month, the Met announced that it had successfully lobbied YouTube to remove 30 rap videos because of their violent content. The police continue to maintain and forensically scrutinise a database of thousands of music videos and YouTube comments for clues about the groups who make drill music: their changing local alliances, tensions and threats to kill. Three days after Barton\u2019s death in May, his grieving friends and family marched in his memory from Camberwell through to neighbouring Peckham. Some of the younger marchers chanted the lyrics to Moscow17\u2019s anthem Moscow March, a track on which Barton raps about \u201cchinging\u201d, \u201cblading\u201d, \u201cdrenching\u201d and \u201cslashing\u201d his enemy, the rival Peckham drill crew Zone 2. It is those highly specific references to hyper-local, real-world violence that marks drill out from its predecessors. In addition to the routine removal of drill videos from YouTube, with no oversight or right of reply, the Met and the Crown Prosecution Service have taken to issuing criminal behaviour orders to drill musicians: these extra-judicial instruments ban rappers from mentioning particular rival neighbourhoods or individuals in their songs. The threats make it harder for liberal voices to defend the genre, and in 2018 drill became London\u2019s new bete noire, to match historical moral panics over video nasties and 90s gangster rap. Pretana Morgan, Rhyhiem Barton\u2019s mother, walks with her daughter at the start of a solidarity march in May 2018. And yet the scapegoating of the genre has come at the expense of any concerted attempt to address the myriad problems at the roots of the violence. The marginal status of the working-class black boys and young men who make drill means there has been little high-profile opposition to the Met\u2019s new experiments in censorship. \u201cThere are deeper problems going on in the communities, and until those problems are solved, the violence is going to keep going on,\u201d the south London drill rapper AM said when I spoke to him in 2018. He pointed to the longstanding causes of gang crime and violence in working-class areas in London. For him, drill was finally documenting some brutal realities that had been ignored for too long: it was an act of catharsis and a cry for help as much as anything. \u201cThe media, the government \u2013 the people at the top \u2013 they don\u2019t want public attention on those negative externalities of the economy, they don\u2019t want people to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the public can see those problems right now, because drill music is drawing attention to it. Their attitude is, \u2018If we can shut down the music, everyone will feel safer\u2019, but that doesn\u2019t mean [the violence] is not going to still go on.\u201d * * * It is easy to forget, with Brexit dominating the headlines and the Olympic summer of 2012 held up as the \u201cgood times\u201d, that only one year before the Olympics the city was ablaze. Though the rioting and looting of early August 2011 began in north London, it quickly spread south: Camberwell saw similar scenes, and a fight broke out in King\u2019s College hospital between rival gangs visiting stabbing victims. It is striking how much the London riots have been erased from political memory, especially as the marginalisation of the poor neighbourhoods where the riots took place has only intensified since. Austerity and gentrification have stretched the longstanding inequality between London\u2019s rich and poor to grim new extremes. \u201cWhen you think there were riots in 2011, to keep cutting youth services after that is just obviously going to be wrong,\u201d says the Green London assembly member Sian Berry. \u201cThe underlying causes of the riots have not been addressed at all. Especially in work and housing, things have actually got a lot worse.\u201d The city has transformed at a bewildering rate in those eight years. Even Brexit fears have only dampened London house prices a bit, and have done little to halt gentrification. A two-bedroom flat in a new-build block on Denmark Road, where Griffiths died, goes for \u00a3600,000, more than double the national average price of a home \u2013 despite the fact that the section of the Herne Hill ward in which it sits, alongside the Thorlands and Lilford estates, ranks in the highest 10% for deprivation in the country. When you Google those estates, the first photo that comes up is of a wall covered with black mould. In nearby Elephant and Castle, Southwark council has joined forces with two of the world\u2019s biggest property developers, Lendlease and Delancey, to demolish the Heygate and Aylesbury estates and Elephant\u2019s \u201ctown centre\u201d to make way for luxury flats, sending working-class and ethnic minority communities scattering to the outer zones of London. Along the river to the west, a \u201cmajor new cultural quarter\u201d is promised in Vauxhall and Nine Elms \u2013 perhaps most effectively symbolised by the 50-storey St George Wharf Tower, home to 214 flats costing up to \u00a351m, not one of them qualifying as the government\u2019s definition of \u201caffordable\u201d (which itself is only 80% of market rate), and where most of the lights are never on. St George Wharf Tower at night in 2016. In the \u201cpretty new blocks\u201d described by the Harlem Spartans rapper Bis, out of 11,863 new homes in Southwark, only 456 (3.8%) were made available at social rent, according to the 35% Campaign, despite the fact that Southwark council\u2019s own planning guidelines stipulate that 35% of new homes should be affordable. This is the world the violence came from: council estates rendered fortresses of poverty and social problems, where so-called postcode wars break out between groups of young people \u201ccaught slipping\u201d outside of their turf, against the backdrop of pretty new apartment blocks and branches of Le Pain Quotidien. Southside Young Leaders\u2019 Academy (Syla) was set up in Camberwell in 2007 by Andy Walker, a TV producer. The intention, then as now, was to pre-empt trouble between groups of young boys and men rather than trying to mop it up afterwards. \u201cThe thing that has really changed in the last decade is the level of security,\u201d Walker says of the state of the city at the beginning of 2019. \u201cIt has really deteriorated for young people in London. I don\u2019t think kids feared to cross from one neighbourhood to another \u2013 not in the same way they do now.\u201d The degradation of the safety net has made matters worse. It has been a decade of ever more severe bureaucratisation and privatisation \u2013 and, above all, of harsh cuts to youth services. \u201cEverybody\u2019s struggling now,\u201d says Walker. Syla provides mentorship and training to boys who are facing difficulties at school, helping them to acquire leadership qualities, self-discipline and practical skills in the hope of stemming a drift towards social exclusion \u2013 but there\u2019s no money. \u201cWe\u2019ve replaced what state-funded youth clubs used to do,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re having to fight for every penny. We get no government grant, or council grant.\u201d Instead, he chases short-term funds from groups such as Comic Relief or the Big Lottery, which have huge demands on them already and often have specific ideas about how the money should be spent. \u201cThe danger is you are pushed into doing the very specific work and programmes that the funders want you to do, and want to pay for,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are very few funds that say, \u2018Look, here\u2019s the money, we approve of what you\u2019re doing, get on with it.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe gentrification of the area means you can get a nice cup of coffee, and that\u2019s nice, but I doubt any of our young people have been in any of the fancy new businesses here,\u201d says Katie Worthington, who runs the Westminster House Youth Club in nearby Nunhead. \u201cThey\u2019re excluded from classes at other centres aimed at the middle-class kids, which cost \u00a37 or \u00a38 a pop.\u201d As we speak, a troupe of kids from the after-school homework club file past us \u2013 and past a substantial food bank collection, piled up on the pool table \u2013 for the evening\u2019s \u201creward\u201d activity: dodgeball in a small sports hall. Many of the families of the members have been uprooted from private rented accommodation when landlords decided to sell, and told to leave London entirely because there\u2019s no affordable housing nearby. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like a citizen of your own city: it\u2019s all so prohibitively expensive,\u201d Worthington says. \u201cWhy would you feel like a Londoner if you\u2019re excluded from all this?\u201d The Westminster House Youth Club. Several people told me that good youth workers were being driven away from the profession altogether by the lack of funding and sustainable employment. Now, with data showing the highest proportion of teen stabbings takes place in the two hours after school finishes, some media attention has finally turned to the drastic cuts to youth work provision in the capital. Since the riots, London has seen 81 youth clubs close, and a 44% cut to the youth service budget at council level, following austerity measures handed down from central government. \u201cYouth clubs are not a panacea,\u201d says Sian Berry, who published the 2018 report that highlighted those cuts. \u201cBut they save a lot of young people from getting into trouble \u2013 and they also help others to thrive. It gives them new horizons, makes them feel like they\u2019re worth investing in \u2013 all those things that create disaffection and alienation when they\u2019re suddenly not there any more.\u201d She wants something done about London\u2019s extraordinarily high levels of rent (consistently the highest in Europe), including rent control, and about the badly paid jobs and zero-hours contracts that further drive young people towards petty crime, selling drugs, and, by extension, violence. \u201cYou can see how for a poor teenager, watching their older siblings and parents struggling with work and rent, the money pulled in by drug-dealing, organised criminals might be tempting,\u201d she says. Above all, Berry wants money for youth services ringfenced from central government, and the cuts reversed. \u201cIt\u2019s not an add-on, it\u2019s not a bonus, it\u2019s not an emergency service,\u201d she says. \u201cAll this stuff about putting youth workers into A&amp;E \u2013 that\u2019s the last line of defence! That\u2019s not building up the resilience of young people from the start.\u201d * * * When the next iteration of the London Plan, a projection of London\u2019s future published by City Hall, comes out in 2019, most of its recommendations will be infrastructural, as usual. Major developments such as Crossrail and HS2 are uppermost in the planners\u2019 minds, along with ideas to support environmental sustainability and attracting investment through boosting London\u2019s enterprise and skills \u2013 a particular concern given the uncertainty of Brexit. As ever, the challenge for the mayor\u2019s office will be to do what it can within its own budget. Westminster holds most of the purse strings and continues to fret over Brexit. Regardless, City Hall is working to a 20- to 25-year forecast; the problems of youth violence and social exclusion need addressing rather more rapidly. Among the 81 youth clubs that have shuttered since 2011 is Grove Park in Lewisham, south-east London, which closed in 2013 when the local council implemented central government cuts that have slashed 34% (almost \u00a31.5m) from its youth services budget since 2011. Another \u00a3200,000 will go in this year\u2019s budget. (Neighbouring Southwark and Lambeth have experienced cuts of more than 50%.) Property developers swooped in with plans to knock it down and build new flats. \u201cIt was built in 1966, and it\u2019s served the community for almost five decades,\u201d says Rob Clayton, chairman of the youth centre\u2019s building preservation trust, which has been campaigning to get it reopened since 2015. \u201cNobody wants it demolished. All the locals are saying there\u2019s a need for a youth club here \u2013 but all of a sudden it was gone, and the Labour MP Heidi Alexander was standing there, next to property developers, giving the local community this \u2018There\u2019s no magic money tree\u2019 type of lecture.\u201d Clayton refused to give up, helping organise tireless voluntary campaigning by the community, from public meetings and lobbying the council to working with architects and establishing its importance as a Bauhaus-inspired building. He and his fellow campaigners fitted the work around full-time jobs. \u201cI put in about 40 hours a month on this,\u201d he says. \u201cI come from a working-class background, grew up on a council estate, and I\u2019m not massive about youth clubs \u2013 but it\u2019s just the general fabric of our society being broken down and asset-stripped. And I thought if I can\u2019t do something nationally, I can do something on my doorstep.\u201d The building was saved from demolition in August 2017. The party was attended by Alexander\u2019s replacement as local MP, Janet Daby, who has been much more supportive, and although a lot of work remains to get the centre open again, it felt like something of a turning point, Clayton says. \u201cIt was just fantastic seeing the building come to life again that day, after all those years closed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had singers, rap artists, dancers, someone cooking jerk chicken \u2013 it was a sunny day and it was just a wonderful atmosphere. It was a taste of the future, and what we\u2019re trying to get back. \u201cAnd I think some of the local politicians have realised it\u2019s not a good look closing youth clubs while young people are killing each other right, left and centre.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",

His films rival those of the controversial New York nebbish for their persistence of focus, as they routinely unpick male-female desire and miscommunication, usually with extended sidebars on cinema (bumbling alter-ego film-makers are frequently his protagonists), and the inebriating wonders of Korea\u2019s favourite drink, that fiercely clear spirit, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/dec/02/soju-popular-booze-world-south-korea\" title=\"\">soju</a></em>.</p> <p>Packed with variations and idiosyncrasies beyond these wry trademarks, it\u2019s an oeuvre that has become one of the most prolific and distinctive on the international festival circuit, winning Hong the fandom of such industry royals as Claire Denis and Isabelle Huppert, yet it\u2019s a taste that Britons have had precious little opportunity to acquire. No matter how many major prizes his works rack up, UK distributors remain largely resistant to their charms, leaving the Hong-curious to discover him via rare specialist DVD releases and one-off repertory screenings. Film-maker Charlie Lyne\u2019s series of \u201cHong Nights\u201d \u2013 cramming as many fans as can fit in his compact London flat for small-screen showings \u2013 have become something of an institution in the city\u2019s cinephile community.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxZCkrds-8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/baxZCkrds-8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxZCkrds-8\">Watch the trailer for Nobody\u2019s Daughter Haewon.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lyne won\u2019t be the only one pleased, then, that curated arthouse streaming service <a href=\"https://mubi.com/showing\" title=\"\">Mubi.com</a> is launching a Hong Sang-soo mini-retrospective this month, kicking off on Monday with his 2013 film <em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/nobodys-daughter-haewon\" title=\"\">Nobody\u2019s Daughter Haewon</a></em> \u2013 a tender, diary-style portrait of a young film student coping with her mother\u2019s emigration from Seoul to Canada. On the gentler end of Hong\u2019s melancholic spectrum, it\u2019s his only film to ever have received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/13/nobodys-daughter-review-hong-sangsoo\" title=\"\">cinema release in the UK</a> \u2013 albeit a pretty marginal one, so don\u2019t berate yourself for blinking and missing it.</p> <p>Mubi\u2019s other five selections, however, have never enjoyed distribution here, and they include some of Hong\u2019s greatest and most warmly accessible films. 2015\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/right-now-wrong-then\" title=\"\">Right Now, Wrong Then</a></em> (hitting the platform on 21 January) may well be his masterpiece. Winner of the Locarno festival\u2019s <a href=\"https://variety.com/2015/film/awards/hong-sang-soo-right-now-wrong-then-takes-top-honors-at-locarno-1201570974/\" title=\"\">top prize</a>, it\u2019s an ingeniously bisected foiled-romance study, playing out the same brief Suwon encounter between a visiting film-maker and a young local painter twice, the minor variations in each version rich with rueful philosophical implication.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/yourself-and-yours\" title=\"\">Yourself and Yours</a></em> (29 January) and <em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/the-day-after-2017\" title=\"\">The Day After</a></em> (18 February) are more minor works, both puckish variations on the breakup drama. The former, adding doppelganger fun and games to the usual Hong stew, is perhaps more novice-friendly than the latter, which, despite cracking the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/22/the-day-after-review-hong-sang-soo-kim-min-hee-cannes-2017\" title=\"\">Cannes competition</a>, is a slight, shrill chamber piece for completists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"014cc732c0edcd22412a42e20bebcd61dde1a886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/014cc732c0edcd22412a42e20bebcd61dde1a886/314_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Min-hee and Isabelle Huppert in Claire\u2019s Camera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Min-hee and Isabelle Huppert in Claire\u2019s Camera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mubi\u2019s other two selections, however, are entirely delicious, both glowing showcases for the brilliant Korean actress (and the director\u2019s current partner) Kim Min-hee, whom the uninitiated may recognize from Park Chan-wook\u2019s <em>The Handmaiden</em>. She deservedly won best actress at Berlin two years ago for <em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/on-the-beach-at-night-alone\" title=\"\">On the Beach at Night Alone</a></em> (6 February), his most nuanced and penetrating female character study. Crisply folded, like <em>Right Now, Wrong Then</em>, into two ambiguously corresponding parts, it tracks a young actress\u2019s slow recovery from a troubled love affair with doleful wit and wrenching emotional acuity \u2013 exquisitely played by Kim.</p> <p>She\u2019s a sweeter delight opposite Huppert in <em><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/claire-s-camera\" title=\"\">Claire\u2019s Camera</a></em> (12 February), perhaps Hong\u2019s easiest, breeziest, most purely pleasurable film.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-three years and 23 films into his career, the South Korean writer-director Hong Sang-soo has been dubbed the \u201cKorean Woody Allen\u201d in certain world cinema quarters, and not just for the remarkable frequency of his output. His films rival those of the controversial New York nebbish for their persistence of focus, as they routinely unpick male-female desire and miscommunication, usually with extended sidebars on cinema (bumbling alter-ego film-makers are frequently his protagonists), and the inebriating wonders of Korea\u2019s favourite drink, that fiercely clear spirit, soju. Packed with variations and idiosyncrasies beyond these wry trademarks, it\u2019s an oeuvre that has become one of the most prolific and distinctive on the international festival circuit, winning Hong the fandom of such industry royals as Claire Denis and Isabelle Huppert, yet it\u2019s a taste that Britons have had precious little opportunity to acquire. No matter how many major prizes his works rack up, UK distributors remain largely resistant to their charms, leaving the Hong-curious to discover him via rare specialist DVD releases and one-off repertory screenings. Film-maker Charlie Lyne\u2019s series of \u201cHong Nights\u201d \u2013 cramming as many fans as can fit in his compact London flat for small-screen showings \u2013 have become something of an institution in the city\u2019s cinephile community. Lyne won\u2019t be the only one pleased, then, that curated arthouse streaming service Mubi.com is launching a Hong Sang-soo mini-retrospective this month, kicking off on Monday with his 2013 film Nobody\u2019s Daughter Haewon \u2013 a tender, diary-style portrait of a young film student coping with her mother\u2019s emigration from Seoul to Canada. On the gentler end of Hong\u2019s melancholic spectrum, it\u2019s his only film to ever have received a cinema release in the UK \u2013 albeit a pretty marginal one, so don\u2019t berate yourself for blinking and missing it. Mubi\u2019s other five selections, however, have never enjoyed distribution here, and they include some of Hong\u2019s greatest and most warmly accessible films. 2015\u2019s Right Now, Wrong Then (hitting the platform on 21 January) may well be his masterpiece. Winner of the Locarno festival\u2019s top prize, it\u2019s an ingeniously bisected foiled-romance study, playing out the same brief Suwon encounter between a visiting film-maker and a young local painter twice, the minor variations in each version rich with rueful philosophical implication. Yourself and Yours (29 January) and The Day After (18 February) are more minor works, both puckish variations on the breakup drama. The former, adding doppelganger fun and games to the usual Hong stew, is perhaps more novice-friendly than the latter, which, despite cracking the 2017 Cannes competition, is a slight, shrill chamber piece for completists. Mubi\u2019s other two selections, however, are entirely delicious, both glowing showcases for the brilliant Korean actress (and the director\u2019s current partner) Kim Min-hee, whom the uninitiated may recognize from Park Chan-wook\u2019s The Handmaiden. She deservedly won best actress at Berlin two years ago for On the Beach at Night Alone (6 February), his most nuanced and penetrating female character study. Crisply folded, like Right Now, Wrong Then, into two ambiguously corresponding parts, it tracks a young actress\u2019s slow recovery from a troubled love affair with doleful wit and wrenching emotional acuity \u2013 exquisitely played by Kim. She\u2019s a sweeter delight opposite Huppert in Claire\u2019s Camera (12 February), perhaps Hong\u2019s easiest, breeziest, most purely pleasurable film. Starring as kindred spirits at a loose end on the fringes of the Cannes film festival, the two actors\u2019 lovely rapport exemplifies how Hong\u2019s mellow but subtly razor-edged artistry has carried over into a wider realm of world cinema. Mubi\u2019s highly welcome showcase at last lets Britain into the party. Crack open the soju. New to streaming and DVD this week American Animals (Sony, 15) Bart Layton\u2019s first film since 2012\u2019s hit hybrid doc The Imposter breaks new ground in fusing narrative storytelling with documentary technique. The result is a riveting college-boy heist movie. The Little Stranger (Path\u00e9, 12) Unfairly buried in cinemas, Lenny Abrahamson\u2019s low-key follow-up to Room is a sensitive, shivery adaptation of Sarah Waters\u2019s Booker-shortlisted ghost story, with Ruth Wilson the pick of a classy ensemble. Under the Tree (Eureka, 15) Nextdoor neighbour disputes have long been ripe material for farce, but rarely to quite such cruelly comic effect as in this memorable Icelandic oddity, as bourgeois tensions go from passive to wildly aggressive. Dogman (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) Gomorrah director Matteo Garrone\u2019s latest atmospheric dive into the dingy Italian underworld chronicles a meek criminal lackey\u2019s act of revenge.

      "body": "<h2>Why have batteries become important?</h2> <p>In a world increasingly anxious about climate change, the surge in the generation of renewable energy over the past 20 years offers a sliver of hope. But the variable nature of wind and solar power means that storing energy until consumers need it has become the next big challenge. And so, large-scale battery installations are springing up across electricity grids around the world, to make them more flexible. In 2017, more than 1GW of power storage capacity was added around the world \u2013 a record, yes, but still a drop in the ocean of global energy demand.</p> <h2>How do batteries like this work?</h2> <p>Of course, we are not talking about a few AAA batteries here. And yet, all batteries broadly work in a similar manner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/battery-zip/giv-39023vsJlry2fWWF\" data-alt=\"how\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/battery-zip/giv-39023vsJlry2fWWF\">how</a> </figure>  <p>Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy when you charge a battery, and then the process is reversed when you draw power from it.</p> <p>There are three main constituents of most batteries: two electrodes and some form of chemical medium called the electrolyte, which can be a liquid, gel or solid. To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode.</p> <p>When you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode.</p> <h2>So how many of these big batteries are there?</h2> <p>There is around 500MW of large-scale battery power installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion.</p> <p>Globally installed power is expected to top 50GW by 2020 \u2013 and surge to almost 1,000GW by 2040, according to <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-storage-620-billion-investment-opportunity-2040/\">Bloomberg NEF</a>. That would equate to about 7% of the world\u2019s energy capacity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T12:48:17/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-09T12:48:17/embed.html\">Chart</a> </figure>  <h2>How do batteries fit in to the renewables revolution?</h2> <p>In the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such <a href=\"https://www.nationalgrideso.com/balancing-services\">ancillary services</a> are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online.</p> <p>There are also the beginnings of \u201chybrid\u201d renewable energy power plants, where batteries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/summer-green-energy-national-grid-carbon-emissions-solar-uk\">installed alongside solar farms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.equinor.com/en/news/26june2018-equinor-has-installed-batwind.html\">windfarms</a>. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices.</p> <p>In other parts of the world, such as South Australia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/27/south-australias-tesla-battery-on-track-to-make-back-a-third-of-cost-in-a-year\">batteries are being used</a> to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage \u2013 that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e33411451fc31d391ce9aee0ad4455441c2d2ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e33411451fc31d391ce9aee0ad4455441c2d2ac/0_55_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gyle Premier Inn at Edinburgh Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gyle Premier Inn at Edinburgh Park was the first in the UK to be battery-powered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Premier Inn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Will we all have big household batteries in the future?</h2> <p>Elon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/01/tesla-announces-low-cost-solar-batteries-elon-musk\">when he unveiled Tesla\u2019s version three years ago</a>, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid.</p> <p>The German firm Sonnen, which has around a 25% global market share in home batteries, said most customers today are people who have solar panels or live in storm-hit regions and want a clean, reliable backup source of power. \u201cThe market is still in the very, very early phase,\u201d says the chief executive, Christoph Ostermann. Germany, Italy, Australia and the US states of California and Hawaii are the biggest markets so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/batteries/embed.html\" data-alt=\"fact box 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/batteries/embed.html\">fact box 1</a> </figure>  <p>For solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing.</p> <p>However, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d. He describes this as an \u201cUberisation\u201d of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. \u201cWe are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>What\u2019s next for electric cars?</h2> <p>We are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Inc.

More than 60% world\u2019s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/12/phone-misery-children-congo-cobalt-mines-drc\">concerns have been raised</a> about the social and environmental impact of mining the metal.</p> <p>The lithium in the batteries comes mainly from three big producer countries, Australia, Argentina and Chile, along with emerging producers such as Bolivia, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe.

Large companies are going to be driven by cost,\u201d says Shearing, of cobalt and lithium production.</p> <p>What happens to the batteries towards the end of their life is also a big challenge. Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, of the school of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham, is worried about the fate of batteries when their performance in today\u2019s crop of electric vehicles is no longer good enough for cars.

      "bodyText": "Why have batteries become important? In a world increasingly anxious about climate change, the surge in the generation of renewable energy over the past 20 years offers a sliver of hope. But the variable nature of wind and solar power means that storing energy until consumers need it has become the next big challenge. And so, large-scale battery installations are springing up across electricity grids around the world, to make them more flexible. In 2017, more than 1GW of power storage capacity was added around the world \u2013 a record, yes, but still a drop in the ocean of global energy demand. How do batteries like this work? Of course, we are not talking about a few AAA batteries here. And yet, all batteries broadly work in a similar manner. Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy when you charge a battery, and then the process is reversed when you draw power from it. There are three main constituents of most batteries: two electrodes and some form of chemical medium called the electrolyte, which can be a liquid, gel or solid. To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode. When you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode. So how many of these big batteries are there? There is around 500MW of large-scale battery power installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion. Globally installed power is expected to top 50GW by 2020 \u2013 and surge to almost 1,000GW by 2040, according to Bloomberg NEF. That would equate to about 7% of the world\u2019s energy capacity. How do batteries fit in to the renewables revolution? In the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such ancillary services are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online. There are also the beginnings of \u201chybrid\u201d renewable energy power plants, where batteries are installed alongside solar farms and windfarms. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices. In other parts of the world, such as South Australia, batteries are being used to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage \u2013 that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter. Will we all have big household batteries in the future? Elon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery when he unveiled Tesla\u2019s version three years ago, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid. The German firm Sonnen, which has around a 25% global market share in home batteries, said most customers today are people who have solar panels or live in storm-hit regions and want a clean, reliable backup source of power. \u201cThe market is still in the very, very early phase,\u201d says the chief executive, Christoph Ostermann. Germany, Italy, Australia and the US states of California and Hawaii are the biggest markets so far. For solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing. However, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d. He describes this as an \u201cUberisation\u201d of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. \u201cWe are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,\u201d he says. What\u2019s next for electric cars? We are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Inc. He views affordability and a decent range between charges as this crop\u2019s defining features. While the first models, with the exception of Tesla, could manage around 100 miles, most new ones now offer between 200-300 miles. \u201cI see the market starting to boom around 2020 or 2021, as there is more choice [of models],\u201d says Fisker. Fisker also views ultrafast charging as vital to helping electric cars go mainstream. While a typical home will take about 8-10 hours to fully top up a car (with a 3KW socket), some new public chargers can do that in about 10 minutes (using a 350KW charger). What about other modes of transport? Electric double-decker buses, built by the Chinese manufacturer BYD, already ply the streets of London. Elon Musk has announced plans for an electric truck. But the energy density required for heavy transport makes it a lot harder for batteries to beat fossil fuels. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more challenging,\u201d says Prof Paul Shearing, the Royal Academy of Engineering\u2019s chair in emerging battery technologies. \u201c[But] I think the future is going to be electric, no matter which way you cut it.\u201d Will we all be flying around in electric jumbo jets soon? \u201cNot yet,\u201d says Shearing, who adds that energy density and weight of batteries meant there would probably only be used in unmanned aerial vehicles in the short term. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a long time until we see an electric passenger plane,\u201d he says.

Safety was thrown into the spotlight when some of the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 developed a fault that caused them to short circuit and catch fire. When something disrupts the chemical reaction inside the battery, it can cause \u201cthermal runaway\u201d, where uncontrolled reactions chain together, generating too much heat, typically resulting in batteries bursting or catching fire. Various safety mechanisms, both electrical control circuits and physical measures including shielding and battery structure, mean such events are rare. But they are of particular concern for portable devices, which are often held on a person, and electric vehicles that may be involved in a collision that could damage the integrity of the battery. What next? Companies are working hard to increase the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery, and to bring down the cost of making them.

      "body": "<p>Britain is a horrible little country filled with incorrigible racists and led by incompetent bigots. That is the impression you get from the news, anyway. That it hates immigrants. That it is inward-looking, small-minded, intent on self-destruction. Some of that is true, of course. There is no denying that Britain is on the verge of a self-inflicted economic disaster and in the middle of an existential crisis. There is no denying the government has created a hostile environment for immigrants, and racism has been stoked by Brexit. But you know what? I am tired of constantly hearing about how intolerant the UK is. Because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Despite a small but vocal contingent who wish to take Britain backwards, the country is still one of the most progressive places in the world. While I live in New York now, I still think of the UK as \u201chome\u201d, and I am proud to be British. We may be facing bleak times, but, amid all the doom and gloom, it is important to remember that the UK is a diverse, liberal society that has plenty to be proud of. The likes of Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage may loudly claim to represent Britain and its values, but they don\u2019t. So, strap yourself in tightly, because we are about to embark on a whirlwind tour of Actually, That\u2019s Pretty Great Britain.</p> <p>Our first stop is the NHS. Obviously. According to the market <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/social-and-lifestyle/british-lifestyles-the-nhs-tops-list-of-uks-most-cherished-institutions\" title=\"\">research firm Mintel</a>, the NHS is the UK\u2019s most cherished institution, topping the list of \u201cBritish things\u201d Britons are most proud of. The NHS is far more than a healthcare provider \u2013 it\u2019s a symbol of fairness. Growing up with the NHS, I didn\u2019t fully understand how incredible it was; then I moved to the US, where healthcare isn\u2019t considered a human right and medicine is mercilessly privatised.</p> <p>Free museums are another thing I took for granted. It is amazing to be able to pop into a world-class museum without having to shell out a fortune, as you do in much of the US. There still seems to be a belief in the importance of public institutions in the UK. Not to mention orderly queues to get inside. And while we may joke about Britons and queueing, the stereotype represents another example of a concern for fairness.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Marmite. There is something special about a people who can get so excited about concentrated yeast extract. Marmite\u2019s popularity, I think, speaks to a charmingly British proclivity for self-loathing that binds the country stickily together.</p> <p>Another important emblem, I reckon, is In Our Time, the unapologetically intellectual Radio 4 series hosted by Melvyn Bragg. When it launched in 1998, Bragg didn\u2019t think a series where top academics had in-depth discussions about a single subject <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/mar/08/in-our-time-radio-4\" title=\"\">would last more than six months</a>. But it has run for more than 20 years. Two million listeners a week tune into hear about topics that range from free radicals to Agrippina the Younger or the emancipation of the serfs. In Our Time\u2019s popularity is a wonderful testament, I think, to Britain\u2019s intellectual curiosity. Proof that the country hasn\u2019t had enough of experts, as some politicians would have us believe.</p> <p>Finally, there is the British sense of humour. The country may be imploding, Brexit may have turned us into an international joke, but we can still laugh at ourselves. Despite everything, that is something to smile about.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain is a horrible little country filled with incorrigible racists and led by incompetent bigots. That is the impression you get from the news, anyway. That it hates immigrants. That it is inward-looking, small-minded, intent on self-destruction. Some of that is true, of course. There is no denying that Britain is on the verge of a self-inflicted economic disaster and in the middle of an existential crisis. There is no denying the government has created a hostile environment for immigrants, and racism has been stoked by Brexit. But you know what? I am tired of constantly hearing about how intolerant the UK is. Because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Despite a small but vocal contingent who wish to take Britain backwards, the country is still one of the most progressive places in the world. While I live in New York now, I still think of the UK as \u201chome\u201d, and I am proud to be British. We may be facing bleak times, but, amid all the doom and gloom, it is important to remember that the UK is a diverse, liberal society that has plenty to be proud of. The likes of Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage may loudly claim to represent Britain and its values, but they don\u2019t. So, strap yourself in tightly, because we are about to embark on a whirlwind tour of Actually, That\u2019s Pretty Great Britain. Our first stop is the NHS. Obviously. According to the market research firm Mintel, the NHS is the UK\u2019s most cherished institution, topping the list of \u201cBritish things\u201d Britons are most proud of. The NHS is far more than a healthcare provider \u2013 it\u2019s a symbol of fairness. Growing up with the NHS, I didn\u2019t fully understand how incredible it was; then I moved to the US, where healthcare isn\u2019t considered a human right and medicine is mercilessly privatised. Free museums are another thing I took for granted. It is amazing to be able to pop into a world-class museum without having to shell out a fortune, as you do in much of the US. There still seems to be a belief in the importance of public institutions in the UK. Not to mention orderly queues to get inside. And while we may joke about Britons and queueing, the stereotype represents another example of a concern for fairness. Then there\u2019s Marmite. There is something special about a people who can get so excited about concentrated yeast extract. Marmite\u2019s popularity, I think, speaks to a charmingly British proclivity for self-loathing that binds the country stickily together. Another important emblem, I reckon, is In Our Time, the unapologetically intellectual Radio 4 series hosted by Melvyn Bragg. When it launched in 1998, Bragg didn\u2019t think a series where top academics had in-depth discussions about a single subject would last more than six months. But it has run for more than 20 years. Two million listeners a week tune into hear about topics that range from free radicals to Agrippina the Younger or the emancipation of the serfs. In Our Time\u2019s popularity is a wonderful testament, I think, to Britain\u2019s intellectual curiosity. Proof that the country hasn\u2019t had enough of experts, as some politicians would have us believe. Finally, there is the British sense of humour. The country may be imploding, Brexit may have turned us into an international joke, but we can still laugh at ourselves. Despite everything, that is something to smile about.",

      "bodyText": "A public inquiry has refused to publish evidence that could shed light on an allegation that Michael Gove intervened in a child sexual abuse investigation. He has been accused of trying, during his time as education secretary, to find out about an investigation into a priest suspected of abusing a boy at a boarding school. The accusation has been made by two witnesses who have testified to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). The environment secretary has denied the allegation, saying it was inconceivable that he would have done so. IICSA has looked at the allegation, but said there was insufficient evidence to come to a conclusion about its veracity. The inquiry has refused a request from the Guardian to make public the evidence, such as witness statements that it had gathered about the allegation. It has published some of the evidence, but not all. In a statement, IICSA said : \u201cAll witness statements and evidence relied upon by the panel were published on the inquiry\u2019s website.\u201d Asked why some witness statements were published, and others were not, the inquiry said: \u201cEvidence which is not relevant is not used or published\u201d. Two lawyers representing child abuse survivors have called for Gove to testify in front of the inquiry to clear up the allegation. Tom Perry, founder of the Mandate Now pressure group, which calls for a law requiring staff in schools and elsewhere to report child abuse allegations, said the inquiry was underfunded, which restricts its ability to investigate allegations thoroughly. IICSA, which has had a chequered history, was set up in 2014 by the then home secretary Theresa May to examine claims that a range of institutions did not protect children from sexual abuse. It has held hearings about alleged sexual abuse in Catholic schools. One of the allegations concerned a priest, known as F65 as he has been granted anonymity, who had been accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old boy at Downside Abbey, a leading Catholic school in Somerset. At a public hearing in December 2017, Claire Winter, the deputy director of children\u2019s services responsible for children\u2019s social care at Somerset county council, told the inquiry that in 2010, F65 was under investigation. She said that F65 was to be suspended from active public ministry while the investigation continued. Winter described an incident that she said was \u201cvery unusual\u201d and unlike anything she had experienced. She described receiving two phone calls from the secretary of state for education and his office asking for the time at which the decision to suspend the priest was to be made. She said she refused to discuss it as it was a child protection matter. Her testimony was backed up by Jane Dziadulewicz , the then safeguarding official for the Clifton diocese, responsible for child protection in that region. She has said she helped produce a report for Gove\u2019s office on the progress of the Downside investigation following the calls. In January 2018, IICSA said it was requesting more evidence about the allegation concerning Gove. In August, in a wider report into child abuse at Downside and another Catholic boarding school, IICSA said: \u201cWe take the view that there is insufficient evidence on this point from which to draw any conclusions.\u201d The inquiry also refused to answer questions about how many people gave evidence about the allegation concerning Gove, how many witness statements were taken, and whether these statements were circulated to victims and others taking part in the inquiry. Winter is known to have made three statements, but the inquiry has only published one. One of Dziadulewicz\u2019s statements has been published, but the inquiry declined to say if she gave further evidence. In his one published witness statement, Gove said neither he nor members of his office had called Winter, adding that there are no official records of such calls. He added: \u201cI think it extraordinarily unlikely that I would have made such a call.

It is the fifth time the military junta, which took over in a bloodless coup in 2014, has delayed elections and prevented the country\u2019s return to democracy. Known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), it has repeatedly declared the country is \u201cnot ready\u201d for elections but the most recent delay has been attributed to concerns it would interfere with the upcoming coronation of the new king. Over the weekend about 200 demonstrators gathered at Bangkok\u2019s Ratchaprasong Intersection \u2013 the symbolic spot where dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in an army assault in 2010 \u2013 carrying banners demanding an election by next month, while smaller groups gathered in other cities across Thailand.

Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor of the Liverpool city region, said the jobs recovery had been kickstarted by Liverpool\u2019s European capital of culture year in 2008, adding: \u201cOur challenge as a combined authority is to build on that success, despite government austerity and the uncertainty of Brexit.\u201d Despite the gains in major urban areas blighted by deindustrialisation under Margaret Thatcher, rural areas and second-tier towns have failed to keep pace, in a reflection of the growing divide between metropolitan Britain and the rest of the country. Yorkshire, excluding its biggest cities, recorded a decline in its employment rate of 0.6 percentage points. About 2.7m jobs have been created since the financial crisis, outstripping many major European economies where unemployment rates remain high. However, questions have been raised over the type of work, with the growth in precarious employment on zero-hours contracts and in the gig economy. While the Resolution Foundation found that growing numbers of low-income households and disadvantaged groups had been helped into work, it warned that job insecurity had risen, in particular for younger workers. Half of all jobs growth since 2008 has come in professional occupations, although the share of 18- to 29-year-olds working in lower-paying roles has expanded over the last decade. Employment on zero-hours contracts and in agency work has also risen 50% faster for 18- to 29-year-olds than the rest of the population. There are still 780,000 workers in Britain without the guarantee of fixed hours, a further 950,000 agency workers, while one in seven worker are self-employed. All these more precarious working roles are significantly above pre-crisis levels. Average wages remain around \u00a325 below the peak recorded before the financial crisis, following a \u201clost decade\u201d of pay growth for British workers. Contrary to the arguments of some Brexiters, the report suggests that migrants have not displaced British workers. While migrants have accounted for about two-thirds of the rise in employment, the employment rate of people born in the UK has risen by more than 2 percentage points to a record high of 75.8%. Almost two-thirds of the jobs growth since 2008 has gone to those on the bottom-half of the pay ladder, while workers with low qualifications account for almost half of the growth in employment. Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile the jobs surge has not been as dominated by London or low-paid work as some claim, new challenges have developed \u2013 particularly for younger workers and with a big rise in insecure work. \u201cWhile more people are working, as a country we are still earning less each week for doing so than we were 10 years ago.\u201d Alok Sharma, the employment minister, said: \u201cAll this is very good news but we are not complacent and are taking further action to increase employment rates for under-represented groups by developing innovative support programmes.\u201d",

A play inspired by Virginia draws out what it was like having to tell her mom what happened.</p> <p>Stoynoff\u2019s play, co-written with the playwright Melissa Li, is a retelling of her original experience at Mar-a-Lago. Another looks at women who have yet to come forward. And a play inspired by Jessica Leeds, who reported in 2016 that Trump groped her on an airplane more than three decades ago, centers on an interview with Megyn Kelly in which the host repeatedly questions her political motivations. \u201cThe impression I had afterwards was like a bucket of cold water,\u201d Leeds said. \u201cI know it was quick and her job is to entertain her audience and whatnot but it was one of these occasions where I did not feel very comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Another play inspired by Rachel Crooks, who publicly described being forcibly kissed by Trump in her early 20s, explores Crooks\u2019s shifting perspective as she progressed from the 22-year-old employee in Trump Tower to the woman she is today, a spin that recasts Crooks\u2019s story as less about Trump and more about growth.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly get annoyed with being referenced as \u2018the Trump accuser\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s not what I want to be known for in my life. But at the same time it allowed me to have a voice that ultimately did lead to the path of running for office and that\u2019s something I probably wouldn\u2019t have thought to do,\u201d said Crooks, who is recently off an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio state legislature.</p> <p>Trump has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, and at various points accused the women bringing them of lying.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s accusers aren\u2019t the only women turning their experiences into art. James Franco accuser Sarah Tither-Kaplan has raised tens of thousands of dollars for <a href=\"https://www.seedandspark.com/fund/losangeless#updates/20651\">a collaboration</a> with female film-makers spotlighting sexual assault within the entertainment industry.

And not for anything they want to be remembered for. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot worse in my life than a man grabbing my breast,\u201d Karina Virginia, another woman who came forward with her Trump story in 2016, told the New Yorker recently. Virginia, a Kundalini yoga teacher who grew up in New Jersey, is one of seven women whose experiences reporting sexual misconduct by Trump inform the plays, with some women \u2013 like the actor and former Miss Arizona Tasha Dixon, who spoke out about Trump\u2019s beauty pageant harassment \u2013 even making cameos on the stage. Each piece will focus on a different aspect of the experience, from difficulties talking to family to questions around victimhood and power. A play inspired by Virginia draws out what it was like having to tell her mom what happened. Stoynoff\u2019s play, co-written with the playwright Melissa Li, is a retelling of her original experience at Mar-a-Lago. Another looks at women who have yet to come forward. And a play inspired by Jessica Leeds, who reported in 2016 that Trump groped her on an airplane more than three decades ago, centers on an interview with Megyn Kelly in which the host repeatedly questions her political motivations. \u201cThe impression I had afterwards was like a bucket of cold water,\u201d Leeds said. \u201cI know it was quick and her job is to entertain her audience and whatnot but it was one of these occasions where I did not feel very comfortable.\u201d Another play inspired by Rachel Crooks, who publicly described being forcibly kissed by Trump in her early 20s, explores Crooks\u2019s shifting perspective as she progressed from the 22-year-old employee in Trump Tower to the woman she is today, a spin that recasts Crooks\u2019s story as less about Trump and more about growth. \u201cI certainly get annoyed with being referenced as \u2018the Trump accuser\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s not what I want to be known for in my life. But at the same time it allowed me to have a voice that ultimately did lead to the path of running for office and that\u2019s something I probably wouldn\u2019t have thought to do,\u201d said Crooks, who is recently off an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio state legislature. Trump has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, and at various points accused the women bringing them of lying. But Trump\u2019s accusers aren\u2019t the only women turning their experiences into art. James Franco accuser Sarah Tither-Kaplan has raised tens of thousands of dollars for a collaboration with female film-makers spotlighting sexual assault within the entertainment industry. Harvey Weinstein accuser Sarah Ann Masse has redoubled her focus on films aimed at sexual violence education, throwing herself into comedy exploring feminism, misogyny and victim blaming, as part of a duo with her husband. Pines meanwhile has her own connection to Trump. She is the daughter of Tony Schwartz, whom Trump threatened with legal action in 2016 after he spoke candidly with the New Yorker about his role in and remorse over ghostwriting Trump\u2019s myth-making book The Art of the Deal. \u201cPart of it is just I\u2019ve watched him speak truth to power for the last two years and I\u2019m feeling inspired to do that in the way that I can,\u201d Pines said of her father. \u201cI think something my dad did is despite the legal threats and despite what are risks, he said, \u2018I need to tell the truth,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cI think that\u2019s what these women did and I\u2019m so inspired by these women.\u201d All proceeds of the run go to the New York Women\u2019s Foundation.",

      "body": "<p>Many families in India still mourn the birth of a girl. But when Leena was born, people celebrated.</p> <p>Sagar Gram, her village in central India, is unique that way. Girls outnumber boys. When a woman marries, it is the groom\u2019s family that pays the dowry. Women are Sagar Gram\u2019s breadwinners. When they are deemed old enough, perhaps at the age of 11, most are expected to start doing sex work.</p> <p>India officially abolished caste discrimination almost 70 years ago. But millennia of tradition is not easily erased. For most Indians, caste still has a defining influence on who they marry and what they eat. It also traps millions in abusive work. The exploited and trafficked children of Sagar Gram, and dozens of other villages across India\u2019s hinterland, are one of its most disturbing manifestations.</p> <p>\u201cIt is caste and gender slavery,\u201d says Ashif Shaikh of Jan Sahas, an advocacy group that works with members of India\u2019s lowest castes, communities that used to be called \u201cuntouchables\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe estimate there are 100,000 women and girls in this situation. But there are likely more we haven\u2019t identified. It\u2019s an invisible issue.\u201d</p> <p>Girls in Sagar Gram grow up hearing a story. Sometime in the misty past of Hindu myth, a king fell in love with a dancer. His enraged queen issued the woman with a challenge: if she could walk a tightrope across a river, she could join the royal family, and permanently raise the status of her caste.</p> <p>As the woman neared the opposite bank of the river, a step from success, the queen suddenly cut the rope. \u201cUp until now, we lured your men through dancing,\u201d the woman told the queen. \u201cFrom now on, we will take your men from you with our bodies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c7b0bb3694ed60f84575faaf4eeffbaaee3d9db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c7b0bb3694ed60f84575faaf4eeffbaaee3d9db/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers outside the office of advocacy group Jan Sahas in Dewas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers outside the office of advocacy group Jan Sahas in Dewas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Conway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leena, 22, remembers learning about the woman. She remembers the awe she felt when the older girls from her caste, the Bacchara, suddenly had enough money for makeup and nice clothing. She remembers what the adults in her village told her when she was 15, and her family was having money problems.</p> <p>\u201cYour parents are going through such a hard time,\u201d they told her. \u201cHow can you go to school? You need to be working.\u201d</p> <p>That was when she started. \u201cThe rest of the girls in my village were doing it, so I felt like I had to do it as well,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>Girls in Sagar Gram, which lies next to a highway, are groomed for this life virtually from birth. Parents decide which of their daughters will fetch the best price. Older girls teach them how to attract customers from passing trucks and cars. The younger ones sometimes stow under beds, observing the others at work.</p> <p>Sex was nonetheless a mystery to Leena. \u201cWhen I was young, the most important thing was seeing the money the customer was offering,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what they were doing to me. I only saw that money was coming in.\u201d</p> <p>Her virginity was prized. She made 5,000 rupees (\u00a355) on the first night. Her price declined after that. Another Bacchara woman, aged 29, says the most she can make for an encounter is 200 rupees. She might see five or six men in a day.</p> <p>India\u2019s preference for male children has created a deep gender imbalance. Among the Baccharas of Sagar Gram village, however, the problem cuts the other way: there are 3,595 women in the district compared with 2,770 men, according to the most recent census.</p> <p>Yet, visiting the village at dusk, few women or girls can be seen. \u201cThey\u2019ve all gone to hotels or to stop cars,\u201d an older man says, gesturing at the nearby highway. Every few hundred metres along the road, girls are reclined on rope beds, waving at any vehicle that slows.</p> <p>The legal age of consent in India is 18. Madhya Pradesh, the state in which Sagar Gram is situated, recently passed the death penalty for anyone who rapes a child under 12, also increasing jail terms for adults who have sex with someone under 18. Police say seven people were arrested for child sexual exploitation offences in Sagar Gram in the past year, five of them women who sold their underage daughters. The law is clear, but does little to sway social custom and economic distress.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional business,\u201d says deputy superintendent Nagendra Singh Sikarwar, at the nearby Jeeran police station. \u201cEven girls we try to rehabilitate come back to it. The main issue is we don\u2019t have alternative jobs for them. And so their families are keen that they continue the work.\u201d</p> <p>Most Bacchara men do not work. Only the lowest paid or most degrading jobs are available to them anyway. So they rely on their children. They wait on their porches with the rest of the family while their daughters are inside with customers.</p> <p>One villager, Balram Chauhan, should be a rich man. He has five daughters. But he is struggling: Chauhan, 52, is the only father in the village who refuses to force his children into sex work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26dbf2cf86729009832f8bc9cb3e802442c3b5b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26dbf2cf86729009832f8bc9cb3e802442c3b5b7/450_537_3550_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Balram Chauhan with one of his daughters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Balram Chauhan, a member of the Bacchara community, right, has protected his five daughters from sex work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Conway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo be exposed to such violence and mental and physical abuse,\u201d he mutters. \u201cHow could any parent willingly send them off?\u201d</p> <p>His mother was a prostitute.

They said it was a culture that had been going on for years. Who was I to stop it?\u201d</p> <p>Trying to break this cycle has been a lifelong struggle.

The exploited and trafficked children of Sagar Gram, and dozens of other villages across India\u2019s hinterland, are one of its most disturbing manifestations. \u201cIt is caste and gender slavery,\u201d says Ashif Shaikh of Jan Sahas, an advocacy group that works with members of India\u2019s lowest castes, communities that used to be called \u201cuntouchables\u201d. \u201cWe estimate there are 100,000 women and girls in this situation. But there are likely more we haven\u2019t identified. It\u2019s an invisible issue.\u201d Girls in Sagar Gram grow up hearing a story. Sometime in the misty past of Hindu myth, a king fell in love with a dancer. His enraged queen issued the woman with a challenge: if she could walk a tightrope across a river, she could join the royal family, and permanently raise the status of her caste. As the woman neared the opposite bank of the river, a step from success, the queen suddenly cut the rope. \u201cUp until now, we lured your men through dancing,\u201d the woman told the queen. \u201cFrom now on, we will take your men from you with our bodies.\u201d Leena, 22, remembers learning about the woman. She remembers the awe she felt when the older girls from her caste, the Bacchara, suddenly had enough money for makeup and nice clothing. She remembers what the adults in her village told her when she was 15, and her family was having money problems. \u201cYour parents are going through such a hard time,\u201d they told her. \u201cHow can you go to school? You need to be working.\u201d That was when she started. \u201cThe rest of the girls in my village were doing it, so I felt like I had to do it as well,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my responsibility.\u201d Girls in Sagar Gram, which lies next to a highway, are groomed for this life virtually from birth. Parents decide which of their daughters will fetch the best price. Older girls teach them how to attract customers from passing trucks and cars. The younger ones sometimes stow under beds, observing the others at work. Sex was nonetheless a mystery to Leena. \u201cWhen I was young, the most important thing was seeing the money the customer was offering,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what they were doing to me. I only saw that money was coming in.\u201d Her virginity was prized. She made 5,000 rupees (\u00a355) on the first night. Her price declined after that. Another Bacchara woman, aged 29, says the most she can make for an encounter is 200 rupees. She might see five or six men in a day. India\u2019s preference for male children has created a deep gender imbalance. Among the Baccharas of Sagar Gram village, however, the problem cuts the other way: there are 3,595 women in the district compared with 2,770 men, according to the most recent census. Yet, visiting the village at dusk, few women or girls can be seen. \u201cThey\u2019ve all gone to hotels or to stop cars,\u201d an older man says, gesturing at the nearby highway. Every few hundred metres along the road, girls are reclined on rope beds, waving at any vehicle that slows. The legal age of consent in India is 18. Madhya Pradesh, the state in which Sagar Gram is situated, recently passed the death penalty for anyone who rapes a child under 12, also increasing jail terms for adults who have sex with someone under 18. Police say seven people were arrested for child sexual exploitation offences in Sagar Gram in the past year, five of them women who sold their underage daughters. The law is clear, but does little to sway social custom and economic distress. \u201cIt\u2019s a traditional business,\u201d says deputy superintendent Nagendra Singh Sikarwar, at the nearby Jeeran police station. \u201cEven girls we try to rehabilitate come back to it. The main issue is we don\u2019t have alternative jobs for them. And so their families are keen that they continue the work.\u201d Most Bacchara men do not work. Only the lowest paid or most degrading jobs are available to them anyway. So they rely on their children. They wait on their porches with the rest of the family while their daughters are inside with customers. One villager, Balram Chauhan, should be a rich man. He has five daughters. But he is struggling: Chauhan, 52, is the only father in the village who refuses to force his children into sex work. \u201cTo be exposed to such violence and mental and physical abuse,\u201d he mutters. \u201cHow could any parent willingly send them off?\u201d His mother was a prostitute. Despite his efforts, so were four of his sisters. \u201cFrom the moment I understood what they were doing I tried to stop them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my parents were against me. They said it was a culture that had been going on for years. Who was I to stop it?\u201d Trying to break this cycle has been a lifelong struggle. His parents sabotaged his efforts to train as a health worker, Chauhan says. When he married off his two daughters to spare them from a life of prostitution, his family cut him off. He cannot move his family outside of a Bacchara village: nobody would rent property to someone from his caste. The \u201chigher\u201d caste communities nearby consider his very presence polluting. So he has opened a small shop in Sagar Gram selling biscuits and confectionery, trying to eke out enough to pay for his daughters\u2019 education. \u201cA lot of people here bad-mouth my daughters,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they see them speaking on a cellphone, 10 people come to my shop and tell me: \u2018Your daughter is chatting to so-and-so.\u2019 They try to say they have loose characters. \u201cIf I had one daughter, I could handle it. But when there are five \u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing.\u201d Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattarcharya",

      "body": "<p>Pop stars \u2013 especially women \u2013 are frozen at the age they become famous. Breaking the ice usually involves a bad-girl reinvention, if not a genuine breakdown. Somehow, this tension never affected Avril Lavigne, the Canadian pop-punk star who arrived in 2002 aged 17 with the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE\" title=\"\">Complicated</a>, a heaving teenage sigh directed at some poseur boy. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t have an indelible look: her low-slung skate pants, tie and ramrod-straight hair are an enduring fancy-dress costume. It\u2019s that she never seemed to want to grow up.</p> <p>Her alternately fun, angsty debut album, Let Go, seemed authentic enough \u2013 she played guitar! The lyrics were handwritten! \u2013 to convince a generation of teenage girls that she, and by association, they, were more credible than Britney. Then 13, I was one of them; I wore Dad\u2019s tie to the shops and wasted hours learning how to copy her handwriting. It was music many quickly graduated from, to acts whose credits didn\u2019t list multiple co-writers: the drug of authenticity hooks teenagers fast. But there is no shame in being a gateway artist, a role Lavigne seemed surprisingly happy to keep playing.</p> <p>After an emotionally intense second album, she seemed to dial back the years with 2007\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/20/popandrock.shopping\" title=\"\">The Best Damn Thing</a>, led by single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg59q4puhmg\" title=\"\">Girlfriend</a>, a Hey Mickey-style rager about homewrecking. Goodbye Lullaby (2011) had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQmEd_UeeIk\" title=\"\">What the Hell</a> (\u201cAll I want is to mess around\u201d) and her 2013 self-titled album boasted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpTKtEhsz9Q\" title=\"\">Bitchin\u2019 Summer</a> (ie School\u2019s Out with swearing) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXd2WxoOP5g\" title=\"\">Here\u2019s to Never Growing Up</a> (\u201cWe\u2019ll be running down the street, yelling, \u2018Kiss my ass\u2019\u201d). She was 29. A year later, she started feeling inexplicably exhausted. Doctors tried to diagnose her with anxiety and chronic fatigue, even though she was sure she had Lyme disease. Finally, she got a vindicating diagnosis and spent two years in bed on antibiotics, certain, at one point, that she would die.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKF6ghfcQic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EKF6ghfcQic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What happens when a teenage immortal faces death? Lavigne, now 34, doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. \u201cIt was a relief\u201d to get the diagnosis, she says tersely, calling from Los Angeles. \u201cI was like: \u2018OK, now I can at least start treating something.\u2019\u201d She was treated at home. Who cared for her? Her manager interrupts and insists we \u201creally focus on the music\u201d. But it is hard to separate Lavigne\u2019s illness from her sixth album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKF6ghfcQic\" title=\"\">Head Above Water</a>, named after a song that came to her as she lay in her mother\u2019s arms, feeling as if she was drowning. It is her best song in years, an emphatic, gothic ballad that is doing well on the US Christian singles chart and has 57m YouTube views. \u201cIt just felt really good to be singing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe emotion was so raw.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Lavigne\u2019s illness, she says she never doubted her capacity to commit to a whole album. She started writing on guitar in bed, graduating to piano when she felt stronger. Inner strength is the prevailing theme of the eight songs I heard, which often evoke Lana Del Rey\u2019s moody epics. Empowerment anthems like this were everywhere a few years ago, but have been replaced by stark admissions of vulnerability and nihilism. But keeping pace with pop wasn\u2019t Lavigne\u2019s concern. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do what everyone was doing,\u201d she says, mentioning a need for \u201corganic musical realness\u201d and constructing songs around her vocals \u201cversus building this crazy loud track and just burying a vocal in it\u201d. This is the kind of dry \u201cfocus on the music\u201d Lavigne prefers. She keeps saying how \u201cmeaningful\u201d the music is, but won\u2019t go deeper.</p> <p>Other songs allude to a toxic relationship. All Lavigne will say is that my assumption is \u201cobviously\u201d correct and that they\u2019re categorically not about her second ex-husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/23/avril-lavigne-attacks-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-nickelback\" title=\"\">they have a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d</a> (he worked on the album). \u201cI appreciate you trying to really get the juice,\u201d she says mockingly, \u201cbut I\u2019m not gonna go there.\u201d I explain that I\u2019m not looking for gossip, but context for her most personal album. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about my music,\u201d she says, exasperated. \u201cI write it and I put it out there, and people can interpret it the way they like.\u201d It is hard to talk about the music when the music apparently speaks for itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9952c12ffdd74dc65eb7c55863df8ec11941dcfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9952c12ffdd74dc65eb7c55863df8ec11941dcfe/0_98_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lavigne in 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lavigne in 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But maybe never showing vulnerability is key to Lavigne\u2019s 17-year pop career. She has heartfelt songs \u2013 her debut album\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGR65RWwzg8\" title=\"\">I\u2019m With You</a> is a fantastic pop-rock ballad, later sampled by Rihanna \u2013 but her exterior has swung between feckless (giving the finger on MTV\u2019s era-defining Total Request Live in 2004) and brittle. (She regrets the tearful 2015 television interview announcing her illness.) She is publicly close to both her ex-husbands, Kroeger and Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley, whom she met aged 17, married at 21 and divorced at 25.</p> <p>Pop is built on female resilience, which seems to have come naturally to her. When asked whether sexist and derisory criticism affected her as a teenager, she is unimpressed: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to.\u201d The stories she told about Limp Bizkit\u2019s Fred Durst trying to sleep with her; the manufactured feud between her and Britney Spears? \u201cOh, that\u2019s OK,\u201d she says, flippantly. \u201cIt\u2019s just because I was superpowerful and they needed gossip to talk about.\u201d Her debut sold more than 6m copies in a year and she toured the world. Did she always feel protected as a teenage girl in a cutthroat industry? \u201cIt was a whirlwind, and it was so magical and unbelievable.\u201d The only gruelling parts were the \u201cdifferent time zones and travelling\u201d.</p> <p>What seemed less natural as her career progressed was Lavigne\u2019s actual identity. The driven 15-year-old from smalltown Napanee, Ontario, was discovered singing country songs in a bookshop. A year later, she moved to New York with her older brother after a Canadian label sent footage of her singing karaoke to a producer. Two months after turning 17, she was signed by pop impresario LA Reid. In Lavigne\u2019s telling, Arista thought they had a Sheryl Crow-style country act on their hands, but she wanted to write heavier songs. A compromise was reached: after writing rockier material with one co-writer, she was paired with LA trio the Matrix, who wrote Let Go\u2019s three massive singles, Complicated, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIy3n2b7V9k\" title=\"\">Sk8er Boi</a> and I\u2019m With You. Lavigne and Matrix disagree about the level of her input on the album. Reid maintained \u201cwhatever gets the job done\u201d diplomacy.</p> <p>The first album was so successful that Lavigne says she only had six months to write 2004\u2019s Under My Skin: \u201cThey made me put it out before I was ready.\u201d She and co-writer Butch Walker kept writing until the last minute, producing the bittersweet grunge anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8QYxmpuyxg\" title=\"\">My Happy Ending</a>. \u201cI called them and I said: \u2018Guys, I have the first single.\u2019 They\u2019re like: \u2018No, we\u2019re going with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMbIipvQL0c\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Tell Me</a>.\u2019\u201d Arista led with their choice but Lavigne was right: My Happy Ending peaked higher and sold almost three times as many copies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg59q4puhmg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bg59q4puhmg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The brooding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/21/popandrock.shopping5\" title=\"\">Under My Skin</a> reflected the kind of progression that makes sense, especially for a pop star who stressed her autonomy at a time when girls weren\u2019t afforded much of it. Which is why her third album, The Best Damn Thing, seemed so odd. Her first for a new label, RCA, it was a riotous pop record led by the deadpan cheerleader banger Girlfriend, her only US No 1 single to date.</p> <p>Like Gwen Stefani, Lavigne has always been conservative despite her punk image. Her family are devoutly Christian. She once described girls \u201chaving sex with a ton of boys\u201d as \u201ca bad thing\u201d, a belief that informed Don\u2019t Tell Me: \u201cDid I not tell you that I\u2019m not like that girl, the one who gives it all away?\u201d By the time she released The Best Damn Thing, the Disney-pushed purity-ring craze dominated pop. But even that couldn\u2019t explain the album\u2019s regressive lyrics: \u201cYou left without me and now you\u2019re somewhere out there with a bitch, slut, psycho babe,\u201d she sang on Everything Back But You. On the title track, she moaned about how she hated it when a guy \u201cdoesn\u2019t get the door\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t get the tab\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand why a certain time of the month I don\u2019t wanna hold his hand\u201d.</p> <p>In retrospect, it would be a relief to blame the album on its producer and co-writer, Dr Luke, who made his name creating debauched hits for the era\u2019s female icons, and lost favour after former protegee Kesha accused him of abuse. (He denies all claims and is suing for defamation.) But Lavigne enjoyed working with him: \u201cWe wrote really great songs together.\u201d These three albums were the only records \u2013 until now \u2013 where she didn\u2019t have to compromise. \u201cIt was the fourth album when the tears started,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e3519062d27c06c001c9b6c6ad19fd4f4a0a697a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3519062d27c06c001c9b6c6ad19fd4f4a0a697a/0_130_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing with her ex-husband Chad Kroeger in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing with her ex-husband Chad Kroeger in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Chin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe majority of the time in my career, [RCA] want me to write another Girlfriend. They don\u2019t want the ballads.\u201d It seems especially tragic that on 2011\u2019s otherwise lovelorn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/23/avril-lavigne-review\" title=\"\">Goodbye Lullaby</a> \u2013 written following her split from Whibley, although he produced half of it \u2013 she had to include What the Hell, a song about snogging a guy\u2019s friends and going \u201con a million dates\u201d that sounded unfortunately similar to the then ubiquitous Disney pop-rock she had inspired.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to be a woman and to be heard, and people sometimes don\u2019t take you seriously,\u201d she says, finally warming to a subject. \u201cI\u2019m highly intuitive and I\u2019ve always got a very strong gut feeling. I\u2019ve always felt that I\u2019ve known what\u2019s best for me to do and I\u2019ve had to fight different people on this journey over those 17 years: \u2018You need to do this and it needs to go Top 40.\u2019 You make those songs cos you have to, but then the stuff that\u2019s the best on record is the album tracks.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds miserable. \u201cI would get some songs the style I really wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cI always loved the pop-rock thing and it\u2019s still who I am. I\u2019m still proud of those songs and I wrote them. It wasn\u2019t like people wrote them and gave it to me. It was like: \u2018OK, I get it. You guys want singles that are going in this direction. Fine, I\u2019ll work with you but I\u2019d rather be doing something else.\u2019 You can\u2019t be stubborn and just do everything your own way.\u201d</p> <p> If commercially inclined compromise is one of the secrets of Lavigne\u2019s enduring career, it remains at odds with the delinquent attitude of many of her songs. That was the mood on her 2013 self-titled album, which dwelled on teenage rebellion and contained a J-pop-influenced song about Hello Kitty that many deemed racist on seeing its stereotype-laden video. (She denied the suggestion, citing the Japanese production crew.) Claims of cultural appropriation aside, its lyrics fared little better. Referencing Spin the Bottle and \u201croll[ing] around in our underwear\u201d, it sounded like a middle-aged pervert\u2019s idea of teenage sleepovers.</p> <p>\u201cThe label didn\u2019t tell me what to write, lyrically,\u201d she insists. \u201cI\u2019m young at heart. I\u2019m a free spirit. I\u2019m super-fun. I love to hang out and have fun and dance and skateboard.\u201d She reels off the diverse types of song she can write \u201cin my sleep\u201d: about love, breakups, partying, dancing, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, friendship. \u201cI\u2019m a fucking rock star, bitch!\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s a sign of how effectively Arista marketed Lavigne\u2019s debut that you want to believe there was a frustrated artist in there all along. Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/may/15/avril-lavigne-melissa-cloning-conspiracy-theories\" title=\"\">a conspiracy theory that Lavigne had died and been replaced by a doppelganger went viral</a>. It was absurd, and must have been extremely hurtful for Lavigne to witness people laughing about her hypothetical death when her health was so precarious. Beyond the delight of a well-reasoned crackpot theory, I don\u2019t think people were gloating about her demise, but attempting to make sense of her jarring career: surely these artists weren\u2019t the same person?</p> <p>Musically, maybe Head Above Water is what will finally kill off the teenage immortal. She switched labels, to BMG, whom she said treated her like a \u201clegacy artist\u201d. \u201cThat was the first time, other than my first album, that a label really just was like: \u2018Take your time and write the music that you want to write.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It would be easy, after our fairly painful encounter, to want to pin the baffling mid-portion of Lavigne\u2019s career on her alone. But the self-evident results of a label\u2019s overdue trust \u2013 a stronger album with real emotional stakes and sophisticated ambitions \u2013 should embarrass an industry that prefers its women powerless and pickled in aspic.</p> <p><em>The album Head Above Water is out on BMG on 15 February</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Pop stars \u2013 especially women \u2013 are frozen at the age they become famous. Breaking the ice usually involves a bad-girl reinvention, if not a genuine breakdown. Somehow, this tension never affected Avril Lavigne, the Canadian pop-punk star who arrived in 2002 aged 17 with the brilliant Complicated, a heaving teenage sigh directed at some poseur boy. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t have an indelible look: her low-slung skate pants, tie and ramrod-straight hair are an enduring fancy-dress costume. It\u2019s that she never seemed to want to grow up. Her alternately fun, angsty debut album, Let Go, seemed authentic enough \u2013 she played guitar! The lyrics were handwritten! \u2013 to convince a generation of teenage girls that she, and by association, they, were more credible than Britney. Then 13, I was one of them; I wore Dad\u2019s tie to the shops and wasted hours learning how to copy her handwriting. It was music many quickly graduated from, to acts whose credits didn\u2019t list multiple co-writers: the drug of authenticity hooks teenagers fast. But there is no shame in being a gateway artist, a role Lavigne seemed surprisingly happy to keep playing. After an emotionally intense second album, she seemed to dial back the years with 2007\u2019s The Best Damn Thing, led by single Girlfriend, a Hey Mickey-style rager about homewrecking. Goodbye Lullaby (2011) had What the Hell (\u201cAll I want is to mess around\u201d) and her 2013 self-titled album boasted Bitchin\u2019 Summer (ie School\u2019s Out with swearing) and Here\u2019s to Never Growing Up (\u201cWe\u2019ll be running down the street, yelling, \u2018Kiss my ass\u2019\u201d). She was 29. A year later, she started feeling inexplicably exhausted. Doctors tried to diagnose her with anxiety and chronic fatigue, even though she was sure she had Lyme disease. Finally, she got a vindicating diagnosis and spent two years in bed on antibiotics, certain, at one point, that she would die. What happens when a teenage immortal faces death? Lavigne, now 34, doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. \u201cIt was a relief\u201d to get the diagnosis, she says tersely, calling from Los Angeles. \u201cI was like: \u2018OK, now I can at least start treating something.\u2019\u201d She was treated at home. Who cared for her? Her manager interrupts and insists we \u201creally focus on the music\u201d. But it is hard to separate Lavigne\u2019s illness from her sixth album, Head Above Water, named after a song that came to her as she lay in her mother\u2019s arms, feeling as if she was drowning. It is her best song in years, an emphatic, gothic ballad that is doing well on the US Christian singles chart and has 57m YouTube views. \u201cIt just felt really good to be singing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe emotion was so raw.\u201d Despite Lavigne\u2019s illness, she says she never doubted her capacity to commit to a whole album. She started writing on guitar in bed, graduating to piano when she felt stronger. Inner strength is the prevailing theme of the eight songs I heard, which often evoke Lana Del Rey\u2019s moody epics. Empowerment anthems like this were everywhere a few years ago, but have been replaced by stark admissions of vulnerability and nihilism. But keeping pace with pop wasn\u2019t Lavigne\u2019s concern. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do what everyone was doing,\u201d she says, mentioning a need for \u201corganic musical realness\u201d and constructing songs around her vocals \u201cversus building this crazy loud track and just burying a vocal in it\u201d. This is the kind of dry \u201cfocus on the music\u201d Lavigne prefers. She keeps saying how \u201cmeaningful\u201d the music is, but won\u2019t go deeper. Other songs allude to a toxic relationship. All Lavigne will say is that my assumption is \u201cobviously\u201d correct and that they\u2019re categorically not about her second ex-husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger; they have a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d (he worked on the album). \u201cI appreciate you trying to really get the juice,\u201d she says mockingly, \u201cbut I\u2019m not gonna go there.\u201d I explain that I\u2019m not looking for gossip, but context for her most personal album. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about my music,\u201d she says, exasperated. \u201cI write it and I put it out there, and people can interpret it the way they like.\u201d It is hard to talk about the music when the music apparently speaks for itself. But maybe never showing vulnerability is key to Lavigne\u2019s 17-year pop career. She has heartfelt songs \u2013 her debut album\u2019s I\u2019m With You is a fantastic pop-rock ballad, later sampled by Rihanna \u2013 but her exterior has swung between feckless (giving the finger on MTV\u2019s era-defining Total Request Live in 2004) and brittle. (She regrets the tearful 2015 television interview announcing her illness.) She is publicly close to both her ex-husbands, Kroeger and Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley, whom she met aged 17, married at 21 and divorced at 25. Pop is built on female resilience, which seems to have come naturally to her. When asked whether sexist and derisory criticism affected her as a teenager, she is unimpressed: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to.\u201d The stories she told about Limp Bizkit\u2019s Fred Durst trying to sleep with her; the manufactured feud between her and Britney Spears? \u201cOh, that\u2019s OK,\u201d she says, flippantly. \u201cIt\u2019s just because I was superpowerful and they needed gossip to talk about.\u201d Her debut sold more than 6m copies in a year and she toured the world. Did she always feel protected as a teenage girl in a cutthroat industry? \u201cIt was a whirlwind, and it was so magical and unbelievable.\u201d The only gruelling parts were the \u201cdifferent time zones and travelling\u201d. What seemed less natural as her career progressed was Lavigne\u2019s actual identity. The driven 15-year-old from smalltown Napanee, Ontario, was discovered singing country songs in a bookshop. A year later, she moved to New York with her older brother after a Canadian label sent footage of her singing karaoke to a producer. Two months after turning 17, she was signed by pop impresario LA Reid. In Lavigne\u2019s telling, Arista thought they had a Sheryl Crow-style country act on their hands, but she wanted to write heavier songs. A compromise was reached: after writing rockier material with one co-writer, she was paired with LA trio the Matrix, who wrote Let Go\u2019s three massive singles, Complicated, Sk8er Boi and I\u2019m With You. Lavigne and Matrix disagree about the level of her input on the album. Reid maintained \u201cwhatever gets the job done\u201d diplomacy. The first album was so successful that Lavigne says she only had six months to write 2004\u2019s Under My Skin: \u201cThey made me put it out before I was ready.\u201d She and co-writer Butch Walker kept writing until the last minute, producing the bittersweet grunge anthem My Happy Ending. \u201cI called them and I said: \u2018Guys, I have the first single.\u2019 They\u2019re like: \u2018No, we\u2019re going with Don\u2019t Tell Me.\u2019\u201d Arista led with their choice but Lavigne was right: My Happy Ending peaked higher and sold almost three times as many copies. The brooding Under My Skin reflected the kind of progression that makes sense, especially for a pop star who stressed her autonomy at a time when girls weren\u2019t afforded much of it. Which is why her third album, The Best Damn Thing, seemed so odd. Her first for a new label, RCA, it was a riotous pop record led by the deadpan cheerleader banger Girlfriend, her only US No 1 single to date. Like Gwen Stefani, Lavigne has always been conservative despite her punk image. Her family are devoutly Christian. She once described girls \u201chaving sex with a ton of boys\u201d as \u201ca bad thing\u201d, a belief that informed Don\u2019t Tell Me: \u201cDid I not tell you that I\u2019m not like that girl, the one who gives it all away?\u201d By the time she released The Best Damn Thing, the Disney-pushed purity-ring craze dominated pop. But even that couldn\u2019t explain the album\u2019s regressive lyrics: \u201cYou left without me and now you\u2019re somewhere out there with a bitch, slut, psycho babe,\u201d she sang on Everything Back But You. On the title track, she moaned about how she hated it when a guy \u201cdoesn\u2019t get the door\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t get the tab\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand why a certain time of the month I don\u2019t wanna hold his hand\u201d. In retrospect, it would be a relief to blame the album on its producer and co-writer, Dr Luke, who made his name creating debauched hits for the era\u2019s female icons, and lost favour after former protegee Kesha accused him of abuse. (He denies all claims and is suing for defamation.) But Lavigne enjoyed working with him: \u201cWe wrote really great songs together.\u201d These three albums were the only records \u2013 until now \u2013 where she didn\u2019t have to compromise. \u201cIt was the fourth album when the tears started,\u201d she says. \u201cThe majority of the time in my career, [RCA] want me to write another Girlfriend. They don\u2019t want the ballads.\u201d It seems especially tragic that on 2011\u2019s otherwise lovelorn Goodbye Lullaby \u2013 written following her split from Whibley, although he produced half of it \u2013 she had to include What the Hell, a song about snogging a guy\u2019s friends and going \u201con a million dates\u201d that sounded unfortunately similar to the then ubiquitous Disney pop-rock she had inspired. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to be a woman and to be heard, and people sometimes don\u2019t take you seriously,\u201d she says, finally warming to a subject. \u201cI\u2019m highly intuitive and I\u2019ve always got a very strong gut feeling. I\u2019ve always felt that I\u2019ve known what\u2019s best for me to do and I\u2019ve had to fight different people on this journey over those 17 years: \u2018You need to do this and it needs to go Top 40.\u2019 You make those songs cos you have to, but then the stuff that\u2019s the best on record is the album tracks.\u201d It sounds miserable. \u201cI would get some songs the style I really wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cI always loved the pop-rock thing and it\u2019s still who I am. I\u2019m still proud of those songs and I wrote them. It wasn\u2019t like people wrote them and gave it to me. It was like: \u2018OK, I get it. You guys want singles that are going in this direction. Fine, I\u2019ll work with you but I\u2019d rather be doing something else.\u2019 You can\u2019t be stubborn and just do everything your own way.\u201d If commercially inclined compromise is one of the secrets of Lavigne\u2019s enduring career, it remains at odds with the delinquent attitude of many of her songs. That was the mood on her 2013 self-titled album, which dwelled on teenage rebellion and contained a J-pop-influenced song about Hello Kitty that many deemed racist on seeing its stereotype-laden video. (She denied the suggestion, citing the Japanese production crew.) Claims of cultural appropriation aside, its lyrics fared little better. Referencing Spin the Bottle and \u201croll[ing] around in our underwear\u201d, it sounded like a middle-aged pervert\u2019s idea of teenage sleepovers. \u201cThe label didn\u2019t tell me what to write, lyrically,\u201d she insists. \u201cI\u2019m young at heart. I\u2019m a free spirit. I\u2019m super-fun. I love to hang out and have fun and dance and skateboard.\u201d She reels off the diverse types of song she can write \u201cin my sleep\u201d: about love, breakups, partying, dancing, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, friendship. \u201cI\u2019m a fucking rock star, bitch!\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s a sign of how effectively Arista marketed Lavigne\u2019s debut that you want to believe there was a frustrated artist in there all along. Two years ago, a conspiracy theory that Lavigne had died and been replaced by a doppelganger went viral. It was absurd, and must have been extremely hurtful for Lavigne to witness people laughing about her hypothetical death when her health was so precarious. Beyond the delight of a well-reasoned crackpot theory, I don\u2019t think people were gloating about her demise, but attempting to make sense of her jarring career: surely these artists weren\u2019t the same person? Musically, maybe Head Above Water is what will finally kill off the teenage immortal. She switched labels, to BMG, whom she said treated her like a \u201clegacy artist\u201d. \u201cThat was the first time, other than my first album, that a label really just was like: \u2018Take your time and write the music that you want to write.\u2019\u201d It would be easy, after our fairly painful encounter, to want to pin the baffling mid-portion of Lavigne\u2019s career on her alone. But the self-evident results of a label\u2019s overdue trust \u2013 a stronger album with real emotional stakes and sophisticated ambitions \u2013 should embarrass an industry that prefers its women powerless and pickled in aspic. The album Head Above Water is out on BMG on 15 February",

      "body": "<p>It is 1992. A young actor named Will Smith, already a famous rapper and sitcom star, is nervous about his first big film role, as a gay con artist in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108149/\">Six Degrees of Separation</a>. It\u2019s a part that requires him to kiss a man, so he calls his friend Denzel Washington, who tells him: \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable about it, don\u2019t do it.\u201d (That\u2019s Washington\u2019s recollection. Less charitable reports have him telling Smith squarely: \u201cDon\u2019t you be kissing no man.\u201d) In the finished film, there is no kiss \u2013 at least not in full view of the camera \u2013 and Smith later says he regrets not giving his all for fear that it would harm his career.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being openly gay has done nothing but restrict my career.

Dan Krikler, a straight actor, agrees to be the voice of the heterosexual community for this article. The distinction became relevant when he played a gay man last year in the European premiere in London of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/08/sniffing-poppers-during-sex-such-a-cliche-reinvented-gay-drama-homos-or-everyone-in-america\">Jordan Seavey\u2019s explosive play Homos, Or Everyone in America</a>. \u201cAs with any form of acting, you substitute the things that aren\u2019t familiar with those that are,\u201d he says. \u201cPlaying someone who\u2019s attracted to guys, it\u2019s not a big leap to substitute the feelings I usually have for women. There were other things that were new to me, so I had to ask a gay co-star, \u2018How do you feel holding hands with a man in public?\u2019 That doesn\u2019t even cross your mind as part of a heterosexual couple. But it\u2019s the kind of research you\u2019d do with any role that doesn\u2019t fit you exactly. It seems ridiculous to only play parts within your own experience. That would go against everything anyone\u2019s ever learned about acting.\u201d</p> <p>It may expand opportunities for LGBT performers, but the idea of like-for-like casting can only inhibit the scope of acting in general. Cate Blanchett, who played a lesbian in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/26/carol-film-review-cate-blanchett-todd-haynes-rooney-mara\">Carol</a> and Bob Dylan in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/21/drama\">I\u2019m Not There</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/27/cate-blanchett-straight-talking-approach-to-complicated-issue\">promised</a> to \u201cfight to the death for the right to suspend disbelief and play roles beyond my experience\u201d. For his part, Seavey has no problem with it. \u201cI used to feel that a straight person could not know, on a molecular level, the exact and particular experience of being queer,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then a straight actor played a gay character in one of my plays and, being a brilliant actor, gave a brilliant performance.

      "bodyText": "It is 1992. A young actor named Will Smith, already a famous rapper and sitcom star, is nervous about his first big film role, as a gay con artist in Six Degrees of Separation. It\u2019s a part that requires him to kiss a man, so he calls his friend Denzel Washington, who tells him: \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable about it, don\u2019t do it.\u201d (That\u2019s Washington\u2019s recollection. Less charitable reports have him telling Smith squarely: \u201cDon\u2019t you be kissing no man.\u201d) In the finished film, there is no kiss \u2013 at least not in full view of the camera \u2013 and Smith later says he regrets not giving his all for fear that it would harm his career. How times change. Now a successful heterosexual actor can swear off gay roles for an entirely different and apparently noble reason. Last weekend, Darren Criss took home a Golden Globe for his performance as the gay serial killer Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace. When he bagged an Emmy for the same part last year, he announced it would be his last gay role. Far from being homophobic, this was his attempt to open up opportunities for colleagues. Having played several LGBT characters, he was keen \u201cto make sure I won\u2019t be another straight boy taking a gay man\u2019s role\u201d. His decision comes at a time when there is a groundswell of opinion proposing that such parts should be given only to actors who identify as LGBT. Some voices in the debate, understandably agitated by the news that Jack Whitehall has been cast as a camp gay man in Disney\u2019s Jungle Cruise, have even used the term \u201cgayface\u201d to describe straight actors going gay for pay, echoing the \u201cblackface\u201d of Laurence Olivier in Othello or Alec Guinness in A Passage to India. Awards season this year would look very different under such restrictions. No Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz or Emma Stone, all of whom play bisexual characters in The Favourite. Nor would Weisz and Rachel McAdams have been permitted to star as lovers in Disobedience. It\u2019s goodbye to Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, and farewell to both Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant in Can You Ever Forgive Me? Ben Whishaw would still be allowed to play Norman Scott in A Very English Scandal, for which he, too, won a Golden Globe, but his co-star Hugh Grant would need to be replaced as the MP Jeremy Thorpe, Scott\u2019s lover who tried to have him killed. Would there be enough out LGBT actors \u2013 brilliant, out LGBT actors, that is \u2013 to fill all these vacant parts? It wouldn\u2019t do to throw out the straights with the bathwater. This dilemma could only have arisen in a climate where there is a plenitude of LGBT roles and an eagerness to see diversity on screen.

To find out, Genov\u00e9s asked a British boat builder to make a 12x7 metre raft called the Acali on which he planned to sail with 10 sexually attractive young people across the Atlantic from the Canary Islands to Mexico. It was like a prototype for the glut of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/reality-tv\">reality TV shows</a> since, a Floating Love Island or Big Brother at Sea, but with a twist \u2013 the participants were so isolated from the rest of the world that it would have been futile to cry: \u201cGet me out of here!\u201d The only ways out were drowning or getting eaten by sharks.</p> <p>Genov\u00e9s was a veteran of extreme rafting.

The Norwegian adventurer wanted to show how people of different races could cooperate effectively.</p> <p>Genov\u00e9s had even grander motives in planning his voyage: he sought to diagnose and cure world violence. To that end, he placed ads in international newspapers and made his selection from respondents, choosing a crew of strangers from different races and religions so that he could create a microcosm of the world. Among the five women and five men were a Japanese photographer, an Angolan priest, a French scuba diver, a Swedish ship\u2019s captain, an Israeli doctor and an Alaskan waitress who was fleeing an abusive husband. Genov\u00e9s called his boat the Peace Project, but it rapidly became known in the world\u2019s press as the Sex Raft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a1b36097e485e0cea553eb50f9cc1520b0e5e5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a1b36097e485e0cea553eb50f9cc1520b0e5e5f/0_173_1949_1169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The mixed-gender, multi-ethnicity, 11-strong crew of the Acali, captained by Maria Bj\u00f6rnstam (centre)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The mixed-gender, multi-ethnicity, 11-strong crew, captained by Maria Bj\u00f6rnstam (centre)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To spur conflict onboard, Genov\u00e9s minimised opportunities for privacy.

With a Caribbean hurricane brewing, Maria, the experienced ship\u2019s captain, recommended they pull into a port to sit out the storm. Genov\u00e9s, fearing the ruin of his experiment if they did so, mutinied and took control of the raft. \u201cHe wants to be very progressive and radical giving power to the women,\u201d says Lindeen, \u201cbut when it comes to the crisis of the captaincy he\u2019s very macho.\u201d</p> <p>But Genov\u00e9s was symbolically castrated later, on the Atlantic crossing.

The tour lasts 90 minutes and costs \u20ac10 (\u00a38.90).</p> \n<p>McGuire\u2019s commentary includes homeless tips on staying safe, stashing possessions and blending into crowds. He mixes anecdotes about shelters \u2013 the decent, the bad, the awful \u2013 with stories about the Liberties\u2019 eras of brothels, a heroin epidemic and \u201cfour corners of hell\u201d, a junction of four pubs notorious for fights.</p> \n<p>\u201cSleeping out in the city centre, that was my worst nightmare.

A tour run by homeless people in Vienna inspired Tom Austin, a Trinity College graduate student, to bring the idea to Dublin. With co-founders Pierce Dargan and Gareth Downey, he obtained support from <a href=\"https://www.dubsimon.ie/\">Dublin Simon Community</a>, a non-profit organisation, and recruited McGuire to be the first guide, with hope that the scheme will expand with more guides covering other parts of the capital.</p> \n<p>McGuire, who spent 25 years working in the voluntary sector, became homeless after a relationship ended and a property crash left him unable to pay his mortgage.</p> \n<p>In early 2014 he packed a bag and headed to the airport \u2013 and stayed there for three weeks, posing as a traveller and snaffling restaurant leftovers. It was safe but demoralising: \u201cMy spirit was broken,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>McGuire returned to the city and slept rough, refusing to seek assistance: \u201cI had far too much pride.

A homelessness crisis in Ireland\u2019s capital has prompted the launch of a walking tour, given by a formerly homeless guide, through an inner city of gritty streets and quiet desperation that tourists seldom see. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the properties for the number of people that are working,\u201d said Derek McGuire, leading a recent Secret Street Tour through the Liberties, a historical blue-collar neighbourhood. \u201cHomelessness could become socially acceptable, become the norm.\u201d The 0.8-mile (1.3km) route includes areas where McGuire used to sleep rough for two years after losing his home in 2014, and passes five homeless hostels, with another six hostels nearby. The tour lasts 90 minutes and costs \u20ac10 (\u00a38.90). McGuire\u2019s commentary includes homeless tips on staying safe, stashing possessions and blending into crowds. He mixes anecdotes about shelters \u2013 the decent, the bad, the awful \u2013 with stories about the Liberties\u2019 eras of brothels, a heroin epidemic and \u201cfour corners of hell\u201d, a junction of four pubs notorious for fights. \u201cSleeping out in the city centre, that was my worst nightmare. I had to put on my Bear Grylls head,\u201d said McGuire. \u201cIt was going to be about survival.\u201d The tour, which started last month, is the latest evidence of a nationwide housing crisis that has inflated rents, nudged the homeless population towards 10,000 and created a political backlash. Thousands have marched through Dublin in recent months to demand rent control and more low-cost housing, and to accuse the government of being in the pockets of landlords, developers and \u201cvulture funds\u201d. Activists have occupied vacant properties, in some cases leading to violent confrontations with private security teams sent to evict them. The eviction of a family in County Roscommon last month triggered especially strong retaliation: about 20 masked vigilantes with baseball bats assaulted the security guards and arsonists firebombed two Dublin branches of KBC Bank, which had sent the guards to repossess the home. Many musicians and artists are finding Dublin unaffordable. Stephen James Smith, the city\u2019s unofficial poet laureate, is couch-surfing and considering leaving the city. Homelessness-themed tours have sprung up in Manchester, London and other cities. A tour run by homeless people in Vienna inspired Tom Austin, a Trinity College graduate student, to bring the idea to Dublin. With co-founders Pierce Dargan and Gareth Downey, he obtained support from Dublin Simon Community, a non-profit organisation, and recruited McGuire to be the first guide, with hope that the scheme will expand with more guides covering other parts of the capital. McGuire, who spent 25 years working in the voluntary sector, became homeless after a relationship ended and a property crash left him unable to pay his mortgage. In early 2014 he packed a bag and headed to the airport \u2013 and stayed there for three weeks, posing as a traveller and snaffling restaurant leftovers. It was safe but demoralising: \u201cMy spirit was broken,\u201d he said. McGuire returned to the city and slept rough, refusing to seek assistance: \u201cI had far too much pride. I\u2019d sooner starve than ask people for money.\u201d He was ragged by the time Merchants Quay Ireland, a homeless charity, offered him the temporary, shared accommodation that he now calls home. Guiding has restored McGuire\u2019s sense of identity. \u201cI see this as an opportunity to tell my story,\u201d he said. He said he expected homelessness to continue rising. Too few new homes are being built across Ireland. And a tech-fuelled boom is bringing hipster cafes and other signs of rent-fuelling gentrification to the Liberties, which is within walking distance of Facebook and Google offices.",

But that rhythm comes at the expense of detail: that I stand in the reception of his GP (current waiting time for an appointment: 15 days) repeatedly stating that I will not allow him to die because someone didn\u2019t fill in the right form; that we drive for 25 miles over the South Downs to the nearest facility that might be able to help him, past the country park where we walked for miles and miles and miles in the days after my mum died; that Dad says to me: \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? Isn\u2019t it all so beautiful?\u201d But when, eventually, we arrive, it is to Gormenghast. Or Mordor. Or Casterly Rock. Except this crumbling horror-palace isn\u2019t fictional, it\u2019s terrifyingly real, appearing to consist mainly of dysfunctional transitional zones: link corridors, lifts serving only specific floors, walkways with dead ends. One evening, after Dad has been admitted to the vascular ward, I find myself in the wrong lift system, each floor offering only locked double doors and silence; only when I\u2019ve seen off a full-blown panic attack by deep breathing do I realise I can retrace my steps to the very beginning and escape. It is like assault by cliche: no resources, no staff, NHS managers brandishing their achievements as doctors and nurses eke out what little they have on the wards. Lines of demarcation that may make sense on a budget sheet but are less useful to an individual human body. Skinny blankets for a freezing man. Food that is not merely unpalatable but clearly devoid of any nutritional value. Opaque administrative hurdles that suck you dry of energy and patience but get you nowhere closer to the answers you need: what is wrong? Can it be put right? The kindness and humanity we encounter are welcome, appreciated and, in the circumstances, miraculous, but they are not the answer either. The key information I garner, most of it covertly, is not medical, but procedural; essentially, how to game a system filled with barriers and illogicalities. How to make departments talk to one another. How, I suspect, to get into the right cost code. Although we do discover that, contra all opinions to date, his problems are not vascular in origin; more likely they are an arcane combination of the haematological and dermatological. We\u2019re sent home from Gormenghast, with biopsies ordered and daily nursing care at home arranged; it is both immense relief and agonising terror. If you relinquish your toehold on the system, will you ever get back in? In my personal life, on and off social media, I am overwhelmed by a tsunami of affection, offers of practical help and expressions of solidarity. I also notice that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has lately been visiting the region; there are photographs of him beaming at nearby hospitals, deployed alongside the hashtag #NHSLongTermPlan. Great stuff: but first I\u2019d be keen to hear a little more about the #NHSShortTermPlan. So, Matt, Dad and I are here if you want to talk. I\u2019ll move his bandages out of your way and put the kettle on. \u2022 Alex Clark writes for the Guardian and the Observer",

Two men who had been hired to kill him were sitting outside his home in their stolen BMW, prosecutors would later tell a court.</p> <p>Motamed was saved that day by a late-morning appointment which meant he broke with his usual practice of leaving the house at 6.45am.

      "bodyText": "Ali Motamed\u2019s wife had become accustomed to making excuses for her 56-year-old husband. Call-outs for his work as an electrician at the Dutch firm, Eneco, gave a handy reason for missing parties or even weddings without prompting undue curiosity. A quiet, self-contained character around his colleagues, he appeared to them content to stay in watching television at the redbrick home he shared with Galina, 50, and their 17-year-old son on Hendrik Marsmanstraat in the centre of a small estate of cheap modern housing in Almere, a city east of Amsterdam. On 11 December 2015 Motamed had tested his wife\u2019s patience by refusing to go to his brother-in-law\u2019s funeral in France \u2013 but he had been right to watch his step that Friday. Two men who had been hired to kill him were sitting outside his home in their stolen BMW, prosecutors would later tell a court. Motamed was saved that day by a late-morning appointment which meant he broke with his usual practice of leaving the house at 6.45am. The assassins, hoping to get to him in the quiet gloom of the morning, were captured on CCTV driving out of Hendrik Marsmanstraat having missed their moment. But Motamed\u2019s luck soon ran out. The following Tuesday, as he emerged from his house into the cold winter air, jogging the few yards from doorstep to bus stop, his killer emerged from the blue BMW to shoot him in the head at point-blank range, before returning to the car and speeding off. Two men, Anouar Aoulad-Buochea, 29, and Moreo Menso, 36, are currently on trial for the murder, an alleged contract killing the Dutch police believe was directed by notorious gangster Naoufal Fassih, known as Noffel on the street, who is already serving an 18-year sentence for arranging a murder for cash. All three men deny involvement. The men accused of the murder had no idea who or why Motamed needed to \u201csleep\u201d, as it was termed in one of a cache of unencrypted BlackBerry messages, revealed in court evidence. Local police were initially baffled about the motive. But this week the Dutch state made public that they now believe what Motamed\u2019s wife had insisted to police as she was driven to the hospital on the day of her husband\u2019s death: the killing had been ordered by the Iranian government. The killing has opened the eyes of the world to a pattern of Iranian hit jobs, often executed through criminal gangs, that has been seized upon by critics of Iran. To them, the killings raise fresh questions about the trust placed in the country to keep to the contentious accord under which Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia agreed to lift economic sanctions in return for Tehran lowering its nuclear ambitions. The US administration, which pulled out of the deal last year, with the president, Donald Trump, labelling it \u201crotten\u201d, seized on the development. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the US would redouble its efforts \u201cto put real pressure on Iran\u201d. Motamed\u2019s death was, according to a letter to the Dutch parliament, one of two murders of opponents of the Iranian regime on Dutch territory, alongside the 2017 shooting of Ahmad Mola Nissi, the leader of a separatist movement from the Iranian region of Ahwaz, who was found dead by his son Khaled on the doorstep of the family home in The Hague.

Among the dead was the second-in-command to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran\u2019s supreme leader. Samadi had long known he was on a death list, although he only confided his real name to Galina in 2000, five years into their marriage, and he had withheld the full truth from his son, pledging to tell all when he turned 18. Samadi had avoided events organised by his Afghan wife\u2019s family for fear of pictures of his face emerging on social media. One photograph, taken at his son\u2019s school graduation, appeared on his niece\u2019s Facebook page but he allowed it to be left there \u201cbecause he had grown older and grey\u201d, and \u201cno one would recognise him any more\u201d, according to the Dutch newspaper, Het Parool.

Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said that, since the revelation by the government, his intelligence agency was now involved in intense efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian interference in Europe.

They left by choice, too \u2013 unwilling to marry other fighters appointed by the group after their own husbands had died. Their stories challenge the dominant narrative around Boko Haram, shaped by the global outcry over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/12/three-years-after-chibok-boko-haram-deploys-children-as-suicide-bombers\" title=\"\">Chibok schoolgirls\u2019 kidnapping</a>, which holds that women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/nigeria-boko-haram-abductions-chitra-nagarajan\" title=\"\">only join by force</a>, and that, similarly, only those who were abducted can be regarded as genuine victims. Returning from Nigeria, I met a group of Swiss women who regularly spend their holidays doing freelance volunteer work with female victims of Boko Haram. \u201cWe only help the ones who were kidnapped,\u201d one pointedly told me.</p> <p>But the circumstances that propel women such as Zahra and Amina into and out of Boko Haram show the limits of the neat categories of victim and perpetrator. In the early days of the insurgency, many women found the movement appealing because it offered alternatives to the patriarchy endorsed by their conservative families. The group\u2019s leaders supported lower dowries, which meant more young women could choose husbands from among their peers, rather than the greying, financially secure men they would be traditionally compelled to marry. And while the militants were only able to provide for them so generously by looting and pillaging, some women felt the Nigerian state\u2019s corruption justified these abuses. Life in the forest felt freer and more dignified than living in the dust of an internally displaced persons\u2019 (IDP) camp, dependent on international aid groups for a meal a day.</p> <p>Even now, Zahra\u2019s and Amina\u2019s thinking about the group \u2013 their belief that returning to the militants would improve their lives \u2013 is mostly a calculus of immediate survival. Dalori II, the camp where they live, like most in the city, is chronically short on food, and across satellite camps in the region groups such as Amnesty International have <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/nigeria-starving-women-raped-by-soldiers-and-militia-who-claim-to-be-rescuing-them/\" title=\"\">documented</a> an epidemic of rape and sexual exploitation. Some progress has been made to curtail these abuses, and humanitarian groups have tried to adjust food distribution practices to blunt the potential for abuse, but this has only changed the dynamic of the exploitation. \u201cYou have to become a harlot to stay in the camps,\u201d says Amina.</p> <p>One reason Zahra says she was glad to leave the militants was because she saw that their blind rejection of teaching in English was harming her children: \u201cIt does not benefit them to stay home. It\u2019s better for them to learn.\u201d She assumed that in Maiduguri, her kids would be able to attend school. But camp managers in Dalori II dismantled the one school on its premises, claiming it was no longer needed since people would be returning to their villages. But nobody has gone home, and now there is no school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/millions-uprooted-boko-haram-lake-chad-basin-nigeria-cameroon-niger-photo-essay\">What next for the millions uprooted by Boko Haram? \u2013 photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The northeast Nigerian state of Borno is now a vast patchwork of towns and villages with few men, a whole sub-society of single mothers trying to cope as breadwinners in areas with collapsed economies without their husbands\u2019 protection and support. Some reintegration programmes offer skills training, but embroidering and selling a cap a month neither enables a woman to feed three children nor does it protect her from rape after dark. Plus, some international groups devote funds and attention to what they call \u201ccountering extremism\u201d, with extremism often conceived in an amorphous way that views ideology, rather than a complex patchwork of political grievance and social frustrations, as a root cause of the violence.</p> <p>While ending the insurgency and countering the militants\u2019 appeal is obviously vital, it is also essential to recognise what precisely has guided women to join the militants in the first place. This has wider implications for the whole of the northeast, not just displaced women in the camps, or former Boko Haram women, but all women, who are trying to cope with conditions so impoverished and limiting that, sometimes, joining a militant group appears to offer a way out.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Zahra\u2019s and Amina\u2019s names have been changed</em></p> <p>\u2022 Azadeh Moaveni is senior gender analyst for the International Crisis Group and a former Middle East correspondent for Time magazine.

Their stories challenge the dominant narrative around Boko Haram, shaped by the global outcry over the Chibok schoolgirls\u2019 kidnapping, which holds that women only join by force, and that, similarly, only those who were abducted can be regarded as genuine victims. Returning from Nigeria, I met a group of Swiss women who regularly spend their holidays doing freelance volunteer work with female victims of Boko Haram. \u201cWe only help the ones who were kidnapped,\u201d one pointedly told me. But the circumstances that propel women such as Zahra and Amina into and out of Boko Haram show the limits of the neat categories of victim and perpetrator. In the early days of the insurgency, many women found the movement appealing because it offered alternatives to the patriarchy endorsed by their conservative families. The group\u2019s leaders supported lower dowries, which meant more young women could choose husbands from among their peers, rather than the greying, financially secure men they would be traditionally compelled to marry. And while the militants were only able to provide for them so generously by looting and pillaging, some women felt the Nigerian state\u2019s corruption justified these abuses. Life in the forest felt freer and more dignified than living in the dust of an internally displaced persons\u2019 (IDP) camp, dependent on international aid groups for a meal a day. Even now, Zahra\u2019s and Amina\u2019s thinking about the group \u2013 their belief that returning to the militants would improve their lives \u2013 is mostly a calculus of immediate survival. Dalori II, the camp where they live, like most in the city, is chronically short on food, and across satellite camps in the region groups such as Amnesty International have documented an epidemic of rape and sexual exploitation. Some progress has been made to curtail these abuses, and humanitarian groups have tried to adjust food distribution practices to blunt the potential for abuse, but this has only changed the dynamic of the exploitation. \u201cYou have to become a harlot to stay in the camps,\u201d says Amina. One reason Zahra says she was glad to leave the militants was because she saw that their blind rejection of teaching in English was harming her children: \u201cIt does not benefit them to stay home. It\u2019s better for them to learn.\u201d She assumed that in Maiduguri, her kids would be able to attend school. But camp managers in Dalori II dismantled the one school on its premises, claiming it was no longer needed since people would be returning to their villages. But nobody has gone home, and now there is no school. The northeast Nigerian state of Borno is now a vast patchwork of towns and villages with few men, a whole sub-society of single mothers trying to cope as breadwinners in areas with collapsed economies without their husbands\u2019 protection and support. Some reintegration programmes offer skills training, but embroidering and selling a cap a month neither enables a woman to feed three children nor does it protect her from rape after dark. Plus, some international groups devote funds and attention to what they call \u201ccountering extremism\u201d, with extremism often conceived in an amorphous way that views ideology, rather than a complex patchwork of political grievance and social frustrations, as a root cause of the violence. While ending the insurgency and countering the militants\u2019 appeal is obviously vital, it is also essential to recognise what precisely has guided women to join the militants in the first place. This has wider implications for the whole of the northeast, not just displaced women in the camps, or former Boko Haram women, but all women, who are trying to cope with conditions so impoverished and limiting that, sometimes, joining a militant group appears to offer a way out. \u2022 Zahra\u2019s and Amina\u2019s names have been changed \u2022 Azadeh Moaveni is senior gender analyst for the International Crisis Group and a former Middle East correspondent for Time magazine.

      "body": "<p>Ministers and public health experts have long been telling us we eat too much sugar, saturated fat and salt but less attention has been paid to the size of the portions on the plate. Now a new guide to portion sizes warning that people are eating too much without realising has been launched by nutritionists, to suggest how much food people should eat during the day to stay healthy and help combat the obesity crisis.</p> <p>The British Nutrition Foundation\u2019s (BNF) guide is designed, it says, to complement the government advice on the sorts of foods to eat, as laid out in the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-eatwell-guide/\">Eatwell Guide</a>. It spells out how much of each sort of food \u2013 starchy carbohydrates, protein, dairy, fruit and vegetables and oils and spreads \u2013 constitute a healthy diet within the 2,000 calories a day that women need and 2,500 for men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/food_portion_hands/giv-3902oJffv9Wj6zcC/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/food_portion_hands/giv-3902oJffv9Wj6zcC/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Super-sizing is clearly out but portion sizes are a puzzle to many. While an apple or a banana is a portion in itself, the right amount of pasta or rice to cook in the interests of staying a healthy weight is more difficult to assess. Recipes vary and many people take a guess and throw more into the saucepan if they feel particularly hungry. The BNF, in its <a href=\"http://nutrition.org.uk/findyourbalance\">new guide</a>, says the answer is 65g to 75g dry weight (180g when cooked) \u2013 or about the amount that would fit in two cupped hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee808b8ddc07818f8a4a732c8b69b8d35c7a4955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee808b8ddc07818f8a4a732c8b69b8d35c7a4955/0_0_4272_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The BNF recommends 65g to 75g dry weight of pasta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The BNF recommends 65g to 75g dry weight of pasta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luciano Mortula/Getty Images/Hemera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The guide offers spoon and hand measurements, which may be easier in daily life than continually getting out the scales. The suggested single portion of a grilled chicken breast, a cooked salmon fillet or a cooked steak is \u201cabout half the size of your hand\u201d. This acknowledges that bigger adults, with bigger hands, will need larger portions. Cheddar cheese should be no more than \u201cabout the size of two thumbs together\u201d and a baked potato \u201cabout the size of your fist\u201d.</p> <p>The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-eatwell-guide/\">Eatwell Guide</a>, says our diet should be made up of one-third fruit and vegetables, one-third starchy carbohydrates and the rest divided between dairy and protein. That means, says the BNF, we can eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables, three to four of starchy carbohydrates such as potatoes, bread, rice and pasta (which in line with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/10/high-fibre-diets-cut-heart-disease-risk-landmark-study-finds\"> research this week</a> should be wholegrain), and two to three portions each of protein foods and of dairy or alternatives and stay healthy without overdoing the calories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/10/how-to-get-your-daily-30g-of-fibre\">How to get your daily 30g of fibre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We do not think much about portion sizes, says Bridget Benelam, a nutrition scientist with the BNF. \u201cThe amount we put on our plate typically depends on the portion size we are used to consuming, how hungry we feel and how much is offered as a helping at a restaurant table or in a packet or ready meal.\u201d</p> <p>She says the BNF looked at the data from the national diet and nutrition survey and found lots of variations in the sizes of people\u2019s portions. \u201cOur suggested portion size for cooked pasta is 180g (254 calories) but, for example, when we looked at portion sizes for spaghetti, the most commonly consumed size was 230g (324 calories), and about 10% of the sample we looked at were consuming 350g as a portion, which would provide nearly 500 calories from the pasta alone, before sauces and sides were added to the meal,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The guide says an easy way to measure spaghetti is to use your thumb and index finger to hold a bunch the size of a pound coin.</p> <p>It suggests smaller portion measures for snacks, such as 20g of unsalted nuts and seeds or the amount that fits into the palm of the hand, which will be between 113 and 137 calories. Also snack size is 55g of reduced-fat hummus \u2013 about two tablespoons, four cooked cocktail sausages or two falafel (40g and 113 calories).</p> <p>A portion of fruit or vegetables \u2013 of which we should eat at least five a day \u2013 could be two plums, two satsumas, seven strawberries, three heaped serving spoons of peas or carrots, one medium tomato or three sticks of celery.</p> <p>If you do include treats, says the guide, they should be small, at around 100 to 150 calories, and not too frequent. Their examples include a small chocolate biscuit bar, a small multipack bag of crisps, four small squares of chocolate (20g) or a mini muffin.</p> <p>The guidance was produced with help from a panel of experts, says the BNF, and funding from major food companies and supermarkets including Waitrose, Tesco and Marks and Spencer.</p> <h2><strong>Portion size recommendations</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 A recommended day includes a breakfast of two wheat biscuits with semi-skimmed milk, followed by a banana and small 150ml glass of orange juice. Lunch is a baked potato about the size of your fist, with tuna mayonnaise made with a medium-sized tin of tuna. A cereal bowl full of mixed salad can also be eaten as part of your midday meal, as well as two tangerines. Dinner is spaghetti bolognese served with the amount of cooked pasta that would fit in two hands cupped together, and three serving spoons or more of broccoli. Dessert can be a small pot of low fat fruit yoghurt. Throughout the day people are advised to snack on fruit, such as an apple, as well as two oatcakes and reduced fat soft cheese. This meal plan equates to seven portions of fruit and vegetables, four portions of starchy foods, two portions of protein and three portions of dairy.</p> <p>\u2022 A recommended spaghetti bolognese recipe involves 75g of uncooked spaghetti per person. Advice states that you can measure a portion for one by using your finger and thumb to make a hole the size of a \u00a31 coin. However, the amount of pasta needed may go up if you\u2019re cooking for someone with higher calorie needs. The portion size of raw mince advised is about 125g but this can be halved in a dish with other ingredients or meat can be replaced with pulses and other vegetarian options. It\u2019s recommended that a lot of vegetables are added to the bolognese sauce, such as onions, tomatoes and celery.</p> <p>\u2022 Another recommended recipe is fish pie, with guidance suggesting about 180g of mashed potato per person (about three average sized potatoes) and around 120-200g of raw fish per person.

      "bodyText": "Ministers and public health experts have long been telling us we eat too much sugar, saturated fat and salt but less attention has been paid to the size of the portions on the plate. Now a new guide to portion sizes warning that people are eating too much without realising has been launched by nutritionists, to suggest how much food people should eat during the day to stay healthy and help combat the obesity crisis. The British Nutrition Foundation\u2019s (BNF) guide is designed, it says, to complement the government advice on the sorts of foods to eat, as laid out in the Eatwell Guide. It spells out how much of each sort of food \u2013 starchy carbohydrates, protein, dairy, fruit and vegetables and oils and spreads \u2013 constitute a healthy diet within the 2,000 calories a day that women need and 2,500 for men. Super-sizing is clearly out but portion sizes are a puzzle to many. While an apple or a banana is a portion in itself, the right amount of pasta or rice to cook in the interests of staying a healthy weight is more difficult to assess. Recipes vary and many people take a guess and throw more into the saucepan if they feel particularly hungry. The BNF, in its new guide, says the answer is 65g to 75g dry weight (180g when cooked) \u2013 or about the amount that would fit in two cupped hands. The guide offers spoon and hand measurements, which may be easier in daily life than continually getting out the scales. The suggested single portion of a grilled chicken breast, a cooked salmon fillet or a cooked steak is \u201cabout half the size of your hand\u201d. This acknowledges that bigger adults, with bigger hands, will need larger portions. Cheddar cheese should be no more than \u201cabout the size of two thumbs together\u201d and a baked potato \u201cabout the size of your fist\u201d. The government\u2019s Eatwell Guide, says our diet should be made up of one-third fruit and vegetables, one-third starchy carbohydrates and the rest divided between dairy and protein. That means, says the BNF, we can eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables, three to four of starchy carbohydrates such as potatoes, bread, rice and pasta (which in line with research this week should be wholegrain), and two to three portions each of protein foods and of dairy or alternatives and stay healthy without overdoing the calories. We do not think much about portion sizes, says Bridget Benelam, a nutrition scientist with the BNF. \u201cThe amount we put on our plate typically depends on the portion size we are used to consuming, how hungry we feel and how much is offered as a helping at a restaurant table or in a packet or ready meal.\u201d She says the BNF looked at the data from the national diet and nutrition survey and found lots of variations in the sizes of people\u2019s portions. \u201cOur suggested portion size for cooked pasta is 180g (254 calories) but, for example, when we looked at portion sizes for spaghetti, the most commonly consumed size was 230g (324 calories), and about 10% of the sample we looked at were consuming 350g as a portion, which would provide nearly 500 calories from the pasta alone, before sauces and sides were added to the meal,\u201d she said. The guide says an easy way to measure spaghetti is to use your thumb and index finger to hold a bunch the size of a pound coin. It suggests smaller portion measures for snacks, such as 20g of unsalted nuts and seeds or the amount that fits into the palm of the hand, which will be between 113 and 137 calories. Also snack size is 55g of reduced-fat hummus \u2013 about two tablespoons, four cooked cocktail sausages or two falafel (40g and 113 calories). A portion of fruit or vegetables \u2013 of which we should eat at least five a day \u2013 could be two plums, two satsumas, seven strawberries, three heaped serving spoons of peas or carrots, one medium tomato or three sticks of celery. If you do include treats, says the guide, they should be small, at around 100 to 150 calories, and not too frequent. Their examples include a small chocolate biscuit bar, a small multipack bag of crisps, four small squares of chocolate (20g) or a mini muffin. The guidance was produced with help from a panel of experts, says the BNF, and funding from major food companies and supermarkets including Waitrose, Tesco and Marks and Spencer. Portion size recommendations \u2022 A recommended day includes a breakfast of two wheat biscuits with semi-skimmed milk, followed by a banana and small 150ml glass of orange juice. Lunch is a baked potato about the size of your fist, with tuna mayonnaise made with a medium-sized tin of tuna. A cereal bowl full of mixed salad can also be eaten as part of your midday meal, as well as two tangerines. Dinner is spaghetti bolognese served with the amount of cooked pasta that would fit in two hands cupped together, and three serving spoons or more of broccoli. Dessert can be a small pot of low fat fruit yoghurt. Throughout the day people are advised to snack on fruit, such as an apple, as well as two oatcakes and reduced fat soft cheese. This meal plan equates to seven portions of fruit and vegetables, four portions of starchy foods, two portions of protein and three portions of dairy. \u2022 A recommended spaghetti bolognese recipe involves 75g of uncooked spaghetti per person. Advice states that you can measure a portion for one by using your finger and thumb to make a hole the size of a \u00a31 coin. However, the amount of pasta needed may go up if you\u2019re cooking for someone with higher calorie needs. The portion size of raw mince advised is about 125g but this can be halved in a dish with other ingredients or meat can be replaced with pulses and other vegetarian options. It\u2019s recommended that a lot of vegetables are added to the bolognese sauce, such as onions, tomatoes and celery. \u2022 Another recommended recipe is fish pie, with guidance suggesting about 180g of mashed potato per person (about three average sized potatoes) and around 120-200g of raw fish per person. It\u2019s also advise to add vegetables such as frozen peas or spinach. All dishes should be served with plenty of cooked vegetables or salad.",

      "bodyText": "The wife of the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has urged human rights campaigners to highlight Japanese prosecutors\u2019 \u201cdraconian\u201d treatment of her husband during his prolonged detention on charges of financial misconduct. In a nine-page letter to the Japan office of Human Rights Watch, Carole Ghosn alleged that prosecutors have subjected her husband to hours of daily interrogation in order to extract a confession. The letter also claims that Ghosn, who was briefly taken ill with a fever last week, is being held in an unheated cell that is lit even at night and is being denied his daily medication. Ghosn, who has been in detention since his arrest on 19 November, faces two charges of under-reporting his salary by tens of millions of dollars, apparently to avoid criticism from Nissan employees that he was paid too much. A third charge alleges that he transferred personal investment losses to Nissan and used company funds to make payments to a Saudi business associate. In his first appearance since his arrest, Ghosn last week proclaimed his innocence during a special court session, claiming that he had been \u201cwrongly accused\u201d and \u201cunfairly detained\u201d. His lengthy detention has sparked international criticism of Japan\u2019s \u201chostage justice\u201d system, which permits prosecutors to re-arrest suspects over separate allegations and keep them in detention for long periods with the aim of extracting a confession. More than 99% of criminal cases in Japan end in a conviction, with most secured through confessions. \u201cIn Japan, suspects are routinely and repeatedly interrogated by prosecutors outside the presence of their lawyers; have no possibility for bail until after they have been indicted; have limited access to counsel; and are forced to sit and listen to interrogations even when they choose to exercise their right to remain silent,\u201d Carole Ghosn said in her letter. \u201cMy husband\u2019s treatment is a case study in the realities of this draconian system.

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog details events in the first and second episodes of the third season of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/true-detective\">True Detective</a>, which airs on Sunday nights on HBO in the US, and Mondays in the UK on Sky Atlantic at 2am and 9pm.</em></p> <p>A child is cycling down a suburban street in Arkansas. An old man gets dressed while a Dictaphone sits on his nightstand. A younger version of the man confidently tells an interviewer he remembers everything. Welcome to the third season of True Detective, where memories, violence and three separate timelines converge. The primary action is set in 1980 and concerns the Purcell case, which centres on the disappearance and apparent murder of two children. Then there\u2019s a deposition being taken 10 years after that, and another interview \u2013 this time for a TV documentary about the case \u2013 set in 2015. The time-travelling gentleman is Wayne David \u201cPurple\u201d Hays (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/12/mahershala-ali-i-had-to-protect-myself-from-peoples-fear-of-me\">Mahershala Ali</a>), a Vietnam veteran turned detective, who originally investigated the murder(s) with his partner, Roland West.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018What you don\u2019t remember you can\u2019t know you don\u2019t remember\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e45669d85442a0f43865b18c59ec87fd15f974f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e45669d85442a0f43865b18c59ec87fd15f974f1/0_307_5075_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Purcell kids before their disappearance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Purcell kids before their disappearance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the 1990 deposition we learn that the Arkansas state police are reopening the Purcell case and potentially looking to overturn the conviction Hays and West secured a decade earlier. Hays has memory problems, we\u2019re told, and we get a flash forward to 2015, where an elderly Hays is playing a recording he has made for himself. \u201cLook at your pictures, take notes,\u201d he says. He\u2019s gearing himself up to give a full account. The question does linger: why is he bothering to do this?</p> <p>In 1990, he is recalling 7 November 1980 \u2013 the night the Purcell kids disappeared and the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/steve-mcqueen\">Steve McQueen</a> died. We see their father, Tom, fixing his car while agreeing to let the children cycle up to a park \u2013 ostensibly to see their friend Ronny\u2019s new dog. \u201cBack by sundown!\u201d is the only caveat. He won\u2019t see them again. The kids leave at 4pm and ride past school friends, a man in a buggy pulling what looks like a load of junk and three surly punks driving around in a purple VW Beetle. Tom Purcell (played by Scoot McNairy) rings around the parents of the kids\u2019 friends. Ronny tells them the kids didn\u2019t arrange to see the dog today.</p> <p>Hays says he and West were investigating some burglaries but on the night of the disappearance we see them shooting at rats in a car park. Like our old friends Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, it seems Hays is not an entirely reliable narrator. In a local park, the purple VW gang are skulling cans of beer and messing around on a bike that looks a lot like Will Purcell\u2019s \u2013 they are definitely implicated now. As Will\u2019s dad drives around to find the kids he spots the man in the buggy \u2013 suspect No 2.

He looks nervy and unsure \u2013 the opposite of his 1990 self. We find out that Hays\u2019s late wife Amelia, a teacher turned investigative journalist, had written a book about the case called Life, Death and the Harvest Moon, which became a classic of American non-fiction writing. \u201cIt used to be before Nam and after Nam. Then it became before the Purcell case and after,\u201d says Hays. He breaks down when he speaks about his wife. Back in 1980 we find out Tom Purcell\u2019s wife Lucy(Mamie Gummer) is absent from the kids\u2019 lives. Could the kids be with her? No, he says, she\u2019s out with her friends. She comes back drunk and berates Tom. </p> <p>Purcell himself becomes our third suspect after the cops search his house and find a couple of things. The first is a stash of Playboys under Will\u2019s bed, and a separate stack of books including a Scout\u2019s Handbook and something called The Forests of Leng. Tom Purcell says the soft porn isn\u2019t his. We find out that the kid\u2019s second cousin Dan O\u2019Brien (suspect number four) was staying in Will\u2019s room, and now lives in Missouri. There\u2019s something else: a hole has been drilled into the back of the wardrobe, offering a view of Julie\u2019s room. </p> <h2>\u2018Black Sabbath.

She will become Hays\u2019s wife, but in 1980 she is the Purcell kids\u2019 teacher. The VW gang attend the same high school and are interviewed by Hays and West, the latter of whom takes a dislike to one of their Black Sabbath T-shirts. \u201cBlack Sabbath. What\u2019s a black sabbath?\u201d asks West. \u201cIt\u2019s a satanic mass,\u201d says Hays. \u201cI think it\u2019s just their name,\u201d adds a non-plussed teen. The boys\u2019 accounts don\u2019t stack up, however, and they are definitely under suspicion.</p> <p>As the search continues back in 1980, Hays goes off on his own. He was part of the long-range reconnaissance patrols in Vietnam, so if anyone can find the kids, it\u2019s him. And he does \u2013 well, Will at least. By following a trail of grass dolls holding what look like wedding bouquets, Hays finds his way to a cave. Inside, he finds Will\u2019s lifeless body, with his hands placed in a prayer position. There is no sign of his sister. In 1990, we find out that a set of fingerprints have showed up during a spate of burglaries in Arkansas: they belong to Julie Purcell.</p> <h2>\u2018You ever been some place you can\u2019t leave and can\u2019t stay, both at the same time?\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f599d5aa96afaf6cd2f73f9bfcf3e520c42e70c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f599d5aa96afaf6cd2f73f9bfcf3e520c42e70c/0_0_4990_3464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hays and West interrogate Woodard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What the hell is the right answer?\u2019 ...

He has two kids but doesn\u2019t know where they are. Back in 2015, Hays tells his son that the interview helps him stay in touch with memories of his wife. \u201cI\u2019m remembering things.

West and Hays attend Will\u2019s funeral and run into the second cousin, Dan, who admits he might have forgotten the Playboys under the bed. He doesn\u2019t remember the kids having any strange interactions with men. He does remember them playing outside a lot to get away from his rowing parents.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog details events in the first and second episodes of the third season of True Detective, which airs on Sunday nights on HBO in the US, and Mondays in the UK on Sky Atlantic at 2am and 9pm. A child is cycling down a suburban street in Arkansas. An old man gets dressed while a Dictaphone sits on his nightstand. A younger version of the man confidently tells an interviewer he remembers everything. Welcome to the third season of True Detective, where memories, violence and three separate timelines converge. The primary action is set in 1980 and concerns the Purcell case, which centres on the disappearance and apparent murder of two children. Then there\u2019s a deposition being taken 10 years after that, and another interview \u2013 this time for a TV documentary about the case \u2013 set in 2015. The time-travelling gentleman is Wayne David \u201cPurple\u201d Hays (Mahershala Ali), a Vietnam veteran turned detective, who originally investigated the murder(s) with his partner, Roland West. \u2018What you don\u2019t remember you can\u2019t know you don\u2019t remember\u2019 At the 1990 deposition we learn that the Arkansas state police are reopening the Purcell case and potentially looking to overturn the conviction Hays and West secured a decade earlier. Hays has memory problems, we\u2019re told, and we get a flash forward to 2015, where an elderly Hays is playing a recording he has made for himself. \u201cLook at your pictures, take notes,\u201d he says. He\u2019s gearing himself up to give a full account. The question does linger: why is he bothering to do this? In 1990, he is recalling 7 November 1980 \u2013 the night the Purcell kids disappeared and the day Steve McQueen died. We see their father, Tom, fixing his car while agreeing to let the children cycle up to a park \u2013 ostensibly to see their friend Ronny\u2019s new dog. \u201cBack by sundown!\u201d is the only caveat. He won\u2019t see them again. The kids leave at 4pm and ride past school friends, a man in a buggy pulling what looks like a load of junk and three surly punks driving around in a purple VW Beetle. Tom Purcell (played by Scoot McNairy) rings around the parents of the kids\u2019 friends. Ronny tells them the kids didn\u2019t arrange to see the dog today. Hays says he and West were investigating some burglaries but on the night of the disappearance we see them shooting at rats in a car park. Like our old friends Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, it seems Hays is not an entirely reliable narrator. In a local park, the purple VW gang are skulling cans of beer and messing around on a bike that looks a lot like Will Purcell\u2019s \u2013 they are definitely implicated now. As Will\u2019s dad drives around to find the kids he spots the man in the buggy \u2013 suspect No 2. As Hays and West drive around engaging in some Vincent-and-Jules-style banter, they get the call. \u2018Is this set up OK for you?\u2019 In 2015, Hays is about to be interviewed for the TV show. He looks nervy and unsure \u2013 the opposite of his 1990 self. We find out that Hays\u2019s late wife Amelia, a teacher turned investigative journalist, had written a book about the case called Life, Death and the Harvest Moon, which became a classic of American non-fiction writing. \u201cIt used to be before Nam and after Nam. Then it became before the Purcell case and after,\u201d says Hays. He breaks down when he speaks about his wife. Back in 1980 we find out Tom Purcell\u2019s wife Lucy(Mamie Gummer) is absent from the kids\u2019 lives. Could the kids be with her? No, he says, she\u2019s out with her friends. She comes back drunk and berates Tom. Purcell himself becomes our third suspect after the cops search his house and find a couple of things. The first is a stash of Playboys under Will\u2019s bed, and a separate stack of books including a Scout\u2019s Handbook and something called The Forests of Leng. Tom Purcell says the soft porn isn\u2019t his. We find out that the kid\u2019s second cousin Dan O\u2019Brien (suspect number four) was staying in Will\u2019s room, and now lives in Missouri. There\u2019s something else: a hole has been drilled into the back of the wardrobe, offering a view of Julie\u2019s room. \u2018Black Sabbath. What\u2019s a black sabbath?\u2019 The next day, Hays and West visit Will and Julie\u2019s school where they meet Amelia Reardon for the first time. She will become Hays\u2019s wife, but in 1980 she is the Purcell kids\u2019 teacher. The VW gang attend the same high school and are interviewed by Hays and West, the latter of whom takes a dislike to one of their Black Sabbath T-shirts. \u201cBlack Sabbath. What\u2019s a black sabbath?\u201d asks West. \u201cIt\u2019s a satanic mass,\u201d says Hays. \u201cI think it\u2019s just their name,\u201d adds a non-plussed teen.

Parts of central Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania are forecast to experience a severe heatwave until Thursday, with the hot weather contracting to New South Wales and Queensland on Friday and Saturday. Tour Down Under organisers announced a plan to shorten the second stage between Norwood in Adelaide and Angaston in the Barossa Valley on Wednesday by 26.9km due to extreme heat. They have also cut 3.4km out of the end of the first stage on Tuesday due to severe winds. Temperatures are forecast to top 40C, which race director Mike Turtur said would create \u201cextremely challenging\u201d conditions for both riders and spectators. \u201cThe safety and welfare of the riders, spectators and everyone involved with the race is always our primary concern,\u201d he said. The hottest spot in NSW will be Menindee, near Broken Hill, with forecast temperatures of 45C on Monday rising to 47C on Thursday, and Friday expected to contribute to more fish deaths. As many as 1m fish are believed to have died in two mass fish kills in the Menindee Lakes since December. The heatwave is caused by a strong high-pressure system that has dragged hot air from the Pilbara in Western Australia, where temperatures in Marble Bar have been above 40C since mid-December, said Ashleigh Langey from the Bureau of Meteorology. Temperatures in Sydney are expected to peak on Friday at 34C, with overnight temperatures remaining as high as 22C. Penrith in the western suburbs is forecast to reach 45C on Friday. \u201cIt will be quite hard to sleep,\u201d Langey said. Players in the Australian Open will struggle through temperatures of 35C in Melbourne on Monday and Tuesday, but BoM senior forecaster Michael Efron said a combination of afternoon sea breezes and weak northerly winds would protect the city from the worst of the heatwave. But he said the UV ratings would remain extreme over much of the state, \u201cso if you\u2019re outside watching the tennis, do slip slop slap\u201d. The tournament introduced a new heat policy this year after players suffered from heat exhaustion in 2018, which includes suspending play on outside courts and allowing players in men\u2019s singles matches to take a 10-minute break during extreme heat. Efron said hot weather records could be broken in northern Victoria, with temperatures of 46C forecast for Mildura on Tuesday and Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca on Wednesday. Albury-Wodonga, Shepparton and Wangaratta are also forecast to be very hot. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Mildura is 46.9C. \u201cIf we get to 47C in the next couple of days then we will be breaking not just January records but all-time hot weather records as well,\u201d Efron said.

But with hardliners in positions of influence on both sides, the potential for an unplanned clash remains high, particularly in the crowded sea lanes of the Gulf or in Iraq. The tough talk from Bolton and Pompeo has added to concerns that Baghdad could again become a proxy battleground between the US and Iranian interests, much as it was during the height of the sectarian chaos, when a full-blown proxy war played out across the country. Throughout much of the US military presence in Iraq, the giant US embassy in the Iraqi capital\u2019s fortified Green Zone was a target for Shia militias, which regularly rained in rockets and mortars from as far as seven miles away. Two of the main protagonists from 2007 to 2011, Asa\u2019ib ahl al-Haq and Kataib Hezbollah, both proxies of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps, have gained strength in Baghdad in the past four years, and exert considerable influence across political and security spheres.

It would get you 80 or 90 Labour votes.\u201d Separately, a cross-party group of MPs from the Lib Dems, Labour, Conservatives and SNP will on Monday publish two draft bills designed to pave the way for a new referendum. One of these would give voters the option of voting for the government\u2019s deal or staying in the EU. Among those behind the plan is the Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who was accused by some newspapers on Sunday of leading a coup against Brexit in alliance with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. Grieve, whose amendment obliging May to respond to the defeat of her plan within three days was passed by MPs last week, told the Guardian the reports were \u201crubbish\u201d, and had seen him receive death threats. \u201cI can emphatically say it is totally untrue that I am in a conspiracy with the Speaker either to stop Brexit or to change the standing orders of the house,\u201d he said.",

It was designed in the 1960s, when only about 5% of school-leavers went on to study at university, and there\u2019s an urgent need for reform and greater transparency.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/29/one-third-18-year-old-university-applicants-get-unconditional-offer\">One-third of 18-year-old university applicants get unconditional offer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the authors face an uphill struggle winning over educationalists wedded to the current system because of what one vice-chancellor described as \u201cinstitutional conservatism\u201d among both school and university leaders.</p> <p>Previous pushes for reform, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/28/university-admissions-changes-scrapped\">most recently in 2012</a>, have been derailed by opposition from university leaders and the Ucas admissions service. But changes to funding and the removal of institutional limits on undergraduate recruitment have shifted admissions towards the interest of applicants.</p> <p>UCU\u2019s efforts to reopen the discussion were backed by Gordon Marsden, Labour\u2019s shadow higher education minister.</p> <p>\u201cAn urgent debate needs to be had on post-qualification admissions. This government has failed to take meaningful action to improve access, and the current university admissions system too often makes it impossible for disadvantaged pupils to reach their full potential,\u201d Marsden said.</p> <p>\u201cFrom unreliable predicted grades that can underestimate the ability of disadvantaged students, to the skyrocketing number of unconditional offers, the current system is in need of a serious rethink if it is to give every student the chance to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, sixth-formers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland apply for places on courses by January, months before sitting their exams in early summer. The timing forces applicants and universities to base their decisions on teachers\u2019 predictions of likely grades \u2013 despite evidence showing those predictions to be largely inaccurate.</p> <p>By bringing forward the sitting of A-levels and similar qualifications to after Easter, and pushing back the start of term for first-year undergraduates, the authors are confident that the bulk of applications and acceptances could take place in August.</p> <p>The report says that the time between the end of exams and results being published at the start of August should be used to provide high-quality advice to school-leavers on their career options and potential courses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/08/university-chiefs-angry-elitish-student-loan-plans\">University chiefs angry over \u2018elitist\u2019 student loan plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cA higher-education system should be more than a cycle. It should be a set of support structures that enables students to make decisions about their higher-education courses and institutions,\u201d the report, by Nartey and Graeme Atherton of the National Education Opportunities Network, states.</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire and a former higher education minister under Labour, said he strongly supported post-qualification admissions, but thought the report\u2019s proposed term-date changes \u2013 with first-year students starting their courses a few weeks after other students \u2013 would be unpopular.</p> <p>\u201cWe are slowly moving towards post-qualification admissions in any case, because students are now in the driving seats,\u201d said Rammell.</p> <p>Nartey said students would be empowered by knowing their results at the point they applied, and that universities would be able to more easily and quickly select their future undergraduates.</p> <p>A shift to post-qualification applications would also end the process known as clearing, a hurried scramble for remaining places among students who failed to achieve the grades predicted by their teachers, which takes places immediately after exam results are published in mid-August.</p> <p>The change would also kill off the increasing use of unconditional offers by some institutions, which award places to students regardless of their eventual grades. Unconditional offers have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/28/top-schools-call-for-an-end-to-universities-use-of-unconditional-offers\">strongly criticised by head teachers</a> as causing disruption in schools and removing incentives for pupils to perform to their best ability.</p> <p>Nartey also said that previous research published by UCU had found that some under-represented groups, including ethnic minorities, were disadvantaged by the existing system, because their predicted A-levels may not have matched their true abilities.</p> <p>\u201cStudents aren\u2019t able to be broad or bold in their applications, because they didn\u2019t know what they may have achieved,\u201d Nartey said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/07/uk-university-professors-black-minority-ethnic\">UK universities making slow progress on equality, data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for Universities UK \u2013 which represents the bulk of British universities \u2013 said in response to the report: \u201cOne reason universities decided not adopt a new model was because disadvantaged students would not have access to one of their best sources of information for advice on university applications, their school or college, in the time they need to make a decision.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognise that there are still challenges to address, including improving information for students and accuracy of predicted grades, and we will be reviewing new information on this topic from Ucas with interest when it is published.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/oct/31/ucas-university-admissions-process-rich\">2011 study by Ucas</a> found that students from disadvantaged backgrounds were likely to lose out under the current system, because they had less advice and support.</p> <p>Earlier <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9541/UK-only-country-to-use-predicted-grades-for-university-admissions-study-shows?list=1676\">research by UCU</a> showed that the existing application system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is a global outlier compared to other high-performing countries, and the only one to use predicted grades as the basis for admissions.</p>",

The reforms, backed by the University and College Union, would see school-leavers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland apply for courses after seeing the results of their A-level and BTec exams or other qualifications, rather than applying months beforehand, as is currently the case. Angela Nartey, a UCU policy officer and co-author of the report, said: \u201cThe current system simply isn\u2019t fit for purpose. It was designed in the 1960s, when only about 5% of school-leavers went on to study at university, and there\u2019s an urgent need for reform and greater transparency.\u201d But the authors face an uphill struggle winning over educationalists wedded to the current system because of what one vice-chancellor described as \u201cinstitutional conservatism\u201d among both school and university leaders. Previous pushes for reform, most recently in 2012, have been derailed by opposition from university leaders and the Ucas admissions service. But changes to funding and the removal of institutional limits on undergraduate recruitment have shifted admissions towards the interest of applicants. UCU\u2019s efforts to reopen the discussion were backed by Gordon Marsden, Labour\u2019s shadow higher education minister. \u201cAn urgent debate needs to be had on post-qualification admissions. This government has failed to take meaningful action to improve access, and the current university admissions system too often makes it impossible for disadvantaged pupils to reach their full potential,\u201d Marsden said. \u201cFrom unreliable predicted grades that can underestimate the ability of disadvantaged students, to the skyrocketing number of unconditional offers, the current system is in need of a serious rethink if it is to give every student the chance to succeed.\u201d Currently, sixth-formers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland apply for places on courses by January, months before sitting their exams in early summer. The timing forces applicants and universities to base their decisions on teachers\u2019 predictions of likely grades \u2013 despite evidence showing those predictions to be largely inaccurate. By bringing forward the sitting of A-levels and similar qualifications to after Easter, and pushing back the start of term for first-year undergraduates, the authors are confident that the bulk of applications and acceptances could take place in August. The report says that the time between the end of exams and results being published at the start of August should be used to provide high-quality advice to school-leavers on their career options and potential courses. \u201cA higher-education system should be more than a cycle. It should be a set of support structures that enables students to make decisions about their higher-education courses and institutions,\u201d the report, by Nartey and Graeme Atherton of the National Education Opportunities Network, states. Bill Rammell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire and a former higher education minister under Labour, said he strongly supported post-qualification admissions, but thought the report\u2019s proposed term-date changes \u2013 with first-year students starting their courses a few weeks after other students \u2013 would be unpopular. \u201cWe are slowly moving towards post-qualification admissions in any case, because students are now in the driving seats,\u201d said Rammell. Nartey said students would be empowered by knowing their results at the point they applied, and that universities would be able to more easily and quickly select their future undergraduates. A shift to post-qualification applications would also end the process known as clearing, a hurried scramble for remaining places among students who failed to achieve the grades predicted by their teachers, which takes places immediately after exam results are published in mid-August. The change would also kill off the increasing use of unconditional offers by some institutions, which award places to students regardless of their eventual grades. Unconditional offers have been strongly criticised by head teachers as causing disruption in schools and removing incentives for pupils to perform to their best ability. Nartey also said that previous research published by UCU had found that some under-represented groups, including ethnic minorities, were disadvantaged by the existing system, because their predicted A-levels may not have matched their true abilities. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t able to be broad or bold in their applications, because they didn\u2019t know what they may have achieved,\u201d Nartey said. A spokesperson for Universities UK \u2013 which represents the bulk of British universities \u2013 said in response to the report: \u201cOne reason universities decided not adopt a new model was because disadvantaged students would not have access to one of their best sources of information for advice on university applications, their school or college, in the time they need to make a decision. \u201cWe recognise that there are still challenges to address, including improving information for students and accuracy of predicted grades, and we will be reviewing new information on this topic from Ucas with interest when it is published.\u201d A 2011 study by Ucas found that students from disadvantaged backgrounds were likely to lose out under the current system, because they had less advice and support. Earlier research by UCU showed that the existing application system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is a global outlier compared to other high-performing countries, and the only one to use predicted grades as the basis for admissions.",
