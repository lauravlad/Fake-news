      "body": "<p>Sam Gyimah, the softly-spoken former Tory minister, admitted he was still adjusting. It was just a few hours before the unassuming MP for East Surrey was unveiled as the Liberal Democrats\u2019 latest recruit at the party\u2019s Bournemouth conference. But it all felt very new.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll probably spend the next few days saying, \u2018Sam Gyimah, Liberal Democrat MP\u2019, and get used to that first,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a huge emotional side to it. I\u2019ve been involved in the Conservative party for two decades. I\u2019ve fought for the party. I have an unusual background \u2013 I\u2019m not your typical Tory recruit. I\u2019ve spent a long time evangelising about why people should look at the Conservative party seriously. It is sad that I find myself at a crossroads. I am an outcast in the Conservative party. But that\u2019s Brexit. It has divided families. The country is divided. This is a huge fault line.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long ago that Gyimah was a Tory rising star, flying up the ranks during Theresa May\u2019s tenure and fast-tracked on to the party\u2019s frontbench.</p> <p>Yet here he is, still just 43, starting afresh with Jo Swinson\u2019s party. The Tory party he joined, he says, is rapidly disappearing.</p> <p>\u201cBorn in the UK, brought up in Ghana, it was a sort of childhood of hardship and difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat attracted me to the Conservative party was these One Nation values. What has happened since the referendum, initially slowly, but increasingly accelerated over the last few months, is that it has moved away from those values. It has become more intolerant. It has become, in the desire to neutralise Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party, more doctrinaire.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Conservative party has become more intolerant and, in the desire to neutralise Nigel Farage, more doctrinaire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI listen to ministers undermining the courts. Ministers questioning experts because their views are inconvenient for what the government is saying about no deal. Or you have a government that says law enforcement is the centrepiece of its platform, and yet says in another breath that it will pick and choose what laws it chooses to respect. This is in many ways undermining key pillars of our constitution and the functioning of our democracy.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue for me is not just Brexit. It is beyond Brexit \u2013 how you conduct politics and the veering towards populism and English nationalism.\u201d</p> <p>Gyimah made headlines at the end of last year when he concluded that he could not support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, meaning he had to resign as universities and science minister. He said more serious concerns about the party emerged during the Tory leadership campaign, when he ran in order to try to create a debate about the party\u2019s direction.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was an opportunity, while the party was discussing its future, to make the case for Brexit realism, and also the case for rediscovering these values. During that process I realised there just weren\u2019t enough people who were going to fight from within to save the situation. As we saw soon after, not only did [Boris] Johnson win an overall majority on a no deal platform, but we very quickly went from a situation where the leader of the party had to be a no dealer, to anyone in government having to sign up to it. That was playing on my mind throughout the summer.\u201d</p> <p>His precarious place in the Tory ranks was brought to an end, along with that of 20 of his colleagues, when he voted to block a no deal Brexit earlier this month. That was his signal to try something different.</p> <p>\u201cThe withdrawal of the whip meant I just had to face a stark reality \u2013 being in the Conservative party now means you\u2019re signing up to no deal or hard Brexit, or you\u2019ll be cast into the wilderness. So what are your choices? Leave politics completely?</p> <p>\u201cIt feels to me that there is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October at the risk of our institutions, at the risk of our democracy, at the risk of our economy. That should not be allowed to happen.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels to me that there is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gyimah says all 21 rebels received letters from the chief whip offering them a way back in \u2013 but the letters differed. He explains: \u201cThere were three different versions of the letter. I think the one I got was the lower tier.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the letter said, I think I knew that just being realistic about the situation, I couldn\u2019t take the whip back because I will not be able to satisfy the minimum price of entry.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to spend all my time dwelling on that. The other side is, what do you do about it? That is why I\u2019m here. Centrists are being cast out of both main parties. Lots of people are politically homeless. Who can you work with to build a movement?</p> <p>\u201cWhen I spoke to Jo I thought this is a project that I can be part of. I\u2019m not looking for a harbour in a storm. I\u2019m attracted to a project to defend liberal democracy and make sure our country does not drift into the nationalistic, populist politics that we see in other democracies.\u201d</p> <p>Does he have a message for the 20 other Tory MPs thrown out for trying to block no deal?</p> <p>\u201cMy message is not just to the 20 \u2013 my message is to all of those who care about this country. The time is now. The problem we have is that the two old parties have entrenched votes and it is very difficult to budge them.</p> <p>\u201cWe need the centre to consolidate and unite if it is going to break through. This is the opportunity to try to create that new politics for the good of our country.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the settlement that comes out of Brexit should be the settlement that Nigel Farage wants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8496bc31694caa3bedbc2a3e4be59de0d4318252\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8496bc31694caa3bedbc2a3e4be59de0d4318252/0_91_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The two politicians wave in front of a crowd in a church and sign saying 'put it to the people'\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Grieve and Sam Gyimah at a \u2018People\u2019s Vote\u2019 rally in April 9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt would be incredibly complacent for us to assume that our institutions and our politics are immune from these [populist] forces.

      "bodyText": "Sam Gyimah, the softly-spoken former Tory minister, admitted he was still adjusting. It was just a few hours before the unassuming MP for East Surrey was unveiled as the Liberal Democrats\u2019 latest recruit at the party\u2019s Bournemouth conference. But it all felt very new. \u201cI think I\u2019ll probably spend the next few days saying, \u2018Sam Gyimah, Liberal Democrat MP\u2019, and get used to that first,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a huge emotional side to it. I\u2019ve been involved in the Conservative party for two decades. I\u2019ve fought for the party. I have an unusual background \u2013 I\u2019m not your typical Tory recruit. I\u2019ve spent a long time evangelising about why people should look at the Conservative party seriously. It is sad that I find myself at a crossroads. I am an outcast in the Conservative party. But that\u2019s Brexit. It has divided families. The country is divided. This is a huge fault line.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long ago that Gyimah was a Tory rising star, flying up the ranks during Theresa May\u2019s tenure and fast-tracked on to the party\u2019s frontbench. Yet here he is, still just 43, starting afresh with Jo Swinson\u2019s party. The Tory party he joined, he says, is rapidly disappearing. \u201cBorn in the UK, brought up in Ghana, it was a sort of childhood of hardship and difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat attracted me to the Conservative party was these One Nation values. What has happened since the referendum, initially slowly, but increasingly accelerated over the last few months, is that it has moved away from those values. It has become more intolerant. It has become, in the desire to neutralise Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party, more doctrinaire. \u201cI listen to ministers undermining the courts. Ministers questioning experts because their views are inconvenient for what the government is saying about no deal. Or you have a government that says law enforcement is the centrepiece of its platform, and yet says in another breath that it will pick and choose what laws it chooses to respect. This is in many ways undermining key pillars of our constitution and the functioning of our democracy. \u201cThe issue for me is not just Brexit. It is beyond Brexit \u2013 how you conduct politics and the veering towards populism and English nationalism.\u201d Gyimah made headlines at the end of last year when he concluded that he could not support Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, meaning he had to resign as universities and science minister. He said more serious concerns about the party emerged during the Tory leadership campaign, when he ran in order to try to create a debate about the party\u2019s direction. \u201cI thought it was an opportunity, while the party was discussing its future, to make the case for Brexit realism, and also the case for rediscovering these values. During that process I realised there just weren\u2019t enough people who were going to fight from within to save the situation. As we saw soon after, not only did [Boris] Johnson win an overall majority on a no deal platform, but we very quickly went from a situation where the leader of the party had to be a no dealer, to anyone in government having to sign up to it. That was playing on my mind throughout the summer.\u201d His precarious place in the Tory ranks was brought to an end, along with that of 20 of his colleagues, when he voted to block a no deal Brexit earlier this month. That was his signal to try something different. \u201cThe withdrawal of the whip meant I just had to face a stark reality \u2013 being in the Conservative party now means you\u2019re signing up to no deal or hard Brexit, or you\u2019ll be cast into the wilderness. So what are your choices? Leave politics completely? \u201cIt feels to me that there is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October at the risk of our institutions, at the risk of our democracy, at the risk of our economy. That should not be allowed to happen.\u201d Gyimah says all 21 rebels received letters from the chief whip offering them a way back in \u2013 but the letters differed. He explains: \u201cThere were three different versions of the letter. I think the one I got was the lower tier. \u201cWhatever the letter said, I think I knew that just being realistic about the situation, I couldn\u2019t take the whip back because I will not be able to satisfy the minimum price of entry. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to spend all my time dwelling on that. The other side is, what do you do about it? That is why I\u2019m here. Centrists are being cast out of both main parties. Lots of people are politically homeless. Who can you work with to build a movement? \u201cWhen I spoke to Jo I thought this is a project that I can be part of. I\u2019m not looking for a harbour in a storm. I\u2019m attracted to a project to defend liberal democracy and make sure our country does not drift into the nationalistic, populist politics that we see in other democracies.\u201d Does he have a message for the 20 other Tory MPs thrown out for trying to block no deal? \u201cMy message is not just to the 20 \u2013 my message is to all of those who care about this country. The time is now. The problem we have is that the two old parties have entrenched votes and it is very difficult to budge them. \u201cWe need the centre to consolidate and unite if it is going to break through. This is the opportunity to try to create that new politics for the good of our country. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the settlement that comes out of Brexit should be the settlement that Nigel Farage wants. \u201cIt would be incredibly complacent for us to assume that our institutions and our politics are immune from these [populist] forces. We can bemoan the Labour party and the Conservative party. That is all well and good. But we have to act and that is why I am here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Citizens\u2019 assemblies will decide what action should be taken on the climate crisis, the Treasury\u2019s ability to stymie green measures will be neutralised and the Green Investment Bank will be revived under proposals set to be key planks of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 general election bid. Along with sweeping reform of Whitehall, including bringing back a department of climate change, local government would be given new powers to cut emissions, there would be a moratorium on airport expansion and an end to fracking, and the UK would achieve net-zero carbon status by 2045 \u2013 five years sooner than the current government goal. \u201cMoving to net-zero is a complete game-changer,\u201d Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem spokesperson for the environment and climate change, told the Guardian. \u201cThe whole of government and society need to understand the need to get to net-zero \u2013 everything we do needs to be seen in terms of that target.\u201d Under the proposals to be presented to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth this weekend, a new minister, who will attend cabinet, would be appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and oversee policy across departments to ensure it meets the zero-carbon pledge. \u201cThe biggest hurdle [to climate policies] was always the Treasury,\u201d said Hobhouse. Soon after Theresa May unveiled her zero-carbon target this summer, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, claimed it would cost too much. \u201cHaving a chief secretary to keep reminding the chancellor of the need to get to net-zero is key,\u201d said Hobhouse. To gain public support for urgent action on emissions, the Lib Dems would convene citizens\u2019 assemblies across the country to debate new measures. These would include ways to ensure a massive expansion of electric vehicles and better public transport, and how to encourage new technology such as heating homes with hydrogen instead of gas. Councils would also be given greater powers over planning, for instance to promote electric vehicles, cycling and walking. \u201cCitizens\u2019 assemblies would not replace politicians\u2019 decision-making, but would inform the options,\u201d said Hobhouse. \u201cWe need decisive action \u2013 the government is not doing anything, they are dithering.\u201d The Green Investment Bank, created under the coalition government, was sold off under George Osborne. Under a Lib Dem government, a replacement would be set up with public money, and have the powers to borrow money from the private sector. Hobhouse said Brexit was getting in the way of tackling the climate emergency: \u201cBrexit means having less money, and it is very counterproductive. We need international cooperation \u2013 climate change is a global problem.\u201d The Lib Dems would end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 \u2013 10 years sooner than the Conservatives \u2013 and stop fracking. There would also be more support for onshore wind and solar, which Hobhouse said the Conservatives had \u201cstopped in their tracks\u201d by drastically changing incentive schemes and planning laws.
