the Tory-turned-Lib Dem MP who chairs the Commons liaison committee, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking a promise to appear before her committee this week. In an interview for Newsnight she explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m appalled. The prime minister is running away from scrutiny. We had a series of reassurances from him over the summer that he would come to the liaison committee \u2013 initially before parliament came back, so on the first Monday. He then moved that date to this coming Wednesday and we very specifically queried with him about the position of prorogation and he assured us that he would be coming to liaison. </p> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid that is a promise broken because he has prorogued parliament and select committees can\u2019t sit. But in fact we decided that we would invite him anyway \u2013 that we would come back and sit on an informal basis, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve heard today that he\u2019s not prepared to come.</p> \n   <p>He is unaccountable. We have seen how everything has unravelled, with just a week of scrutiny in parliament. And I suspect that he didn\u2019t want that to continue.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:50:56.337Z\">at 5.50pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77cda28f082514879f18dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:32:23.928Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Employers would have to negotiate with unions on pay under Labour's national collective bargaining plans, Pidcock tells TUC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Laura Pidcock,</strong> the shadow business minister, has set out more details of Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining in a speech to the TUC this afternoon. She was fleshing out an idea that Jeremy Corbyn promoted in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/corbyn-pidcock-announce-ministry-employment-rights-workers-protection-agency/\">his own speech</a>, in which<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/10/jeremy-corbyn-extension-workers-rights-labour-tuc-congress\"> he promised the biggest ever extension of workers\u2019 rights.</a></p> \n  <p>Pidock said Labour\u2019s new national joint advisory council would ensure the voices of workers were heard around the cabinet table. And she said that, under Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining, employers would have to negotiate pay with unions. She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Labour government will establish a Ministry of Employment Rights. The department will be responsible for transforming our workplaces by delivering a huge rollout of individual and collective rights at work and legislating for enforcement powers to make these rights meaningful.</p> \n   <p>It will establish a national joint advisory council for representatives of government, employers, unions and experts to meet and advise. Above all, this will mean that the voice of working people will be heard at the cabinet table, exactly as it should be.</p> \n   <p>The beating heart of this department will be the rollout of sectoral collective bargaining. Now, I realise that this concept may be familiar to people in this room, but people outside of this room may be wondering what on earth I\u2019m talking about, and I don\u2019t blame them. Because the percentage of workers covered by collective agreements has dwindled rapidly over the last 40 years.</p> \n   <p>Our Labour government will re-establish national collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in each sector of our economy. That was the British way for most of the 20th century and it still is the way that the successful economies of northern Europe manage their industrial relations.</p> \n   <p>Sector-wide collective bargaining will set minimum and legally binding pay, terms and conditions for every employer and every worker in the sector.</p> \n   <p>In practice it means that rather than the employer having all the power to determine what your conditions and pay are at work, they will be legally obliged to enter into negotiation with your trade union \u2013 a giant step forward in rebalancing the unequal power relations that exist between worker and employer.</p> \n   <p>Imagine the transformative impact that would have on, say, the care sector, where the mostly female workforce has seen this highly skilled and professional area of work become a minimum wage job, where care workers are not paid for travel time between visits and can end up working 10 hours for five hours pay. What a scandalous state of affairs that the very people looking after some of the most poorly and vulnerable people in the country are being paid less than the minimum wage. And think of the effect on those in their care. Well, we are calling time on this kind of exploitative practice.</p> \n   <p>Because under a Labour government, those care sector employers would be legally obliged to come to the table and negotiate all aspects of the industry, the conditions in workplaces and, fundamentally, their pay. So, whether you are a care home worker from Dundee or Durham, you would be secure in the knowledge that minimum terms and conditions negotiated for the sector will restore dignity and a decent life to you and those you look after.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2e742b568b268b2c17c6c92e8483dc4a11c7319\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2e742b568b268b2c17c6c92e8483dc4a11c7319/0_108_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Pidcock at the TUC conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Pidcock at the TUC conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:48:30.578Z\">at 5.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77c9058f083106f4558ffd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:03:31.803Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The DUP leader, <strong>Arlene Foster</strong>, and her deputy, <strong>Nigel Dodds</strong>, have arrived at No 10 for talks with Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2761f9e17e16fbcd5edc63d6a1de08f383c268af\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2761f9e17e16fbcd5edc63d6a1de08f383c268af/0_5_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds arrive at Downing Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds arrive at Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:19:52.373Z\">at 5.19pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77bffc8f08143ee1ae3ad6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T15:24:06.623Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has secretly ordered the Cabinet Office to turn the government\u2019s public internet service into a platform for \u201ctargeted and personalised information\u201d to be gathered in the run-up to Brexit,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-voter-data\"> BuzzFeed is reporting.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77bd4e8f083106f4558f5a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T15:20:40.068Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Northern Ireland-only backstop 'simply a non-runner', says DUP</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,</strong> the DUP chief whip, was on the World at One.

Slipping into franglais (he was sitting in on a French lesson), he used the interview to dismiss claims that proroguing parliament for five weeks was anti-democratic. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need a Queen\u2019s speech. That\u2019s why parliament is in recess now, because you always have a recess before a Queen\u2019s speech.

He has been more critical of the UK\u2019s Brexit stance than other European commissioners, giving a speech last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/21/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-berlin-merkel-prepares-to-visit-berlin-as-minister-struggles-to-defend-his-collaborators-jibe-live-news?page=with:block-5d5d4cee8f081cf11cf1a715#block-5d5d4cee8f081cf11cf1a715\">describing Johnson as an \u201cunelected PM\u201d who was \u201cgambling with peace\u201d.</a> As trade commissioner, Hogan is there to represent the EU, not Ireland. But if it ever gets to the point where the UK will be hoping for the EU to downplay Irish concerns in the negotiations, Hogan is not likely to be cooperative.</p> \n  <p>But, on the plus side, Hogan is sounding more positive about the prospects of there being a Brexit deal than he was last month. In<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/penny-finally-dropping-for-uk-on-brexit-says-phil-hogan-1.4013645\"> an interview with the Irish Times</a> he said the penny was \u201cfinally dropping\u201d in the UK.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage \u2013 albeit at the eleventh hour \u2013 that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the two sides were heading in the direction of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, Hogan replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes. The taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hogan also said Boris Johnson was shifting his stance. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone. That is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. This is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p> \n   <p>If we can build on that we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hogan told the Irish Times that he would expect it to take \u201ca number of years\u201d to conclude a final trade deal with the EU.

Many others have criticised the decision, of course, including Amber Rudd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/07/amber-rudd-resigns-from-cabinet-and-surrenders-conservative-whip\">when she resigned as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, </a>but given that Hague is someone whose default mode is loyalty to the party, his critique is remarkable.

Are the DUP about to join the club?</p> \n  <p>As my colleague <strong>Lisa O\u2019Carroll </strong>wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d766eaa8f083106f455841b#block-5d766eaa8f083106f455841b\">in a post</a> on this blog yesterday, there is increasing speculation that Boris Johnson is moving towards accepting some version of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit crisis. Newsnight\u2019s <strong>Nicholas Watt</strong> went into this in more detail in a report yesterday. Here is an excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49639294\">a blog</a> setting out his understanding of Johnson\u2019s thinking.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Tories familiar with Boris Johnson\u2019s thinking say he is now willing to contemplate a version of the so-called \u201cNorthern Ireland-only backstop\u201d. Under this plan Northern Ireland would be closely bound to the EU on areas where there are already elements of an all Ireland economy \u2013 agriculture and electricity.</p> \n   <p>But Great Britain would be free to chart its own course. That would free GB to have a free trade agreement with the EU but would create a border down the Irish Sea. All of that could be achieved by amending the backstop in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to apply only to Northern Ireland. The separate political declaration would be amended to say that a Canada-plus trade deal would be negotiated for Great Britain. The government would be wary of calling the new mechanism a backstop, because it regards the current backstop as anti-democratic.</p> \n   <p>Downing St confirmed that a backstop in any form is unacceptable to the prime minister. But he is willing to recognise, as he told MPs last week, that \u201cagri-food is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there is potentially a big problem with this plan. The DUP would oppose anything that would create a new regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland (although Watt, in his blog, quotes one source explaining why a version of this proposal might be acceptable to the unionists).</p> \n  <p>This morning <strong>Arlene Foster,</strong> the DUP leader, spoke to Sky News before flying to London. She said she would be speaking to Johnson later. Asked about the suggestions that Johnson was planning a Northern Ireland-only backstop, she claimed this was \u201cvery wide of the mark\u201d. Perhaps she is right, but it did sound a little as if she was not 100% convinced and as if she was seeking to lay down a marker to the PM.</p> \n  <p>She told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about that ... What we\u2019re focused on is about getting a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom, one that works for Northern Ireland, one that does not have Northern Ireland hived off into a different customs union than the rest of the United Kingdom, breaking up the single market of the United Kingdom. That would be unheard off. To think that any United Kingdom prime minister would be involved in that sort of thing would just be an anathema. Jeremy Corbyn has said that in the past, our own prime minister has said that. So I think all of this speculation is very wide of the mark.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to her that some people might think she was being naive, and that Johnson was more committed to delivering Brexit than to sticking with the DUP, she replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What people are talking about is not delivering Brexit; what people are talking about is the break-up of the United Kingdom. That is not something that any prime minister in the United Kingdom is going to in any conscience go along with.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a76921799f868a7a24ddf3a5c036ac916e73f351\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a76921799f868a7a24ddf3a5c036ac916e73f351/20_0_888_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T09:15:55.278Z\">at 10.15am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d77583b8f083106f4558a96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T08:08:06.444Z\">9.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda for the day</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Parliament is not sitting, but there is still plenty of politics around.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused by the chair of the Commons liaison committee of breaking a specific promise to appear before it this week. (See 5.37pm.) Johnson has rejected as \u201cnonsense\u201d the claim that his lengthy prorogation of parliament is undemocratic. (See 3.46pm.) Jeremy Corbyn has promised to introduce the biggest ever extension to workers\u2019 rights and create a ministry and government agency should he get into government. The EU is pinning hopes on British negotiators reverting to the Northern Ireland-only backstop previously rejected by Theresa May as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK. DUP leaders rejected this proposal as unacceptable (see 9.58am and 4.20pm) Within the last hour Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has been meeting Johnson in Downing Street. The former Irish prime minister and joint architect of the Northern Ireland peace process, Bertie Ahern, has said it is imperative that any Brexit solution be acceptable to the DUP. A cross-party group of MPs has formally launched a campaign to win support in the Commons for Brexit via a managed deal, arguing both a no-deal departure or a second referendum would cement political divisions and cause endless uncertainty. Harriet Harman has promised to be \u201cscrupulously neutral\u201d as she announced her bid to become the next Speaker of the House of Commons, despite being a prominent campaigner for remain in the 2016 referendum. Past prime ministers, present-day parliamentarians, diplomats and armed services personnel filled Westminster Abbey to pay tribute to former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, described as \u201c a man for ideals, not shabby deals\u201d. The details of the service are on the Westminster Abbey website here. Johnson is being urged to withdraw Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s knighthood over his conviction for domestic violence and the former England cricketer\u2019s response to criticism. The first cracks have begun to emerge in Britain\u2019s resilient labour market as job creation slowed over the summer months, in a sign of the stress facing the UK economy as Brexit looms. Britain has accused Iran of flagrantly breaching assurances it would not sell oil to Syria from an Iranian tanker released by authorities in Gibraltar on the condition that the 2.1m barrels of oil would not sold to the \u201cmurderous regime\u201d of Bashar al Assad. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory-turned-Lib Dem MP who chairs the Commons liaison committee, has accused Boris Johnson of breaking a promise to appear before her committee this week. In an interview for Newsnight she explained: I\u2019m appalled. The prime minister is running away from scrutiny. We had a series of reassurances from him over the summer that he would come to the liaison committee \u2013 initially before parliament came back, so on the first Monday. He then moved that date to this coming Wednesday and we very specifically queried with him about the position of prorogation and he assured us that he would be coming to liaison. I\u2019m afraid that is a promise broken because he has prorogued parliament and select committees can\u2019t sit. But in fact we decided that we would invite him anyway \u2013 that we would come back and sit on an informal basis, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve heard today that he\u2019s not prepared to come. He is unaccountable. We have seen how everything has unravelled, with just a week of scrutiny in parliament. And I suspect that he didn\u2019t want that to continue. Laura Pidcock, the shadow business minister, has set out more details of Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining in a speech to the TUC this afternoon. She was fleshing out an idea that Jeremy Corbyn promoted in his own speech, in which he promised the biggest ever extension of workers\u2019 rights. Pidock said Labour\u2019s new national joint advisory council would ensure the voices of workers were heard around the cabinet table. And she said that, under Labour\u2019s plans for national collective bargaining, employers would have to negotiate pay with unions. She explained: A Labour government will establish a Ministry of Employment Rights. The department will be responsible for transforming our workplaces by delivering a huge rollout of individual and collective rights at work and legislating for enforcement powers to make these rights meaningful. It will establish a national joint advisory council for representatives of government, employers, unions and experts to meet and advise. Above all, this will mean that the voice of working people will be heard at the cabinet table, exactly as it should be. The beating heart of this department will be the rollout of sectoral collective bargaining. Now, I realise that this concept may be familiar to people in this room, but people outside of this room may be wondering what on earth I\u2019m talking about, and I don\u2019t blame them. Because the percentage of workers covered by collective agreements has dwindled rapidly over the last 40 years. Our Labour government will re-establish national collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in each sector of our economy. That was the British way for most of the 20th century and it still is the way that the successful economies of northern Europe manage their industrial relations. Sector-wide collective bargaining will set minimum and legally binding pay, terms and conditions for every employer and every worker in the sector. In practice it means that rather than the employer having all the power to determine what your conditions and pay are at work, they will be legally obliged to enter into negotiation with your trade union \u2013 a giant step forward in rebalancing the unequal power relations that exist between worker and employer. Imagine the transformative impact that would have on, say, the care sector, where the mostly female workforce has seen this highly skilled and professional area of work become a minimum wage job, where care workers are not paid for travel time between visits and can end up working 10 hours for five hours pay. What a scandalous state of affairs that the very people looking after some of the most poorly and vulnerable people in the country are being paid less than the minimum wage. And think of the effect on those in their care. Well, we are calling time on this kind of exploitative practice. Because under a Labour government, those care sector employers would be legally obliged to come to the table and negotiate all aspects of the industry, the conditions in workplaces and, fundamentally, their pay. So, whether you are a care home worker from Dundee or Durham, you would be secure in the knowledge that minimum terms and conditions negotiated for the sector will restore dignity and a decent life to you and those you look after. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, have arrived at No 10 for talks with Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson has secretly ordered the Cabinet Office to turn the government\u2019s public internet service into a platform for \u201ctargeted and personalised information\u201d to be gathered in the run-up to Brexit, BuzzFeed is reporting. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, was on the World at One. Like his boss, Arlene Foster (see 9.58am), he insisted that Boris Johnson would not sanction a Northern Ireland-only backstop. He explained: I don\u2019t see the prime minister who appointed himself as the minister for the union agreeing to an arrangement that separates Northern Ireland from Great Britain in trading terms. So, I think that this idea that you have a Northern Ireland-only backstop where you have a trade border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is simply a non-runner. In any event it would contravene the core principles of the Good Friday agreement, the Belfast agreement ... The solution to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland is not to create a second border in the Irish Sea because I think that would be deeply destabilising. He also rejected suggestions the DUP was losing influence over Number 10. He said: The idea that our influence is waning, I think, flies in the face of reality. Our leader will be meeting with Boris Johnson, we are plugged into the ongoing discussions about alternative arrangements, we have a significant role to play and, therefore, I would argue that our influence remains. Downing Street has denied wanting a Northern Ireland-only backstop. (See 1.55pm.) But there have been multiple claims that this is the direction in which Johnson is heading, including from the EU\u2019s new trade commissioner. (See 3.15pm.) Select committees cannot officially sit while parliament is prorogued. But, as Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee says on Twitter, her committee held an unofficial session this morning to take evidence on Brexit. Boris Johnson has recorded a short interview with Sky News on his visit to a primary school in Pimlico in London. Slipping into franglais (he was sitting in on a French lesson), he used the interview to dismiss claims that proroguing parliament for five weeks was anti-democratic. He said: We need a Queen\u2019s speech. That\u2019s why parliament is in recess now, because you always have a recess before a Queen\u2019s speech. And anybody who says - this stuff about it being anti-democratic - I mean, donnez-moi un break. What a load of nonsense. We were very, very clear that if people wanted a democratic moment, if they wanted an election, we offered it to the Labour opposition, and mysteriously they decided not to go for it. Johnson is right to say that parliament always gets prorogued before a Queen\u2019s speech, but the point about this prorogation is that it is lasting five weeks \u2013 far longer than normal. According to this House of Lords library briefing (pdf), it will be the longest prorogation since 1930. In his interview, Johnson also insisted that he was getting on with addressing the priorities of the people - which he said meant not just delivering Brexit by 31 October, but investing in the police and schools and hospitals. (See 1.22pm.) By contrast, he claimed, Labour was just offering delay and \u201cdither\u201d beyond 31 October. \u201cNobody can see what that achieves,\u201d he said. As John Bercow announced his decision to step down as Speaker on Monday afternoon, Britons in Spain were also contemplating their futures. In Barcelona, a group of them held a demo outside the British consulate to protest against the decision to suspend parliament and to complain about the \u201cenormous uncertainty\u201d they continue to face. Many had been excluded from the Brexit referendum because they had been resident abroad for more than 15 years and so were not entitled to vote. Phil Hogan, Ireland\u2019s European commissioner, has been given the trade portfolio under the new president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, it has been announced today. He has been commissioner for agriculture. This means he will be the EU chief trade negotiator, and will take the lead in negotiating the details of a trade deal with the UK after Brexit. If the UK had a choice (it didn\u2019t), Hogan might not be the candidate Boris Johnson would choose. He has been more critical of the UK\u2019s Brexit stance than other European commissioners, giving a speech last month describing Johnson as an \u201cunelected PM\u201d who was \u201cgambling with peace\u201d. As trade commissioner, Hogan is there to represent the EU, not Ireland. But if it ever gets to the point where the UK will be hoping for the EU to downplay Irish concerns in the negotiations, Hogan is not likely to be cooperative. But, on the plus side, Hogan is sounding more positive about the prospects of there being a Brexit deal than he was last month. In an interview with the Irish Times he said the penny was \u201cfinally dropping\u201d in the UK. I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage \u2013 albeit at the eleventh hour \u2013 that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK. Asked if the two sides were heading in the direction of a Northern Ireland-only backstop, Hogan replied: Yes. The taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit. Hogan also said Boris Johnson was shifting his stance. He explained: Mr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone. That is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. This is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. If we can build on that we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome. Hogan told the Irish Times that he would expect it to take \u201ca number of years\u201d to conclude a final trade deal with the EU. But he said that, because of the UK\u2019s long membership of the EU, the process should not take as long as normal trade deals. At the weekend there was speculation that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, might follow Amber Rudd in resigning from the cabinet. He is another remain-voting centrist thought to be suffering from extreme buyer\u2019s remorse following his decision to back Boris Johnson for leader. During the leadership campaign Hancock endorsed Johnson, only for Johnson to then criticise a plan for a sugar levy on milkshakes that Hancock was promoting. Then Johnson decided to prorogue parliament for five weeks - even though Hancock, during the leadership campaign, said such a move would dishonour everything people fought and died for at D-day. But, if anything, Hancock\u2019s enthusiasm for Johnson is growing. This morning after cabinet he put this on Twitter. Theresa May made sure her cricketing hero Geoffrey Boycott got a knighthood in her resignation honours list. This was controversial, because Boycott was convicted for assaulting his then girlfriend 21 years ago. Boycott did not do his case any good with the patronising and dismissive approach when asked about this by Martha Kearney on the Today programme this morning. My colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson has written it up here. Now Labour is saying Boycott should have his knighthood rescinded. This is from Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities. Celebrating a man convicted of assaulting his partner by giving him a knighthood is an insult to victims and survivors of domestic violence. Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister\u2019s favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is. Boris Johnson should rescind his knighthood today. The whole honours system needs radically overhauling, alongside peerages, so that our political system works for the many not the few. Here are some more lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing. I have already posted what the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said about today\u2019s cabinet meeting. (See 1.22pm.) The spokesman confirmed that the government intended to publish a revised version of the government\u2019s Operational Yellowhammer report about what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But he refused to say any more about how the government would respond to yesterday\u2019s Commons vote saying the government should publish all documents relating to Yellowhammer, as well as private messages from nine government aides relating to prorogation. He said the government would respond to the vote in due course. But he also said the request for private messages was disproportionate and unprecedented The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Johnson is considering a Northern Ireland-only backstop. (See 9.58am.) The spokesman said: \u201cWe are not seeking a Northern Ireland-only backstop.\u201d The spokesman confirmed that Johnson would not be attending a hearing with the liaison committee tomorrow. Sarah Wollaston, the committee\u2019s chair, thought she had an understanding with Johnson that he would appear on Wednesday and yesterday she wrote to him asking if that hearing could go ahead, regardless of prorogation (which means committees can no longer hold formal parliamentary hearings). But the spokesman said that Johnson would be offering an alternative debate. He said committees don\u2019t meet while parliament is prorogued. The spokesman suggested that Johnson would be holding more meetings with EU leaders soon. There are reports today saying the PM will go to Brussels next week. Asked about this, the spokesman said Johnson would be speaking with other EU leaders in the coming weeks and that his travel plans would be announced in the usual way (ie, nearer the time). He also said David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, would be in Brussels for talks with the EU\u2019s Brexit team tomorrow and on Friday. The spokesman said that a new minister for women and equalities would be appointed soon to replace Amber Rudd, who resigned at the weekend. Rudd has already been replaced in her capacity as work and pensions secretary by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey. The spokesman confirmed that Johnson would meet Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds, leader and deputy leader of the DUP, in Downing Street this afternoon. Today\u2019s cabinet sounds as if it was the first meeting of the committee drafting the next Conservative manifesto. Brexit was discussed. Boris Johnson briefed colleagues on his \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with Leo Varadkar yesterday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing. But the spokesman said there was also a substantial discussion on domestic policy, with ministers saying what their plans were for their own departments. Johnson\u2019s decision last week to remove the whip from 21 Tory rebels last week, effectively deselecting them as candidates at the next election, has been seen as sign that he is making the Conservative party increasingly extreme. In her letter announcing her resignation on Saturday night Amber Rudd said the removal of 21 one nation Tories was an \u201cact of political vandalism\u201d. The former party leader William Hague said in his Telegraph column today (see 10.25am) that this could prompt moderate Tories to start looking for a new home. Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, made a similar argument in the Evening Standard yesterday. At cabinet Johnson pushed back against this claim. According to his spokesman, Johnson told the cabinet that he would lead a one nation government. The spokesman said: The prime minister then led a discussion on the government\u2019s priorities for the autumn. The PM said he would lead a one nation government which would respect the result of the referendum by leaving the European Union on October 31 while energetically focusing on the NHS, tackling violent crime, education and the cost of living. Secretaries of state then set out priorities for their individual departments. On crime and policing, the government will begin recruiting 20,000 new police officers and progress plans to invest up to \u00a32.5bn to deliver 10,000 new prison places. The government has also kicked off an urgent review of sentencing policy to ensure the public are protected from the most dangerous criminals. On education, a \u00a37.1bn increase in funding for schools by 2022-23 has been announced as the government focuses on giving all young people the same opportunities to succeed regardless of where they go to school. On health, as well as reaffirming the five-year settlement for the NHS, with an additional \u00a333.9bn a year by 2023-24, ministers will focus on ensuring this money gets to the front line and delivers real improvements for patients. The prime minister concluded the meeting by saying that the government would use education, infrastructure and technology to level up across the country. Number 10 sources are not contesting the Spectator report saying Johnson also described himself as \u201cthe most liberal Conservative PM in decades\u201d. (See 12.43pm.) Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, has said it would be wrong to use the general election to try to resolve the Brexit crisis. A referendum was needed for that, he argued, because an election should be fought on wider issues. Speaking at an event at King\u2019s College London, he said: It is wrong as a matter of principle to mix the general election up with the specific Brexit question. If the British people end up having a general election on Brexit you are going to mix up issues that should be kept separate. What Boris Johnson thinks is: if I fight a Brexit general election, I can say to people: \u2018Look it\u2019s no deal or you get Jeremy Corbyn.\u2019 You could end up with the bizarre situation where, let\u2019s just suppose the Conservatives manage to win a majority with 35% to 40% of the vote, they will claim a mandate for no-deal when, if you add the votes for all the parties opposed to no-deal together, they will come to more than 50% of the vote. It is a completely undemocratic way of deciding it. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing, much of which focused on what happened at cabinet. I\u2019ll post the highlights shortly, but you are better off reading James Forsyth\u2019s take in the Spectator, which is more interesting. Here\u2019s an excerpt. At the start of the meeting, Boris Johnson took on the argument made by many of the Tory 21 that this is an extreme government, and that he is turning the Tories into a rightwing sect. He argued that most voters want the referendum result delivered, which is what he is trying to do, and that his domestic agenda is in the common ground of British politics. He pointed out that he was more trusted on the NHS than Jeremy Corbyn, which would hardly be the case if the critics\u2019 charge was true. He told the cabinet that he was \u2018the most liberal Conservative PM in decades\u2019. At which point, Matt Hancock interjected: \u2018Don\u2019t tell Priti.\u2019 And here is another YouGov poll of some interest. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech to the TUC. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s powerful de facto chief of staff, was doorstepped by Sky News as he left home this morning. Asked what his next move would be, Cummings replied: You guys should get out of London. Go and talk to people who are not rich remainers. This seems to be a reference to the idea that London-based journalists do not realise how much support there is for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy outside middle-class remain circles in the capital. There is quite a lot of evidence to support this view. Here is some YouGov polling from earlier this week suggesting that, among voters in general, people are inclined to think Boris Johnson and his government are more in touch with the public mood on Brexit than MPs in parliament are. But Lord Heseltine, the pro-European former Conservative deputy prime minister, said it was a mistake for Cummings to claim it was the remain side who represented the views of the wealthy elite. He told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics: If you start talking about who are the richest influential people in this campaign \u2013 who owns the Telegraph? Who owns the Sun? Who owns the Daily Mail? People with riches, wealth, of untold millions. They are the ones who appoint the editors of newspapers that are frankly propaganda sheets for leave. And for Dominic Cummings to try to shove the blame on to individuals who want to remain because they are rich is a major slip of the tongue. These are from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates. Amber Rudd, who quit as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, and also resigned the Tory whip, has written an open letter to her constituents explaining her decision. She now sits as an independent, but she says she hopes to continue as MP for Hastings and Rye \u201cinto the next general election\u201d. UPDATE: A spokesman for Amber Rudd has clarified that she will not stand in her Hastings and Rye constituency at the election. I have taken out the sentence in the paragraph above saying her letter seemed to imply otherwise. Boris Johnson chaired cabinet this morning. No 10 will brief on it at 12pm, but the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth has already had a read-out. Corbyn is on his peroration. Congress, the coming general election will be a chance for a real change of direction. In the next few weeks the establishment will come after us with all they\u2019ve got, because they know we\u2019re not afraid to take them on. We\u2019re going after the tax avoiders. We\u2019re going after the bad bosses. We\u2019re going after the dodgy landlords. We\u2019re going after the big polluters destroying our climate. Because we know whose side we\u2019re on. We\u2019re creating a society of hope and inclusion \u2013 not poverty \u2013 and division. He is now getting a long standing ovation. Corbyn has praise for the Financial Times. Last week the Financial Times said that Labour is, and I quote, \u2018determined to shift power away from bosses and landlords and to workers and tenants\u2019. Well there has been no shortage of rather unkind reporting about our party over the last few years, but this time they\u2019ve got it absolutely right. We will put workers on company boards, and give the workforce a 10% stake in large companies paying a dividend of as much as \u00a3500 a year to each employee. And we will give tenants more rights including caps on rent rises. And that principle of empowering people doesn\u2019t just apply to the workplace. We\u2019ll bring rail, mail, water and the national grid into public ownership, so the essential utilities that people rely on are run by and for the public, not just shareholders. Here is a story by my colleagues Kate Proctor and Rajeev Syal about the employment rights announcement in Corbyn\u2019s speech. Corbyn says Labour would set up a workers\u2019 protection agency. Too many employers are getting away with flouting laws. Nearly half a million people are still being paid less than the minimum wage. We\u2019ll put a stop to that. We\u2019ll create a workers protection agency with real teeth, including the power to enter workplaces and bring prosecutions on workers\u2019 behalf. If you\u2019re a worker with a boss who makes you work extra hours for no pay or forces you into dangerous situations, you deserve a government that\u2019s on your side and ready to step in to support you. Corbyn says Labour would introduce equal rights for all workers from day one. And it would end zero-hours contracts. Corbyn says Labour would bring about \u201cthe biggest extension of rights for workers that our country has ever seen\u201d. He says he would establish a new ministry of employment rights. He says Labour would roll out sectoral collective bargaining. And within 100 days of taking office he would repeal the Tory Trade Union Act. Corbyn says pay is lower in real terms than it was a decade ago, he says. He says the last decade has been the worst for wage growth since the Napoleonic war. Corbyn confirms that Labour will go into the election proposing a referendum on Brexit, with a credible leave option and remain as the two choices. Corbyn says his first priority is to stop no deal. Then he wants to trigger a general election. A general election is coming, he says. At the election he says Labour will unleash the biggest people-powered campaign ever seen. Corbyn says the Tories would use a no-deal Brexit to implement policies that would benefit the rich. For the Tories this is about so much more than leaving the European Union. It\u2019s about hijacking the referendum result to shift even more power and wealth to those at the top. They will use a no-deal crash to push through policies that benefit them and their super-rich supporters and hurt everyone else \u2013 just as they did after the financial crash. Under the cover of no-deal they will sell off our public services, strip away the regulations that keep us safe, and undermine workers\u2019 rights. He says a no-deal Brexit would be a Trump deal Brexit. Be in no doubt, a no-deal Brexit is really a Trump Deal Brexit, leading to a one-sided US trade deal negotiated from a position of weakness. It will put us at the mercy of Trump and the big US corporations itching to get their teeth further into our NHS, sound the death knell for our steel industry, and permanently drive down rights and protections for workers. I am not prepared to stand by and let that happen. Corbyn says this time last week the Tories and the DUP had a majority of one. Now it is minus 45, he says. He says for most people what happens at Westminster is a million miles away. For him, real politics is not the parliamentary knockabout. It is about giving power to people. He says Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy is clear. He says he wants to stage a showdown over no deal, and present this as a conflict between parliament and the people. But the idea that Johnson represents the people is absurd, he says. He says Johnson and his cabinet are not just on the side of the establishment. They are the establishment. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking at the TUC conference now. He starts by praising the TUC, and thanking trade unionists for what they do. William Hague, the former Conservative leader and former foreign secretary, has used his Telegraph column today (paywall) to deliver a damning verdict on Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to remove the whip from the 21 rebels who voted against the government on Brexit last week. Many others have criticised the decision, of course, including Amber Rudd when she resigned as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, but given that Hague is someone whose default mode is loyalty to the party, his critique is remarkable. He describes what Johnson did as \u201ca disgusting act of hypocrisy\u201d. Here is an extract. All of us who have been Tory leader have made mistakes, but this one is the most egregious and counter-productive act of self-harm committed by the party leadership that I can recall in my lifetime. If we do not speak out about it, there is little prospect that lessons will be learned ... It is not possible to be aware of [the] record and characters [of those who have had the whip removed] without thinking that their expulsion from the parliamentary ranks of the Conservative party, partly at the behest of people who have spent years rebelling, is a disgusting act of hypocrisy. Space does not allow me to go through the work of each of these 21. But when I recall Nicholas Soames sitting assiduously on the backbenches and loyally supporting Tory leaders when I arrived in the Commons in 1989, and that he was still in the same spot, still supporting them, when I left in 2015, I cannot accept that he can be tossed out of the party after one rebellion on the whim of advisers who have only just turned up ... The final problem with this whole episode is that it appears to send a signal \u2013 that if you are a \u201cmoderate\u201d Tory, a socially liberal, fiscally responsible, internationalist Conservative who believes in the necessity of compromise and balance in our national affairs \u2013 you have to start to think about joining a new party. Job creation across the UK has slowed... but there\u2019s good news too \u2013 wages are picking up, my colleague Graeme Wearden writes on his business live blog, covering today\u2019s unemployment figures. The full details are here. Anyone who has followed Boris Johnson\u2019s career in detail will know that there is a long list of people who have put their trust in him and who at some point discover they have been let down. Are the DUP about to join the club? As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll wrote in a post on this blog yesterday, there is increasing speculation that Boris Johnson is moving towards accepting some version of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit crisis. Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt went into this in more detail in a report yesterday. Here is an excerpt from a blog setting out his understanding of Johnson\u2019s thinking. The Tories familiar with Boris Johnson\u2019s thinking say he is now willing to contemplate a version of the so-called \u201cNorthern Ireland-only backstop\u201d. Under this plan Northern Ireland would be closely bound to the EU on areas where there are already elements of an all Ireland economy \u2013 agriculture and electricity. But Great Britain would be free to chart its own course. That would free GB to have a free trade agreement with the EU but would create a border down the Irish Sea. All of that could be achieved by amending the backstop in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to apply only to Northern Ireland. The separate political declaration would be amended to say that a Canada-plus trade deal would be negotiated for Great Britain. The government would be wary of calling the new mechanism a backstop, because it regards the current backstop as anti-democratic. Downing St confirmed that a backstop in any form is unacceptable to the prime minister. But he is willing to recognise, as he told MPs last week, that \u201cagri-food is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland\u201d. But there is potentially a big problem with this plan. The DUP would oppose anything that would create a new regulatory border between Britain and Northern Ireland (although Watt, in his blog, quotes one source explaining why a version of this proposal might be acceptable to the unionists). This morning Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, spoke to Sky News before flying to London. She said she would be speaking to Johnson later. Asked about the suggestions that Johnson was planning a Northern Ireland-only backstop, she claimed this was \u201cvery wide of the mark\u201d. Perhaps she is right, but it did sound a little as if she was not 100% convinced and as if she was seeking to lay down a marker to the PM. She told Sky News: There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about that ... What we\u2019re focused on is about getting a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom, one that works for Northern Ireland, one that does not have Northern Ireland hived off into a different customs union than the rest of the United Kingdom, breaking up the single market of the United Kingdom. That would be unheard off. To think that any United Kingdom prime minister would be involved in that sort of thing would just be an anathema. Jeremy Corbyn has said that in the past, our own prime minister has said that. So I think all of this speculation is very wide of the mark. When it was put to her that some people might think she was being naive, and that Johnson was more committed to delivering Brexit than to sticking with the DUP, she replied: What people are talking about is not delivering Brexit; what people are talking about is the break-up of the United Kingdom. That is not something that any prime minister in the United Kingdom is going to in any conscience go along with. Parliament is not sitting, but there is still plenty of politics around. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech at the launch of the King\u2019s College London International School for Government. 10am: A new group, MPs for a Deal, to give a briefing. Its members include Stephen Kinnock, Rory Stewart, Norman Lamb and Caroline Flint. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After cabinet Johnson is due to do a school visit to promote government plans to open more free schools. And Sky News is reporting that Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is coming to London today. It is thought she will be meeting Johnson. I will post more on that shortly. Here is more from what Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, told the Today programme about how she would conduct herself if elected Commons Speaker. (See 8.27am.) She said: I think the Speaker has to be scrupulously neutral as between different views within the House. The Speaker doesn\u2019t vote, doesn\u2019t take sides in debates. But, the Speaker is not neutral as between parliament and the executive. The Speaker has to be on parliament\u2019s side and stand up for parliament. Asked about John Bercow\u2019s conduct as Speaker, Harman said: He has been right to say to ministers: \u2018You have got to come to the house. You have got to account for yourself.\u2019 John Bercow, who is effectively working his notice as Speaker now, delivered a short speech from the chair as the prorogation ceremony was beginning early this morning condemning the government\u2019s decision to prorogue for five weeks. Here is an extract from Hansard. I have already made the point that if people have the manners to listen, which they have not, that I will play my part. This is not, however, a normal prorogation. It is not typical. It is not standard. It is one of the longest for decades, and it represents, not just in the minds of many colleagues but for huge numbers of people outside an act of executive fiat. I quite understand. I have already said that I respect Black Rod, who is doing her duty. The Queen\u2019s Commissioners are doing their duty, and I will play my part. I completely understand. [Interruption.] It is not disorder. I do not require advice on order from you, Mr Stuart. You are a master of disorder, man. I completely understand why very large numbers of Members are much more comfortable staying where they are. Mr Stuart, if you do not like it, you are perfectly entitled to your view. I could not give a flying flamingo what your view is. [Interruption.] Thank you very much indeed. And here is some video. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Patrick Greenfield. If you are interested in all the chaos and protest that erupted in the Commons in the early hours of this morning as parliament was prorogued, here is our overnight story. But if you want all the details, including the best tweets and the most candid pictures, do have a look at yesterday\u2019s blog. My colleagues Mattha Busby and then Kate Lyons kept it going until 3.30am. It is a terrific read. The mother of the house, Harriet Harman, has told the BBC that she will stand for the position of Speaker after John Bercow announced he would stand down on October 31. Harman insists that she would be a neutral figure in the house despite her support for remaining in the European Union. Theresa May\u2019s former advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill have been included on her resignation honours list, provoking accusations of cronyism. They\u2019ll both get CBEs while Robbie Gibb, her director of communications, will received a knighthood. You can read the full list following the link below. Restoring power sharing in Stormont will surely be on the agenda in cabinet following a violent night in Derry on the Creggan estate. Police were attacked with petrol bombs and a device found in the city was an attempt to murder officers by the New IRA, according to the PSNI. Officers were carrying out searchings targeting dissident republicans. Yesterday, Boris Johnson and the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar clashed on the prospect of resorting direct rule in Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Taoiseach said his government would oppose direct rule from London as it would violate the Good Friday agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland. The prime minister will host a cabinet meeting later today and there is be plenty to discuss with just 51 days to go until Brexit. Former conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin has told BBC Radio 4 that Boris Johnson should turn his attention to reaching an agreement with the European Union. Letwin says he would vote for \u201cliterally any deal\u201d the government manages to agree with Brussels and he believes a large part of the house would also back an agreement. If he cannot get a majority to vote for the deal in the house, the prime minister should hold a referendum, Letwin adds. He also suggests that Johnson could back a second referendum, despite the fact that he opposes one now. Letwin explains: Boris has often changed his mind about many things. And that\u2019s one of his advantages, that he is very flexible. Boris Johnson suspended parliament amid chaotic scenes in the early hours of Tuesday following his sixth parliamentary defeat in six days, as MPs voted to block a snap election and to force the publication of No 10\u2019s secret preparations for a no-deal Brexit, writes our Rowena Mason. Welsh Labour MP Anna McMorrin had the tweet of the night from the house. Our data team have made a useful graphic that tells you which way your MP voted on calling a general election. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political goings-on. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest political developments this morning until Andrew Sparrow is ready to take charge. MPs met until the early hours on an another dramatic night in Westminster as parliament was suspended for five weeks at the request of Boris Johnson. The consternation of many MPs and the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, was clear, with the outgoing speaker describing the prorogation as \u201cnot typical\u201d, \u201cnot standard\u201d and as representing \u201can act of executive fiat\u201d. There were chaotic scenes in the house as Bercow began proceedings to prorogue parliament, as a group of opposition MPs carrying signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d drowned out Black Rod as she tried to address the Speaker, the ritual that initiates the suspension. Several MPs were also involved in altercation near the Speaker\u2019s chair, as they attempted to prevent him leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of parliament. Cries of \u201cshame on you\u201d rose from the opposition benches as government MPs left the chamber. Labour MPs, who remained in their seats after government MPs and the Speaker had left to attend the House of Lords, sang Jerusalem and Bread of Heaven. Parliament won\u2019t sit today, or for the next five weeks, but we\u2019re anticipating a lot of furious reaction. Join us as we bring you that and all of the day\u2019s other news.

      "bodyText": "The EU is pinning its hopes on British negotiators reverting to the Northern Ireland-only backstop previously rejected by Theresa May as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK. With Boris Johnson facing a choice between breaking his word and extending the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October, or bringing back a tweaked deal for a last-gasp vote in parliament, officials and diplomats have expressed hope the prime minister will make a U-turn. EU sources insisted there was no other approach that could work and the negotiations were otherwise doomed to hit a \u201czombie stage\u201d given the likelihood of an imminent general election. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what mandate the prime minister has to propose something and obviously there is a strong division between the parliament and the government,\u201d said Nathalie Loiseau, a former French minister for EU affairs. It is hoped in Brussels that Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, will further pursue a Northern Ireland-only backstop during meetings with the European commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce on Wednesday and Friday. The newly nominated EU commissioner for trade, Phil Hogan, a former Irish minister, told the Irish Times he believed the \u201cpenny is finally dropping\u201d in Johnson\u2019s government over the lack of alternatives. The idea was originally rejected by May on the grounds it was unpalatable to her partners in the Democratic Unionist party, on which she relied for her working majority. At the time, she said \u201cno British prime minister\u201d could accept a regulatory border being drawn in the Irish Sea. No 10 insisted on Tuesday that Johnson was not pursuing the idea again in the hope of winning the support of more hardline Eurosceptics. \u201cWe are not seeking a Northern Ireland-only backstop,\u201d a No 10 spokesman said. However, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, was sufficiently alarmed to demand a private meeting with Johnson in Downing Street on Tuesday evening, which lasted an hour. Following the meeting, Foster said: \u201cThe prime minister rejected a Northern Ireland-only backstop in a letter to Donald Tusk on 19 August. It is undemocratic and unconstitutional and would place a tariff border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That would be unacceptable. \u201cDuring today\u2019s meeting, the prime minister confirmed his rejection of the Northern Ireland-only backstop and his commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.\u201d Hogan later told RT\u00c9 News that constitutional issues in the withdrawal agreement that concerned the DUP could be \u201cimproved\u201d, suggesting space could be opening up for a deal that might win the party\u2019s approval. Johnson has not been specific about how he will get a new deal with Brussels, but before his meeting with Foster, he said \u201cthere is a way\u201d to achieve one \u201cbut it will take a lot of hard work\u201d, as he fought back against accusations that his five-week prorogation of parliament is anti-democratic. \u201cDonnez-moi un break \u2013 what a load of nonsense,\u201d he said, switching to Franglais. The prime minister has said he wants to remove the Irish backstop from the withdrawal agreement as it would tie Northern Ireland into the single market and the whole of the UK into a shared customs territory with the EU. He has described the arrangement as \u201cundemocratic\u201d and railed against signing a treaty that he says would be \u201cinconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK\u201d. But his proposal in recent days of a single all-Ireland agrifood zone has offered some hope in Brussels that the government may return to the initial EU suggestion of an arrangement that solely keeps Northern Ireland within the EU\u2019s structures. Hogan said Johnson, who visited the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin on Monday, had offered some grounds for optimism in his recent talks. \u201cMr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone. That is certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland/the EU and the rest of the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

      "bodyText": "There were extraordinary scenes of chaos and anger in the House of Commons overnight as opposition MPs staged a protest against the suspension of parliament for five weeks \u2013 a prorogation that the Speaker of the House said represented \u201can act of executive fiat\u201d. As John Bercow began proceedings to prorogue parliament, a group of opposition MPs carrying signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d drowned out Black Rod as she tried to address the Speaker, a ritual that initiates the suspension. Several MPs were also involved in an altercation near the Speaker\u2019s chair, as they attempted to prevent him leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of parliament. One Labour MP threw himself across Bercow\u2019s chair in protest at the shutting down of parliament. Lloyd Russell-Moyle tried to block the Speaker by lying across him momentarily to stop him leaving to the House of Lords in the official ceremony to prorogue parliament. Other Labour colleagues, including the shadow women and equalities minister, Dawn Butler, and the backbencher Clive Lewis held up posters that read \u201csilenced\u201d. As Russell-Moyle was pushed away by a member of Commons staff, the Green party leader, Caroline Lucas, was seen to tumble as MPs still sitting in the chamber in the early hours of Tuesday morning started heckling and shouting. Lewis tweeted that the group of MPs had been trying to re-enact an event from 1629 when the Speaker was pinned to his chair to prevent the prorogation of parliament. Cries of \u201cshame on you\u201d rose from the opposition benches as government MPs left the chamber. Labour MPs, who remained in their seats after government MPs and the Speaker had left to attend the House of Lords, sang the Red Flag, SNP MPs Scots Wha Hae and Plaid Cymru MPs Calon L\u00e2n, with harmonies. Russell-Moyle, the MP for Brighton Kemptown, is no stranger to parliamentary stunts. In December 2018, he grabbed the ceremonial mace after Theresa May postponed a key Brexit debate and vote on her withdrawal bill to the new year. The chaos unfolded in the early hours of Tuesday morning, after a day of high drama in which Boris Johnson lost his sixth parliamentary vote in as many days and Bercow announced his impending retirement as Speaker. As the prorogation got under way, Bercow expressed his anger, saying it was \u201cnot a normal prorogation\u201d. \u201cIt is not typical. It is not standard. It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents, not just in the minds of many colleagues, but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat,\u201d he said. As Bercow spoke, opposition MPs held signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d and some attempted to block his way. One of those involved in the protest, Alex Sobel, Labour MP for Leeds North West, said the action \u201cechoes the action of members to try and prevent the speaker proroguing at the request of Charles I\u201d, referring to the 1629 incident when MPs, furious at the closure of parliament, left their seats and sat on the Speaker, preventing him from rising and closing the house, allowing MPs to pass a number of motions condemning the king. Bercow was not sat on, and was soon allowed to pass through the House of Commons to attend the House of Lords. The Speaker returned to the House of Commons to confirm the prorogation of parliament, with only a handful of Conservative MPs present and packed opposition benches. As parliament wrapped up at about 2am, opposition MPs lined up to shake Bercow\u2019s hand. Many MPs tweeted their anger, though the reason for their fury was split down party lines, with Conservative MPs appalled at the opposition MPs who had tried to stop the Speaker leaving his seat and opposition MPs angry at the proroguing of parliament. The pandemonium capped a rancorous day in parliament during which Johnson\u2019s options narrowed as parliament\u2019s bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October received royal assent and passed into law. Later the prime minister once again failed in his attempt to force an early general election after opposition MPs abstained from the vote and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he would not let his party walk into \u201ctraps laid by this prime minister\u201d. Parliament also voted by 311 to 302 for Johnson to publish Operation Yellowhammer documents detailing the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit plans, after a leaked version from early August warned of possible food and medicine shortages. The motion, brought by the former Tory MP Dominic Grieve, also directed Johnson to disclose messages relating to the suspension of parliament sent by his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings and various other aides on WhatsApp, Facebook, other social media and both their personal and professional phones. Grieve said he had information from public officials that such correspondence contained a \u201cscandal\u201d. But Downing Street sources suggested Johnson\u2019s advisers would resort to legal action rather than hand over their communications. Any refusal to comply could put them and the government in contempt of parliament.",

A few weeks later he was joined by the teacher and activist Holly Rigby, the activist Rob Poole and the Durham academic Sol Gamsu, to set up Laps.

It also plans to bring a motion to this year\u2019s Labour conference calling for the full integration of state and private schools, including nationalising the endowments of the hugely wealthy public schools.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s leadership is sympathetic. McDonnell has backed the Laps campaign and tells them he believes an \u201cintegrated education system\u201d could well be a popular policy with the public as the country heads into an election.</p> \n<p>This would represent a dramatic break from the New Labour/Adonis years, when Labour took the view that private schools were not a problem to solve but a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-20154299\" title=\"\">model to emulate</a>, and that they should be encouraged to shore up their ailing state counterparts through sponsorship or extending public benefit as a result of charitable status.</p> \n<p>For Gamsu, too, that approach belongs to the past. His research has explored the way education fits into the broader structures of class and capitalism and he is keen, he says, to \u201cpush the Labour party into a position where they have seriously to take on elite culture and power in Britain\u201d. This would involve integrating private and state sectors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/labour-phase-out-private-schools-britain-inequality-finland\" title=\"\">along Finnish lines</a>, and also reforming further and higher education as part of the creation of a more democratic and accessible National Education Service.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/labour-phase-out-private-schools-britain-inequality-finland\">Labour must be bold, and finally abolish private schools | Steven Longden</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Interestingly, the most strident opposition to reform of private schools might come from within the state sector. Influential Conservative-supporting free school founders, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Miss_Snuffy/status/1167704215935954944?s=20\" title=\"\">Katharine Birbalsingh</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toadmeister/status/1166116566943109122?s=21\" title=\"\">Toby Young</a>, boast that their meritocratic approach, modelled on a traditional curriculum and strong discipline, is giving the private sector a run for its money. They see no need to lay a glove on the private schools.</p> \n<p>But this argument could be turned on its head. If everyone across the political spectrum now accepts that most children, particularly those from less well-off backgrounds, can do equally well academically what, bar snobbery and entrenched habits of segregation, is stopping our children being educated together? And shouldn\u2019t state schools have the benefit of the broad curriculum and creative pursuits that are fast becoming the province of private schools alone?</p> \n<p>Ultimately it\u2019s a question of modernity: the need for this troubled country finally to tackle harmful, outmoded social hierarchies through a common system of genuinely public education. Private school reform is decades, if not centuries, overdue. The moment might finally have arrived.</p>",

McDonnell has backed the Laps campaign and tells them he believes an \u201cintegrated education system\u201d could well be a popular policy with the public as the country heads into an election. This would represent a dramatic break from the New Labour/Adonis years, when Labour took the view that private schools were not a problem to solve but a model to emulate, and that they should be encouraged to shore up their ailing state counterparts through sponsorship or extending public benefit as a result of charitable status. For Gamsu, too, that approach belongs to the past. His research has explored the way education fits into the broader structures of class and capitalism and he is keen, he says, to \u201cpush the Labour party into a position where they have seriously to take on elite culture and power in Britain\u201d. This would involve integrating private and state sectors along Finnish lines, and also reforming further and higher education as part of the creation of a more democratic and accessible National Education Service. Interestingly, the most strident opposition to reform of private schools might come from within the state sector. Influential Conservative-supporting free school founders, such as Katharine Birbalsingh and Toby Young, boast that their meritocratic approach, modelled on a traditional curriculum and strong discipline, is giving the private sector a run for its money. They see no need to lay a glove on the private schools. But this argument could be turned on its head. If everyone across the political spectrum now accepts that most children, particularly those from less well-off backgrounds, can do equally well academically what, bar snobbery and entrenched habits of segregation, is stopping our children being educated together? And shouldn\u2019t state schools have the benefit of the broad curriculum and creative pursuits that are fast becoming the province of private schools alone? Ultimately it\u2019s a question of modernity: the need for this troubled country finally to tackle harmful, outmoded social hierarchies through a common system of genuinely public education. Private school reform is decades, if not centuries, overdue. The moment might finally have arrived.",

A luxury until it underwent its industrial revolution from the 1960s on, it is now ubiquitous. Today, questions about how poultry is produced, by and for whom, and to whose profit, take you to the heart of the global trade system.

For British Brexiters, the reward will be cheaper goods for consumers on low incomes. Both parties see the EU regulations on these standards, such as its ban on imports of poultry washed with chlorine, as unnecessary and at root protectionist. Chlorinated chicken has become totemic because it encapsulates a much wider argument over what sort of agriculture the world needs and how far we should regulate it.</p> <p>We chlorinate our water, so what\u2019s the problem with using chlorine washes to make chicken safe? <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49353220\" title=\"\">Why all the fuss</a>, asked Zippy Duvall, the head of the US farmers\u2019 lobby group, on the BBC\u2019s Today programme last month. The fact that we disinfect water with chlorine will not do as an argument here, despite Duvall\u2019s hopes. We disinfect our lavatories with it, too. The issue of safety depends on concentration. The World Health Organization recommends water supplies are treated with a maximum of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chlorine.pdf\" title=\"\">5mg of chlorine per litre</a>.

The EU allows salad leaves to be treated with chlorine washes, and in the UK they have typically been used at concentrations of up to 15-20mg per litre, although industry has been moving away from using them in response to consumer concerns.</p> <p>The WHO recommends <a href=\"https://cot.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/cot/cotstatementwashaids200614.pdf\" title=\"\">limits</a> on levels because disinfecting with chlorine leaves behind harmful residues of chlorinated compounds, some of which are known from animal tests to be cancer-causing.

It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents... an act of executive fiat\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A group of opposition MPs, carrying signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d tried to prevent the Speaker <strong>John Bercow </strong>from exiting his chair to go to the House of Lords to complete prorogation proceedings. As Conservatives left the chamber with the Speaker to attend the House of Lords, Labour MPs chanted \u201cShame on you!\u201d at them, while they remained in parliament singing Red Flag, Calon L\u00e2n (in Welsh), and Scots Wha Hae.<br><br></li> \n   <li>A thunderous Bercow returned to the House of Commons to confirm the prorogation of parliament, but only a handful of Conservative MPs returned, painting a striking visual of empty government and packed opposition benches.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Earlier in the day, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> once again failed in his attempt to force an early general election after opposition MPs abstained and Labour leader <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> said he would not let his party walk into \u201ctraps laid by this prime minister\u201d. This was the sixth parliamentary defeat for the prime minister in a week, more defeats than Thatcher, Major, Blair or Brown had in their entire tenures as PM. <br><br></li> \n   <li>Despite royal assent being given to legislation requiring a delay to Brexit beyond October 31 unless a divorce deal is approved or parliament agrees to leave the EU without one by 19 October , Johnson insisted he would not ask for another Brexit delay. <br><br></li> \n   <li>Speaker <strong>John Bercow</strong> announced his intention to stand down next month, leading to both tributes and criticism in the House.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>MPs voted narrowly to demand the government publish all written and electronic contact connected to prorogation and no-deal Brexit planning. While the government agreed it would share \u201cappropriate information with parliament\u201d but argued the \u201cscope of the information requested disproportionate and unprecedented\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Liberal Democrats announced they are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party, effectively severing the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p> \u2022 This summary was amended on 10 September 2019 because Plaid Cymru MPs sang Calon L\u00e2n, not Bread of Heaven as an earlier version said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T16:40:09.230Z\">at 5.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76f63c8f083106f455887a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T02:08:55.992Z\">3.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1171205489272729600\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Updated: Parliamentary defeats for each Prime Minister<br><br>Thatcher - 4 in 11 years<br>Major - 6 in 7 years<br>Blair - 4 in 10 years<br>Brown - 3 in 3 years<br>Cameron - 10 in 6 years<br>May - 33 in 3 years<br>Johnson - 6 in one week</p>\u2014 Richard Chambers (@newschambers) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newschambers/status/1171205489272729600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76ff7b8f083106f45588a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-10T01:49:18.838Z\">2.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More reaction coming in from MPs to the extraordinary night we\u2019ve just witnessed. </p> \n  <p>They are all furious and disgusted, though the reason for their anger is pretty much split down party lines, with Conservatives MPs appalled at the opposition MPs who tried to stop John Bercow from leaving his seat in parliament, whereas Labour and other opposition MPs are angry at the proroguing of parliament.

The other defeats were: on the Oliver Letwin motion allowing time for the Benn bill, on the Benn bill at second and third reading and on holding an early election. The final vote counted as a defeat, because Johnson did not get the required two-thirds majority, although technically he won, because more MPs voted in favour than against.</p> \n  <p>But what does this defeat mean?</p> \n  <p>Humble addresses are considered binding on the government. The passing of this motion (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d7698698f082514879f0f03#block-5d7698698f082514879f0f03\">7.24pm)</a> means the government is now obliged to release to the Commons:</p> \n  <p>1) all private messages sent between nine advisers, including Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff, including text and WhatsApp messages and private emails, sent from 23 July relating to the prorogation of parliament.</p> \n  <p>2) all the documents prepared within government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee.</p> \n  <p>The motion mentions 23 July because that is the day Boris Johnson became Tory leader. He become prime minister the following day.</p> \n  <p>The material is meant to be handed over by 11 September.</p> \n  <p>However, it does not seem likely that the government will comply. The Commons will not even be sitting on Wednesday. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that he wanted to publish some version of the Operation Yellowhammer document anyway. But during the debate Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, suggested that the government would not have the legal power to enforce the release of the internal prorogation messages, even if it wanted to comply. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d7682528f083106f4558549#block-5d7682528f083106f4558549\"> 5.51pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>Last year Labour used the humble address mechanism to require the publication of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice about the withdrawal agreement. The government initially ignored the request, and it only complied a month later when MPs passed <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2018/december/contempt-motion-on-publishing-of-legal-advice/\">another motion finding the government in contempt of parliament.</a></p> \n  <p>In this case no such contempt motion will be passed any time soon, because after tonight the Commons will not be sitting until 14 October.</p> \n  <p>And even if it were passed, a contempt motion on its own would not necessarily force Boris Johnson\u2019s government to comply. Theresa May\u2019s government did, but May respected the authority of parliament. Johnson\u2019s administration seems much more contemptuous of it. </p> \n  <p>On other issues MPs and campaigners have threatened legal action, or gone to court, to ensure that Johnson complies with their wishes. But this vote is not a matter of legislation, and it does not relate to the exercise of prerogative powers. It is a Commons procedural matter, and so it is hard to see on what basis the courts could intervene.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for the night.

If the house votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as Speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends. </p> \n   <p>If the house does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me stand down at the close of business on Thursday, 31 October. Least disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech expected on 21 and 22 October. </p> \n   <p>The week also after that may be quite lively and it would be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period. <br></p> \n   <p>Most democratic because it will mean that a ballot is held when all members have some knowledge of the candidates. This is far preferable to a contest at the beginning of a parliament when new MPs will not be similarly informed and may find themselves vulnerable to undue institutional influence.<br></p> \n   <p>We would not want anyone to be whipped senseless, would we? Throughout my time as Speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at any time. <br></p> \n   <p>To deploy a perhaps dangerous phrase, I have also sought to be the backbencher\u2019s backstop.<br></p> \n   <p>I could not do so without the support of a small but superb team in Speaker\u2019s House, the wider house staff, my Buckingham constituents, and above all my wife, Sally, and our three children, Oliver, Freddy and Jemima. From the bottom of my heart, I thank them all profusely.<br></p> \n   <p>I could also not have served without the repeated support of this house and its members past and present. This is a wonderful place filled overwhelmingly by people who are motivated by their notion of the national interest by their perception of the public good. And by their duty, not as delegates, but as representatives, to do what they believe is right for our country.<br></p> \n   <p>We degrade this parliament at our peril. I have served as a member of parliament for 22 years, and for the last 10 as Speaker. This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest privilege and honour of my professional life for which I will be eternally grateful.</p> \n   <p>I wish my successor in the chair the very best fortune in standing up for the rights of honourable and right honourable members individually and for parliament institutionally as the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T15:11:13.063Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76680f8f083106f45583bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T15:03:21.645Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is important to remember, of course, that only yesterday the Conservatives announced that they were going to field a candidate against John Bercow at the next election, even though the Speaker is normally given a clear run, because they had concluded he was biased against them on Brexit.

Taking advantage of the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow SO24 motions to be used not just for neutral motions (ie, ones with no practical effect), Grieve has used the process to table a \u201chumble address\u201d that, if passed, forces the government to release written material. And he is asking for not just one batch of material, but two: all private correspondence relating to the decision to prorogue parliament, and the Operation Yellowhammer government no-deal planning documents.

Johnson is expected to win the vote technically, because most MPs voting are expected to vote in favour, but lose the vote in practical terms, because under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two thirds of MPs (434) must vote in favour for the election election to happen.</p> \n  <p><em>Around 11pm or later?: </em>Parliament prorogues.

During the summer it emerged that, when Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, he once said about Leo Varadkar: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/268b55ec-a891-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?\u201d</a> Johnson campaigned for a policy outcome that will probably cause immense damage to the Irish economy, and for the last two years his Brexiter allies have frequently demonised Varadkar as the obstacle to a successful Brexit. Johnson then delayed his first visit to Dublin for weeks (despite this morning claiming that he believed it was important to speak to the Irish first \u2013 see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/09/brexit-latest-news-eu-no-deal-bill-royal-assent-boris-johnson-parliament-politics-live?page=with:block-5d7613748f082514879f08cf#block-5d7613748f082514879f08cf\">9.59am.)</a> Varadkar could be forgiven for wanting to tell him to take a jump.</p> \n  <p>Instead, Varadkar sounded sincere about wanting to ensure Ireland remains a friend to the UK in the future. (Realistically, that\u2019s the only sensible economic strategy.) And Johnson sounded considerably more measured and composed than he did in his public appearances on Thursday and Friday last week (not difficult). Perhaps shaken by the way people like his brother Jo Johnson and Amber Rudd have concluded he is not serious about finding a Brexit deal, he was much more negative about the reality of a no-deal Brexit than he has been for ages, describing it as \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But that did not prevent Johnson being disconcerted by some of the questions. He repeatedly dodged a question about when he last visited the Irish border.

He did not seem too bothered by Sumption\u2019s argument that the strategy outlined in the Daily Telegraph would be unlawful. He said he and his colleagues had been discussing in the House of Commons tearoom on Thursday what Boris Johnson might do to circumvent the law requiring him to ask for a no-deal Brexit, and Evans said: \u201cWe whittled them down to about 20.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He did not list all 20, but he referred to two: the government tabling a vote of no confidence in itself, or the government passing a one-line bill setting the date for an early election.</p> \n  <p>Evans also argued that, even though Johnson did not have the support of the Commons, he did have the backing of the public. Evans explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You have to remember, 400 MPs representing leave seats voted remain. You really do have parliament against the people.

The government could in theory try to pass a vote of no confidence in itself, but that would open up a 14-day period during which MPs could agree to support an alternative PM and government. And it could try to pass primary legislation requiring an election on 15 October, but that would require a majority, which Johnson does not have, and it could be amended in ways unacceptable to Number 10.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T08:38:03.657Z\">at 9.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7609948f083106f4557ffb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T08:16:06.826Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another former lord chancellor, <strong>David Gauke</strong>, has also said that the plan to try to sabotage any letter sent to the EU requesting a Brexit delay with a second hostile letter would not work.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1170963962369728515\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sending two letters to the EU \"carries no weight\" says former justice secretary David Gauke<br><br>\"The consensus view in the legal world is that it's pretty watertight,\" he says of the act passed by Parliament to prevent a no-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a><a href=\"https://t.co/jI6cvXd5nN\">https://t.co/jI6cvXd5nN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gwHUJmjJkB\">pic.twitter.com/gwHUJmjJkB</a></p>\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1170963962369728515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Gauke, of course, is one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed last week after voting against the government on this issue.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d76093a8f082514879f0895\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-09T08:11:52.577Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m sorry comments were not open earlier.

In other circumstances, and for other individuals, that might be seen as a reasonable approach to taking a difficult decision. But because of Johnson\u2019s long record of inconsistency, the story has come to be seen as emblematic of his duplicity.</p> \n  <p>As referred to earlier, according to<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/08/boris-johnson-draws-plan-legally-stop-brexit-extension-mps-vote/\"> today\u2019s Daily Telegraph splash (paywall),</a> Johnson is considering a new version of the \u201ctwo contradictory letters strategy\u201d to try to confound the law passed by parliament requiring him to request an article 50 extension if he has failed to agree a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted to agree no deal (which they won\u2019t). Here is an extract from<strong> Owen Bennett </strong>and<strong> Harry Yorke</strong>\u2019s story.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson has drawn up plans to \u201csabotage\u201d any Brexit extension <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/06/boris-johnson-set-defy-law-rather-ask-brexit-delay/\">without breaking the law</a>, the Telegraph has learnt ...</p> \n   <p>One plan under serious consideration would see the prime minister send an accompanying letter alongside the request to extend article 50 setting out that the government does not want any delay after Oct 31.</p> \n   <p>On Sunday night, a cabinet source told The Telegraph: \u201cThere is a prescribed letter that has to be sent ... Does that stop the prime minister sending other documents to the EU? I don\u2019t think it does.</p> \n   <p>\u201cA political explainer perhaps, as to where the government\u2019s policy is. It has to make clear that the government is asking for an extension, but let\u2019s not forget what the next step is.</p> \n   <p>\u201cOnce that is done, the Europeans are going to ask: \u2018Why? What is the reason?\u2019 [What] if the government said: \u2018We don\u2019t have any reasons for an extension\u2019?</p> \n   <p>\u201cThere is a clear path now: the Europeans need to refuse an extension.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Lord Sumption</strong>, a former supreme court judge, told the Today programme earlier this would be illegal.

The bill, or act as it\u2019s about to become, says that he\u2019s got to apply for an extension.

This is <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> kicking off the blog before Andy Sparrow and my colleagues in London take over on what promises to be another momentous day at Westminster and beyond. </p> \n  <p>After the resignation of the work and pensions secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/08/brexit-boris-johnson-amber-rudd-resignation-live-news\">Amber Rudd, dealt another blow</a> to Boris Johnson\u2019s government, there is more fevered speculation about whether or not the prime minister will try to bypass the backbench bill blocking no deal if, as is likely, it becomes law today.</p> \n  <p>It seems probable that there will be more twists and turns than an Ashes series, but here are some of the fixed points, along with possible developments: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Boris Johnson heads to Dublin for talks with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on how to break the stalemate over a solution to the Irish backstop. Read our splash story on this subject <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/boris-johnson-heads-to-dublin-amid-fears-of-more-resignations\">here</a>.</li> \n   <li>Johnson will then fly back to London where he is expected to make <strong>another attempt to force a general election on 15 Octobe</strong>r by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.</li> \n   <li>The gambit is likely to fail, according to most calculations, because opposition parties still want to ensure that a no-deal Brexit is definitely off the table before they go to the country. This would enable them to portray Johnson as having broken his key promise of delivering Brexit \u201ccome what may\u201d on 31 October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/the-boris-johnson-plan-and-how-it-fell-apart\">writes Michael Savage, in this very handy explainer</a> about what\u2019s been going on and what lies ahead.</li> \n   <li>Meanwhile, the backbench bill to block no deal <strong>is expected to receive royal assent today. </strong></li> \n   <li>If that goes ahead, <strong>the key question will be whether Johnson is somehow able to circumvent the legislation</strong> and go ahead with Brexit. There are reports swirling around that No 10 believes it can go to court to get around the law, but an equal number saying the government won\u2019t be able to. The latter point to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertBuckland/status/1170653531076026368\">a tweet by justice secretary Robert Buckland</a> that he has spoken to the PM \u201cregarding the importance of the rule of law\u201d.</li> \n   <li>There is the possibility that the EU could prevent Britain from delaying its exit anyway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/08/france-threatens-to-veto-further-brexit-extension\">according to our Brussels correspondent Daniel Boffey</a>.</li> \n   <li>And there is also <strong>the chance of further cabinet resignations</strong> following Rudd\u2019s decision to stand down. We report that she has been contacted by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers worried about the government\u2019s Brexit policy since tendering her resignation.</li> \n   <li>In all the chaos you might have missed the fact that <strong>Rudd was replaced as work and pensions secretary yesterday by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey</strong>, MP for Suffolk Coastal, a loyalist who was promoted from her role as environment minister.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>And I liked this picture of Johnson and his latest nemesis at the Tory conference last year.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up the blog now. Thank you to all of you absolute troopers who have stuck with us throughout this wild and prorogued night. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow as we report on the fallout of the crazy scenes we witnessed tonight. Until then! \u2018An act of executive fiat\u2019: Chaotic scenes as UK parliament suspended \u2013 video Parliament has been suspended until 14 October after a day and night of high drama that ended at about 2am. There were chaotic scenes as the prorogation formalities began in the early hours of Tuesday. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, expressed his anger at the suspension of proceedings, saying it was \u201cnot a normal prorogation. It is not typical. It is not standard. It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents... an act of executive fiat\u201d. A group of opposition MPs, carrying signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d tried to prevent the Speaker John Bercow from exiting his chair to go to the House of Lords to complete prorogation proceedings. As Conservatives left the chamber with the Speaker to attend the House of Lords, Labour MPs chanted \u201cShame on you!\u201d at them, while they remained in parliament singing Red Flag, Calon L\u00e2n (in Welsh), and Scots Wha Hae. A thunderous Bercow returned to the House of Commons to confirm the prorogation of parliament, but only a handful of Conservative MPs returned, painting a striking visual of empty government and packed opposition benches. Earlier in the day, Boris Johnson once again failed in his attempt to force an early general election after opposition MPs abstained and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would not let his party walk into \u201ctraps laid by this prime minister\u201d. This was the sixth parliamentary defeat for the prime minister in a week, more defeats than Thatcher, Major, Blair or Brown had in their entire tenures as PM. Despite royal assent being given to legislation requiring a delay to Brexit beyond October 31 unless a divorce deal is approved or parliament agrees to leave the EU without one by 19 October , Johnson insisted he would not ask for another Brexit delay. Speaker John Bercow announced his intention to stand down next month, leading to both tributes and criticism in the House. MPs voted narrowly to demand the government publish all written and electronic contact connected to prorogation and no-deal Brexit planning. While the government agreed it would share \u201cappropriate information with parliament\u201d but argued the \u201cscope of the information requested disproportionate and unprecedented\u201d. The Liberal Democrats announced they are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party, effectively severing the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election. \u2022 This summary was amended on 10 September 2019 because Plaid Cymru MPs sang Calon L\u00e2n, not Bread of Heaven as an earlier version said. More reaction coming in from MPs to the extraordinary night we\u2019ve just witnessed. They are all furious and disgusted, though the reason for their anger is pretty much split down party lines, with Conservatives MPs appalled at the opposition MPs who tried to stop John Bercow from leaving his seat in parliament, whereas Labour and other opposition MPs are angry at the proroguing of parliament. Both sides claim their opponents actions show them acting against the will of the people. Doesn\u2019t this feel like a long time ago now? But it was only about four hours ago that there was this heated exchange between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn about the calling of an election. A sign of just how long and how dramatic they day has been. Here\u2019s more from Alex Sobel, Labour MP, about what MPs were trying to do during that moment of altercation at the Speaker\u2019s chair during the prorogation proceedings. From what I witnessed, though a few MPs laid hands on John Bercow\u2019s arm and put their bodies between his chair and the floor, no one sat on him. Conservative MPs have condemned the opposition MPs who were involved in attempting to block the Speaker from leaving the chamber, including Assistant Government Whip Nigel Huddleston and Bob Seely, Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight, who condemned the Speaker for his behaviour today. With Trumpian syntax, Seely wrote: \u201cSpeaker loses plot at the end of parliament. Openly takes sides. Insults colleagues. Very sad.\u201d Here\u2019s some video of Scottish and Welsh MPs singing in the House as they waited for John Bercow to return from the House of Lords, where the prorogation formalities were taking place. While Conservative MPs left the House to go with Bercow and witness the suspension of parliament, opposition MPs remained in the Commons in protest at the prorogation. They filled their time with singing and from the feedback of MPs on Twitter, it appears the Welsh MPs, singing Bread of Heaven in Welsh, complete with harmonies, was judged the best of the bunch. Opposition MPs tried to physically stop the Speaker from going to Lords to prorogue parliament In case you missed it before, there were extraordinary scenes in the House after Black Rod came to address the Speaker, in which opposition MPs tried to physically stop the Speaker from leaving his chair to go out to the House of Lords to finish the prorogation formalities. Labour MP Rachael Maskell who was part of the group trying to stop Bercow\u2019s exit from the chamber posted this photograph of the moment as she reassured her followers: \u201cTonight I did everything I could to stop the Parliament being prorogued.\u201d Greens MP Caroline Lucas said the move was \u201cechoing the action of members to try to prevent the Speaker proroguing at the request of Charles I\u201d. Richard Wheeler, PA\u2019s parliamentary editor, calls tonight \u201carguably the most surreal time I\u2019ve spent in the Commons chamber in six-and-a-half years\u201d as Labour and opposition MPs remained in the chamber as the Speaker and Conservative MPs left to go to the House of Lords to watch the ceremony required for prorogation. Opposition MPs, holding up signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d, who chanted \u201cShame on you!\u201d as Conservative MPs left the chamber, started singing \u2013 Red Flag, Jerusalem, Flower of Scotland and Bread of Heaven. Parliament has been suspended until 14 October. Jeremy Corbyn is now shaking hands with John Bercow and Labour MPs are queued up to shake Bercow\u2019s hand. The Speaker is taking his time with each handshake, giving Ian Blackford a big pat of the back and a rub of the arm. Bercow now hugging John McDonell. This might take a while. The camera has just panned back and we can see nine Conservative MPs. The Conservative benches are almost empty, whereas the Labour benches are packed with MPs holding up signs saying \u201csilenced\u201d. These are quite extraordinary scenes. John Bercow is reading out what happened. He sounds incredibly bored. He is saying that the leader of the House of Lords addressed the group and gave assent to the proroguing of parliament. John Bercow has returned to the House of Commons, where he was given a huge round of applause by Labour MPs. \u201cI feel much more at home here,\u201d he says. The group \u2013 including Bercow and Black Rod \u2013 are now returning back to the House of Commons where opposition MPs have been singing. Lords have addressed the Speaker and ordered that parliament has been prorogued. There was a lot of hat-tipping and now the Speaker, Black Rod and other key MPs have left the Lords. There are some serious scenes going on right now, as opposition MPs band together in protest at the prorogation by singing. Opposition MPs were holding up signs in parliament saying \u201csilenced\u201d. And one of these signs has been left on the Speaker\u2019s chair. Labour MP Clive Lewis has posted a photograph of it alongside a quote suggesting what has happened today equates to \u201ctyranny\u201d. Bercow was loudly applauded by opposition MPs as he left the chamber. Labour MPs then chanted \u201cshame on you!\u201d to Conservatives as they exited. Some classic Bercow in that last speech, which he interrupted to address an MP who was heckling him (I missed the original comment), to which Bercow responded: \u201cI require no response from you Mr Stephenson! You wouldn\u2019t have the foggiest idea where to start in counselling me. I require no response from you, I require no response to you! Get out, man!\u201d The heckling continues, someone yells: \u201cAnti-deomocratic\u201d. Someone heckles the Speaker to \u201cdo your job for which you\u2019re handsomely paid\u201d. And he has walked out of the parliament, followed by MPs. MPs are chanting \u201cShame on you!\u201d as the Conservative benches empty. The Speaker says he treats Black Rod with respect and he understands that the Lords are doing what \u201cthey believe to be right\u201d. He says he is happy to play he part. But wants to point out: \u201cthis is not a standard or normal prorogation\u201d and that it \u201crepresents an act of executive fiat\u201d. Black Rod has entered and is addressing the Speaker. And we\u2019re back. The door has been ordered to be closed. Parliament was meant to be back five minutes ago, but is still not back. Maybe someone lost their ermine robe. A reminder that progroguing parliament does not just have implications for Brexit. Parliament will not sit again until 15 October and a host of bills will not be heard because of the break, including, as Jon Featonby from the British Red Cross points out, a bill about reuniting refugees in the UK with their family members. We are about two minutes away from parliament being prorogued. So, what is actually going to happen? My colleagues Martin Belam and Jessica Elgot have written this helpful guide including this information about the ceremony that is about to take place: You cannot do anything in Westminster without a bit of pomp and circumstance. A ceremony of prorogation involves a message from the Queen being read in the House of Lords, and then Black Rod summoning MPs from the Commons to the Lords. A list of all the bills passed by the parliament is read, followed by a speech on behalf of the Queen announcing what has been achieved by the government before MPs are sent home. Given what is on the order paper in parliament on Monday, this is likely to happen very late this evening. Good evening/early hours of the morning everyone. This is Kate Lyons taking over from Mattha Busby. Parliament has been suspended for 10 minutes to prepare for the prorogation formalities. Or as David Linden (SNP MP) put it \u201cso folk can get their ermine robes and funny hats on\u201d. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts says all the checks and balances of parlimentary democracy have been \u201cdeliberately stormed\u201d. When the government teeters between avoiding and evading the law, this is neither normal nor honourable. We desperately need a new politics of citizens conventions in every nation, of truth and conciliation in an informed referendum, with article 50 revoked if necessary for this to happen. The Green Party\u2019s Caroline Lucas says that events tonight have clearly shown that the political system is broken. It is wrong that a prime minister can suspend parliament as a mere inconvenience simply to avoid scrutiny. It is wrong that he can cynically try to use the proposals for a general election as a way of getting us to crash out of the EU while we\u2019re in the middle of a general election campaign. We can no longer continue with an uncodified constitution that depends on people playing by the rules when we have a feral government. Liberal Democrat MP Sir Ed Davey says his party is offering the prime minister a way out: \u201cPut it to the people in a People\u2019s Vote\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford says Johnson has lost every vote in the House of Commons since he became prime minister and predicted that he will be \u201cswept from government\u201d in the next election. The party\u2019s leader in Westminster declares he is looking forward to Scotland securing independence \u201caway from the clutches of a Tory Brexit Britain and an isolationist Britain taking us away from our partners and friends in the European Union\u201d. Amid mass abstentions, 293 MPs vote for the prime minister\u2019s motion, while 46 vote against it. The course of action required the support of two-thirds of MPs. \u201cThe majority does not satisfy the requirements of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act,\u201d the Speaker, John Bercow, confirms. \u201cI earlier urged the house to trust the people but once again, the opposition think they know better,\u201d says Boris Johnson, after his second attempt to trigger an early general election fails. \u201cThey want the British prime minister to go to a vital negotiation without the power to walk away. They want to delay Brexit yet again, without further reference to those who voted for it \u2026 And so now the house will move to adjourn and resume the state opening and the Queen\u2019s speech on October 14, and I hope the opposition will use that time to reflect. Meanwhile, this government will press on with negotiating a deal.\u201d Responding, Jeremy Corbyn says: \u201cThe one thing the prime minister didn\u2019t say was that he was going to obey the law of this country. He did not say, acknowledge or accept three votes that have taken place in this parliament, and under his request, the House is now due \u2013 apparently this evening \u2013 to be prorogued for one of the longest prorogations in history, simply in order to avoid any questioning of what he is doing or not doing \u2026 This government is a disgrace.\u201d Independent MP Ivan Lewis says parliament\u2019s handling of Brexit has reduced the UK to a \u201claughing stock around the world\u201d and warns of the economic consequences of the further insecurity \u2013 urging Brexit to be delivered. \u201cWhatever the deal is put to this house, there are many, many people who will vote against it because they want to thwart the terms of the referendum result,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is many of the so-called progressives in this house who are fuelling rightwing extremism by showing contempt for the result. One can\u2019t be a selective democrat.\u201d Tory MP Tom Tugenghat says the only answer to solving the current impasse is a general election. Shortly after, John Bercow calls for a division. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake attacks Corbyn for \u201ccampaigning for decades to leave the EU on any terms possible\u201d and criticises Labour MPs for opposing Theresa May\u2019s \u201csensible deal\u201d for the purposes of \u201cparty politics\u201d. He says it is reasonable for people to expect the UK to leave the EU with a deal, but calls for the people to have a vote to decide the best way forward. In response, Tory MP Andrew Selous says parliament is very good at saying no, but \u201cbereft of ideas to come up with anything better\u201d and calls on the result of the referendum to be respected by a new parliament that will \u201cactually vote for something for a change\u201d. Labour MP Sir George Howarth then asks why the prime minister is putting his own ambitions above the national interest. \u201cCometh the hour, cometh the man. Well, the hour has come, but certainly not the man,\u201d he says. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson commends Amber Rudd\u2019s brave decision in resigning from the cabinet \u2013 in what could be interpreted as the extension of an olive branch to the former work and pensions secretary. She goes on to tell Boris Johnson that people across the UK are afraid of a no-deal Brexit. Labour &amp; Co-operative MP Geraint Davies says that rather than spend millions on propaganda, the government should disclose Yellowhammer and use the money to help educate people about the horrors of the report. Questioned about her party\u2019s earlier announcement, Swinson says: \u201cIf people really want an end to this Brexit mire, the way to do that is to stop Brexit \u2026 A Liberal Democrat government would revoke article 50.\u201d She says elections should not be held at moments of national crisis. Although I believe that a People\u2019s Vote is the best way to resolve this, I say to the prime minister, he can have his general election as soon as he secures an extension, because otherwise we risk the scenario where there is a general election where we crash out of the European Union either during or in the immediate aftermath of such an election, and with parliament not sitting at those crucial moments, it would be the height of irresponsibility to dissolve parliament at that time. Former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan says the government has been \u201ctrammelled into a Kafkaesque trap\u201d by the Fixed Term Parliaments Act and that he hopes the next government will act swiftly to abolish it. He says that leaving the EU has been the most \u201cpoisonous, difficult decision of our life\u201d and predicts that a general election \u2013 called with Brexit unresolved \u2013 would not resolve the problems the government faces either. Blackford says Johnson has lost the support of Scottish Tories, referencing the resignation of former leader Ruth Davidson. \u201cWe want an election,\u201d he declares. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want it on the prime minister\u2019s terms. This is a prime minister who cannot be trusted, who is seeking to trap parliament tonight so he can drive us off the cliff edge.\u201d Bill Grant, one of 13 Tory MP\u2019s in Scotland intervenes to say that in 2016 more people in Scotland voted to leave the EU than voted for the SNP in 2017. Blackford says the SNP has won the last three elections, before going on to warn that the prime minister is set to demonstrate that the law \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d. The prime minister is saying with those words that he\u2019s going to ignore an act of parliament. That he is going to ignore the law. I would simply say to the Prime Minister: be careful. You occupy the highest office in the land and what you\u2019re demonstrating to the people of the United Kingdom is that the law doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s a very serious situation to be in. I ask the prime minister to think again, to think very carefully or be prepared to pay the consequences of ignoring the law of this land. SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford says he is ashamed at what he has seen in parliament this evening and calls on MPs to behave in a dignified manner. However, DUP MP Ian Paisley claims that an SNP MP shouted \u201cYou\u2019re a liar\u201d when Boris Johnson was speaking, and also alleges that a Labour member shouted \u201cYou\u2019re a thug\u201d at the prime minister. Blackford says he is condemning all such behaviour, and fellow SNP MP Stewart McDonald intervenes to compare the prorogation of parliament to events typical of a \u201cfailed state\u201d that Tory MPs would denounce. Johnson tells Corbyn to go to Brussels and negotiate a deal for himself, as the back and forth goes on, and the Labour leader retorts that his party is responsible and accuses the government of suspending parliament to avoid scrutiny. In particularly fraught proceedings \u2013 with Tory MP Robert Goodwill at one point standing up and flapping his arms like a chicken as some of his colleagues shouted chicken \u2013 Corbyn declares that the prime minister is talking up no-deal to one wing of his party and talking up getting a deal to the other. \u201cThe sad reality is that he is not preparing adequately for the first and not negotiating at all for the other,\u201d he says. \u201cThis government is only interesting in shutting down parliament to avoid scrutiny. His obfuscations and evasions are being rumbled, both at home and abroad.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to walk into traps set by this government.\u201d Corbyn says he wants to \u201cturf out this government\u201d, sparking jovial scenes on Tory benches, before claiming the government is \u201cscapegoating migrants\u201d and deepening divisions. He criticises Boris Johnson\u2019s social media output and then asks why, if the PM seeks a no deal, he does not argue for one and seek a mandate for it. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has an apology for anyone watching proceedings in parliament. Jeremy Corbyn is called to address the question of whether there should be an early general election. \u201cThe only point of any importance the prime minister\u2019s just included in his speech is his clear indication that he does not intend to follow the law that has just been passed that requires him to ask for an extension in certain circumstances,\u201d he says. Corbyn declares he will not vote to support the dissolution of parliament until no-deal is taken off the table. \u201cI am not prepared to risk the disaster of inflicting no deal on us, our communities, our jobs, our services, or indeed, our rights,\u201d he exclaims. \u201cNo deal would not be a clear break \u2026 It would start a whole new period of confusion and delay. But this time, set against a backdrop of rising unemployment, further deindustrialisation and deepening poverty all across this country.\u201d The Speaker dismisses \u201cpolitical\u201d interventions from several MP\u2019s, including Sarah Wollaston, who asks whether the prime minister will appear in committee as scheduled on Wednesday. Boris Johnson warns MPs that they are \u201cthwarting the will of the people\u201d and calls again for a general election. Johnson throws down the gauntlet to opposition MPs and reasserts that he would leave the EU without a deal. If you really want to delay Brexit beyond October the 31st, which is what you seem to want to do, then vote for an election and let the people decide if they want a delay or not. And if you refuse to do that tonight, I will go to Brussels and negotiate our departure, hopefully with a deal, but without one if necessary. I will not ask for another delay. The Tory benches are raucous as Johnson moves the microphone closer to himself, until Anna Soubry brings a point of order and urges him to confirm whether he will respect the wishes of parliament. Johnson thanks Bercow for his \u201ccharacteristically impartial judgements\u201d and goes on to obfuscate by criticising Corbyn for receiving a salary and highlighting inconsistencies in Labour\u2019s Brexit policy positions. Johnson criticises the Liberal Democrats over their plans to cancel Brexit. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats also called for a referendum on our membership to the EU and once they got it - and by the way they lost it, of course - they did nothing but try to overturn the result,\u201d he says. \u201cArrogating to themselves to decide which democratic decisions they respect and those they reject. They want a second referendum and they are already planning to campaign against the result. When asked if she would implement Brexit if the people voted for it the party\u2019s new leader replied \u2018No\u2019.\u201d However, he describes the party as a model of \u201ccoherence by comparison with the leader of the opposition\u201d and claims that Labour do not want an election because they fear they will lose. But he says there are a small minority of Labour MPs who also don\u2019t want a general election because they think the party might win. In front of a packed front bench, Johnson says \u201cDither, delay and procrastination\u201d have become \u201cthe hallmark of the opposition\u201d and proclaims he would win an election. He gives way to Labour MP Marsha de Cordova who says nine years of austerity has led to the degradation of the education system and the NHS, as well as four million children living in poverty. Johnson suggests, in more colourful terms, that the money spent on EU membership would help fund public services. Enter the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who thanks for the Speaker for his long and distinguished service, and puts forward the motion to bring an early election. He then mockingly praises Jeremy Corbyn for declining the \u201copportunity\u201d to remove the government. \u201cLast Wednesday [Jeremy Corbyn] became the first leader of the opposition in the history of our country to show his confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s Government by declining the opportunity to have an election with a view to removing the Government.\u201d He says Corbyn previously said he would back an election if legislation to prevent the Government from forcing through a no-deal Brexit on October 31 became law. The surrender act has now passed, it\u2019s gained royal assent, he\u2019s done his level best to wreck this country\u2019s chances of a successful negotiation. By his own logic, he must now back an election. Throughout the weekend [Corbyn\u2019s] cronies, together with those of other opposition parties, have been trying to disguise their preposterous cowardice by coming up with ever more outrageous excuses for delaying an election until the end of October or perhaps November or when hell freezes over. The parliamentary buildings bill motion passes without a division, and Labour MP Stephen Doughty says he has been made aware that the government is \u201cseeking to circumvent the terms of the resolution that the house passed earlier about the release of documents relating to prorogation and Operation Yellowhammer\u201d. He asks whether the Speaker can advise on the method through which the papers can be disclosed. John Bercow criticises an MP who he says shouted \u201cYawn\u201d as Doughty was speaking and says the government must comply with the wishes of the house. Its not \u2018Yawn\u2019, its serious politics. The simple answer is that the government must comply with the Humble Address passed by the House. That is the reality of the matter. A debate has happened, a decision has been made, and it is incumbent upon the government to comply manifestly with what\u2019s been decided, the spirit, purposes and content of which are entirely clear. This not about game-playing and machination, it\u2019s about doing what parliament wants, which is what most people would expect their elected parliament to do. Today\u2019s sketch from the Guardian\u2019s John Crace, as we await the early election debate while MPs discuss Lords amendments to the parliamentary renovation plans. The Liberal Democrats are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party. Guardian political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that the move would effectively sever the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election. \u201cI relish the chance to take the fight to Boris Johnson in an election and I\u2019m confident we\u2019d make significant gains,\u201d says party leader Jo Swinson. \u201cWhenever the election comes, our position is clear and unequivocal. A majority Liberal Democrat government would not renegotiate Brexit, we would cancel it by revoking article 50 and remaining in the European Union.\u201d In the Commons, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds says that his party is \u201cfully committed\u201d to restoring devolved powers in Stormont. He alludes to a number of the party\u2019s controversial positions, including on keeping abortion illegal, and says the DUP would deal with the important issues Northern Ireland faces \u201cwithout prejudice to the issues that Sinn F\u00e9in have elevated\u201d. Dodds claims that Sinn F\u00e9in is \u201cpreventing the restoration of Stormont\u201d upon the basis of these issues. Former Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins is to join investment bank Goldman Sachs, according to the FT. The paper reports that he will not earn an elite-rank wage, but will receive a six-figure sum just below the managing director level, where salaries start at \u00a3770,000. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg tweets that the government is expected to disclose the Brexit documents tomorrow. There are reports that Phil Hogan, Ireland\u2019s European commission nominee, is to be confirmed as the EU\u2019s chief trade negotiator. The Irish politician has been critical of Boris Johnson and warned last month of the ramifications of a no-deal Brexit on the relationship between the UK and EU states. \u201cIf the UK fails to prevent a crash-out Brexit they should be under no illusion regarding the foul atmosphere they will create with their EU partners and the serious consequences this will have for negotiating any future trade agreement,\u201d he said, according to the Irish Times. The BBC has posted this remarkable video of opposition MPs arguing earlier. A number of other MP\u2019s, including the chancellor Sajid Javid, has since reposted the exchange. In the Commons, MPs are now debating the motion relating to the executive in Northern Ireland moved by Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith in Theresa May\u2019s former chief whip\u2019s first appearance at the dispatch box. However, he says that there is not enough time to debate all the motions on the order paper. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two years but Smith says he believes the parties could swiftly agree a programme for government despite fundamental disagreements. Political parties across the spectrum must now realise that the lack of political leadership has left public servants bearing the load for far too long .. There can be no more excuses. We just have to get this assembly and executive up and running .. The government will now intensify its efforts to put forward compromise solutions to the parties. The Guardian\u2019s Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported earlier (see 4.26pm) that there were rumours Boris Johnson was considering putting forward a Northern Ireland-only backstop to get a Brexit deal through parliament in the second half of October. As Daniel Boffey reported on Friday, it is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d. BBC political editor Nick Robinson sums up how the government has fared of late. The Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee writes that MPs should do away with \u201cCorbynphobia\u201d to prevent a no deal. It\u2019s no use wishing for another leader of the opposition; this is the one Labour has, and in this crisis he is now stepping up to the plate. His leadership of the alliance has been \u201ccollegiate\u201d; he is the grownup, while Johnson breaks things. Theresa May lost her 20-point lead in the 2017 election; Johnson\u2019s lead in the polls is about half that. Corbyn\u2019s manifesto back then was highly popular and you can bet it will sell well again. He\u2019s a good campaigner; Johnson may disappoint. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn closes the debate and says his party would support an early general election once \u201cthe government had made clear they will carry out the law\u201d, asking it to extend the Brexit deadline to prevent no deal. \u201cSurely, Mr Speaker, the very least we deserve from the prime minister is a clear undertaking that a requirement that we ask for an extension until January to prevent crashing out must be made at the appropriate time,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy can\u2019t the foreign secretary or the prime minister say that?\u201d After the government has made it clear that it will respect the law, Labour would be happy to debate any of the government\u2019s policies in a general election, Corbyn declares. And the motion passes without a division. Raab says the country wants \u201cthis mess sorted out\u201d by the end of October but that the House of Commons is seeking to further delay Brexit. \u201cIn those circumstances, the proper way to proceed is for this House to allow voters to decide in an election who goes over to negotiate at the European Council on the 17th of October, the prime minister, or the right honourable gentleman,\u201d he says, pointing at Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cBut what is [he] afraid of?\u201d In the absence of an election, Johnson will go to Brussels on that day to negotiate a departure from the EU \u201cwith or without a deal\u201d. \u201cI urge this house to vote today not for more deadlock and delay but the only course of action that will break this deadlock, restore public confidence in our democracy, and allow this country to move forwards,\u201d Raab says. Taking a sterner line as he goes on, Raab says Johnson is working on securing a deal but claims the country is appalled by repeated attempts in parliament \u201cto frustrate Brexit\u201d. Respecting the referendum must also mean that this house allows us to leave without a deal if Brussels leave no other credible choice. Taking that option off the table severely weakened our negotiating position. Winding up the debate, the foreign secretary \u2013 who first mooted the idea of proroguing parliament during the Tory election contest \u2013 pays tribute to what he describes as interesting points that have been made \u201cby all sides of the house\u201d and provides a careful account of the government\u2019s position. This government will always respect the rule of law. That\u2019s been our clear position consistently, and frankly it is outrageous that it is even in doubt. Of course, how the rule of law will be respected is normally straightforward. But sometimes it can be more complex because there are conflicting laws or competing legal advice. The government usually gets its interpretation right, but there have been many judicial reviews over the years by many governments of different complexions. When on occasion the government has lost a case \u2026 then of course it must correct its position accordingly and expeditiously. A number of backbench Tory MPs have been offering defences of the government position, and longtime Eurosceptic Peter Bone says the legislation designed to prevent no deal was \u201crushed through\u201d without \u201cproper scrutiny\u201d and that this debate is being held for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d. \u201cThis is a general debate which is being held for political purposes,\u201d he asserts. Tory MP for the Cotswolds Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown says it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the prime minister would break the law and claims the longer uncertainty over Brexit goes on, the more the public will hold parliament in contempt. \u201cThis parliament has passed a rotten law, it has asked the prime minister to seek an extension on terms that we know not what they were, are, might be,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could face all sorts of terms in that extension \u2026 Yet this parliament has mandated the prime minister to accept those terms whatever they are.\u201d Moments earlier, former Labour MP Ian Austin called into question the opposition party\u2019s credentials for government. \u201cThese people are a million miles away from the traditional, mainstream politics of the Labour party,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have poisoned what was once a great party with extremism. They cannot be trusted with the institutions that underpin our democracy.\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson says it is \u201castonishing\u201d that a debate over whether the prime minister will respect the rule of law is taking place. \u201cThe prime minister is on a power trip, but the truth is he does not have unfettered power much as he would like to,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of arrogance and entitlement about this action. He acts like rules and conventions simply do not apply to him.\u201d She concedes the law preventing no-deal is not perfect. \u201cIts a good step, but not a guarantee .. frankly I for one, will not put anything past our prime minister in terms of what he will try to engineer.\u201d Extremely strong words from the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford who says freedoms, rights and democracy are under threat and under attack by a prime minister \u201cthreatening to ignore the rule of law\u201d. Mr Speaker, today is indeed a historic day, a dark day, it will be remembered as the day the UK government obstructed the people and plunged the United Kingdom into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. The prime minister says he would rather die in a ditch than write to seek an extension to protect our economy from falling off the cliff edge, if that is the course he chooses then he must resign. Undermining democracy at every turn, [Johnson] simply cannot be trusted. The rule book has been well and truly ripped up, and with it democracy and decency shredded by a cult of Brexit fanboys in No 10 unfit and unwilling to govern. Mr Speaker, what a despicable state of affairs, that an unelected bureaucrat - the prime minister\u2019s lead advisor, is sitting in No 10 devising and directing an assault on democracy, preventing parliamentary scrutiny and transparency And should we be surprised, these are the men behind the biggest con in modern times. The government has responded to the passage of the vote earlier compelling the release of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer document and No 10\u2019s private prorogation correspondence. Meanwhile, on Radio 4, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen says he believes that a Northern Ireland only backstop would only be acceptable if put to a vote in the nation. The most senior government minister currently in the chamber Dominic Raab, and former Tory MP Anna Soubry says that given the motion concerns the rule of law it would be surprising if the foreign secretary were to answer those questions. In fairness, Raab was a lawyer before becoming an MP. But the point still stands, and further questions are likely to be raised if a government law officer such as the secretary of state for justice, or the attorney general, do not address Corbyn\u2019s motion. Winding up his speech, Corbyn calls on Johnson to come to the dispatch box to set out \u201chis detailed plan for Brexit\u201d and confirm he will abide by the law. I hope the prime minister will live up to the office that he holds, accept the decisions made of the parliament and carry out the wishes of that Act to ensure that an application is made to prevent this country crashing out on the 31st of October with all the damage that will do to food supplies, medicine supplies, industrial supplies, and his longer term ambitions of heading this country in a totally different direction which many, many people are truly frightened of. Prominent Brexiteer and Tory backbencher Peter Bone asks whether Corbyn would support a no-deal if one of the other EU countries blocked the UK from extending article 50. The Labour leader dismisses the question as hypothetical and calls on the government to accept the decision of parliament to pass the act preventing no-deal into law \u2013 before predicting the vote calling for a general election later this evening will not pass. \u201cNo 10 has briefed that the PM will defy the law, so until the government has abided by that law, I don\u2019t believe there will be a majority in this house for what the PM is proposing later today under the Fixed-term Parliament Act. Asked again what would happen if an EU country did not grant an extension, Corbyn says: \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to get a deal but what we don\u2019t want is a no deal exit with all the dangers for jobs, living standards, supplies and the prime minister and his chums taking us down the road into the arms of Donald Trump and the trade arrangements he\u2019ll make with the US.\u201d He goes on to reference Amber Rudd\u2019s claims over the weekend that there was \u201cnot one shred of evidence\u201d that the government had made any new proposals during the Brexit negotiations. Former minister Angela Eagle intervenes to highlight the apparent contradiction between Boris Johnson saying he would obey the bill preventing a no-deal if it was passed, but the next day announcing he would rather be dead in a ditch. Corbyn says he does not wish anyone dead in the ditch, but that the PM should accept the democratic will of parliament. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an executive president who can rule over us .. We will expect the prime minister to abide by the details of the law.\u201d The SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, then says the government has a responsibility to recognise the impact of its abusive language and actions outside of parliament. Corbyn agrees that language has consequences: \u201cSurely we can have an intelligent debate in our society without resorting to that kind of behaviour, language or violence threatened against some individuals.\u201d Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s motion, which is now being debated and may go through without a division. That this house welcomes the completion of all parliamentary stages of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill and has considered the matter of the importance of the rule of law and ministers obligation to comply with the law. Earlier (see 5.12pm), the Labour leader said MPs would be concerned by suggestions from No 10 that the prime minister may not obey this law. Opening his speech, Corbyn thanked the Speaker and welcomed the decision the house had just reached and said he looked forward to the government abiding by it. The fact that parliament is compelled to pass a law to ensure the will of parliament is upheld shows what extraordinary times we now live in. The house has rejected no deal, businesses and trade unions are united in rejecting no deal, and there is no majority for it across the country. The Chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster [Michael Gove], the co-convenor of the vote leave campaign, said in March this year \u2018we didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. It is clear there is no mandate for no deal. In trying to diminish the act, the government\u2019s spin doctors have branded it the surrender bill and ministers dutifully trotted out this phrase in the media and the minister who\u2019s going to reply has already replied like Pavlov\u2019s dogs always do. We are not at war. The prime minister is obsessed with this hyperbole and aggressive language. \u2018surrender bill\u2019, \u2018do or die\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019d rather be dead in a ditch\u2019, the list goes on. Mr Speaker, we\u2019re supposed to be having negotiations with our European partners. The lives at stake as a result of all of this, are not those of the prime minister or his cabinet. He went on to criticise Boris Johnson\u2019s absence from the House of Commons, amid cries of \u201cwhere is he\u201d. Following the conclusion of this 90-minute debate, MP\u2019s will debate a motion under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act and Lords amendments to the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill. Then, at around 10pm, MPs will debate Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election over the course of an hour and a half, before a vote which will take 15 minutes. Parliament will then prorogue. That was Boris Johnson\u2019s fourth main defeat in a Commons vote since he became prime minister. The other defeats were: on the Oliver Letwin motion allowing time for the Benn bill, on the Benn bill at second and third reading and on holding an early election. The final vote counted as a defeat, because Johnson did not get the required two-thirds majority, although technically he won, because more MPs voted in favour than against. But what does this defeat mean? Humble addresses are considered binding on the government. The passing of this motion (see 7.24pm) means the government is now obliged to release to the Commons: 1) all private messages sent between nine advisers, including Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff, including text and WhatsApp messages and private emails, sent from 23 July relating to the prorogation of parliament. 2) all the documents prepared within government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee. The motion mentions 23 July because that is the day Boris Johnson became Tory leader. He become prime minister the following day. The material is meant to be handed over by 11 September. However, it does not seem likely that the government will comply. The Commons will not even be sitting on Wednesday. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs that he wanted to publish some version of the Operation Yellowhammer document anyway. But during the debate Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, suggested that the government would not have the legal power to enforce the release of the internal prorogation messages, even if it wanted to comply. (See 5.51pm.) Last year Labour used the humble address mechanism to require the publication of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice about the withdrawal agreement. The government initially ignored the request, and it only complied a month later when MPs passed another motion finding the government in contempt of parliament. In this case no such contempt motion will be passed any time soon, because after tonight the Commons will not be sitting until 14 October. And even if it were passed, a contempt motion on its own would not necessarily force Boris Johnson\u2019s government to comply. Theresa May\u2019s government did, but May respected the authority of parliament. Johnson\u2019s administration seems much more contemptuous of it. On other issues MPs and campaigners have threatened legal action, or gone to court, to ensure that Johnson complies with their wishes. But this vote is not a matter of legislation, and it does not relate to the exercise of prerogative powers. It is a Commons procedural matter, and so it is hard to see on what basis the courts could intervene. That\u2019s all from me for the night. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. MPs have backed the Grieve motion requiring the release of some no-deal planning documents, and private messages from No 10 officials about prorogation, by 311 votes to 302 \u2013 a majority of nine. Here is the text of Dominic Grieve\u2019s motion. That a humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to direct ministers to lay before this House, not later than 11.00pm Wednesday 11 September, all correspondence and other communications (whether formal or informal, in both written and electronic form, including but not limited to messaging services including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook messenger, private email accounts both encrypted and unencrypted, text messaging and iMessage and the use of both official and personal mobile phones) to, from or within the present administration, since 23 July 2019 relating to the prorogation of Parliament sent or received by one or more of the following individuals: Hugh Bennett, Simon Burton, Dominic Cummings, Nikki da Costa, Tom Irven, Sir Roy Stone, Christopher James, Lee Cain or Beatrice Timpson; and that ministers be further directed to lay before this House no later than 11.00pm Wednesday 11 September all the documents prepared within Her Majesty\u2019s government since 23 July 2019 relating to operation Yellowhammer and submitted to the cabinet or a cabinet committee. MPs are now voting on Dominic Grieve\u2019s SO24 motion. Dominic Grieve intervenes. He asks Gove to explain why no government official swore an affidavit for the prorogation court case? Gove says the question for MPs is, are they willing to ignore data protection legislation, the ECHR and the normal conventions of government, just so that Grieve\u2019s curiosity can be satisfied. John Bercow, the Speaker, intervenes and calls the vote. Gove says he has already said that the government intends to plan a version of the Operation Yellowhammer report on no-deal planning. But it is neither an impact assessment or a worst-case scenario, he says. Gove says the Grieve motion is unprecedented. It is a fishing expedition, he says. He says it drives a coach and horses through privacy regulation. And he says it may be in breach of article eight of the European convention on human rights on privacy. He suggests this is an unprecedented example of people who claim to respect conventions undermining them. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is now winding up for the government. He says documentation about how the government decided to prorogue parliament is already in the public domain, because of the court cases that have been taking place. He says it rare for such information to be in the public domain. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, says Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, made it clear last week that he was not consulted about the decision to prorogue parliament. He says submissions sent to the PM do not normally go to the whole of the cabinet. He says the government is now being asked to submit every idea on this submitted by officials to the PM. But there has to be a \u201csafe space\u201d where advice can be private, he says. He says Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, told a committee earlier today that if this motion were passed, it would have a chilling effect on the advice given to ministers. He says that four of the people named in the motion are civil servants, not just one as Dominic Grieve said earlier. These are from Lindsay Hoyle, the most senior of the three deputy speakers and one of the favourites to replace John Bercow as Speaker. Boris Johnson was due to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee, which represents all select committee chairs, on Wednesday. It would have been his first appearance before the committee, which questions prime ministers three times a year, for about 90 minutes at a time. But the decision to prorogue parliament means the committee hearing will not go ahead because Commons committees do not formally meet during prorogation. But Sarah Wollaston, the committee\u2019s chair, has written to Johnson asking him to agree to meet them anyway, as he originally said he would. It would not be an official committee hearing, but there is nothing to stop MPs agreeing to hold a meeting at any time they want. If prorogation meant the committee could not use a Commons committee room for the hearing, doubtless the BBC or Sky would be more than happy to host the hearing. (Or the Guardian - we\u2019ll find you a room and a video feed.) Owen Paterson, a Tory Brexiter, is speaking now. He says the motion names nine \u201crelatively junior\u201d people. He says it is unfair that they are being asked to disclose their private communications. I just think before this witch hunt atmosphere continues, would members opposite like to consider they are talking about nine relatively junior members assisting the government. Can we just think of the impact on them that their private emails, their private phone to their family and friends, are all going to be inspected. And who is the omniscient person, this great found wisdom, on who will judge whether those messages are pertinent to this motion? (The list includes Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff. No one thinks he is relatively junior.) Cherry speculates that people in government may have discussed the real reason for prorogation not in official emails, which would be subject to disclosure rules, but in private messages or using burner phones. She says that is why the motion (see 5.35pm) asks for the release of private messages relating to the prorogation of parliament. If they have done nothing wrong, they have nothing to fear, she says. She says she knows enough about English history to know that two kings, Edward II and Richard II, were brought down by \u201cunaccountable whispers of poison\u201d. This motion could reveal other \u201cunaccountable whispers of poison\u201d, she suggests. Cherry refers MPs to this article by the legal commentator David Allen Green in the Financial Times (paywall) at the weekend. She says the court case revolved around the government\u2019s motives for proroguing parliament - the matter of \u201cbad faith\u201d. She says that in litigation like this, faced with an allegation of bad faith, the normal response of a respondent would be to provide a witness statement. But in this case the government did not do that, he says \u2013 a point made by Green. Here is an extract from Green\u2019s article. Could it be that a witness statement was intended and prepared but that the relevant senior officials refused to sign it? Or that the document contained something the government did not want the court, or the world, to know? Ms Cherry asked Michael Gove, the minister responsible for no-deal planning, about it. He said he had \u201cabsolutely no idea\u201d. Witness statements are formal court documents, and it is a criminal offence to sign one that you know to be incorrect. They are serious documents for serious people, as far apart from the trivial discourse of political sloganeering and promises as one can imagine. Witness statements matter. The government\u2019s position on prorogation is that the request was made for routine reasons, and not to frustrate parliament. The legal challengers in London say there is evidence that ministers themselves do not quite believe it. But that is the official version. The government has disclosed some documents which, on their face, show that the prorogation was routine but Ms Cherry and others fear that these do not provide a full account, and that the decision was contained in unofficial communications, such as WhatsApp messages. My own view is that if the government\u2019s disclosed documents were the entire story then a witness statement would not have been a problem. Cherry says if the courts decide the prorogation was unlawful, they can order parliament to return. In the Commons Joanna Cherry, the SNP justice and home affairs spokeswoman, is speaking now. She is one of the MPs backing the legal challenge in Scotland against the decision to prorogue parliament. She says even the \u201cdogs in the street\u201d know the real reason for prorogation was to do with the desire to try to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. She says as late as 25 August No 10 was denying that it planned to prorogue parliament, even though the decision to prorogue was taken earlier. She says the government has a reputation for being economical with the truth. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, used his speech in the debate to say Labour would be backing the Grieve motion. He said that in recent weeks there had been a growing lack of trust in the government among MPs. Here is the key quote from Dominic Grieve. In his speech opening the debate, he referred to the government\u2019s claim that the five-week prorogation was not related to its desire to limit the opportunity for MPs to obstruct a no-deal Brexit. Ministers claimed that that was not a factor, and that the length of the prorogation was just to do with the need to prepare for the Queen\u2019s speech. But, Grieve said, when the government was taken to court, there were claims that that government lawyers could not find any officials willing to swear an affidavit backing up the government\u2019s case. He continued: Then a most remarkable thing happened, and this is where it becomes more difficult for me. I have to say that in the course of the days that followed, I started to be given information from public officials informing me that they believed that the handling of this matters smacked of scandal. There\u2019s no other way to describe it. Of course, that places me in a difficulty because it is simply the information that I\u2019ve been given, and I want to make absolutely clear that I\u2019m not in a position any more than I think any member in this house to be able to ascertain if that information is mistaken or not. I can only say that I believe those sources to be reliable and also in my experience extraordinarily unusual that I should get such approaches with individuals expressing their disquiet about the handling of this matter and some of the underlying issues to which it could give rise. So it is as a consequence of that that I have drafted \u2026 the humble address concerning the prorogation documents. Grieve said one of the nine officials named in his motion was a civil servant, but all the rest were special advisers (political appointees). He said he had named them because they might have information that would shed light on what happened. But he stressed that the decision to name these people did not mean he was making any \u201cimputation\u201d against them. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, intervenes again. He says this motion would be binding on the government. But it would not be binding on individuals. He says he thinks, in what he is saying, Grieve is narrowing the information that he wants to request. Grieve does not accept this. He says advisers should be willing to provide the information requested in this motion, if MPs vote for it. If they are not willing to do that, that would amount to a \u201cslide towards a government that will not respect the conventions without which orderly government in this country cannot take place\u201d. Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan intervenes. He says Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff, asked a special adviser to hand over her personal mobile phone for inspection before he sacked her. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, intervenes. He asks what legal right the government has to require its employees to give up its personal email accounts and private messages. Grieve says these are government employees. During the course of their work they have to comply with the civil service code, including not using private email addresses to carry out official work. He says, in addition to that, it is a question of what the Commons requests. He says he understands this house could act abusively. But he says, if any government employee is asked to look and see if a communication has been carried out relevant to work, you should be willing to provide it. That should not be a matter of coercion, he says. Geoffrey Cox suggests No 10 could not force staff to comply with Grieve\u2019s motion. In the Commons Chris Leslie, the Independent Group for Change MP, intervenes on Dominic Grieve to quote from a Mail Online story quoting a No 10 source saying that even if the motion is passed Downing Street will not comply. He says that is the problem. NNo 10 is quoted saying things like this that ignore all conventional rules. He says it is impossible to know where these comments come from. Grieve says, when questions about this were asked at PMQs, Boris Johnson refused to engage with the questions. He says he does not trust Johnson to provide answers on this. Dominic Grieve is opening the debate on his standing order 24 motion that would force the publication of the government\u2019s Operation Yellowhammer document and No 10\u2019s private prorogation correspondence. Here is the text of the motion. He started by saying how concerned he was by government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks. Referring to Boris Johnson\u2019s comment about how the September sitting was something introduced by the \u201cgirly swot\u201d David Cameron, he says he guessed Johnson mentioned this as a contrast with his own \u201cmanly idleness\u201d. Grieve also says, after the announcement came out, he was contacted by people claiming that the decision amounted to a scandal. He says the government claimed that the long prorogation had nothing to do with limiting the opportunities for MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit, but that in fact that may be untrue. He says his motion requires the publication of private messages relating to prorogation sent by nine named officials, from 23 July. The nine officials are named in his motion. He says that the fact that people have been named should not be seen as an allegation of wrongdoing. From now until 7.15pm: MPs debate the Grieve SO24 motion saying the government should publish its Operation Yellowhammer documents and correspondence about proroguing parliament. At 7.15pm there will be a vote taking about 15 minutes. 7.30pm: MPs will debate Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s motion for 90 minutes. It may go through at the end without a division. Around 9pm: MPs will debate a motion under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act and Lords amendments to the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill. In theory, up to two and a half hours has been set aside for these matters, but they are likely to wrap up much sooner \u2013 perhaps in about an hour. Around 10pm: MPs begin the 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election. When it finishes there will be a vote, which will take about 15 minutes. After that parliament will prorogue. John Bercow says he will allow the Corbyn application for an emergency debate too. He says the debate will start after the Grieve SO24 one. It will last for up to 90 minutes, he says. Jeremy Corbyn says he wants an urgent debate on a matter of overriding importance on this motion: That this house welcomes the completion of all parliamentary stages of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill and has considered the matter of the importance of the rule of law and ministers obligation to comply with the law. He says MPs will be concerned by suggestions from No 10 that the prime minister may not obey this law. Bercow says that debate will start now, and that it will last for two hours. But first he is hearing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s application for another SO24 debate. Dominic Grieve is now making his application for a standing order 24 debate. Here is the motion he is proposing. Grieve says MPs will now have the chance to ask about Operation Yellowhammer because of the prorogation, and also have a chance to ask about the government\u2019s motives for proroguing parliament for five weeks. He says his motion would enable MPs to get these documents before Brexit. He says, if the motion is agreed, he will explain in the debate why these documents are required. John Bercow allows the motion. Some MPs shout now, but at least 40 MPs (the number required) stand up, meaning it will go ahead. Parliament should be debating the \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences of a no-deal Brexit that could put lives at risk, instead of being suspended, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Speaking ahead of a \u201cNo to no deal\u201d rally in Glasgow this evening. Brown said: Boris Johnson and his ministers say that Britain is taking back control. But in reality, Britain is losing control \u2013 of our food supplies, of our medical supplies and of our manufacturing supplies \u2026 Can the prime minister guarantee that medical supplies \u2013 the 1m medical packs that come every day into the country through ports such as Dover \u2013 arrive uninterrupted and without putting lives at risk? Can he pledge that our food supplies \u2013 30% of which come from mainland Europe and another 10% through countries where Europe has trade agreements \u2013 will arrive uninterrupted without putting nutritional standards at risk and pushing food prices up 10%? Brown said without these assurance, Brexit would be \u201cthe biggest own goal in our peacetime economic history \u2026 no matter how much it is dressed up as a patriotic act\u201d. These are from the Institute for Government\u2019s Hannah White. More on the backstop. This is from the Financial Times\u2019s George Parker. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is pleased about John Bercow\u2019s departure. This is what my colleague Rajeev Syal wrote earlier this year about the candidates to be next Speaker. Here is video of John Bercow\u2019s resignation statement. The Labour MP Jim Cunningham has also announced he is standing down at the next election, the BBC\u2019s Simon Gilbert reports. In the Commons the Bercow leaving do tributes are still rolling on. For a different take, this from the Times\u2019 Esther Webber. This is from PA Media. A new law designed to stop the government forcing through a no-deal has reached the statute book. The granting of royal assent for the legislation was announced by the Lord Speaker in the House of Lords, ahead of the suspension or prorogation of parliament. The new act requires a delay to Brexit beyond 31 October unless a divorce deal is approved or parliament agrees to leaving the EU without one by 19 October. Boris Johnson has previously branded it the \u201csurrender bill\u201d, claiming it took away control of the UK\u2019s negotiations with the EU by allowing parliament to block no deal. Downing Street has said the government will obey the law, but repeated that the PM would not be seeking a further extension to the article 50 withdrawal process. In the Commons chamber the tributes to John Bercow are still coming. But not everyone is joining in. This is from the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young. One theory doing the rounds in Dublin is that Boris Johnson may pull a Northern Ireland-only backstop out of the bag at the last minute as a means of forcing a Brexit deal through parliament in between 17 October and 31 October. The idea was mooted early on in Brexit talks but famously dropped after opposition from the DUP, which accused Theresa May of trying to break up the union of the United Kingdom by creating regulatory checks down the Irish Sea. But Johnson\u2019s proposal for an all-island agriculture zone is one of the key elements of the backstop and now that the DUP no longer has the leverage it had because of the changed arithmetic, some believe this is where the landing zone is. As Daniel Boffey reported on Friday, it is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d. The suggestion that Stormont could have a role in dynamic regulatory alignment has been rejected by the EU, but it is being seen as a sign of the thinking in Conservative quarters. It may also explain why efforts are being redoubled to get Stormont back up and running by the deadline for direct rule in October. One British source said the all-island agri-zone \u201cis a very serious proposal\u201d and should not be dismissed, with another reporting one senior cabinet minister dropping strong hints that a Northern Ireland-only backstop is not off the table, despite statements to the contrary by Boris Johnson. So is it possible that Johnson comes back from Brussels on 17 October with no deal, and, faced with the law that will require him to seek an extension, reverts to the original Northern Ireland-only backstop in a very last die-in-a-ditch moment? A few months ago we posted this video with some highlights from John Bercow\u2019s time as Speaker. These are from the House magazine\u2019s Seb Whale. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From my colleague Patrick Wintour The tributes to John Bercow are still coming in. They have included tributes from Dame Cheryl Gillan, who praised Bercow for the support he has given to those who have campaigned on behalf of those with autism, from Angela Eagle, who praised his campaigning on behalf of LGBT issues, and from Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, who said that even though he disagreed with some of Bercow\u2019s rulings, he thought Bercow had been an \u201coutstanding\u201d Speaker. Bercow told Bone it was big of him to say that in the light of their Brexit disagreements. Here is the full text of John Bercow\u2019s resignation statement. Colleagues, I would like to make a personal statement to the house. At the 2017 election I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep. If the house votes tonight for an early general election, my tenure as Speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends. If the house does not so vote, I have concluded that the least disruptive and most democratic course of action would be for me stand down at the close of business on Thursday, 31 October. Least disruptive because that date will fall shortly after the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech expected on 21 and 22 October. The week also after that may be quite lively and it would be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period. Most democratic because it will mean that a ballot is held when all members have some knowledge of the candidates. This is far preferable to a contest at the beginning of a parliament when new MPs will not be similarly informed and may find themselves vulnerable to undue institutional influence. We would not want anyone to be whipped senseless, would we? Throughout my time as Speaker I have sought to increase the relative authority of this legislature for which I will make absolutely no apology to anyone, anywhere, at any time. To deploy a perhaps dangerous phrase, I have also sought to be the backbencher\u2019s backstop. I could not do so without the support of a small but superb team in Speaker\u2019s House, the wider house staff, my Buckingham constituents, and above all my wife, Sally, and our three children, Oliver, Freddy and Jemima. From the bottom of my heart, I thank them all profusely. I could also not have served without the repeated support of this house and its members past and present. This is a wonderful place filled overwhelmingly by people who are motivated by their notion of the national interest by their perception of the public good. And by their duty, not as delegates, but as representatives, to do what they believe is right for our country. We degrade this parliament at our peril. I have served as a member of parliament for 22 years, and for the last 10 as Speaker. This has been, let me put it explicitly, the greatest privilege and honour of my professional life for which I will be eternally grateful. I wish my successor in the chair the very best fortune in standing up for the rights of honourable and right honourable members individually and for parliament institutionally as the Speaker of the House of Commons. It is important to remember, of course, that only yesterday the Conservatives announced that they were going to field a candidate against John Bercow at the next election, even though the Speaker is normally given a clear run, because they had concluded he was biased against them on Brexit. The story is here. A few minutes ago Michael Gove praised Bercow lavishly. (See 3.51pm.) Maybe he was being sincere if speaking in a personal capacity (Gove is an accomplished parliamentarian debater, and did not seem to mind Bercow giving backbenchers the chance to hold the executive to account), but for a Conservative party and government representative to be praising Bercow a day after launching a plan to unseat him, and on the day the government is closing parliament to stop ministers being held to account, was astonishingly hypocritical. David Lidington, the former Cabinet Office minister, represents the constituency next door to Bercow\u2019s in Buckinghamshire. He says Bercow never allowed his duties as Speaker to detract from his need to represent his constituents. Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, whose bill designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was passed as a result of a procedural ruling allowed by Bercow, praises Bercow as a reforming Speaker who has empowered parliament. Bercow says Gove never complained about urgent questions being granted at short notice, because he was always quick enough and bright enough to respond. He suggests that praising Gove may not do him credit on the Tory benches. (Many Tory MPs loath Bercow, and will be glad to see him gone.) Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is speaking now. He says for the first time he would like to associate himself with what Jeremy Corbyn said. He says Bercow was a tenacious backbencher, and frontbencher too. He says he has no wish to prematurely truncate Bercow\u2019 role in the chair. He says he has always appreciated the way Bercow has tried to ensure the executive has been held to account. He says Bercow has acted in the best tradition of Speakers. He says Bercow has tried to make the executive answerable to the Commons, just as the house is answerable to the people. He ends by saying he and Bercow have children at the same school. Jeremy Corbyn rises on a point of order and uses it to thank John Bercow for his work as Speaker. He says Bercow has \u201ctotally changed the way in which the job has been done\u201d. He has gone out to the country and spoken at schools and factories. He says he will always remember Bercow speaking to students with learning disabilities at an event in Corbyn\u2019s constituency. He says he has made the role of Speaker more powerful. Corbyn says, as someone who aspires to hold executive office, he approves of a powerful parliament holding the executive to account. He says he has tried to do that himself during his career. Bercow says he could not have served without the support of the Commons. He says it is filled with people motivated by their sense of public duty, and with people who see themselves not as delegates but as representatives \u2013 there to do what is best for the public. He says he has been an MP for 22 years, and Speaker for 10 years. It has been the greatest honour of his life, he says. He wishes his successor all the best in terms of standing up for the rights of MPs individually, and for parliament institutionally. Bercow has finished. He receives a round of applause, although with most of the clapping coming from the opposition benches. Bercow says he has always sought to be the champion of backbenchers. If you like, he has been their backstop, he says. He thanks House of Commons staff. And he thanks his wife and his three children. He sounds very emotional at this point. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he wants to make a personal statement. At the 2017 election he promised his wife and children that it would be his last, he says. He says if the Commons votes for an early general election, his tenure as Speaker and as an MP will end when this parliament ends. He says, if MPs do not vote for an election, he has concluded the least disruptiveoption will be to stand down at close of play on Thursday 31 October. He says the votes on the Queen\u2019s speech will come at the start of that week. He says it would make sense to have an experienced Speaker in the chair for those votes. And he says this would be the most democratic option because it would allow the new Speaker to be elected by MPs who know the candidates. From the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy Tory MPs are falling like skittles at the moment. Another, Mark Prisk, has announced that he is standing down at the next election. Prisk, 57, a former minister, voted remain in 2016 and voted with the government in the divisions on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. In his letter announcing his decision he says it is not a reaction to Brexit. But he also deprecates \u201cthe rise of narrow ideology over pragmatic, common sense\u201d, and so it is not hard to guess what he thinks of what Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are doing to the Conservative party. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has put out this statement about Boris Johnson\u2019s meeting with Leo Varadkar in Dublin this morning. She said: I am encouraged by the prime minister\u2019s commitment to getting a sensible deal. I hope the discussions in Dublin lay the foundation for a way forward. We want the referendum result implemented. To do otherwise would be to damage democracy but we have never been champions of exiting the European Union without a deal. To secure a sensible deal which respects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom will require pragmatic discussions on all sides. The prime minister has already ruled out a Northern Ireland-only backstop because it would be anti-democratic, unconstitutional and would mean our core industries would be subject to EU rules without any means of changing them. We will continue to work with the government and will also use any discussions with the taoiseach to encourage efforts towards a sensible deal. Foster is right to say that Johnson has ruled out a Northern Ireland-only backstop. But he also told told Tory MPs during the leadership contest that he was not attracted to the idea of proroguing parliament, and look what happened to that pledge. Perhaps she has included that paragraph because she wants to hold him to his commitment not to have a Northern Ireland only arrangement. It is interesting that she is saying he has ruled out a Northern Ireland backstop on the grounds that it is undemocratic, when in fact that is his argument for ruling out the UK-wide backstop. The argument for ruling out a Northern Ireland only one is different; that it would lead to a regulatory border down the Irish Sea. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Here is the full text of Dominic Grieve\u2019s SO24 motion. (See 2.23pm.) The government intends to prorogue parliament this evening, but before MPs get sent away for their five-week recess, they have got a huge amount to get through. Here is the timetable for the rest of the day. I use the word \u201ctimetable\u201d provisionally, because at this point it is not at all clear how long everything will take. In theory, if everything took the maximum amount of time allocated, the Commons could still be sitting at 8am tomorrow morning. No one expects that to happen. But the final vote, on whether or not to have an early election, may come at around 11pm. Here is what we know. 2.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, takes questions. 3.30pm: Two MPs make applications for emergency debates under standing order 24. They are Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, and Jeremy Corbyn. Taking advantage of the Speaker\u2019s decision to allow SO24 motions to be used not just for neutral motions (ie, ones with no practical effect), Grieve has used the process to table a \u201chumble address\u201d that, if passed, forces the government to release written material. And he is asking for not just one batch of material, but two: all private correspondence relating to the decision to prorogue parliament, and the Operation Yellowhammer government no-deal planning documents. Corbyn\u2019s motion is about the rule of law, but I have not seen the text yet. The Speaker will have to decide whether to accept one or both motions. Given the level of anger in the Commons about the prorogation decision, it is quite likely both will be allowed. In theory each debate could last up to three hours, taking you to 10pm if both motions were to be put to a vote. But at Westminster today there is an assumption that MPs will get through the SO24 debate or debates more quickly. Early evening?: The government has tabled five motions under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. Up to 90 minutes is allocated for each debate, but it is understood that four of the motions will get pulled, and the other one is not expected to take the full 90 minutes. Early/mid evening?: MPs have to conclude the parliamentary buildings (restoration and renewal) bill, which is returning from the Lords. Up to an hour has been set aside for this debate, but, again, it could wrap up more quickly than that. 9pm or later?: MPs begin the 90-minute debate on Boris Johnson\u2019s motion calling for an early election. Johnson is expected to win the vote technically, because most MPs voting are expected to vote in favour, but lose the vote in practical terms, because under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two thirds of MPs (434) must vote in favour for the election election to happen. Around 11pm or later?: Parliament prorogues. This involves a ceremony taking place in the House of Lords, with MPs summoned to attend, as happens with the Queen\u2019s speech - only without the Queen. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, is suggesting Boris Johnson could be impeached if he ignores the law designed to rule out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid\u2019s Wesminster leader, said this after the meeting of opposition leaders this morning. I am glad that as opposition parties, we are united in our belief that Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to undermine the rule of law must be stopped. If the prime minister refuses to seek an extension to the period under article 50, he will have broken the law \u2013 plain and simple \u2013 and he must be subject to legal repercussions. I told other opposition parties this morning that if he does break the law, we should be ready to impeach Boris Johnson \u2013 a procedure that he himself supported in 2004 when current Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price sought to impeach Tony Blair for lying. Saville Roberts did not mention the fact that Price\u2019s attempt to impeach Blair in 2004 got nowhere. As this Commons library briefing (pdf) explains, \u201cimpeachment is considered obsolete, as it has been superseded by other forms of accountability\u201d. Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, has suggested Johnson could be jailed for contempt of court if he ignored this law. This is what Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said after the meeting of opposition parties this morning. It is clear there must be an early election - but it cannot happen while the Tory government is threatening to subvert the law to force through a catastrophic no-deal Brexit on 31 October. If Boris Johnson wants an election he must obey the law and take a no-deal Brexit off the table. It is beyond belief that the prime minister is disrespecting democracy by seeking to shut down parliament and railroad through an extreme Brexit against the will of parliament and the people. Once the threat of no deal is off the table, we will move for an early election. The government has spent tens of thousands of pounds in recent days on adverts promising \u201cBrexit is happening\u201d on 31 October, despite increasing uncertainty over whether it actually will, PA Media reports. Figures from Facebook showed the government had paid out \u00a330,531 on the targeted posts in the five days since they were launched on 4 September \u2013 the same week MPs voted to block a no-deal departure. The adverts point to information for businesses and members of the public on how to prepare for the planned exit on Halloween. Jeremy Corbyn has described the government\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament this evening as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Asked about the move, Corbyn said: I think it is disgraceful. Parliament should be sitting. Parliament should be holding the government to account. And the prime minister appears to want to run away from questions. Corbyn also confirmed that the opposition parties have agreed not to back an early election until the government has complied with the bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. This is from Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, commenting after a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders this morning. One consequence of the decision to prorogue parliament this evening is that Boris Johnson will not have to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee at a session that was scheduled for Wednesday. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee (and a member of the liaison committee) has issue this statement on behalf of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum. He said: It is extraordinary that Boris Johnson will shut down parliament this evening for over a month at the very moment when we need our elected MPs to be in the House of Commons holding the government to account. It also means that the prime minister will avoid having to face questions from the liaison committee on Wednesday. I don\u2019t think he was relishing the prospect. Richard Benyon, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who lost the whip last week after he voted against the government, has announced he is standing down at the next election. Here is a full list of MPs who are standing down. There are now almost 20 MPs, elected as Tories at the last election, who have said they are not standing again. Almost all are from the centrist, one nation wing of the party. There are another 13 who could go because they lost the whip last week and may struggle to get re-elected as independents. Back in the public administration committee, Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, said that in the event of a general election, essential government business could continue. That would include the Brexit talks, he said. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have issued a joint statement following their talks in Dublin. Here it is in full. They said that while \u201ccommon ground\u201d was established in some areas, \u201csignificant gaps\u201d remain between them. The prime minister and the taoiseach had a positive and constructive meeting in Government Buildings this morning. This was an essential and timely opportunity for the prime minister and the taoiseach to establish a relationship and a better understanding of each other\u2019s positions. They spoke privately over breakfast for more than half an hour before joining their delegations for another half-hour meeting. While they agreed that the discussions are at an early stage, common ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain. The UK and Ireland are committed to securing an agreement between the European Union and the UK, and recognise that negotiations take place through the Brussels taskforce. They also shared their commitment to the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and the restoration of the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland. They look forward to meeting each other again in the near future. Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq goes next. Q: When were you told of the PM\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament for five weeks? Sedwill says the paper has been revealed in court. He was on holiday at the time, but he was kept informed, and read that paper on the day it was submitted to the PM, or the day after. The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan asks if, in the event of a vote of no confidence, the PM could just run down the clock for 14 days without recommending an alternative PM to the Queen. Sedwill confirms that that is the case. Sedwill suggests that, following a vote of no confidence, the prime minster would not be obliged to suggest an alternative PM to the Queen. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. There is a live feed here. Sedwill has just said the prime minister is under a duty to resign only when he, or she, can make a recommendation to the Queen as to who is most likely to be able to command the confidence of the House of Commons. That is a political judgment the PM must exercise, with advice from the cabinet secretary. Q: Does the PM need to test that, with a sitting House of Commons? No, says Sedwill. He says when Boris Johnson was appointed there was talk of having a vote of confidence in the house. But that did not go ahead. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Downing Street has also insisted, again, that Boris Johnson will refused to request an article 50 extension - even though legislation passed last week, and due to receive royal assent later today, would require him to do this if MPs do not pass a deal or vote to approve a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: The prime minister is not going to seek an extension. If MPs want to resolve this there is an easy way - vote for an election today and let the public decide. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims that Boris Johnson has changed tack and that he is now going \u201call out\u201d for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. Here are the main quotes from the Boris Johnson/Leo Varadkar press conference. Boris Johnson insisted that he genuinely wanted to secure a Brexit deal before 31 October and he described a no-deal Brexit as \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d. This is a marked change of tone from Johnson, who in the past has repeatedly insisted that the dangers of no deal have been exaggerated by his critics. He said: I want to find a deal. I have looked carefully at no-deal. Yes, we could do it, the UK could certainly get through it, but be in no doubt that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible. He also insisted a deal could be achieved. I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement. I do believe that a deal can be done by October 18 [the final day of the EU summit] so let\u2019s do it together. He said he was \u201cundaunted\u201d by the opposition to his strategy in parliament. He said: We will come out on October 31, and I\u2019m sure that parliamentarians will see the wisdom of doing that and respecting, honouring, the referendum result - the democratic referendum result. And, I\u2019m absolutely undaunted by whatever may take place in parliament. I think what the British people want us to do is to deliver a deal and to get on and take us out on October 31. Leo Vardakar said that there would be no \u201cclean break\u201d for the UK from the EU, whatever happens later this year. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, which poses a threat to the Tories at the next election, is demanding a no-deal Brexit, which it describes as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d. In a reference to this terminology, Varadkar said: The story of Brexit will not end if the United Kingdom leaves on 31 October or even 31 January \u2013 there is no such thing as a clean break. No such thing as just getting it done. Rather, we just enter a new phase. If there is no deal, I believe that\u2019s possible, it will cause severe disruption for British and Irish people alike. We will have to get back to the negotiating table. When we do, the first and only items on the agenda will be citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border. All the issues we had resolved in the withdrawal agreement we made with your predecessor. An agreement made in good faith by 28 governments. Varadkar said, even if there were a deal, negotiations between the UK and the EU would have to continue. We will enter talks on a future relationship agreement between the EU and UK. It\u2019s going to be tough dealing with issues ranging from tariffs to fishing rights, product standards and state aid. It will then have to be ratified by 31 parliaments. He said that, even if Johnson agreed a deal by 31 October, negotiating a free trade deal with the EU during the time set aside for the transition, and getting it ratified by all EU parliaments, would be a \u201cHerculean task\u201d. He said that he was prepared to listen to Johnson\u2019s ideas for an alternative to the backstop, but he would not just accept a \u201cpromise\u201d. He said: I am ready to listen, but what we will not do is replace a legal guarantee with a promise. He said he thought the EU would need a \u201cgood reason\u201d if it were to agree to another article 50 extension. He wanted this matter resolved at the October summit, he said. He explained: I\u2019m very keen to have this matter resolved at the EU summit. Brexit has dominated politics for far too long now. This is an opportunity for common ground and finding a solution. As for an extension, we\u2019d like to see this dealt with but if there is a good reason to have an extension we would consider it. He said Ireland would oppose the reintroduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland, which he said would be \u201ccontrary to the St Andrews agreement\u201d. Johnson claimed he had \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d for alternatives to the backstop. But he refused to give any detail of what they were. He said: I\u2019ve seen the old border and how absolutely vital it is we keep the open border, on the plan, it\u2019s fairly obvious, we need to find a way of ensuring that the UK is not kept locked in backstop arrangement while giving Ireland the assurance that it needs. Whether it\u2019s electronic pre-clearance or concept of the unity of island for agri-foods, and other ideas we\u2019ll bring forward to address the full range. I don\u2019t underestimate the technical problems but I do think there is a way through. Varadkar said having no backstop would mean there being no deal. He said: In the absence of agreed alternative arrangements, no backstop is no deal for us. Prorogation is the process that happens when parliament gets suspended at the end of one session of parliament before the start of another, which starts with a new Queens\u2019s speech. It is not the same as parliament being dissolved, which is what happens before a general election. And it is not the same as when parliament gets adjourned, for a recess, as happens over a holiday period. If you want to learn more about the process, this House of Commons library briefing note (pdf) may tell you everything you need to know. No 10 has confirmed at the morning lobby briefing that parliament will be prorogued at the end of proceedings tonight. This is from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. Up to 100 demonstrators gathered outside Leinster House, the Irish parliament, in Dublin this morning ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin, PA Media reports. The protest was led by Seamus McDonnell from Co Armagh, who chanted: \u201cNo customs, no border, no Brexit.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Dessie Ellis said: We\u2019re here today to protest against Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Dublin. We want to send out a strong message that we will not stand for a hard border or any border. There are people from all around the country here to tell him that today but particularly from the border region. People living in the border region will suffer immensely if a border comes back so the taoiseach needs to stand strong, stand his ground and give that message from the Irish people. The Criminal Bar Association has condemned suggestions from the government that it might try to ignore the law saying the PM would have to request a Brexit extension by 19 October, unless Boris Johnson either agrees a deal or gets MPs to vote for no deal. This is from the CBA\u2019s chair, Caroline Goodwin: As the CBA our role is not to say \u2018remain\u2019 or \u2018leave\u2019 but part of our role is to explain the law \u2013 criminal law \u2013 and play our part in upholding the rule of law. Standing up for the rule of law underpins our civil society \u2013 the economy, justice system, societal cohesion. In or out, the EU, a government that stands up for the rule of law acts in the best interests of the people \u2013 parliament included. Any government \u2013 the executive \u2013 which ignores the rule of law and actively seeks to break the law undermines the entire justice system, opens the door wide open to mob rule and very quickly to anarchy. How can a government on the one hand pledge to unleash a \u2018reign of terror\u2019 on criminals when its own leadership threatens to break the law? We cannot expect people not to rob, rape and murder when a government declares it may break the law. We cannot lay rape to the rule of law. And this is what other journalists are saying about the Boris Johnson/Leo Varadkar press conference. From RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young From Euronews\u2019s Darren McCaffrey From the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam From politics.co.uk\u2019s Ian Dunt From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From the Irish News\u2019s Allison Morris That was a slightly longer press conference than we had been led to expect and, given the circumstances, it was perhaps not as frosty as it might have been. During the summer it emerged that, when Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, he once said about Leo Varadkar: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?\u201d Johnson campaigned for a policy outcome that will probably cause immense damage to the Irish economy, and for the last two years his Brexiter allies have frequently demonised Varadkar as the obstacle to a successful Brexit. Johnson then delayed his first visit to Dublin for weeks (despite this morning claiming that he believed it was important to speak to the Irish first \u2013 see 9.59am.) Varadkar could be forgiven for wanting to tell him to take a jump. Instead, Varadkar sounded sincere about wanting to ensure Ireland remains a friend to the UK in the future. (Realistically, that\u2019s the only sensible economic strategy.) And Johnson sounded considerably more measured and composed than he did in his public appearances on Thursday and Friday last week (not difficult). Perhaps shaken by the way people like his brother Jo Johnson and Amber Rudd have concluded he is not serious about finding a Brexit deal, he was much more negative about the reality of a no-deal Brexit than he has been for ages, describing it as \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d. But that did not prevent Johnson being disconcerted by some of the questions. He repeatedly dodged a question about when he last visited the Irish border. He ignored a question about whether he stood by the claim he one made about how technology could solve the border issue because that is how the congestion charge is enforced on the border between Camden and Islington. And he was humbled by a brilliant question pointing out that, while he is happy to use \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d as a metaphor, Brexit undermines arrangements that have preserved the peace in an country where until recently hundreds of people did end up dead in ditches literally. Johnson claimed to have \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d to resolve the backstop. (See 10.08am.) But, unless he is moving towards approving a Northern Ireland-only backstop (which is possible, although the DUP would erupt), his comments about wanting to preserve the all-Ireland economy while avoiding border checks and still taking the UK out of the EU, suggest he is still fundamentally stranded in \u2018have cake and eat it\u2019 territory. Johnson\u2019s strategy is driven by the understandable belief that many British voters just want to see Brexit done and for the whole crisis to go away. But this may be misconceived. As Varadkar argued forcefully in his opening remarks, there is no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d, and this problem will be with us for years. (See 9.47am.) Q: The Irish say they have received no new proposals today. Have you got anything today? And if you create an all-Ireland agrifoods zone, won\u2019t that put a border in the Irish Sea that the DUP won\u2019t accept. Johnson says the government has \u201can abundance of proposals\u201d. But he does not want to share them with the media. He says he will discuss ideas with Varadkar. He wants changes to the political declaration, as well as to the withdrawal agreement. He says he thinks he has \u201cthe ideal amount of time\u201d to sort this out. Angela Merkel said 30 days would be enough to find a solution. She was right. Varadkar says \u201cno backstop is no deal\u201d. That is not an option Ireland finds acceptable, he says. And that\u2019s it. I will give a verdict, summary and reaction soon. Q: When you talk about people being dead in ditches, there is a sense that you don\u2019t really understand what is at stake here. When did you last visit the border? Do you still think it is like the border between Camden and Islington? Johnson says he thinks everyone here understands the importance of the border. The UK will never impose checks at the border, he says. There must be an open border, so goods and people can circulate in the normal way. He says he genuinely thinks that solutions can be found. Varadkar says he hopes this will get settled at the EU summit in October. Most EU countries would prefer not to have an extension. But if there were a \u201cgood reason\u201d for one, the EU would consider it. Q: How can you convince Varadkar that you have the power to get anything through parliament? Johnson says everyone can see the Brexit talks have been going on for far too long. The EU wants this done, and he wants this done. And he thinks parliamentarians will see the wisdom of this. He claims he is \u201cundaunted\u201d by what is happening in parliament. The British people want him to deliver Brexit. He says he wants to \u201cmanage down\u201d expectations. I don\u2019t think we are going to have a complete breakthrough here today. Q: What would the Irish government think about London imposing direct rule on Northern Ireland? Varadkar says the Irish would oppose direct rule, as contrary to the St Andrews agreement. Johnson and Varadkar are now taking questions. Q: Have you visted the border as PM? And when are we going to see the detail of your backstop plan? Johnson says he knows what the border was like in the old days. He knows how vital it is not to return to those days. He claims that the \u201clanding zone\u201d is obvious. There are two areas where progress can be made. First, there is a lot that can be done on trusted traders schemes etc. Second, you can accept the unity of Ireland for sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. He says, if you can address these two points, you can go a long way towards a solution. He says he accepts \u201cthe locus for the negotiation remains Brussels\u201d. But he wants to discuss with the Irish how they can assist with that process. Other EU leaders ask him if he has made progress with the Irish. So it is incumbent on the UK to talk first to Ireland. (But Johnson has not talked first to Ireland. He visited Berlin and Paris first, last month.) Johnson says he wants a deal. They have spent three years \u201cmasticating\u201d over this problem. He says their predecessors solved far harder problems. Johnson says there are two tasks before November. They must restore the government in Northern Ireland. And they must get Brexit done, he says. The UK must come out by 31 October or \u201cpermanent damage\u201d may be done to trust in the political system. There are three questions to resolve, he says. 1) Can they ensure that unchecked movement of goods and people, and cattle, continues at the border? Johnson says he thinks the answer is yes. 2) Can they maintain the Belfast agreement? Johnson says he thinks the answer is yes. 3) Can we protect the economic unity of Ireland. Again, Johnson says he thinks the answer is yes. Johnson says the government must achieve these aims, while allowing the UK to leave the EU. He says he thinks, when you look at these problems, there are practical solutions. If there weren\u2019t, the backstop would not be described as a backstop. Johnson says he wants to get a deal. A no-deal Brexit would be \u201ca failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible\u201d. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says he first met Varadkar at a St Patrick\u2019s day parade in London when he was mayor. He says the \u201cvast crowd\u201d illustrated the close and intricate relationship between the British and the Irish. He says their predecessors took the two countries forward in circumstances that were much harder. He says the British eat 50% of cheese and beef produced in Ireland. And the England cricket captain was born in Dublin, he says. Varadkar quotes from something Gen Alan Brooke wrote about seeing Ireland when flying back after a visit to the US with Churchill during the second world war. Leo Varadkar is speaking now. He says there will be no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d. He says if there is no deal, the UK will have to renegotiate a new relationship with the EU anyway. And he says that, even if there is a deal, they will have to negotiate a trade deal. Varadkar says there can be no such thing as a \u201cclean-break Brexit\u201d. He says he thinks a Brexit deal is possible. And he says Ireland wants to be a friend to the UK in a future. On the backstop, he says Ireland cannot replace a legal deal with a promise. Varadkar he says is not willing to replace the backstop with a promise. He says he and Boris Johnson have spoken twice by phone. But the UK has still not proposed a legal, operative alternative to the backstop, he says. Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar have posed for a picture on the steps of Government Buildings. But they just gone in without speaking to the media. But they might come out again. Someone has been testing the microphones. And the two podiums have been moved, so they are now near the door, and under shelter. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Boris Johnson has repeatedly claimed that the talks with the EU intended to find an alternative to the backstop are advancing well. \u201cWe are making substantial progress,\u201d he told MPs at PMQs on Wednesday. But yesterday Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, said the opposite. As the FT reports in its splash (paywall), this is what he said when asked if he agreed that progress was being made in the talks. If that is what\u2019s being said, that\u2019s a very optimistic assessment of where we stand. We will hear from both leaders imminently. Immediately after the Today programme\u2019s interview with the former supreme court judge Lord Sumption (see 9.07am), for a counter view they put up the backbench Tory Brexiter Nigel Evans. He did not seem too bothered by Sumption\u2019s argument that the strategy outlined in the Daily Telegraph would be unlawful. He said he and his colleagues had been discussing in the House of Commons tearoom on Thursday what Boris Johnson might do to circumvent the law requiring him to ask for a no-deal Brexit, and Evans said: \u201cWe whittled them down to about 20.\u201d He did not list all 20, but he referred to two: the government tabling a vote of no confidence in itself, or the government passing a one-line bill setting the date for an early election. Evans also argued that, even though Johnson did not have the support of the Commons, he did have the backing of the public. Evans explained: You have to remember, 400 MPs representing leave seats voted remain. You really do have parliament against the people. It\u2019s not a great look. And I will be standing alongside the prime minister in trying to deliver what the people voted for. The two ideas Evans did propose are problematic. The government could in theory try to pass a vote of no confidence in itself, but that would open up a 14-day period during which MPs could agree to support an alternative PM and government. And it could try to pass primary legislation requiring an election on 15 October, but that would require a majority, which Johnson does not have, and it could be amended in ways unacceptable to Number 10. Another former lord chancellor, David Gauke, has also said that the plan to try to sabotage any letter sent to the EU requesting a Brexit delay with a second hostile letter would not work. Gauke, of course, is one of the 21 Tories who had the whip removed last week after voting against the government on this issue. I\u2019m sorry comments were not open earlier. They are open now. When Boris Johnson was deciding whether to back remain or leave in the EU referendum in 2016, he famously wrote two versions of his column for the Telegraph, one making the case for remain and one making the case for leave, before finally making his mind up \u2013 and publishing the leave one. In other circumstances, and for other individuals, that might be seen as a reasonable approach to taking a difficult decision. But because of Johnson\u2019s long record of inconsistency, the story has come to be seen as emblematic of his duplicity. As referred to earlier, according to today\u2019s Daily Telegraph splash (paywall), Johnson is considering a new version of the \u201ctwo contradictory letters strategy\u201d to try to confound the law passed by parliament requiring him to request an article 50 extension if he has failed to agree a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted to agree no deal (which they won\u2019t). Here is an extract from Owen Bennett and Harry Yorke\u2019s story. Boris Johnson has drawn up plans to \u201csabotage\u201d any Brexit extension without breaking the law, the Telegraph has learnt ... One plan under serious consideration would see the prime minister send an accompanying letter alongside the request to extend article 50 setting out that the government does not want any delay after Oct 31. On Sunday night, a cabinet source told The Telegraph: \u201cThere is a prescribed letter that has to be sent ... Does that stop the prime minister sending other documents to the EU? I don\u2019t think it does. \u201cA political explainer perhaps, as to where the government\u2019s policy is. It has to make clear that the government is asking for an extension, but let\u2019s not forget what the next step is. \u201cOnce that is done, the Europeans are going to ask: \u2018Why? What is the reason?\u2019 [What] if the government said: \u2018We don\u2019t have any reasons for an extension\u2019? \u201cThere is a clear path now: the Europeans need to refuse an extension.\u201d Lord Sumption, a former supreme court judge, told the Today programme earlier this would be illegal. (See 8.09am.) This is what he said when asked if it would be legal for the PM to seek an article 50 extension while trying to sabotage the strategy at the same time. No, of course it wouldn\u2019t. The bill, or act as it\u2019s about to become, says that he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. To send the letter and then try to neutralise it seems to me, plainly, a breach of the act. What you\u2019ve got to realise is the courts are not very fond of loopholes. Other lawyers have said the same thing. This is from Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor. And these are from Adam Wagner, the barrister and legal commentator. From the Irish Times\u2019 Pat Leahy Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Patrick Greenfield. Boris Johnson is in Dublin already for his talks with Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister). They are due to hold a mini press conference at about 9.15am. Journalists are already outside Government Buildings in Dublin, where Varadkar\u2019s office is based, waiting for the leaders to arrive. Julian Smith has indicated he will not resign from the government despite official papers released last week indicating the Northern Ireland secretary had clashed with No10 over suspending parliament. Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders working to stop a no-deal Brexit will meet again this morning to plan their next steps, according to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The government is expected to lose another attempt to force an October election later today. Meanwhile, our Brexit correspondent, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, is in Dublin waiting for the British prime minister to arrive. The former supreme court judge Lord Sumption has told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that simultaneously asking the EU for an extension while asking the bloc to reject the request would not be legal. This is how Boris Johnson\u2019s government is planning to sabotage any Brexit extension without breaking the law, according to the Telegraph. Johnson and Varadkar are taking questions just after 9am as the prime minister arrives in Dublin. We\u2019ll bring you the most important answers. Paschal Donohoe, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, has told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that his government would support a further Brexit extension but said it needed the backing of all EU27 member states. Ahead of today\u2019s meeting between Boris Johnson and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, Donohoe said the Irish were looking forward to further understanding the UK government\u2019s Brexit views and discussing the political standoff in Northern Ireland. Direct rule from London under a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cexceptionally serious\u201d, according to the Irish finance minister. Good morning readers. I\u2019m taking over the live blogging reins until Andrew Sparrow is ready to guide you through another big day of Brexit developments. Nobody from the government is doing any broadcast rounds this morning, it appears, but I will bring you the most important politics news lines as they happen. Tweet me at @pgreenfielduk if you have any questions. We\u2019ve already heard this morning about the potential impact of Brexit on the economy, according to KPMG. But for a real-time picture, we can see that the pound rose close to $1.23 earlier this morning before slipping back. It is now buying $1.227. It is worth \u20ac1.113. The pound has benefited from the government\u2019s recent calamities, which investors have seen as making no deal less likely, in turn pushing up sterling. The other big story of the day so far is that British Airways has been forced to cancel \u201cnearly 100% of our flights\u201d after pilots went on strike for 48 hours over pay. BA told passengers in a statement on its website: We understand the frustration and disruption Balpa\u2019s strike action has caused you. After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this. The pilots are on strike for 48 hours and have further action planned on 27 September. The airline said it was offering all affected customers full refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline. Flights on BA CityFlyer, SUN-AIR and Comair were not affected. BA operates more than 800 flights a day, with most expected to be cancelled, affecting up to 145,000 passengers each day. You can read our full story on the strike here. The Labour MP John Mann, who quit the party on Saturday to become the government\u2019s antisemitism tsar, has been speaking to the BBC about his new role and Brexit. Taking Brexit first, Mann told the Today programme that activists knocking on the doors of Labour voters in the north of England heartlands \u201cwould find voters who voted Brexit and who reject the direction that Jeremy Corbyn was taking the party\u201d. He added: The vast majority of Labour supporters in the heartlands voted Brexit. They are despairing about what they are seeing in parliament. They are scratching their heads, wondering what Labour is for. An opponent of Jeremy Corbyn, Mann denied he would use his new role as the government\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d antisemitism role as a way of attacking the Labour leader\u2019s record on the issue. \u201cThat would be dismissive of antisemitism \u2026 Labour has to get its act together and root out antisemitism,\u201d he said. We are likely to hear a great deal more about the government\u2019s manoeuvres in the next few days. But a reader\u2019s letter raises an interesting argument that some of the farcical episodes in the Johnson administration\u2019s short tenure \u2013 think the bungled police academy speech and even Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Commons slouch \u2013 are all part of the masterplan to distract voters from the serious defeats being inflicted on the government at Westminster. You can read it here: Norman Smith, the BBC\u2019s assistant political editor, has just been talking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme talking about some of the machinations we might expect at Westminster today. He said if MPs do reject the government\u2019s bid to force an election and then the no-deal bill is given royal assent, we can expect Downing Street to prorogue parliament. This is because the government has no other way of preventing rebel Tory MPs and opposition parties from seizing total control of the parliamentary timetable and holding debates on, for example, forcing the release of details of the no-deal Brexit planning document, Operation Yellowhammer. Smith said Johnson had \u201clost control of parliament, his majority, control of election timing, and a no-deal Brexit. He can\u2019t do much.\u201d He also adds that his sources maintain No 10 would \u201cnot break the law\u201d by ignoring the no-deal bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option,\u201d he said. The latest gloomy report about what will happen to the economy in the event of no deal comes from KPMG. The consultancy predicts Britain would lose 1.5% growth and fall into its first recession for a decade if we crash out. Consumer spending would be badly hit, it says. Yael Selfin, KPMG UK\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cWith the Brexit debate poised on a knife-edge, the UK economy is now at a crossroads.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: A retail footfall survey today adds to the downbeat economic mood. It says visits to the high street were down 1.9% in the three months to the end of August as people preferred out-of-town centres or online shopping. My colleague Miles Brignall has the full story here: Given the complexity of the political situation, it is not surprising that there is considerable divergence on way the papers have approached the Brexit turmoil today. The Times\u2019 splash headline says \u201cJohnson in retreat over delay to Brexit\u201d but the Telegraph reckons No 10 has a plan to thwart backbenchers\u2019 no-deal bill, saying: \u201cJohnson \u2018can legally stop Brexit extension\u2019\u201d. The Telegraph quotes a No 10 source as saying that, if the government is forced to request an extension to article 50 as the backbench no-deal bill will do, it could append a letter to the request saying that the UK does not have any reason to extend the deadline for Brexit from 31 October. The source tells the Telegraph (whose star columnist used to be the PM): Once that is done, the Europeans are going to ask: \u2018Why? What is the reason?\u2019 [What] if the Government said: \u2018We don\u2019t have any reasons for an extension\u2019? There is a clear path now: the Europeans need to refuse an extension.\u201d The Scotsman reports \u201cJohnson will \u2018test to the limit\u2019 no-deal legislation\u201d. The Guardian throws it forward to focus on Johnson\u2019s trip to Ireland: \u201cPM heads to Dublin amid fears of more resignations\u201d, on which subject the FT says: \u201cVaradkar plays down prospects of progress on Brexit deadlock\u201d. The Mail has its own Brexit scoop from an interview with the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, a remainer who nevertheless pledges to remain loyal to Johnson. But she demands of his approach to talks with the EU: \u201cWhat is your plan, Boris?\u201d. The Express proclaims \u201cBritain is still backing Boris\u201d. The Sun says the PM will fight the no-deal bill in court but leads with: \u201cLittle Mix Jesy: my suicide bid\u201d. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. This is Martin Farrer kicking off the blog before Andy Sparrow and my colleagues in London take over on what promises to be another momentous day at Westminster and beyond. After the resignation of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, dealt another blow to Boris Johnson\u2019s government, there is more fevered speculation about whether or not the prime minister will try to bypass the backbench bill blocking no deal if, as is likely, it becomes law today. It seems probable that there will be more twists and turns than an Ashes series, but here are some of the fixed points, along with possible developments: Boris Johnson heads to Dublin for talks with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on how to break the stalemate over a solution to the Irish backstop. Read our splash story on this subject here. Johnson will then fly back to London where he is expected to make another attempt to force a general election on 15 October by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The gambit is likely to fail, according to most calculations, because opposition parties still want to ensure that a no-deal Brexit is definitely off the table before they go to the country. This would enable them to portray Johnson as having broken his key promise of delivering Brexit \u201ccome what may\u201d on 31 October, writes Michael Savage, in this very handy explainer about what\u2019s been going on and what lies ahead. Meanwhile, the backbench bill to block no deal is expected to receive royal assent today. If that goes ahead, the key question will be whether Johnson is somehow able to circumvent the legislation and go ahead with Brexit. There are reports swirling around that No 10 believes it can go to court to get around the law, but an equal number saying the government won\u2019t be able to. The latter point to a tweet by justice secretary Robert Buckland that he has spoken to the PM \u201cregarding the importance of the rule of law\u201d. There is the possibility that the EU could prevent Britain from delaying its exit anyway, according to our Brussels correspondent Daniel Boffey. And there is also the chance of further cabinet resignations following Rudd\u2019s decision to stand down. We report that she has been contacted by three cabinet ministers and nine junior ministers worried about the government\u2019s Brexit policy since tendering her resignation. In all the chaos you might have missed the fact that Rudd was replaced as work and pensions secretary yesterday by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, MP for Suffolk Coastal, a loyalist who was promoted from her role as environment minister. And I liked this picture of Johnson and his latest nemesis at the Tory conference last year. She was a big fan of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s bid for the leadership:",

He then launched his second attempt to get parliament to back a general election in order to get a mandate to leave the EU by 31 October, accusing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of \u201cpreposterous cowardice\u201d for refusing to support one.

The loss of the vote means there cannot now be an election until mid-November at the earliest, given parliament\u2019s suspension. In a further setback for No 10, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced he would stand down on 31 October if there was no election before then. This means his immediate successor is likely to be chosen by the current parliament, in which there is no majority for a no-deal Brexit. It also confirms Bercow will still be in post during the crucial fortnight when parliament returns from prorogation in mid-October. Bercow, who received a stream of tributes from Labour and other opposition MPs, has been instrumental in empowering backbenchers to hold the executive to account over its Brexit policy and to pass the legislation preventing the UK\u2019s departure from the EU without a deal. Minutes after announcing he would step down after 10 years, Bercow said he was allowing Grieve, a former attorney general, and Corbyn to move humble addresses putting Johnson under pressure. The device was previously used by MPs to make Theresa May publish the government\u2019s legal advice on Brexit. Corbyn\u2019s address was designed to force Johnson to say he would abide by the rule of law, amid suggestions the prime minister could try to get around legislation mandating him to request a three-month delay to Brexit if there is no deal by 19 October. Johnson\u2019s official spokesman insisted on Monday that he would abide by the rule of law but, at the same time, the prime minister has said he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension to article 50. Johnson later told the Commons repeatedly: \u201cI will not ask for another delay.\u201d Following the defeats, several Tory MPs said they believed Johnson was trying to find a way to bring back some of the 21 Conservatives from whom he removed the whip for defying his Brexit policy last week. The aim of the Grieve motion was to prove that Johnson and his administration had misled MPs with their claim that the move to shut down parliament for five weeks was not to frustrate debate about Brexit. Grieve said he had asked for the information relating to prorogation because public officials had informed him that \u201cthey believed the handling of this matter smacked of scandal\u201d. However, senior government aides suggested No 10 would refuse to comply, potentially putting Johnson and senior members of his administration in contempt of parliament and creating a fresh clash between the executive and MPs. Cummings has already been found in contempt of parliament once before after failing to appear before a select committee investigating fake news. One government source said the vote was \u201can abuse of parliamentary procedure and would never have been allowed under an impartial speaker\u201d. \u201cIf MPs want to seize the private texts of advisers to their friends, families, colleagues and journalists then they can speak to people\u2019s lawyers,\u201d they said. A Downing Street spokesman said the scope of information requested was \u201cdisproportionate and unprecedented\u201d. However, Bercow said the \u201cgovernment must comply with the humble address ... that is the reality\u201d, even in a period of prorogation. The government suspended sitting in the House of Commons and House of Lords until 14 October \u2013 a move condemned by opposition parties and anti-no-deal Tories. Criticising the prorogation, Corbyn, said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and accused Johnson of wanting to run away from questions.",
