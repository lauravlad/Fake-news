This would leave MPs with only a few days to put a stop to a no-deal Brexit or Brexit altogether. Markets jittered in anticipation of a no deal exit that is now more likely than ever before. </li> \n   <li><strong>MPs and campaigners across the political spectrum have reacted with outrage to the PM\u2019s prorogation plans.</strong> Protests were held in towns across the UK, and a cross-party group of MPs has vowed to try everything in their power to avert prorogation. The former chancellor Philip Hammond said MPs opposed to a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> will \u201chave to do something\u201d when parliament returns next week.</li> \n   <li>Johnson\u2019s government has argued that the current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years. <strong>Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg described the planned prorogation as \u201ca completely normal procedure\u201d.</strong> Several legal challenges have been launched against the plan, one of them spearheaded by the campaigner Gina Miller. </li> \n   <li><strong>A petition calling to stop the prorogation of parliament has reached more than 1 million signatures.</strong> </li> \n   <li>In what is regarded a blow to Boris Johnson,<strong> Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has announced her imminent resignation from her role as party leader, </strong>a move that could cost the PM a majority at the next general election. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me, goodnight. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d66f69d8f08ea59f447ae74\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T21:50:19.324Z\">10.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Diane Abbott</strong> said in an interview with the BBC: \u201cBoris does not represent the people, he\u2019s never represented the people.

It is the first shot in what will be an intense battle in the coming days to torpedo his plan. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a brazen attempt, of truly historical magnitude, to prevent the executive being held accountable for its conduct before Parliament,\u201d said Miller.</p> \n  <p>She had received legal correspondence from the government legal officers in the last two weeks stating that the issue of prorogation is of no more than \u201cacademic\u201d interest and she says this now proves that Johnson has misled the nation.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is, sadly, all too clear from today\u2019s announcements, that prorogation is a desperate reality, not a mere theoretical nicety. In view of this, I urge our courts to urgently hear my application for Judicial Review before 9 September 2019 \u2013 the earliest date that Prorogation of Parliament could come into effect.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe have all been comprehensively misled by the Prime Minister and his lawyers. A reply from the Government Legal Department received late on 27 August stated: \u2018The proposed intention to bring legal proceedings in respect of events which have not occurred and may never do so is noted. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not accept that the approach taken in your letter is an appropriate one.\u2019,\u201d she said in a statement issued tonight.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTo put this in an official legal letter and send it out at the same time as you are drafting a press release confirming Parliament\u2019s suspension the following morning illustrates just how manipulative and anti-democratic this Prime Minister and his Government really are. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe basis of my approach to the courts is that it cannot be legitimate or a proper use of the prerogative power to prorogue Parliament when the intention and effect inherent in doing so is to frustrate Parliament and fetter it from exercising its sovereign right to fulfil its elective role and enact any law it sees fit.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T20:04:19.030Z\">at 9.04pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d66d6448f08ea59f447ad6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T19:36:46.080Z\">8.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>MPs continue to rebuke the PM\u2019s prorogation plans on Twitter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RachaelMaskell/status/1166790044729925632\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Proroguing Parliament to avoid scrutiny of the PM\u2019s disastrous no deal plan is a slip towards autocracy and a dangerous precedent to set.

This is the battleground Johnson seeks \u2013 himself as roguish, freewheeling representative of the people\u2019s will, defender of the referendum versus the Westminster establishment and the elite, as represented by MPs elected to parliament. Explosive, dangerous, unresolvable, David Cameron\u2019s reckless, Tory-pleasing referendum cut right through the constitution, and now it lies badly damaged.</p> \n   <p>This assault on parliament is galvanising those soft Tory opponents who were prevaricating, the ones who preferred to wait until late October to give Johnson a chance to strike a new EU deal. Now, say Dominic Grieve and others, they all realise the one week before prorogation must be used to legislate against a no-deal Brexit. There is just time, there are manoeuvres, from seizing the timetable to a humble address and other ingenious devices murmured sotto voce lest the government hear their plans. It can be done, must be done, double quick, it\u2019s too late to wait until they return in October.</p> \n   <p>The war for public hearts and minds has hardly begun. Which side will people lean, towards a sense their constitution and their parliament has been outraged by a revolutionary rightwinger? Or will they go with Johnson as the true representative of the people, leading angry Brexiters to their hearts\u2019 desire? He has the advantage of the great claque of the 80% Tory press urging him on. This is only step one of Johnson\u2019s \u201cby any means necessary\u201d threat.

Given Labour\u2019s weakness in Scotland, he would be confident the SNP would win comfortably by harnessing a very strong anti-Brexit vote in the city.</p> \n  <p>And Holyrood is already braced for the result of tomorrow\u2019s Scottish parliamentary byelection in Shetland, where the SNP hope to win a remarkable victory, by defeating the Liberal Democrats in one of its electoral strongholds.</p> \n  <p> The Lib Dems have held Shetland since the foundation of the Scottish parliament in 1999 and the contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland since 1950 (then as the Liberals). Senior Lib Dems are adamant they will hold on, but many Shetlanders scent an upset.</p> \n  <p>That could change the parliamentary arithmetic at Holyrood significantly: Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, is two seats short of a majority. </p> \n  <p>If the SNP wins either seat, they would then have the same votes as all the opposition parties together.

Having so often been told that our exit from the European Union was about \u2018taking back control\u2019, it appears our new Prime Minister wants that power to reside with him alone. </p> \n   <p>Lacking the legitimacy of the ballot box, or any public endorsement, Mr Johnson now seeks to thwart the will of the House of Commons by just shutting it down to try to stop elected MPs from doing the job they were elected to. A constitutional outrage, verging on a coup and one that must be challenged. </p> \n   <p>The action of an autocrat not a democrat, the Prime Minister\u2019s decision is part of a pattern of arrogance that is Trumpesque at heart \u2013 far removed from the Churchillian statesmanship that he would like people to believe he possesses. And such an act of political chicanery also risks compromising the political independence of our monarch. </p> \n   <p>Around the world, Westminster has been admired as the \u2018Mother of Parliaments\u2019 but this move from Mr Johnson will embarrass us internationally. </p> \n   <p>Brexit and the way it has been handled has divided our country and our politics. At the time when we most need calm, moderate, thoughtful leadership \u2013 in the national interest \u2013 we are now lumbered with a man without either the skills or integrity to hold this any other high office.</p> \n   <p>Opposition to such an authoritarian approach is unifying people from across the political divide \u2013 the Prime Minister\u2019s only support appears to be from the government\u2019s confidence and supply allies, the DUP. That said, anger and outrage will not be enough. Parliamentarians from across all parties and none \u2013 and in both Houses \u2013 must assert the authority of those elected to the Commons.</p> \n   <p>I have taken part in two prorogation ceremonies in my four years as leader of the opposition in the Lords. Like many traditions, its roots go way back. Whilst the pomp, ceremony and outfits appear somewhat anachronistic, they are part of a proud historical tradition.</p> \n   <p>The next prorogation should therefore be uncontroversial \u2013 just part of how our Parliament functions. If however, Mr Johnson\u2019s reckless disregard for Parliament goes ahead in the way he clearly wishes it to, it will be anything but.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T18:14:13.217Z\">at 7.14pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d66bbf68f082209d32234d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T17:41:05.629Z\">6.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Guardian readers have been getting in touch to tell us about why they\u2019re planning on protesting against Boris Johnson suspending parliament. </p> \n  <p>Many have expressed their concern over what they consider an undemocratic move by Johnson. Aforji Churjor, who works in FX sales in London, has said that he\u2019s going to parliament to protest. <br>\u201cI genuinely couldn\u2019t believe he would actually do it. When it was discussed before I thought that he was saying what he wanted to get Tory members to vote for him. To the claim that he wants to kill parliamentary democracy for democratic reasons is beyond laughable. Nobody made him dictator, it\u2019s a blatant ploy to get a general election triggered ... He will go down as the worst PM of all time and after the last two that\u2019s saying something! We need to Stop Boris and save our democracy!\u201d</p> \n  <p>Catherine Ogden, a retired primary school teacher who is on her way to a protest in Manchester said that she was taking part on behalf of her daughter, who is living in Spain. <br>\u201cThis is an orchestrated attempt to shut out our elected members of parliament from debating an issue that will affect us for generations to come. This is not about leave or remain anymore, this is about a three-year long offence against the democratic rights of British citizens, at home and abroad. Whichever side of the debate you stand, this has not been a clean fight and the consequences will be grave.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Other readers who have contacted the Guardian have said that they feel angry and fearful about what could happen next. Barbara, who lives in the south-west of England, said that she is \u201creally upset, angry and scared to death by this outrageous government and it\u2019s dictatorial approach to Brexit. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSuspending parliament is the most undemocratic and sinister move imaginable and is dictatorial in the extreme. MPs must be allowed to debate a decision like Brexit, which has split the country and continues to do so.

It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion.</p> \n  <p>It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.</p> \n  <h2>Can MPs vote against prorogation?</h2> \n  <p>No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T16:03:59.883Z\">at 5.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d669f4b8f08ea59f447ab21\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:41:11.537Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rees-Mogg: 'This is a completely normal procedure'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg has been doorstepped at Aberdeen airport where journalists followed him through the terminal after his privy council meeting with the Queen.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnything the Queen says is private, as you know,\u201d said Rees-Mogg, who was one of three members of the council who went to Balmoral to ask permission on behalf of the prime minister for the prorogation of parliament.</p> \n  <p>Asked if he was confident that the move would not be up for challenge in the courts, he replied: \u201cThe courts will come to their decision but this is a completely normal procedure.\u201d<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FraserNicoll/status/1166705890197684224\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jacob Rees-Mogg arriving at Aberdeen airport having met with the Queen at Balmoral. <a href=\"https://t.co/aMtAPZ31Yj\">pic.twitter.com/aMtAPZ31Yj</a></p>\u2014 Fraser Nicoll (@FraserNicoll) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FraserNicoll/status/1166705890197684224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:48:28.985Z\">at 4.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d6699cc8f082209d322333f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-28T15:19:10.246Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vince Cable to stand down as MP at next election</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some non-prorogation news now. Our political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that there is speculation that the Liberal Democrats are preparing to welcome another defector, after their former leader Vince Cable announced he would stand down as an MP at the next election. </p> \n  <p>The candidate for Cable\u2019s Twickenham seat, which he won back from the Conservatives in the 2017 general election, will be chosen from an all-female shortlist. Those wanting to stand have until midday on Friday to say so. A spokesman for the party said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vince has enjoyed a fantastic parliamentary career in the Liberal Democrats and representing the people of Twickenham. He will continue to serve as the MP until the next election, whenever that may be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The vacancy opens up the possibility that the rumoured defection of another former Change UK MP will soon follow, with new members to be announced at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Bournemouth. </p> \n  <p>Senior party figures have said they are holding out for Heidi Allen, Luciana Berger or Angela Smith to make the switch and follow their former colleague Sarah Wollaston.

Tavish Scott, previously a Scottish Lib Dems leader, won in 2016 with 67% of the vote, a majority of 4,865 over the SNP.</p> \n  <p>The contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland has been a Lib Dem constituency since 1950 and is the party\u2019s safest in the UK, but Sturgeon and the SNP have shovelled huge resources into the contest to succeed Scott, who stood down in June to work instead for Scottish Rugby.</p> \n  <p> An SNP win tomorrow would be cited as clear proof that Scottish voters now favour independence from the rest of the UK after Brexit. Shetland historically has been sceptical about the case for leaving the UK.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon has visited Shetland to campaign three times in recent weeks, alongside numerous Holyrood ministers and SNP MPs and MSPs, inviting criticism from her opponents after one visit meant she failed to appear at a government press event disclosing a multibillion-pound public spending deficit in Scotland last year.</p> \n  <p> The Scottish Tories pointed out Sturgeon had visited Shetland as many times in the last month as she had during her previous five years as first minister. Brydon Goodland, the Tory candidate for Shetland, said: \u201cThe SNP only care about Shetland when there are votes to be won.\u201d</p> \n  <p> The final message to voters from Tom Wills, the SNP\u2019s young candidate, was Brexit-focused. He claimed the SNP was \u201cby some distance the strongest pro-European party in the UK\u201d with 100 parliamentarians at Scottish, UK and European level focused on stopping the UK leaving the EU.</p> \n  <p> The Lib Dems reject the implication they are softer on Brexit. After all, their European election campaign slogan was \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d.

The announcement has added fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/08/27/next-weeks-spending-round-will-clear-decks-let-us-focus-brexit/\">the Daily Telegraph</a>, Javid pledged increased spending on priority areas of schools, police and health, but said there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments. <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thanks to the hard work of the British people over the last decade, we can afford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities, without breaking the rules around what the government should spend, and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police. </p> \n   <p>But at the same time, it\u2019s vital that we continue to live within our means as a country. Unlike the Labour party, we don\u2019t believe in just throwing money at a problem. And especially at a time when the global economy is slowing, it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let our public finances get out of control.</p> \n   <p>So I can confirm that next week\u2019s spending round will be delivered within the current fiscal rules. As every household knows, that will mean making choices and prioritising where we focus spending, and any departments expecting a blank cheque will be sorely disappointed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/27/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-prioritise-legislation-stop-no-deal-meeting-opposition-parties-labour\">yesterday backed cross-party plans</a> to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs\u2019 attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit.

A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen\u2019s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October. Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council.

      "bodyText": "I will be wrapping up now, as another historic day in British politics is coming to an end. At a glance, this is what happened: During a meeting of the privy council with the Queen, the monarch has consented to the prorogation of parliament, as requested by prime minister Boris Johnson in what is widely considered a bid to push through a no deal Brexit. Parliament will thus be dissolved, unless MPs or campaigners will manage to trash this plan over the coming days, between September 9th and September 12th, until October 14th. This would leave MPs with only a few days to put a stop to a no-deal Brexit or Brexit altogether. Markets jittered in anticipation of a no deal exit that is now more likely than ever before. MPs and campaigners across the political spectrum have reacted with outrage to the PM\u2019s prorogation plans. Protests were held in towns across the UK, and a cross-party group of MPs has vowed to try everything in their power to avert prorogation. The former chancellor Philip Hammond said MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit will \u201chave to do something\u201d when parliament returns next week. Johnson\u2019s government has argued that the current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years. Brexit hardliner Jacob Rees-Mogg described the planned prorogation as \u201ca completely normal procedure\u201d. Several legal challenges have been launched against the plan, one of them spearheaded by the campaigner Gina Miller. A petition calling to stop the prorogation of parliament has reached more than 1 million signatures. In what is regarded a blow to Boris Johnson, Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has announced her imminent resignation from her role as party leader, a move that could cost the PM a majority at the next general election. That\u2019s all from me, goodnight. Diane Abbott said in an interview with the BBC: \u201cBoris does not represent the people, he\u2019s never represented the people. This is Boris versus the people. And the people are going to fight.\u201d This from Welsh Labour MP Anna McMorrin: Ruth Davidson will step down as party leader without much further ado, reports ITV\u2019s Scotland correspondent Peter A Smith: This from independent MP Angela Smith, formerly Labour: The \u201cDo not prorogue Parliament\u201d petition is still flying, and has now reached more than 900,000 signatures. Here my colleague Matthew Weaver\u2019s story: Also, in case you hadn\u2019t seen this tweet by Hugh Grant, which has been very popular, while the name Hugh is trending, here it is: People on Twitter have begun debating the legitimacy of the Queen\u2019s role, as well as questioning the future of Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchy. The hashtag #AbolishTheMonarchy is currently trending. This from Apolitical\u2019s Josh Lowe: And this from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall: Conservative MP Sam Gyimah also found strong words earlier today: A consensus regarding Boris Johnson\u2019s main motive for dissolving parliament is emerging from the quarter of prorogation opponents. This from Labour MP Richard Burgon: My colleague Tom Kibasi wrote about this earlier: But even if Johnson gets his \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d general election, it\u2019s likely to come with a number of caveats, as Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall points out: This is Ed Miliband\u2019s verdict on today\u2019s developments: Quite a few people seem to be ruminating on the future of chancellor Sajid Javid tonight. This from the journalist Ian Fraser: And this from Stefan Rousseau, chief political photographer at the Press Association - (the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg retweeted): People across the UK took to the streets tonight to demonstrate against the Queen\u2019s approval of the prime minister\u2019s plans to prorogue parliament. Lawyers for campaigner Gina Miller have made an urgent application to the high court for a judicial review of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament. It is the first shot in what will be an intense battle in the coming days to torpedo his plan. \u201cThis is a brazen attempt, of truly historical magnitude, to prevent the executive being held accountable for its conduct before Parliament,\u201d said Miller. She had received legal correspondence from the government legal officers in the last two weeks stating that the issue of prorogation is of no more than \u201cacademic\u201d interest and she says this now proves that Johnson has misled the nation. \u201cIt is, sadly, all too clear from today\u2019s announcements, that prorogation is a desperate reality, not a mere theoretical nicety. In view of this, I urge our courts to urgently hear my application for Judicial Review before 9 September 2019 \u2013 the earliest date that Prorogation of Parliament could come into effect. \u201cWe have all been comprehensively misled by the Prime Minister and his lawyers. A reply from the Government Legal Department received late on 27 August stated: \u2018The proposed intention to bring legal proceedings in respect of events which have not occurred and may never do so is noted. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not accept that the approach taken in your letter is an appropriate one.\u2019,\u201d she said in a statement issued tonight. \u201cTo put this in an official legal letter and send it out at the same time as you are drafting a press release confirming Parliament\u2019s suspension the following morning illustrates just how manipulative and anti-democratic this Prime Minister and his Government really are. \u201cThe basis of my approach to the courts is that it cannot be legitimate or a proper use of the prerogative power to prorogue Parliament when the intention and effect inherent in doing so is to frustrate Parliament and fetter it from exercising its sovereign right to fulfil its elective role and enact any law it sees fit.\u201d MPs continue to rebuke the PM\u2019s prorogation plans on Twitter. My colleague Polly Toynbee has written a column about the possible consequences of today\u2019s events, and predicts an impending civil war. She writes: This aggressive provocation of parliament widens the great Brexit divide into a civil war state of mind. This is the battleground Johnson seeks \u2013 himself as roguish, freewheeling representative of the people\u2019s will, defender of the referendum versus the Westminster establishment and the elite, as represented by MPs elected to parliament. Explosive, dangerous, unresolvable, David Cameron\u2019s reckless, Tory-pleasing referendum cut right through the constitution, and now it lies badly damaged. This assault on parliament is galvanising those soft Tory opponents who were prevaricating, the ones who preferred to wait until late October to give Johnson a chance to strike a new EU deal. Now, say Dominic Grieve and others, they all realise the one week before prorogation must be used to legislate against a no-deal Brexit. There is just time, there are manoeuvres, from seizing the timetable to a humble address and other ingenious devices murmured sotto voce lest the government hear their plans. It can be done, must be done, double quick, it\u2019s too late to wait until they return in October. The war for public hearts and minds has hardly begun. Which side will people lean, towards a sense their constitution and their parliament has been outraged by a revolutionary rightwinger? Or will they go with Johnson as the true representative of the people, leading angry Brexiters to their hearts\u2019 desire? He has the advantage of the great claque of the 80% Tory press urging him on. This is only step one of Johnson\u2019s \u201cby any means necessary\u201d threat. Expect more such \u201cmeans\u201d yet to come. Link to full piece below. The Welsh Labour MP Stephen Doughty called Boris Johnson a \u201ccoward\u201d in an interview on ITV. I think what we\u2019ve seen here is a sly, underhand move by the prime minister, a fundamentally undemocratic and unconstitutional move, which goes against the interest of the people of Wales and the ability of all of us representing our constituents who elected us to have their voices heard in parliament. Boris Johnson has a very hazy relationship with the truth and we are unable to hold him and his ministers to account at the moment, let alone his unelected, shadowy advisors sitting there, trying to drag this country off a cliff. Why is he so afraid of parliament sitting? Things seem to be getting more heated outside parliament, according to the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne: This from the Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, who believes the dissolution of parliament will lead to a catalogue of \u201cmodern compassionate Conservative reform\u201d. Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, has tweeted the following statement: And this from my colleague Heather Stewart: This from Channel 4\u2019s Hayley Barlow on how the leaders of Britain\u2019s two biggest parties have communicated with the public today. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley: My colleagues Aamna Mohdin and Marvel Kalukembi are reporting from parliament square in London on the protests: The crowds at Commons Greens, opposite parliament, have shut down a major road, chanting \u201cstop the coup.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, Boris Johnson is the main subject of ire on many people\u2019s placards, with some stating: \u201cBollocks to Boris\u201d. Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green was one of many oppositional politicians at the protest. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to stand against Boris Johnson\u2019s coup. We have a representative democracy and by suspending parliament, you are removing people\u2019s democratic right.\u201d Womack said she\u2019s both surprised and not by Johnson\u2019s move to suspend parliament.\u201dI feel like we\u2019ve been expecting this for a while but I didn\u2019t think he would make such a brutal move that showed such a disregard for our parliamentary procedures.\u201d She added: \u201cI think what he has done is unite parts of the country who don\u2019t support a no deal and his form of process that is denying democracy. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue the work we\u2019ve been doing to secure a people\u2019s vote so the people have a final say and ensure within parliament we are working cross party to prevent a no deal.\u201d Jane Keane, 54 years old, said she\u2019s been protesting every day since Michael Gove said there would be preparations for a no deal. \u201cIt is a complete contradiction to what parliament has said three times. They\u2019ve said no deal is unacceptable. My understanding is parliament is sovereign not Boris Johnson.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t have a history of activism and has largely remained neutral in politics because of the work she\u2019s done with local government. But she said as someone who has recently survived, she knows how important it is to have easy access medical supplies. It remains unclear whether Ruth Davidson is also planning to quit as an MSP if, as is widely expected, she announces her resignation as Scottish Tory leader on Thursday. Sebastian Payne at the Financial Times has tweeted she plans to stay on as a backbencher but Chris Musson, the Scottish Sun political editor, who broke the story of Davidson\u2019s resignation as leader, is not so sure. If she does resign from Holyrood as well, that throws up the real prospect of the Scottish National party winning her seat of Edinburgh Central, a constituency Davidson won unexpectedly in 2016 but with a slender majority of 610 votes. It is being eyed up by Angus Robertson, the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader and election strategist, who lost his Commons seat of Moray to the Tories in the 2017 snap election. Given Labour\u2019s weakness in Scotland, he would be confident the SNP would win comfortably by harnessing a very strong anti-Brexit vote in the city. And Holyrood is already braced for the result of tomorrow\u2019s Scottish parliamentary byelection in Shetland, where the SNP hope to win a remarkable victory, by defeating the Liberal Democrats in one of its electoral strongholds. The Lib Dems have held Shetland since the foundation of the Scottish parliament in 1999 and the contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland since 1950 (then as the Liberals). Senior Lib Dems are adamant they will hold on, but many Shetlanders scent an upset. That could change the parliamentary arithmetic at Holyrood significantly: Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, is two seats short of a majority. If the SNP wins either seat, they would then have the same votes as all the opposition parties together. If they win both, they regain the overall majority they lost in 2016 and also a much more powerful political case for staging a second referendum. Given those numbers, would Davidson risk the union she has fought so hard to protect by quitting Holyrood? Angela Smith, the leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, has launched a searing attack on Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Writing in the House magazine, the former Labour MP lambasted the PM\u2019s prorogation plans as \u201cTrumpesque at heart\u201d. Despite ongoing speculation that Boris Johnson would try to shut down Parliament before Brexit Day, the formal announcement from No.10 was still deeply shocking and disturbing. Having so often been told that our exit from the European Union was about \u2018taking back control\u2019, it appears our new Prime Minister wants that power to reside with him alone. Lacking the legitimacy of the ballot box, or any public endorsement, Mr Johnson now seeks to thwart the will of the House of Commons by just shutting it down to try to stop elected MPs from doing the job they were elected to. A constitutional outrage, verging on a coup and one that must be challenged. The action of an autocrat not a democrat, the Prime Minister\u2019s decision is part of a pattern of arrogance that is Trumpesque at heart \u2013 far removed from the Churchillian statesmanship that he would like people to believe he possesses. And such an act of political chicanery also risks compromising the political independence of our monarch. Around the world, Westminster has been admired as the \u2018Mother of Parliaments\u2019 but this move from Mr Johnson will embarrass us internationally. Brexit and the way it has been handled has divided our country and our politics. At the time when we most need calm, moderate, thoughtful leadership \u2013 in the national interest \u2013 we are now lumbered with a man without either the skills or integrity to hold this any other high office. Opposition to such an authoritarian approach is unifying people from across the political divide \u2013 the Prime Minister\u2019s only support appears to be from the government\u2019s confidence and supply allies, the DUP. That said, anger and outrage will not be enough. Parliamentarians from across all parties and none \u2013 and in both Houses \u2013 must assert the authority of those elected to the Commons. I have taken part in two prorogation ceremonies in my four years as leader of the opposition in the Lords. Like many traditions, its roots go way back. Whilst the pomp, ceremony and outfits appear somewhat anachronistic, they are part of a proud historical tradition. The next prorogation should therefore be uncontroversial \u2013 just part of how our Parliament functions. If however, Mr Johnson\u2019s reckless disregard for Parliament goes ahead in the way he clearly wishes it to, it will be anything but. Guardian readers have been getting in touch to tell us about why they\u2019re planning on protesting against Boris Johnson suspending parliament. Many have expressed their concern over what they consider an undemocratic move by Johnson. Aforji Churjor, who works in FX sales in London, has said that he\u2019s going to parliament to protest. \u201cI genuinely couldn\u2019t believe he would actually do it. When it was discussed before I thought that he was saying what he wanted to get Tory members to vote for him. To the claim that he wants to kill parliamentary democracy for democratic reasons is beyond laughable. Nobody made him dictator, it\u2019s a blatant ploy to get a general election triggered ... He will go down as the worst PM of all time and after the last two that\u2019s saying something! We need to Stop Boris and save our democracy!\u201d Catherine Ogden, a retired primary school teacher who is on her way to a protest in Manchester said that she was taking part on behalf of her daughter, who is living in Spain. \u201cThis is an orchestrated attempt to shut out our elected members of parliament from debating an issue that will affect us for generations to come. This is not about leave or remain anymore, this is about a three-year long offence against the democratic rights of British citizens, at home and abroad. Whichever side of the debate you stand, this has not been a clean fight and the consequences will be grave.\u201d Other readers who have contacted the Guardian have said that they feel angry and fearful about what could happen next. Barbara, who lives in the south-west of England, said that she is \u201creally upset, angry and scared to death by this outrageous government and it\u2019s dictatorial approach to Brexit. \u201cSuspending parliament is the most undemocratic and sinister move imaginable and is dictatorial in the extreme. MPs must be allowed to debate a decision like Brexit, which has split the country and continues to do so. Maybe MPs will now all get their act together and stop this.\u201d Evening everyone. This just in from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: The Guardian\u2019s Libby Brooks has been placing the Ruth Davidson exit as Scottish Tory leader into context. Davidson was reportedly livid at Boris Johnson\u2019s sacking of David Mundell as Scottish secretary and went on to issue a defiant challenge to Johnson on the eve of his first visit to Scotland as prime minister, pledging she would refuse to back a no-deal Brexit. In her regular column for the Scottish Mail on Sunday she promised she would \u201cnot be backward in challenging Mr Johnson\u2019s government where I think they are getting it wrong\u201d. The first openly lesbian party leader anywhere in the UK, Davidson gave birth last October to her first child, conceived with her partner, Jen, following IVF treatment. A state-educated woman with a working-class background in a party overwhelmingly controlled by privately schooled men, Davidson delivered previously unthinkable electoral success for the Scottish Tories at both Holyrood and Westminster. Last September Davidson published her first book, Yes She Can, a collection of interviews with \u201cmould-breaking women\u201d, in which she revealed she had been diagnosed with clinical depression as a teenager, and she discussed the ongoing management of her mental health. Davidson attracted criticism from opposition politicians including Nicola Sturgeon today for not giving media interviews after the prorogation announcement. Davidson\u2019s allies would not be drawn to speak publicly before her statement tomorrow and privately only expressed admiration for her leadership and sadness at her decision. The Scottish Labour Leader, Richard Leonard, has given his reaction to news of Ruth Davidson\u2019s departure as leader of the Scottish Tories. \u201cIf the rumours are true then the loss of Ruth Davidson as leader of the Scottish Conservatives will be a real blow to her party,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows that even within his own ranks, Boris Johnson is already losing support and credibility. Scotland and the UK needs a general election as quickly as possible to oust him from Downing Street and elect a Labour government.\u201d Things are moving in Wales, where the assembly is being recalled from its Summer recess, reports Ian Craig of the South Wales Argus. European politicians have been casting an eye over events in Britain today, with a former French Europe minister talking about an \u201cillness\u201d at the heart of British democracy. The former minister, Nathalie Loiseau, now an MEP, said: \u201cWe are going to see a Brexit without agreement and what\u2019s more a Brexit without debate. What illness is British democracy suffering from to be fearful of debate before making one of the most important decisions in its history?\u201d A former Finnish prime minister, Alexander Stubb, said: \u201cIt makes me really sad to see what Brexit is doing to one of the great democracies of our time. Please, stay calm and use common sense.\u201d The Labour MP Jess Phillips has responded to Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to MPs about plans to prorogue parliament, telling him: \u201cThis is not the actions [sic] of a credible prime minister.\u201d She wrote: \u201cYou\u2019re gambling that the trappings of office will give you an advantage in this game of chance. It is a mighty gamble. And for the people I represent, it is not a game.\u201d She condemned the prime minister for treating her constituents\u2019 jobs, businesses and safety as \u201ccasino chips\u201d, and said \u201cevery right-minded member in parliament\u201d would fight his plan \u201cevery step of the way\u201d. \u201cThe sight of politicians from across the political divide working together this week to stop a no-deal Brexit has sent you into a panic,\u201d her letter to Johnson continues. \u201cThis is not the actions of a credible prime minister, you will lose and take the people down with you.\u201d Responding to reports that Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson is set to quit after differences with Boris Johnson, the Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray said her departure would be deeply felt by her party. \u201cShe campaigned tirelessly for a remain vote in the EU referendum, but the Tories under Boris Johnson have become a hard Brexit party, so it is not surprising that it has come to this,\u201d he said. Protesters have been gathering in Manchester\u2019s Albert Square, many armed with umbrellas \u2013 some in solidarity with Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protest and some simply to protect against the rain. They are chanting \u201cstop the coup\u201d, and holding signs reading \u201cHands off\u201d and \u201cProtect our democracy\u201d. One of the organisers, Emma, a 26-year-old immigration consultant, said: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m angry and shocked that our democracy could be ripped out from underneath us while we\u2018re asleep at the wheel.\u201d She said she and her friend Noora had previously said they should be doing something, and today they said \u201cwe don\u2019t care if anyone else shows up, we\u2019re heading down to Manchester town centre. We tweeted about it and everyone got onboard.\u201d Noora, 27, a standup comedian, said they were inspired by the umbrella movement of Hong Kong. \u201cWe\u2019re here to protest against the downgrading of democracy that is happening in the UK at the moment \u2026 I feel like we should make some kind of a stand. It might seem minor but you\u2019re showing that it can\u2019t continue like this.\u201d They were joined by Rory and Margaret, retired lecturers in their 70s. Rory said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most flagrant attack on democracy that I can remember. It\u2019s bad enough that [Boris Johnson] was elected leader by a handful of people, but what was this \u2018taking back control\u2019 all about? And sovereignty of parliament? Parliament has just been overruled. I think it\u2019s an absolute outrage.\u201d Tallulah, 17, said she thought what was going on was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d. \u201cThe facade of a democracy is being ripped apart.\u201d William, 18, agreed with her. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I thought it was a joke the first time I saw it the article about the Queen. But unfortunately it\u2019s not satire. And here we are.\u201d Ruth Davidson is expected to quit as leader of the Scottish Conservative party because of her irreconcilable differences with Boris Johnson over Brexit and the pressures of motherhood. Scottish Tory sources said an announcement was imminent. Davidson was \u201cconsidering her position\u201d, one source said, although he stressed it was not connected to Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. Davidson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cRuth will make her decision clear in due course and there will be no further comment this evening.\u201d Davidson made abundantly clear during the Tory leadership campaign that she did not believe Johnson was the right man for the job. One of Johnson\u2019s first acts as prime minister was to sack her close friend and ally David Mundell, who served as Scottish secretary for five years. Severin Carrell, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, has confirmed reports that Ruth Davidson is on the verge of quitting, in part over her differences with Boris Johnson. He tweets: The former chancellor Philip Hammond has said MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit will \u201chave to do something\u201d when parliament returns next week. Some colleagues \u201cto be perfectly frank\u201d had been planning to wait but the circumstances had now changed and they would have to move in the coming days, he told broadcasters. Asked if it would involve trying to bring the government down, he replied: \u201cI have always made clear that I am not interested in bringing down the government. I simply want the government to recognise that the majority is opposed to a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Ruth Davidson is to quit as leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, according to a report in the Scottish Sun. Quoting \u201cinsiders\u201d, it says she is stepping down \u201cdue to the pressures of motherhood\u201d. Davidson became the first UK party leader to have a baby while in office when she gave birth to a boy at Edinburgh Royal infirmary last October. We\u2019d like to hear from people who are taking to the streets to protest against the prorogation of parliament. Tell us where you are and why you are taking part. Protests continue to be organised in towns and cities around the country. Here are the details of some: London Parliament Square, from 5pm Birmingham Victoria Square, 5.30pm Liverpool St George\u2019s Plateau, 5.30pm Milton Keynes Station, 6pm Chester Town Hall, 7pm Manchester Albert Square, from 4pm Edinburgh The Mound, from 4pm (moving to Holyrood at 4.30pm) Cambridge Market Square, from 6pm Cardiff Aneurin Bevan Statue, from 6pm Durham Marketplace, from 6pm Bristol College Green, 5.30pm Brighton Bartholomew Square. 5.30pm Jeremy Corbyn has responded to Donald Trump on Twitter. Lawyers seeking to reverse Boris Johnson\u2019s move to prorogue parliament hope a Scottish court will also hold a far faster hearing on whether the measure is unconstitutional and illegal. A legal team acting for Joanna Cherry and 74 other MPs and peers expect to be in court in Edinburgh this Friday morning to urge Scotland\u2019s civil court, the court of session, to block the proroguing agreed today by the Queen. They had already won approval for a full hearing of their legal challenge to Johnson\u2019s proroguing strategy on Friday 6 September next week. They will now ask the court to hear that case early next week, following Johnson\u2019s gambit on Wednesday. Jolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit lawyer who helped coordinate the legal challenge through his Good Law Project, said they believe the courts are able to reverse the decision even though it has been approved by the Queen: The MPs\u2019 lawyer, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, is expected to attack Johnson and the privy council\u2019s request of the Queen on Wednesday rather than the Queen\u2019s decision to approve it. O\u2019Neill will argue the court can order UK ministers to request that the Queen reverses the prorogument, again via the privy council. Either side is likely to immediately appeal against the judge\u2019s decision whichever way it goes, leading to series of urgent court hearings likely to end up at the UK supreme court. Meanwhile, the European Movement in Scotland held a demonstration against Johnson\u2019s \u201ccoup\u201d in central Edinburgh on Wednesday. We\u2019ve just launched a piece by Jessica Elgot providing answers to some of the key questions around the complex events of today. You can read it in full, but here are two: What is prorogation? Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament, normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a new Queen\u2019s speech. It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion. It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years. Can MPs vote against prorogation? No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way. Jacob Rees-Mogg has been doorstepped at Aberdeen airport where journalists followed him through the terminal after his privy council meeting with the Queen. \u201cAnything the Queen says is private, as you know,\u201d said Rees-Mogg, who was one of three members of the council who went to Balmoral to ask permission on behalf of the prime minister for the prorogation of parliament. Asked if he was confident that the move would not be up for challenge in the courts, he replied: \u201cThe courts will come to their decision but this is a completely normal procedure.\u201d Some non-prorogation news now. Our political correspondent Kate Proctor reports that there is speculation that the Liberal Democrats are preparing to welcome another defector, after their former leader Vince Cable announced he would stand down as an MP at the next election. The candidate for Cable\u2019s Twickenham seat, which he won back from the Conservatives in the 2017 general election, will be chosen from an all-female shortlist. Those wanting to stand have until midday on Friday to say so. A spokesman for the party said: Vince has enjoyed a fantastic parliamentary career in the Liberal Democrats and representing the people of Twickenham. He will continue to serve as the MP until the next election, whenever that may be. The vacancy opens up the possibility that the rumoured defection of another former Change UK MP will soon follow, with new members to be announced at the party\u2019s autumn conference in Bournemouth. Senior party figures have said they are holding out for Heidi Allen, Luciana Berger or Angela Smith to make the switch and follow their former colleague Sarah Wollaston. A source said: \u201cTwickenham coming into play has certainly raised the levels of speculation about defections.\u201d Berger said she was still deciding what to do at the next election. The former MP Sarah Olney, who briefly took the Richmond Park seat from Zac Goldsmith before losing it months later in 2017, was briefly rumoured for Twickenham but has been reselected as the candidate in Richmond. The all-women shortlist quashes rumours that the former Labour MP and now Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, Chuka Umunna, could switch from running in Streatham to Twickenham, where Cable had a 9,000 majority. Our Brexit correspondent Lisa O\u2019Carroll has been listening to the Irish deputy PM, Simon Coveney, and the UK\u2019s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, speaking at a conference in Paris. The former prime minister John Major has said he is seeking legal advice on whether he can challenge Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. In a statement read out on BBC News, Major said: \u201cI have no doubt that the prime minister\u2019s motive in seeking prorogation is to bypass a sovereign parliament that opposes his policy. As events unfold I will continue to seek advice on the legality of this and other matters, but will be making no further comment.\u201d Last month Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. In June he said this: Planned protests against the prorogation of parliament are springing up around the country. The campaign group Another Europe is Possible is planning a demo on College Green in Westminster at 5.30pm. Leeds for Europe is planning a protest in City Square on Thursday at 5.30pm. In Manchester, people will start to gather (with umbrellas, Hong Kong-style) in Albert Square from 4pm today. The European Movement in Scotland is to host a walking vigil, meeting at 4pm at the foot of the Mound in Edinburgh. In Cardiff, people will gather at the Aneurin Bevan statue at 6pm today, and in Cambridge there will be a protest in Market Square. This tweet sent in June by Matt Hancock, now the health secretary, has been doing the rounds. In it he called on other Conservative leadership candidates to rule out proroguing parliament, saying it undermined parliamentary democracy. He doesn\u2019t appear to have said anything yet about today\u2019s announcement. Nicola Sturgeon hopes the Brexit crisis will boost the Scottish National party\u2019s chances of a shock Holyrood byelection victory in the Liberal Democrat stronghold of Shetland tomorrow. Pundits believe the SNP is on the verge of winning the seat, which the Lib Dems have held comfortably since the first Scottish parliament elections in 1999. Tavish Scott, previously a Scottish Lib Dems leader, won in 2016 with 67% of the vote, a majority of 4,865 over the SNP. The contiguous Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland has been a Lib Dem constituency since 1950 and is the party\u2019s safest in the UK, but Sturgeon and the SNP have shovelled huge resources into the contest to succeed Scott, who stood down in June to work instead for Scottish Rugby. An SNP win tomorrow would be cited as clear proof that Scottish voters now favour independence from the rest of the UK after Brexit. Shetland historically has been sceptical about the case for leaving the UK. Sturgeon has visited Shetland to campaign three times in recent weeks, alongside numerous Holyrood ministers and SNP MPs and MSPs, inviting criticism from her opponents after one visit meant she failed to appear at a government press event disclosing a multibillion-pound public spending deficit in Scotland last year. The Scottish Tories pointed out Sturgeon had visited Shetland as many times in the last month as she had during her previous five years as first minister. Brydon Goodland, the Tory candidate for Shetland, said: \u201cThe SNP only care about Shetland when there are votes to be won.\u201d The final message to voters from Tom Wills, the SNP\u2019s young candidate, was Brexit-focused. He claimed the SNP was \u201cby some distance the strongest pro-European party in the UK\u201d with 100 parliamentarians at Scottish, UK and European level focused on stopping the UK leaving the EU. The Lib Dems reject the implication they are softer on Brexit. After all, their European election campaign slogan was \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d. But observers on Shetland say the Lib Dem campaign has suffered greatly from the lacklustre performance of its candidate, Beatrice Wishart , while Wills has energised younger voters. Much hinges on turnout. The Lib Dems hope the island\u2019s broadly conservative voters will treat with cynicism Wills\u2019s claims that the SNP will slash ferry and air fares for islanders, increase housing spending and protect fishing interests. Here\u2019s the document with the orders approved at today\u2019s meeting of the privy council at Balmoral. Anna Soubry has become the latest MP to write to the Queen today to ask for a meeting ... Here is the document with the orders approved at the privy council at Balmoral today. And this is the key text: It is this day ordered by Her Majesty in Council that the Parliament be prorogued on a day no earlier than Monday the 9th day of September and no later than Thursday the 12th day of September 2019 to Monday the 14th day of October 2019, to be then holden for the despatch of divers urgent and important affairs, and that the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain do cause a Commission to be prepared and issued in the usual manner for proroguing the Parliament accordingly. The privy council meeting to sign off Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend parliament has taken place at Balmoral, the Press Association reports. Sources said the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the lord president of the council, plus the Lords leader, Natalie Evans, and the chief whip, Mark Spencer, attended the meeting with the Queen. The former Tory deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine has just put out a statement after hearing about the news of what\u2019s happening in the UK while on holiday in the Balkans. Like a range of others, he says it\u2019s a constitutional outrage. \u201cOn hearing the news whilst on holiday in Montenegro, I am appalled by the government\u2019s announcement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s decision is a constitutional outrage. A government which is frightened of parliament is frightened of democracy. I hope that every member of parliament, in feeling this humiliation, will use every legal and constitutional weapon to obstruct a government proposing to force on the British people a historic change for which they have long since lost any mandate.\u201d My colleagues Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Heather Stewart report that constitutional experts are saying the prime minister\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament for five weeks will be the longest suspension of the British legislature since 1945. They said it appeared to be designed to evade scrutiny of his plans for Brexit or any new deal with the EU. Ruth Fox, the director of the highly respected Hansard Society, a leading source of independent research and advice on parliamentary affairs, said it was an \u201caffront to parliamentary democracy\u201d. Lawyers said the unprecedented length of the suspension of parliament would prompt immediate legal challenge. \u201cExpect litigation \u2013 starting in Scotland,\u201d said Ros Kellaway, the head of Brexit and EU law at Eversheds Sutherland, in London. Read the full story here: The US president has helpfully tweeted to say it will be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn to \u201cseek a no-confidence vote against the new prime minister Boris Johnson\u201d. He added: \u201cBoris is exactly what the UK has been looking for and will prove to be \u2018a great one!\u2019 Love UK.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has written to the Queen to ask for a meeting in light of the prime minister \u201cstifling the voices of both the people and their representatives\u201d. Further to this post about the geographical spread of the signatories on the petition against the proroguing of parliament, this nifty tool allows you to check how many people in your constituency have signed it. 1,627 people in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s constituency have signed it so far, compared with 199 in Boris Johnson\u2019s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. (The petition has nearly 287,000 signatures now, by the way.) The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, has accused the French government of risking leaving British people resident in the country behind after Brexit, writes Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Speaking at a conference in Paris organised by the French business group Medef, Barclay said Brits in France would be left with fewer rights than those of the 300,000 French nationals in the UK in the event of no deal. EU leaders repeatedly tell me how important citizens\u2019 rights are to them but not only has the [European] commission refused to agree a specific deal on citizens\u2019 rights \u2013 as requested by all political parties in the UK parliament \u2013 the offer here in France falls short of what we have set out in the UK in several respects. We have guaranteed the rights of the approximately 300,000 French nationals and indeed all EU nationals living in the UK. I call on the French government and others in the EU to match our offer and provide certainty for UK nationals in France. The value of the pound fell sharply against the euro and the dollar this morning after Boris Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament, raising the chances of a no-deal exit from the EU. Sterling fell by more than a cent against the US dollar to a six-day low of below $1.22, and by almost as much against the euro, to \u20ac1.096. Here\u2019s our story: The Sun\u2019s political editor is reporting some \u201cserious disquiet\u201d in government about Boris Johnson\u2019s new strategy. This is a great explainer by Jessica Elgot on what exactly prorogation is and why the prime minister is using it. The Press Association is reporting that a group of Church of England bishops has issued an open letter outlining their particular concerns over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Twenty-five bishops signed the letter warning of the potential cost of a no-deal Brexit to \u201cthose least resilient to economic shocks\u201d. \u201cThe sovereignty of parliament is not just an empty term, it is based on institutions to be honoured and respected: our democracy is endangered by cavalier disregard for these,\u201d they said. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said on Tuesday he would be willing to chair a citizens\u2019 forum on Brexit \u201cin principle\u201d after being approached by senior MPs. \u201cThe archbishop of Canterbury has conditionally agreed to chair a citizens forum in Coventry and, without prejudice for any particular outcome, we support this move to have all voices in the current Brexit debate heard,\u201d said the bishops. \u201cHowever, we also have particular concerns about the potential cost of a no-deal Brexit to those least resilient to economic shocks.\u201d Boris Johnson has placed the Queen \u201cin the firing line\u201d over Brexit, according to the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic. It floated the possibility that a parliamentary crisis could become a royal crisis. Republic\u2019s spokesman, Graham Smith, said Johnson had thrown British politics into a deep crisis \u201cand has shone a spotlight on the impotence of the Queen and the role of the monarch\u2019s powers\u201d. \u201cAlready people are petitioning the Queen to intervene, but she won\u2019t. Not because she can\u2019t, but because the Queen\u2019s first priority is always the preservation of the monarchy. \u201cBut Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament has created a unique crisis for the Queen. The convention is that the Queen does as she\u2019s told by the PM. But in normal times the PM has the full support of a majority in the Commons.\u201d \u201cConstitutionally the Queen is free to decide whether or not to go along with the government\u2019s plans or support the sovereign parliament. So the Queen has a choice to make, and she\u2019s damned if she does and damned if she doesn\u2019t.\u201d Smith added: \u201cWill the public care about the constitutional niceties? How much the Queen fulfils the public\u2019s expectations and hopes will determine how much the parliamentary crisis becomes a royal crisis.\u201d For the record, a YouGov poll in the run-up to last year\u2019s royal marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle found that seven in 10 Britons support Britain continuing to have a monarchy. Monarchists were also slightly more likely to be leave voters, with those who cast a ballot in 2016 splitting 56/44% in favour of Brexit. Those who were against Britain having a royal family voted 65/35% in favour of remain. The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, has told BBC Radio 5 Live that \u201copposition parties will be more united\u201d as a result of Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament. She described the move as \u201cunconstitutional and unlawful\u201d and said she had \u201clittle doubt that the courts will step up to protect our parliament and parliamentary democracy\u201d. They think they can get away with shutting down parliament because it\u2019s inconvenient, and that is unconstitutional and unlawful in our country \u2026 None of us voted for a prime minister to shut down parliament because it\u2019s annoying. Chakrabarti said the first step would be to mount a parliamentary challenge, before considering legal action. We will work across parties to defeat this strategy in parliament. And I hope it doesn\u2019t come to it, but if down the road it ends up in the courts, I have little doubt that the courts will step up to protect our parliament and parliamentary democracy. She also said of Boris Johnson: He\u2019s been getting away with blue murder, but this time he\u2019s gone too far. That petition is now at 175,000 signatures. It had 14,000 just over two hours ago. Once a petition gets more than 100,000 signatures it must be considered for a debate in parliament. You can see where in the country the signatories come from by looking at this heatmap. It\u2019s interesting to see the dark red patches in places such as London, Brighton, Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the more affluent parts of big northern cities such as Manchester and Sheffield. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour will do everything it can to prevent what he described as a \u201csmash and grab\u201d operation on the part of the government. \u201cI have protested in the strongest possible terms on behalf of my party and all the other opposition parties that are going to join in with this in saying that suspending parliament is not acceptable, It\u2019s not on,\u201d the Labour leader said in a clip pooled to broadcasters. \u201cWhat the prime minister is doing is a sort of smash and grab on our democracy in order to force through a no-deal exit from the European Union. What is he so afraid of that he has to suspend parliament in order to prevent parliament discussing these matters? Corbyn said the first thing Labour would do was to put forward legislation to prevent the suspension, and than there would be a challenge in the form of a vote of no confidence. Asked about plans by a cross-party group of MPs to hold an alternative parliament, and calls by some Labour MPs for people to take to the streets, he replied: \u201cWe will do everything that we can. We will join everybody else in doing that.\u201d Mick Whelan, the general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 trade union, Aslef, has said Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to \u201ctry to sideline parliament in the run-up to Brexit\u201d could cause civil unrest. Whatever your views on Brexit, the democratic process must underpin what is done in all our names \u2013 or civil unrest will be the result. It is disturbing that a prime minister who only has a mandate from the Conservative party and not from the electorate is trying to undermine the foundations of our democracy. And while people did vote, three years ago, to leave the European Union, no one voted to leave without a deal. The best way forward is to call a general election and let the people decide. The political commentator Paul Mason has called on people to gather in central London tonight to protest against the government\u2019s planned suspension of parliament. The Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, has a useful caveat here on how much parliamentary time will be lost through the prorogation. In practice, MPs are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament, depending on which day parliament is prorogued in the second week of September. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess from 12 September until 7 October. Given that MPs do not generally sit on Fridays, it means MPs will not be able to sit for four days until the following Monday, 14 October. They could also lose days in the second week of September, depending on what day parliament is prorogued in the week beginning 9 September. However, one key new obstacle is that any legislation that is incomplete ahead of prorogation will fall, meaning MPs would have to pass any anti-no-deal legislation in its entirety either before prorogation or in the three weeks leading up to 31 October. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Queen expressing concern about the move by Boris Johnson, reports our colleague Heather Stewart. The Labour MP Clive Lewis has said the police will have to remove him and other MPs from the chamber of the House of Commons if parliament is shut down. Charlie Falconer, the Labour peer and former lord chancellor, has also been tweeting: Events in Britain are making headlines around Europe and elsewhere. Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds reports that Boris Johnson is demonstrating a determination and recklessness that his main critics never anticipated. Britain is now heading towards an \u201cunprecedented constitutional shock\u201d in which the Queen will be involuntarily involved, adds the Spanish daily, which is considered a national newspaper of record in a country that is itself no stranger to constitutional crises and worse. In France, Le Monde leads with a straight news report on events in the UK, noting that the pound fell against the euro and adding that Johnson is \u201cdesperate to leave the EU\u201d with or without a divorce agreement. In the US, the New York Times described Johnson\u2019s request for the suspension of parliament as \u201ca surprise maneuver that would make it harder for lawmakers to prevent Britain from exiting the European Union without an agreement with the bloc.\u201d In Ireland, Pat Leahy, the Irish Times political editor, predicts that Johnson\u2019s move \u201cwill almost certainly incite a parliamentary rebellion that his government is likely to lose\u201d. He added: \u201cIn Dublin and in Brussels, they will sit tight and watch. This fight is in Westminster, and then, probably, across the UK. In truth, it has been coming for months. Only once it is resolved will the Brexit deal-making resume, as all the while the no-deal clock ticks louder and louder.\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, the chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, has tweeted that \u201ctaking back control\u201d has never looked so sinister. \u201cAs a fellow parliamentarian, my solidarity with those fighting for their voices to be heard,\u201d he said. Joanna Cherry, an SNP MP and part of a group behind a legal action in Edinburgh aimed at preventing Boris Johnson from shutting down parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit, has said opposition parties may now have to review plans agreed yesterday to go for primary legislation first rather than a vote of no confidence. As reported this morning by the Guardian\u2019s Libby Brooks, the barrister told the BBC that she had made a motion this morning to the court in Edinburgh to try to get the hearing brought forward. The court will rule on whether it is lawful for parliament to be suspended. Cherry described the move today by Boris Johnson as \u201cprofoundly undemocratic\u201d. \u201cThe good news is that the opposition is more united than it has ever been and we are looking at all options to prevent Boris Johnson from acting like a dictator,\u201d she said. The preference of those parties had been to go first with primary legislation \u2013 of the type that would, for example, extend article 50 - but that should now be reviewed, she said. However, Cherry cautioned that a vote of no confidence could still be used as \u201ca ruse\u201d by Boris Johnson to call a general election after the planned departure date of 31 October and thereby facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Cherry echoed some of the language of her party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, in voicing concern that the prime minister could also shut down the Scottish parliament \u201cif he closes Westminster on a whim\u201d. Some Conservative MPs here tweeting in support of the government\u2019s decision, all trying to suggest that proroguing parliament is a very normal thing to do. The Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan has accused those describing the government\u2019s move as a coup of having \u201ca screwed-up mindset\u201d. Nick Boles, who resigned the Tory party whip in April citing the party\u2019s failure to compromise on Brexit, has said any MP who supports the government\u2019s move to suspend parliament will \u201cshare in responsibility for the damage inflicted by a no-deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has compared the actions of Downing Street today to those of a dictatorship. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely outrageous. Shutting down parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit which will do untold and lasting damage to the country against the wishes of MPs is not democracy. It\u2019s a dictatorship and if MPs don\u2019t come together next week to stop Boris Johnson in his tracks then I think today will go down in history as the day UK democracy died,\u201d she told the BBC. Speaking in Edinburgh, the SNP leader said she had listened to Boris Johnson in the morning and rarely had she heard a more flimsy \u201ccover story\u201d. \u201cEverybody knows what this is about. It\u2019s about restricting the power parliament has to stop a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Noting that Johnson was unelected and had come to power after being selected by Tory MPs, Sturgeon said enacting new laws or anything that could stop Johnson had to be a priority. There was now a narrow window of opportunity to act on a plan that opposition parties had discussed yesterday, she said, to try to take control of business in the House of Commons and pass primary legislation. Unison\u2019s general secretary, Dave Prentis, has accused Boris Johnson of treating the future of the UK \u201clike the plot of a far-fetched political TV drama\u201d. This outrageous manoeuvre has been made to silence all opposition in the most dictatorial way. Our parliamentary democracy is the envy of the world, but it\u2019s being stamped upon and disregarded by a prime minister who\u2019s not gone near a public vote. Boris Johnson is treating the future of the UK like the plot of a far-fetched political TV drama. The country must be asked for its view on Brexit right now. That\u2019s the only way. Here\u2019s a roundup of more Twitter reaction. The Conservative MP and Johnson ally Zac Goldsmith was predictably dismissive of the idea that proroguing parliament was a constitutional outrage. Alastair Campbell, the No 10 director of communications under Tony Blair, called on Conservative MPs to get behind a legislative plan to stop a no-deal Brexit. In the north-east, which is expected to be particularly hard hit by a no-deal Brexit, the mayor of the North of Tyne, Jamie Driscoll, called for a march on Downing Street. He said: People voted to give Britain parliamentary sovereignty. By a small margin we voted to leave the EU, and the likes of Johnson and Farage were talking about Norway- or Swiss-style arrangements. Now we are seeing this farce, this dangerous destruction of our democracy. Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to derail democracy by proroguing parliament has all the trappings of a coup. People need to march on Downing Street. Our parents and grandparents did not fight dictators to see it happen here. That petition I mentioned earlier now has 65,000 signatures, up from 14,000 just under an hour ago. The DUP, which props up the Conservative government, has supported the decision to prorogue parliament. The party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, said on Twitter that it had been the longest parliamentary session in the Union of England and Scotland since 1707. She said the terms of the party\u2019s confidence and supply agreement with the government would be reviewed in advance of the new session. \u201cThis will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government,\u201d said Foster. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has issued a statement responding to the government\u2019s announcement. I am appalled at the recklessness of Johnson\u2019s government, which talks about sovereignty and yet is seeking to suspend parliament to avoid scrutiny of its plans for a reckless no-deal Brexit. This is an outrage and a threat to our democracy. That is why Labour has been working across parliament to hold this reckless government to account, and prevent a disastrous no deal, which parliament has already ruled out. If Johnson has confidence in his plans he should put them to the people in a general election or public vote. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, described the developments as \u201ca very British coup\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cWhatever one\u2019s views on Brexit, once you allow a prime minister to prevent the full and free operation of our democratic institutions you are on a very precarious path.\u201d Dr Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, spoke to BBC news earlier. (I\u2019ve only just had a chance to write up my notes.) We were due to have a Queen\u2019s speech and prorogation anyway but to do it right now, given everything that is going on and given the emphasis that is going to be on parliament in the effort by some MPs to try and stop a no-deal Brexit, it does seem like a very obvious move to try and cut down the time available to anti-no deal MPs to be able to do something about it. She said we could expect a showdown between the government and MPs next week. We heard in the last week or so a lot of noises about whether or not Boris Johnson would be able to find a deal, [whether he] was making progress possibly with EU leaders about when he might be able to do that, and there was some speculation that that might stop Conservative MPs wanting to go to a showdown with their own government too early and that they would actually give the government time. I think this changes that. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, has renewed his calls for a second EU referendum in response to today\u2019s prorogation news. This is a good quick backgrounder from the House of Commons library on how exactly proroguing parliament works. A petition calling on the government not to prorogue parliament has already received more than 14,000 signatures. Its text reads: \u201cParliament must not be prorogued or dissolved unless and until the article 50 period has been sufficiently extended or the UK\u2019s intention to withdraw from the EU has been cancelled.\u201d The Financial Times\u2019s Sebastian Payne is reporting that the government will call an election if MPs manage to pass a vote of no confidence next week. The SNP MP Joanna Cheery has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal team about speeding up the action in the Scottish courts to stop Boris Johnson shutting down parliament, which was due to be heard of 6 September. Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70 MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an interim interdict (similar to an injunction in England and Wales) in the court of session to block prorogation. Led by Jolyon Maugham QC\u2019s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were exhausted. Cherry told reporters on Tuesday the team were prepared to get a judge \u201cout of their bed in the middle of the night\u201d to block prorogation. Meanwhile, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has described Johnson as a \u201cdictator\u201d, saying: \u201cThe Tory leader has no mandate, no majority and is acting like a dictator by attempting to curtail parliament to get his way. \u201cThe SNP will do everything we can to stop Brexit and prevent a no-deal disaster. It is vital that MPs from across the parties urgently pull together to stop Boris Johnson driving Scotland and the UK off a cliff edge.\u201d The Speaker, John Bercow, has issued an extraordinary statement. \u201cI have had no contact from the government, but if the reports that it is seeking to prorogue parliament are confirmed, this move represents a constitutional outrage,\u201d he says. Here\u2019s the full text of the prime minister\u2019s letter to MPs. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has said it would be \u201ca constitutional outrage\u201d if parliament were prevented from holding the government to account. Hammond quit the cabinet before Boris Johnson became prime minister and has become a leading opponent of no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has sent through its formal announcement. Here are the key points. Boris Johnson has briefed cabinet colleagues that the government will \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d, and that the current parliamentary session will be brought to an end. He has spoken to the Queen to request an end to the current parliamentary session in the second sitting week in September. Following the conclusion of the traditional party conference season, the second session of this parliament will commence with a Queen\u2019s speech on Monday 14 October. \u201cA central feature of the legislative programme will be the government\u2019s number one legislative priority \u2013 if a new deal is forthcoming at European council \u2013 to introduce a withdrawal agreement bill and move at pace to secure its passage before 31 October.\u201d \u201cThe decision to end the current parliamentary session \u2013 the longest in close to 400 years and in recent months one of the least active \u2013 will enable the prime minister to put a fresh domestic programme in front of MPs for debate and scrutiny while also ensuring that there is good time before and after the European council for Parliament to further consider Brexit issues.\u201d Votes on the Queen\u2019s speech are likely to fall on Monday 21 and Tuesday 22 October. And here\u2019s a statement from the prime minister: We must focus on crucial public priorities \u2013 helping the NHS, fighting violent crime, investing in infrastructure and science and cutting the cost of living. We have made an important start \u2013 funding for 20,000 extra police officers and new investment in our NHS \u2013 but to deliver on the public\u2019s priorities we require a new session and a Queen\u2019s speech. I believe it is vital that parliament is sitting both before and after European council and if, as I hope, a deal with the EU is forthcoming, parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the withdrawal agreement bill required for ratification ahead of 31 October. Here is Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to MPs confirming that parliament will be prorogued. It starts: \u201cI hope you had an enjoyable and productive summer recess, with the opportunity for some rest ahead of the return of the house.\u201d He says he will request an end to the parliamentary session in the second sitting week of September. Boris Johnson has been speaking to the broadcast media. He confirmed that the Queen\u2019s speech would be held on 14 October and said the move to suspend parliament was purely about \u201cgetting on with plans to take this country forward\u201d. As I said on the steps of Downing Street, we\u2019re not going to wait until 31 October before getting on with our plans to take this country forward. This is a new government with a very exciting agenda ... We have to be bringing forward new and important bills. That\u2019s why we are going to have a Queen\u2019s speech and we are going to do it on 14 October. He denied that it was a move to deny MPs the time they needed to debate and vote on Brexit. That is completely untrue. If you look at what we\u2019re doing we are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, on hospitals, making sure that we have the education funding that we need and there will be ample time on both sides of that crucial 17 October summit, ample time in parliament for MPs to debate the EU to debate Brexit and all the other issues. Asked if he was planning a general election, he said: No, all you should take from this is that we are doing exactly what I said on the steps of Downing Street, which is we must get on now with our legislative domestic agenda. Scotland\u2019s first minister has tweeted, saying that unless MPs work together to stop Johnson, today could go down as \u201ca dark one indeed for UK democracy\u201d. She called on the Scottish Conservatives to back a cross-party effort to try to block the suspension of parliament. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, has just pointed out that the SNP party conference will fall right across the date of the proposed Queen\u2019s speech. Craig Oliver, who was director of communications at No 10 under David Cameron, has tweeted: More reaction from outraged opposition MPs is coming in. Anna Soubry, the leader of Change UK, has said UK democracy is under threat from \u201ca ruthless PM\u201d. The Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve has been speaking to BBC News. The former attorney general, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days ahead of parliament\u2019s return next week. He said they would try to take steps to try to ensure that prorogation would not happen and suggested there could be a vote of no confidence in the government. I think that the prime minster\u2019s decision is deeply questionable and frankly pretty outrageous. He knows very well that we are in the middle of a national crisis. He knows very well that parliament is very concerned about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and this has very little to do with starting a new session of parliament. It is a deliberate attempt to make sure parliament doesn\u2019t sit for a five week perio \u2026 This is an attempt to govern without parliament. It is pretty unprecedented and I think the government will come to regret it. When opposition leaders met yesterday they stressed they would prioritise legislative measures to try to stop a no-deal Brexit, rather than holding a vote of no confidence in the government, but Grieve said a vote of confidence was now more likely. If it is impossible to prevent prorogation then i think it is going to be very difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to table a motion for a vote of no confidence \u2026 I\u2019ve always been of the view that bringing down the administration which is made up of a party of which I am a member is something I would only do as a last resort and that remains my position and I don\u2019t wish to do it f there is any way of avoiding it. But if there is no other way of avoiding it it may be the only thing I can do. The Observer\u2019s political editor, Toby Helm, tweets that his paper reported on Sunday that Boris Johnson had asked the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, whether parliament could be shut down for five weeks from 9 September. He said the report was rubbished by No 10. Best for Britain, a group committed to stopping Brexit \u201cthrough any democratic means\u201d, have issued a statement. The group\u2019s chief executive, Naomi Smith, said: It would make no sense for the Queen to back this deeply undemocratic, unconstitutional and fundamentally political manoeuvre from the government. If the Queen is asked to help, she would do well to remember history doesn\u2019t look too kindly on royals who aid and abet the suspension of democracy. John Redwood, the Conservative MP and arch-Eurosceptic, is going along with the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d line. This is from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper. She says the government\u2019s move is \u201cdeeply dangerous and irresponsible\u201d. This is from Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake. He says the \u201cdeclaration of war will be met with an iron fist\u201d. More from the Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot. This from the chairman of the Conservative party, James Cleverly, demonstrates the line the government is going to take \u2013 that this move is business as usual. And here is our story. Ministers could move on Wednesday to suspend parliament for up to five weeks, which would prevent MPs from planning legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, the Guardian understands. Senior sources said a privy council of senior ministers was preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as Wednesday to set this in motion. MPs have already started condemning the reported plans on Twitter. So, to recap, the BBC is reporting that the government is to ask the Queen to suspend parliament days after MPs return from recess. A Number 10 source told the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, that this would allow Boris Johnson\u2019s new administration to hold a Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 October. This will leave MPs with very little time to attempt to pass laws that could stop a no deal Brexit. Here is the BBC\u2019s story. And this from the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg. More from our chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, on reports that a recess until mid-October could be on the agenda of a privy council meeting this week. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian politics live blog. Following the surprise announcement yesterday afternoon that the first major speech by the chancellor, Sajid Javid \u2013 due to be held today \u2013 was to cancelled, the Treasury has confirmed that the one-year spending review, which had been due to take place later this year, would happen on 4 September, the day after MPs return to parliament. The announcement has added fuel to speculation the government could be planning an early general election. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Javid pledged increased spending on priority areas of schools, police and health, but said there would be no \u201cblank cheque\u201d for departments. Thanks to the hard work of the British people over the last decade, we can afford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities, without breaking the rules around what the government should spend, and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police. But at the same time, it\u2019s vital that we continue to live within our means as a country. Unlike the Labour party, we don\u2019t believe in just throwing money at a problem. And especially at a time when the global economy is slowing, it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let our public finances get out of control. So I can confirm that next week\u2019s spending round will be delivered within the current fiscal rules. As every household knows, that will mean making choices and prioritising where we focus spending, and any departments expecting a blank cheque will be sorely disappointed. Jeremy Corbyn yesterday backed cross-party plans to delay a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and prioritise rebel MPs\u2019 attempts to use legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Plans are set to be agreed by the end of the week. The Guardian\u2019s political team reports that rumours at swirling at Westminster that the privy council of senior ministers is preparing to meet the Queen at Balmoral this week, perhaps as soon as today. They write: Leaked emails revealed at the weekend that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had sought legal advice about proroguing parliament for five weeks from early September, when MPs are already expected to break briefly for party conferences. A new session of parliament would then begin with a fresh Queen\u2019s speech packed with manifesto-friendly measures on or around 14 October. Such a move would have to be approved by the privy council. It would give MPs little chance for parliamentary manoeuvring, but could just about allow time for a vote on any reworked deal Johnson manages to strike with the EU27, before the crucial European council meeting on 17 October. Last night, the Guardian published details of a raft of dramatic and controversial education policy proposals set out in a confidential leaked briefing paper. The measures include billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools, which are set to be announced by the government within days. This morning, ministers have been accused of trying to act tough with reforms that would emphasise excluding unruly children from schools and using \u201creasonable force\u201d against them. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: We know the role that school exclusions have played in the rise of knife crime, but once again the Tories are trying to sound tough whilst failing to look at the evidence. The Conservative government would rather kick kids out of school and advocate the use of the ambiguously termed \u2018reasonable force\u2019 as discipline, which will cause parents, children and teachers additional stress, rather than actually putting the time and investment in to ensure all children receive a good education and have a positive experience within our schools.

Davidson was \u201cconsidering her position\u201d, one source added, although he stressed it was not connected to Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament. \u201cRuth will make her decision clear in due course, and there will be no further comment this evening,\u201d her spokesman said on Wednesday. She made abundantly clear during the Tory leadership campaign that she did not believe Johnson was the right UK party leader, with some of her close allies describing Johnson as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the Scottish Tories. One of Johnson\u2019s first acts as prime minister was to sack her close friend and ally David Mundell, who served as Scottish secretary for five years, against her advice.

However, she won with a slender lead of just 610 votes over the Scottish National party, which would be very confident of winning the seat in a byelection where Brexit and the prospect of Scottish independence were the defining issues. Holyrood is already braced for the results of Thursday\u2019s Scottish parliamentary byelection in Shetland, where the SNP hopes to win a seat held comfortably by the Liberal Democrats for 20 years. A win for the SNP in Shetland would leave Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party with 63 seats, tied with all other opposition parties. If the SNP won another byelection in Edinburgh Central, the first minister would win a parliamentary majority. Davidson, the first openly lesbian party leader anywhere in the UK, gave birth to her first child, conceived with her partner, Jen, following IVF treatment, last October. As a state-educated woman in a party overwhelmingly controlled by privately schooled men, she has delivered previously unthinkable electoral success for the Scottish Tories at both Holyrood and Westminster. Last September, Davidson published her first book, Yes She Can, a collection of interviews with \u201cmould-breaking women\u201d, in which she revealed that she was diagnosed with clinical depression as a teenager and discussed the continuing management of her mental health. Davidson attracted criticism from opposition politicians, including Sturgeon, for not giving media interviews on Wednesday following the prorogation announcement. Davidson\u2019s allies would not be drawn to speak publicly before her own statement on Thursday, and privately only expressed admiration for her leadership and sadness at her decision. Several years ago Davidson was touted as a potential leader of the UK Tories and a future prime minister, although she repeatedly rebuffed suggestions she would look for a safe Westminster seat. In June a YouGov poll of Tory members suggested nearly two-thirds would rather Scotland left the UK than Brexit not take place. Davidson said the party\u2019s members needed to \u201ctake a long, hard look at themselves\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Women\u2019s organisations welcomed the chancellor\u2019s promise this year that \u201causterity is coming to an end\u201d. The 2019 spending review is a significant test of what that promise will mean in real terms, particularly for women, who have borne the brunt of austerity policies since 2010. But an end to austerity must mean more than simply an end to budget cuts. After nearly a decade of chronic underfunding, our public services are in crisis. For \u201cjust about managing\u201d families, continuing as they are for the next few years certainly won\u2019t feel much like the end of austerity.</p> <p>Women \u2013 particularly the poorest women, BAME women and disabled women \u2013 suffered most from cuts to public services and social security because they are generally poorer, more likely to use public services, more likely to work in the public sector and more likely to increase unpaid work when services are cut. Women and those on lower incomes need to see a marked improvement in public services and a rise in living standards more generally, if the promise of end to austerity is going to ring true. Our public services and social security system need meaningful investment to actively reverse and repair the damage done since 2010.

The 2019 spending review is a significant test of what that promise will mean in real terms, particularly for women, who have borne the brunt of austerity policies since 2010. But an end to austerity must mean more than simply an end to budget cuts. After nearly a decade of chronic underfunding, our public services are in crisis. For \u201cjust about managing\u201d families, continuing as they are for the next few years certainly won\u2019t feel much like the end of austerity. Women \u2013 particularly the poorest women, BAME women and disabled women \u2013 suffered most from cuts to public services and social security because they are generally poorer, more likely to use public services, more likely to work in the public sector and more likely to increase unpaid work when services are cut. Women and those on lower incomes need to see a marked improvement in public services and a rise in living standards more generally, if the promise of end to austerity is going to ring true. Our public services and social security system need meaningful investment to actively reverse and repair the damage done since 2010. Spending on social infrastructure, such as health, education, care and specialist women\u2019s services builds the social and human capital that is just as important to future productivity as investment in say, transportation networks. After all, it is not just roads but high-quality childcare and reliable healthcare that enable parents to work.

And there lies the rub for our systems of representative democracy.</p> \n<p>How can politicians facing short-term constraints (particularly the need to be re-elected every few years) be expected to take the necessary decisions that require long-term and, probably, quite painful change on the part of the citizens who get to vote for them?</p> \n<p>This is where a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/could-camdens-climate-assembly-help-fix-democracy-too\">citizens\u2019 assembly could help</a>, as the experience in Ireland shows. The country\u2019s ban on abortion was an intractable problem that generation after generation of political leaders had failed to resolve. In 2016, under intense domestic and international pressure, the Irish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/08/how-99-strangers-in-a-dublin-hotel-broke-irelands-abortion-deadlock\" title=\"\">established a citizens\u2019 assembly</a> and tasked it with coming up with recommendations. It met over the course of five long weekends spread across five months. The 99 citizen members heard from expert witnesses, advocates and women who had been affected by Ireland\u2019s abortion ban. In carefully facilitated roundtable discussions the members deliberated on the subject, producing a series of recommendations that were then sent back to parliament. A special all-party committee of parliament spent a number of months debating the recommendations. The result of this was the decision to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/27/ireland-to-start-abortion-law-reform-after-historic-vote\" title=\"\">referendum, which passed</a> by a two-thirds majority in the summer of 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ecfe0f97-344b-4a3c-9e88-cd55a79d9101\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://rebellion.earth/\">Extinction Rebellion</a> is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues.</p>\n    <p>Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies.</p>\n    <p>More than 1,000 activists&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/22/people-arrested-at-london-climate-protests\">were arrested</a>&nbsp;in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow.

At the heart of a citizens\u2019 assembly is random selection: in much the same way as for jury duty, regular citizens are selected at random. They have not run for office; they are not there to represent special interests. The citizen members are there to represent themselves, and thereby the greater population, of which they are a representative sample.</p> \n<p>This is bringing \u201cdisorganised society\u201d into the room \u2013 giving regular citizens a voice in helping to drive debates on important public policy. These citizens, in turn, are put in the special position of informing and educating the political classes \u2013 helping our political leaders to work through the complexities of a difficult issue; informing them of aspects they might not have considered before; giving them a sense of where citizens might be prepared to go; even providing some degree of political cover.</p> \n<p>What is laudable about the Extinction Rebellion agenda is that the activists are not pushing for particular policy decisions on the climate emergency: they are merely asking that their government agrees to establish a citizens\u2019 assembly and give it the task of bringing forward proposals.</p> \n<p>There are certain things that need to happen for this to work properly. The citizens\u2019 assembly should be established by government, not parliament (because it is the government that ultimately calls the shots), but it should report back to parliament so that all political parties are given the opportunity to debate its recommendations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/could-camdens-climate-assembly-help-fix-democracy-too\">Britain's first climate assembly: can it help fix democracy too?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The agenda should be defined carefully. An ideal way to ensure this would be to allow the assembly itself to clarify it owns terms, guided by the experts advising it.</p> \n<p>It is critically important that the assembly\u2019s recommendations are dealt with respectfully: this does not mean that they are necessarily all accepted, but they should not be ignored. The Irish model of having an all-party committee debate the report would be worth emulating.</p> \n<p>Although government sponsors it, the assembly should be run independently of government (with methods such as tendering out the task to an agency with appropriate expertise). And the process should be run openly and transparently with all documents going online, live streaming of expert presentations, and full details of the key names involved in running and advising the process. Everything possible should be done to ensure that the process is seen as objective and above board.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d54db6ec333be3447965a99f79a7fade6cb740a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d54db6ec333be3447965a99f79a7fade6cb740a/0_238_5494_3297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People take part in the Mothers Rise Up march in London in May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The climate change emergency cannot be dealt with adequately in a few weekends.\u2019 People on the The Mothers Rise Up march in London in May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And the process needs time.

      "bodyText": "The climate crisis demands an urgent, realistic and sustained response from governments around the world: such a response will inevitably require sacrifices from all of us. And there lies the rub for our systems of representative democracy. How can politicians facing short-term constraints (particularly the need to be re-elected every few years) be expected to take the necessary decisions that require long-term and, probably, quite painful change on the part of the citizens who get to vote for them? This is where a citizens\u2019 assembly could help, as the experience in Ireland shows. The country\u2019s ban on abortion was an intractable problem that generation after generation of political leaders had failed to resolve. In 2016, under intense domestic and international pressure, the Irish government established a citizens\u2019 assembly and tasked it with coming up with recommendations. It met over the course of five long weekends spread across five months. The 99 citizen members heard from expert witnesses, advocates and women who had been affected by Ireland\u2019s abortion ban. In carefully facilitated roundtable discussions the members deliberated on the subject, producing a series of recommendations that were then sent back to parliament. A special all-party committee of parliament spent a number of months debating the recommendations. The result of this was the decision to have a referendum, which passed by a two-thirds majority in the summer of 2018. In Britain, the Extinction Rebellion group believes that a citizens\u2019 assembly could play a similarly important role in addressing the climate emergency. At the heart of a citizens\u2019 assembly is random selection: in much the same way as for jury duty, regular citizens are selected at random. They have not run for office; they are not there to represent special interests. The citizen members are there to represent themselves, and thereby the greater population, of which they are a representative sample. This is bringing \u201cdisorganised society\u201d into the room \u2013 giving regular citizens a voice in helping to drive debates on important public policy. These citizens, in turn, are put in the special position of informing and educating the political classes \u2013 helping our political leaders to work through the complexities of a difficult issue; informing them of aspects they might not have considered before; giving them a sense of where citizens might be prepared to go; even providing some degree of political cover. What is laudable about the Extinction Rebellion agenda is that the activists are not pushing for particular policy decisions on the climate emergency: they are merely asking that their government agrees to establish a citizens\u2019 assembly and give it the task of bringing forward proposals. There are certain things that need to happen for this to work properly. The citizens\u2019 assembly should be established by government, not parliament (because it is the government that ultimately calls the shots), but it should report back to parliament so that all political parties are given the opportunity to debate its recommendations. The agenda should be defined carefully. An ideal way to ensure this would be to allow the assembly itself to clarify it owns terms, guided by the experts advising it. It is critically important that the assembly\u2019s recommendations are dealt with respectfully: this does not mean that they are necessarily all accepted, but they should not be ignored. The Irish model of having an all-party committee debate the report would be worth emulating. Although government sponsors it, the assembly should be run independently of government (with methods such as tendering out the task to an agency with appropriate expertise). And the process should be run openly and transparently with all documents going online, live streaming of expert presentations, and full details of the key names involved in running and advising the process. Everything possible should be done to ensure that the process is seen as objective and above board. And the process needs time. The climate emergency cannot be dealt with adequately in a few weekends. The citizens\u2019 assembly needs time and space to allow the members to develop sufficient expertise on the topic to be able to deliberate in a suitably informed way. One might be forgiven for thinking that the recent announcement by the select committees of the House of Commons that they will establish a citizens\u2019 assembly on climate change this autumn is a sign that the political establishment has listened. But actually this is not the case: that is parliament acting \u2013 not government. The agenda has been tightly defined (focused on existing 2050 targets, which many now feel are not enough). The scope is also unrealistic (only two weekends of meetings, expertise provided solely by civil servants). There is a danger that this process will be tokenistic, inadequate, and provide parliament with the cover that the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d box has been ticked. This climate emergency requires a courageous response from our political leaders. This is a real test for our system of representative democracy, built on the notion that our parliamentarian ne\u2019er-do-wells are available for a good kicking every few years. Climate breakdown presents a real conundrum because it requires a long-term solution, one that goes beyond an election cycle. A citizens\u2019 assembly \u2013 given sufficient time, resources and expert assistance \u2013 offers one means to solve the problem of taking difficult, long-term decisions in a political system governed by short-term rules. \u2022 Professor David Farrell is the head of politics and international relations at University College Dublin.

Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called the move \u201can utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen.\u201d A meeting of opposition MPs, convened by Jeremy Corbyn, agreed on Tuesday to let legislative efforts take priority over a confidence vote in the new government as a mechanism to stop no deal \u2013 a priority that could be changed given the curtailing of the parliamentary timetable. The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be: MPs returning on 3 September. A new spending review on 4 September. Parliament prorogued before party conferences on 12 September. Parliament returns for Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. The EU council meets on 17 October, potentially to agree any new Brexit deal. The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October. Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs\u2019 efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing. The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review \u2013 called a spending round \u2013 which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked. Javid, writing in the Daily Telegraph, suggested he would not break Philip Hammond\u2019s strict fiscal rules, saying the government could \u201cafford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 without breaking the rules around what the government should spend \u2013 and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police\u201d.

Suppressing debate on profound choices is unlikely to help deliver a stable future EU-UK relationship.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU officials said it heightened the chances of a no-deal outcome, as parliament could refuse to back a compromise presented to MPs, just days before the 31 October deadline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister, who is a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the move showed there was a \u201cdisease\u201d in British democracy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe could see a Brexit without an agreement,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathalieLoiseau/status/1166656831802023937\">the MEP wrote on Twitter</a>. \u201cIt is, moreover, a Brexit without debate that is looming.

      "body": "<h2><strong>What is prorogation?</strong></h2> \n<p>Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament, normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a new Queen\u2019s speech. It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion.</p> \n<p>It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/chancellor-sajid-javid-fast-tracked-spending-review-fuels-talk-of-early-election\">Boris Johnson asks Queen to suspend parliament</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>So is this just normal procedure?</h2> \n<p>There are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times. For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than a week.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/chancellor-sajid-javid-fast-tracked-spending-review-fuels-talk-of-early-election\">the five-week suspension</a> does include a three-week period that would typically be recess anyway, three weeks during which the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held.</p> \n<p>The length of the prorogation will clearly have the effect of narrowing rebel MPs\u2019 options \u2013 they have two weeks fewer in parliament to pass any anti-no-deal legislation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"714c33c0-427a-4502-a3cc-9014d13af240\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xAfmVOq5hu8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why does Boris Johnson say he is doing this?</h2> \n<p>Johnson has rejected claims his decision is designed to block MPs from considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d against parliament.

      "bodyText": "What is prorogation? Prorogation is a formal mechanism to end a session of parliament, normally lasting only a short time until proceedings begin again with a new Queen\u2019s speech. It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion. It is normal for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years. So is this just normal procedure? There are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times. For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than a week. However, the five-week suspension does include a three-week period that would typically be recess anyway, three weeks during which the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held. The length of the prorogation will clearly have the effect of narrowing rebel MPs\u2019 options \u2013 they have two weeks fewer in parliament to pass any anti-no-deal legislation. Why does Boris Johnson say he is doing this? Johnson has rejected claims his decision is designed to block MPs from considering ways to thwart his Brexit plans after he was accused of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d against parliament. No 10 said there would be \u201cample time\u201d for MPs to debate Brexit either side of the EU summit on 17 October. He says the move will allow him to \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d. Can MPs vote against prorogation? No. Parliament is due to go on a three-week conference recess anyway in the second week of September and there had been suggestions MPs would vote against holding this recess, or any attempt to extend it. However, proroguing parliament is not voted on by MPs so cannot be stopped in this way. How does the privy council come into this? The request to the Queen and the proposed timetable was made at a privy council meeting at Balmoral by a small number of senior ministers who attend the meetings. There has been some confusion because technically senior opposition MPs are members of the privy council, including Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. But these MPs do not go to actual meetings, that is the preserve of a select number of senior ministers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is the lord president of the council. Could the Queen have refused the privy council\u2019s request? Technically, yes under the royal prerogative. But in reality it would have been extremely difficult for her to do so. Corbyn has written to her saying that \u201cthere was a danger that the royal prerogative is being set directly against the wishes of a majority of the House of Commons\u201d. How will this affect plans to stop no deal? Less than 24 hours after Corbyn and other opposition MPs came to an agreement that they would use legislative efforts to stop no deal, rather than the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of an immediate no-confidence vote, it looks like the window for potential legislation has become far narrower. It makes the prospect of a snap no-confidence vote far more likely and remainer MPs will need to weigh up that option again. Corbyn has offered to lead a caretaker government to negotiate an extension to article 50 and then call a general election \u2013 an offer that is highly unpalatable to most Conservative MPs. The Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, who opposes a no-deal Brexit, said he would consult with likeminded MPs over the next few days before parliament\u2019s return next week. Grieve said a no-confidence vote was now more likely. \u201cIf it is impossible to prevent prorogation then I think it is going to be very difficult for people like myself to keep confidence in the government and I could well see why the leader of the opposition would wish to table a motion for a vote of no confidence,\u201d he said. Will there be legal action to stop prorogation? There will certainly be an attempt. The campaigner Gina Miller revealed on Wednesday evening that her lawyers had made an urgent application to the high court for a judicial review of Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament. The SNP MP Joanna Cherry has confirmed that she has spoken to her legal team about speeding up the planned action in the Scottish courts, which was due to be heard on 6 September. Labour\u2019s Ian Murray, another of the cross-party group of more than 70 MPs and peers behind the action, said they would consider seeking an interim interdict \u2013 similar to an injunction in England and Wales \u2013 in the court of session to block prorogation. Led by Jolyon Maugham QC\u2019s Good Law Project, the group had been seeking a ruling from the court of session to prevent the prime minister going to the Queen with a request for prorogation until all appeals were exhausted.",

The proposed new timetable would leave MPs with a far narrower window to pass anti-no deal legislation, cutting it short by two weeks, with new dates likely to be: MPs returning on 3 September. A new spending review on 4 September. Parliament prorogued before party conferences on 12 September. Parliament returns for Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October. The EU council meets on 17 October, potentially to agree any new Brexit deal. The UK would be due to leave the EU on 31 October. Rumours swirled in Westminster on Tuesday that plans were afoot to stymie MPs\u2019 efforts to stop no deal after it was revealed that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, would hold a fast-tracked spending review on the day after MPs return to parliament next week, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing.. The swift timing of the review came as the first major speech by the chancellor was abruptly cancelled by the Treasury with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. A Treasury spokesman said the speech had been cancelled because the one-year spending review, called a spending round, which had been expected to take place later this autumn, was being fast-tracked. Javid, writing in the Daily Telegraph, suggested he would not break his predecessor Philip Hammond\u2019s strict fiscal rules, saying the government could \u201cafford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 without breaking the rules around what the government should spend \u2013 and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police.\u201d The chancellor said his economic priorities were health, education and policing, suggesting that other key areas including housing may get overlooked for major investment. He said: \u201cHealth and education aren\u2019t just the names of departments \u2013 they\u2019re lifelines of opportunity, just as they were for me. The teachers who persuaded me that I had what it takes to study economics, and put me on the path to becoming chancellor of the exchequer. \u201cThe police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up on became a centre for drug dealers. The NHS that cared for my dad in his final days. These aren\u2019t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They\u2019re the beating heart of our country.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cNobody is fooled into believing that this is a proper and normal spending review. It\u2019s a one off pre-election panic-driven stunt budget. Whitehall sources suggested there was considerable concern MPs could trigger a vote of no confidence in the government and an early general election, which could lead to departments being left in the dark about spending plans, with budgets running out in 2020. \u201cWe want people to be able to plan and there is a reason it is in early September because of the risks when MPs return to the house that week,\u201d one source said. The 12-month review, instead of the usual three-year review, is intended as a short-term measure to give departments new budgets and also free up officials to focus on preparing for Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is heading into the crunch period for Brexit negotiations with the UK economy potentially on the brink of recession and as global economic growth falters, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. The prime minister faces the challenge of breaking the deadlock with Brussels to avoid a no-deal Brexit on Halloween, just as the outlook for the economy deteriorates at home and abroad. The latest phase of talks came as Britain recorded the first fall in quarterly GDP since 2012 and as Donald Trump engages the US in a trade war with China, dragging down global trade volumes and economic growth. Economists warned that the wider global slump raised the chances of a prolonged downturn in Britain and made it more difficult for the UK to rely on trade with other nations to boost the economy after leaving the EU. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU \u201ccouldn\u2019t have come at a worse time\u201d as the world economy slows. \u201cBusinesses remain largely unprepared for a disastrous cliff-edge no deal and are in sit-and-wait mode while business groups continue to speak out against the economic chaos,\u201d he added. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. City economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was worse than expected. Three beat the forecasts. This month there were some bright spots as consumers continued to prop up the UK economy by raising their spending, helped by record employment levels, a relatively steady inflation rate and rising wage growth. Despite expectations of a downturn in sales volumes, consumer spending rose last month by 0.2% from June. UK workers\u2019 average pay packets also rose at the fastest rate in 11 years, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Unemployment rose slightly to 3.9% in a sign that weaker economic growth and the rising risk of a no-deal Brexit could be starting to have an impact on the job market, although the jobless rate still remains at the lowest level since the mid-1970s. Despite the pockets of strength for Britain, the economy plunged into reverse in the second quarter for the first time since 2012. Brexit uncertainty, car plant shutdowns and companies running down their stockpiles built up before the original 29 March deadline led GDP to shrink by 0.2% in the three months to the end of June. Two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 which could only be confirmed after Britain has left the EU when official figures are published in November \u2013 are regarded by economists as the definition of a technical recession. Johnson has begun to increasingly brace the UK economy for no-deal Brexit, ramping up public spending by \u00a32.1bn on preparations including stockpiling of medicines, an extra 500 border officials and a public awareness campaign about disruption. However, the latest snapshot from the public finances showed the prime minister is likely to overshoot the government\u2019s budget target for the year by about \u00a38bn, as he increases public borrowing. Stock markets have been plunged into a tailspin over the past month amid a rise in trade protectionism around the world, which could spell trouble for the UK seeking trade deals outside the EU, analysts said. According to surveys compiled by the research firm IHS Markit from businesses in 44 countries accounting for about 89% of global GDP, world manufacturing output has plunged into recession territory as the US-China trade war weighs on export demand. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, said rising trade tensions were making the climate for British exporters more difficult as the UK prepares to leave the EU. \u201cThe risk of no deal and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit more generally is likely to continue to be a drag on investment and trade. So we are likely to see a growing imbalance in the UK economy alongside very weak growth,\u201d he added.",

This dramatic pivot in Britain\u2019s global orientation is easily overlooked because the contrast in political style between the new prime minister and his predecessor is more conspicuous.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is not a skilful manager, except of expectations. He impressed dignitaries at the G7 summit in Biarritz with a capacity for seriousness that used to come as standard in prime ministers. Johnson sets the bar low, then clears it. He steered a traditional British diplomatic course between Europe and the US. His style is a flattering tribute to Donald Trump but on the substance \u2013 Russia, Iran, the climate emergency \u2013 the UK still sides with Germany and France. That balancing act will be harder outside the EU, and the messier the Brexit, the wobblier the tightrope. Johnson needs a trade deal with Washington. It is the totem pole around which Tory Eurosceptics perform their frenzied anti-Brussels war dances. But Trump does not distinguish between commerce and state power. He will set the price of a deal at total loyalty in foreign affairs and surrender to US corporate interests. The UK must switch regulatory and strategic alignment from European to US standards, and thereby forfeit privileged access to the vast market on its doorstep. Few Brexiteers understand what that means in practice. The UK voice will be heard in Brussels from the wrong side of a closed door \u2013 and in Washington from the end of a tight leash.
