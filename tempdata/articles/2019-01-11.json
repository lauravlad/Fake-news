It\u2019s all there, densely packed into an hour of theatre, hip-hop and spoken word.</p> <p>There\u2019s Musa\u2019s own story of how his life fell apart after the death of his hero, Muhammad Ali. There\u2019s his best mate, out of Goulburn jail and riding a self-destructive streak. There\u2019s the woman he fell in love with \u2013<strong> </strong>inscrutable, captivating<strong> </strong>him as she halves MDMA caps, and breaking his heart when she starts calling him \u201cchamp\u201d.</p> <p>But there\u2019s also the other stuff. The Australia stuff.</p> <p>It\u2019s being told at school that your skin is the colour of shit. It\u2019s being singled out by Mark Latham on Twitter. It\u2019s shock jocks and far-right rallies and riots declaring war on the religion you were raised with. It\u2019s race-baiting by politicians to win elections. It\u2019s learning, Musa says, \u201cwhat it means to be a young brown boy on black land run by white people\u201d.</p> <p>Born and raised in Queanbeyan, the son of Australian arts journalist Helen Musa and Malaysian poet and actor Musa bin Masran, Musa is a confident performer who can hold the stage on his own with little more than a sonorous voice and evocative writing (the river is a recurring motif that he invokes memorably with just a few lines of poetry, and a flowing movement of his hands).</p> <p>But sitting in the gloom of the empty theatre before the second night of his show, he admits to feeling conflicted about the work.</p> <p>\u201cSince Ali Died is based on autobiography but still it\u2019s fictive, conflating several people into one character. What I like to do with a lot of my work is take autobiographical elements and heighten them to the level of some type of myth \u2013 sometimes almost like a fairytale.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s fucking scary because, having said all of that, you are still putting your life out on show, your pain and grief \u2013 and the dark side of yourself. It\u2019s a very vulnerable, dangerous spot and I\u2019m still not sure how it makes me feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97361c72d5718a1486b07e45aff3273830335e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97361c72d5718a1486b07e45aff3273830335e42/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You are risking your sanity, you are risking your life every time you get on stage.\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You are risking your sanity, you are risking your life every time you get on stage.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Catto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The work was first performed last year, to rapturous public response.

I see art and writing as dangerous. I have made the mistake of thinking art is the best type of therapy. I can only present my words in a confident way because I have gone through a fire to make the work \u2013 but it\u2019s all on unsteady foundations.\u201d</p> <p>Omar has been writing and performing for more than a decade; he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/05/omar-musa-dead-centre-review-a-vital-if-uneven-slice-of-hip-hop-and-poetry\">recorded albums</a>, written a novel \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/23/here-come-the-dogs-by-omar-musa-review-street-poetry-committed-to-the-page\">Here Come The Dogs</a> \u2013 and books of poetry, and performs as a slam poet. The play, his first, is directed by Anthea Williams, who Omar says \u201cwas able to identify some of the chaotic threads in my work\u201d, and found a way to bring them together in one story. The pair spent ten intensive days nutting out a structure that combines rap performance with prose, and poetry with theatre.</p> <p>But for all the praise and his increasing reach, Musa says he has grown ambivalent about writing and performing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this play will live much longer than this year,\u201d Musa says. \u201cIt\u2019s painful, it\u2019s difficult to dredge all that personal stuff up again night after night, when you are trying to write a new chapter in your life and put some of this stuff behind you.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just not professional enough to be more detached from it but I feel so depleted. Art destroys you as much as it fulfils you \u2013 even more \u2013 which is why I\u2019m getting to a point where I might even give it up.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitates before qualifying this: \u201cI would never be able to fully give it up \u2013 it\u2019s within me. I want to do another novel. But making my passion into my profession, I sometimes wonder if that\u2019s a big misstep. It feels like the audience is getting more out of it than I am and, as the audience is getting bigger and bigger, I\u2019m getting smaller and smaller \u2013 and one day, am I just going to vanish into thin air? And what was it worth? Do I have to sacrifice my mind and life and my liver and my everything to make art? Maybe it\u2019s better if I just go and tend to a garden in Borneo \u2013 grow eggplants and chillies.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Musa is seriously considering spending more time in the archipelago, \u201ctowards Malaysia, towards Borneo, towards Indonesia\u201d, he says.</p> <p>He recently stayed with his father in<strong> </strong>Sabah, Borneo. Each day \u201cyou just trundle down to the local restaurants, grab a plate of kway teow, squeeze a calamansi lime over it, have an iced lime tea, sip on that \u2013 get a nice mangostein, the princess of the fruits, or the king of the fruits: a durian.\u201d</p> <p>Writing comes easy there, he says. \u201cThe humidity ignites my creative mind.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg24XX8PweI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gg24XX8PweI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But one also gets the sense that, at 35, Musa has not only grown weary of Australia\u2019s rolling culture wars, but of being betwixt and between. \u201cI\u2019m Australian-Malaysian \u2013 I am in between. I will be forever stuck on the hyphen. You have access to different identities and different eyes, but it can also be very dislocating.

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Liverpool\u2019s players would question his sanity if he criticised them after two consecutive defeats and they can demonstrate at Brighton on Saturday there is no insecurity in the Anfield ranks. The Premier League leaders have suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time this season. Manchester City ended Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten league campaign before Wolves knocked them out of the FA Cup, although the manager insists there is no cause for alarm or inquests into the difficult start to 2019. Klopp said: \u201cYou don\u2019t lose a game in the first part of the season and then lose your head. That would be strange. That would be bad and in general not the right thing to do. This is a moment where your team could sit in the dressing room and really think: \u2018Is he mad?\u2019 because it was not that bad. We talk about Man City and it was what, 11mm? Not a lot from getting a point and a brilliant result. Then we go to Wolves and I make the changes. That says more about me than the team, so let\u2019s carry on. It\u2019s a normal situation, it\u2019s still very positive. \u201cIf you point the finger then it becomes even bigger. There\u2019s no reason for doing it. Nothing happened, each team in the world can lose at Man City. We spoke about why, what we did, what happened and what we could have done better of course, but that\u2019s how we do it always. \u201cIt\u2019s only people who are insecure who would say we are going in completely the other direction and have lost belief. We have to prove it [that is not the case] on the pitch again.\u201d Klopp has won only eight of his 26 matches in January as the Liverpool manager but insists there is no recurring problem. \u201cI don\u2019t see a specific reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve lost one Premier League game in January and that was Manchester City away. That\u2019s not a sign of a bad record in January. It\u2019s just a sign of a really difficult game. I\u2019ve never felt bad in January. It\u2019s just that December is a tough month to go through for all of us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Solanke believes young English players are increasingly unwilling to wait for their chance to prove themselves at the biggest clubs in the country and will follow his example, as well as that of Jadon Sancho, by leaving in order to find first-team football. Solanke completed a \u00a317m move from Liverpool to Bournemouth last week, a fee that is somewhat remarkable given the 21-year-old\u2019s playing record \u2013 one 17-minute substitute appearance for Chelsea in October 2014 followed by 21 appearances, 16 of which came off the bench, and only one goal scored for Liverpool having moved there in May 2017. He did score seven goals in 25 Eredivisie appearances during a loan spell at Vitesse Arnhem, while at Chelsea, and was also a key part of the England Under-20 squad who won the World Cup in 2017. As such, he backs himself to be a success at Bournemouth and views his decision to join Eddie Howe\u2019s side as part of a wider trend that began when Sancho moved from Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund two summers ago. The winger was deemed by some to have taken a risk but he has thrived at the Bundesliga leaders and has gone on to become part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior setup. \u201cThat [Sancho\u2019s success at Dortmund] has affected everyone,\u201d said Solanke, who has one England cap. \u201cWhen one young player sees another young player doing that they think they can do it as well, especially when everyone is playing at international level together. Sancho is doing well in Germany and a lot of players would like to follow his path. What he\u2019s done, getting into the England team at such a young age, it will influence a lot of young players.\u201d Callum Hudson-Odoi could become the next young domestic talent to leave one of England\u2019s biggest clubs in order to gain first-team football, with the 18-year-old Chelsea winger the subject of a \u00a335m bid from Bayern Munich and supposedly keen to make the switch given he has yet to start a Premier League game for Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side. \u201cI think every footballer just wants to play,\u201d said Solanke when commenting on his own lack of opportunities at Stamford Bridge, as well as at Anfield. \u201cYou want to show what you can do and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to playing here.\u201d Solanke will have to wait for that opportunity given he is still recovering from the muscle injury that meant a move to Crystal Palace fell through at the start of the month. In contrast, Nathaniel Clyne is already up and running for Bournemouth having also joined the club from Liverpool on a loan deal that runs until the end of the season. The right-back started last week\u2019s FA Cup third-round defeat to Brighton and is in line to do the same against Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday. Like Solanke, Clyne is enthused by the prospect of regular first-team football at Bournemouth having struggled for that at Anfield. Speaking alongside the striker on Friday, the 27-year-old also dismissed claims from Neil Warnock that he had already agreed to join Cardiff before moving to the south coast. Warnock last week accused Liverpool of \u201clacking class\u201d over Clyne\u2019s situation before going on to describe himself as \u201cdisappointed\u201d, having given the player his first taste of first-team football while manager of Crystal Palace in 2008. \u201cNothing was agreed,\u201d insisted Clyne. \u201cIt was just talks, really, between my agent and the clubs, and ultimately I made the decision to come to Bournemouth.

      "body": "<p>It was the moment that enshrined Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r into Manchester United legend. David Beckham\u2019s corner, Teddy Sheringham\u2019s flick and, well, you know the rest. What has remained a secret until now was that up in the Camp Nou directors\u2019 box \u2013 following an outrageous piece of blagging \u2013 was Mauricio Pochettino. And when Solskj\u00e6r did what he did, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/may/26/newsstory.sport\" title=\"\">to win the 1999 Champions League final</a> against Bayern Munich, Pochettino found himself celebrating as crazily as any United fan.</p> <p>The way the Tottenham manager tells it, he was simply carried along by the emotion of the moment. Pochettino was an Espanyol player at the time and, together with his teammate, Toni Jim\u00e9nez \u2013 who is now the goalkeeper coach at Spurs \u2013 he had watched the first half from seats that were not so great. And so he and his partner-in-crime decided to upgrade.</p> <p>They were on the same level as the VIP area and they hopped from block to block until they got there. Remarkably, they spied two padded seats that were empty, jumped into them and, even more remarkably, they were not moved on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/11/manchester-united-fans-solskjaer-pochettino-who-should-be-permanent-manager\">Manchester United fans on who they want as the permanent manager</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe sat, like this,\u201d Pochettino says, making like the meekest of boys. \u201cThen, the second half started and we watched it from there \u2013 the presidents\u2019 [area]. When Sheringham scored for 1-1 in the last minute, we said: 'Wow, amazing game, now injury-time.' And then when Solskj\u00e6r scored, we were celebrating. How I shouted for a Manchester United goal was incredible! I don\u2019t know why because in that moment, we were neutral. But the atmosphere was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>It is a story that resonates particularly loudly because on Sunday at Wembley, Pochettino\u2019s Spurs take on a United team that has been re-energised under the caretaker management of Solskj\u00e6r. And, of course, there is the small matter of who may be given the United job on a permanent basis in the summer.</p> <p>Could it yet be Solskj\u00e6r, who has won his first five matches \u2013 albeit against low-ranking opposition \u2013 but, perhaps more importantly, has reacquainted United with a sense of adventure and fun? The Spurs game is his first major test. Were he to triumph, it would certainly help his case.</p> <p>Or could it be Pochettino, whom United and Sir Alex Ferguson have in their sights? Ferguson, now back to health and influence, had advanced Pochettino\u2019s candidacy in 2016, post Louis van Gaal, only for the Glazers to prefer the surer thing of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.</p> <p>Pochettino wears his vanity more appealingly than Mourinho these days and since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/18/jose-mourinho-exits-old-trafford-manchester-united-sack-manager\" title=\"\">the Old Trafford sacking</a> of a man that he counts as a friend, he has been cute, playful and frankly mischievous at various times with regard to the stories linking him with United at the end of the season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&amp;title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&amp;description=&amp;link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&amp;link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&amp;link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&amp;link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&amp;link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&amp;link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\" data-alt=\"Social media\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/linker-embed/v1/index.html?vertical=sport&title=Guardian%20sport%20on%20social%20media&description=&link-1-headline=Follow%20us%20on%20Twitter&link-1-url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fguardian_sport&link-2-headline=Like%20us%20on%20Facebook&link-2-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardiansport&link-3-headline=Find%20us%20on%20Instagram&link-3-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fguardian_sport%2F&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fguardianfootball\">Social media</a> </figure>  <p>It is a soap opera that promises to run and run, although Pochettino played it straight for a change on Friday at his pre-match press conference when he stressed that Premier League points were the only thing on his mind. He looked positively flabbergasted when asked whether his players had joked with him about the United job. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are too respectful.\u201d</p> <p>There has been the temptation to bill the game as Pochettino versus Solskj\u00e6r, with the winner taking all, but that is not only glib, it is incorrect. It is so for several reasons and the biggest one is a man called Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman who, if United come calling for Pochettino, will make it unbelievably difficult for them to take him.</p> <p>There was a time when United would have who they wanted from Spurs \u2013 Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov, even if the latter\u2019s move came after tortuous negotiations. Ferguson infamously described the business of dealing with Levy as \u201cmore painful than my hip replacement\u201d.</p> <p>There has since been a shift in the relationship between the clubs and not only because Spurs finished above United in 2014, 2016 and 2017. As Pochettino noted, the economic landscape of the Premier League has shifted, making all of the clubs more financially powerful and able to resist unwanted overtures from the bigger ones.</p> <p>Levy has long been a nightmare to deal with but now it can be close to impossible. United, for example, wanted to take Eric Dier from Spurs in 2017.

      "bodyText": "It was the moment that enshrined Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r into Manchester United legend. David Beckham\u2019s corner, Teddy Sheringham\u2019s flick and, well, you know the rest. What has remained a secret until now was that up in the Camp Nou directors\u2019 box \u2013 following an outrageous piece of blagging \u2013 was Mauricio Pochettino. And when Solskj\u00e6r did what he did, to win the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich, Pochettino found himself celebrating as crazily as any United fan. The way the Tottenham manager tells it, he was simply carried along by the emotion of the moment. Pochettino was an Espanyol player at the time and, together with his teammate, Toni Jim\u00e9nez \u2013 who is now the goalkeeper coach at Spurs \u2013 he had watched the first half from seats that were not so great. And so he and his partner-in-crime decided to upgrade. They were on the same level as the VIP area and they hopped from block to block until they got there. Remarkably, they spied two padded seats that were empty, jumped into them and, even more remarkably, they were not moved on. \u201cWe sat, like this,\u201d Pochettino says, making like the meekest of boys. \u201cThen, the second half started and we watched it from there \u2013 the presidents\u2019 [area]. When Sheringham scored for 1-1 in the last minute, we said: 'Wow, amazing game, now injury-time.' And then when Solskj\u00e6r scored, we were celebrating. How I shouted for a Manchester United goal was incredible! I don\u2019t know why because in that moment, we were neutral. But the atmosphere was amazing.\u201d It is a story that resonates particularly loudly because on Sunday at Wembley, Pochettino\u2019s Spurs take on a United team that has been re-energised under the caretaker management of Solskj\u00e6r. And, of course, there is the small matter of who may be given the United job on a permanent basis in the summer. Could it yet be Solskj\u00e6r, who has won his first five matches \u2013 albeit against low-ranking opposition \u2013 but, perhaps more importantly, has reacquainted United with a sense of adventure and fun? The Spurs game is his first major test. Were he to triumph, it would certainly help his case. Or could it be Pochettino, whom United and Sir Alex Ferguson have in their sights? Ferguson, now back to health and influence, had advanced Pochettino\u2019s candidacy in 2016, post Louis van Gaal, only for the Glazers to prefer the surer thing of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Pochettino wears his vanity more appealingly than Mourinho these days and since the Old Trafford sacking of a man that he counts as a friend, he has been cute, playful and frankly mischievous at various times with regard to the stories linking him with United at the end of the season. It is a soap opera that promises to run and run, although Pochettino played it straight for a change on Friday at his pre-match press conference when he stressed that Premier League points were the only thing on his mind. He looked positively flabbergasted when asked whether his players had joked with him about the United job. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are too respectful.\u201d There has been the temptation to bill the game as Pochettino versus Solskj\u00e6r, with the winner taking all, but that is not only glib, it is incorrect. It is so for several reasons and the biggest one is a man called Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman who, if United come calling for Pochettino, will make it unbelievably difficult for them to take him. There was a time when United would have who they wanted from Spurs \u2013 Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov, even if the latter\u2019s move came after tortuous negotiations. Ferguson infamously described the business of dealing with Levy as \u201cmore painful than my hip replacement\u201d. There has since been a shift in the relationship between the clubs and not only because Spurs finished above United in 2014, 2016 and 2017. As Pochettino noted, the economic landscape of the Premier League has shifted, making all of the clubs more financially powerful and able to resist unwanted overtures from the bigger ones. Levy has long been a nightmare to deal with but now it can be close to impossible. United, for example, wanted to take Eric Dier from Spurs in 2017. There was never any possibility of Levy sanctioning the departure of a player he wanted to keep. \u201cDaniel is, as you know very well, so tough to negotiate with,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cFor different clubs in England to do business with him, it\u2019s so difficult.\u201d Pochettino, unusually, does not have an agent and he negotiated the new five-year contract he signed last May directly with Levy. Not unusually, he thought that he did a good job. \u201cFor me, if there was one person that was easy to do business with, it was Daniel,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think it was more difficult for him than me because I am the manager and he cannot upset me.\u201d If United or Real Madrid were to try to take Pochettino in the summer, it is likely that the dynamics of any negotiation between him and Levy would be different. In Levy\u2019s favour would be the length of Pochettino\u2019s contract and, crucially, the absence of a buyout clause in it. As recent history has shown, Tottenham talent does not get away from Levy without a fight or, in some instances, by playing an ugly game of brinkmanship. Just ask Berbatov. Or Luka Modric and Gareth Bale. If Pochettino does want a new challenge, he may have to ask himself just how hard he is prepared to push for it. Levy has been here before with some of his players and, although it would be a new experience with a manager, he would approach it with trademark iron fists. Ferguson knows this better than anyone.

He spent much of the summit repeating misdirections about the need for a border wall. \u2022The apparent reversal came as hundreds of thousands of workers went without pay. Miami airport closed a terminal due to a lack of TSA staff, who have been hit by the shutdown. The House passed a bill which would guarantee workers backpay, which Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Trump would sign. \u2022But despite Trump urging Democrats to vote, there does not seem an easy way out of the impasse. Democrats have insisted they will not fund the wall, which they say is unnecessary. They believe the $5.7bn would be better spent on other border measures. The White House has released this video from the meeting where Trump ditched his national emergency plan. It\u2019s full of the same spurious statements and misdirection that has characterized Trump\u2019s wall sale pitch. There is a guy wearing a cowboy hat though. Trump will likely be embarrassed about ending his very public pursuit of a national emergency. But spare a thought for Lindsey Graham, Trump foe-turned-Trump-sycophant, who was faithfully tagging along with the president\u2019s national emergency line as recently as... two hours ago. It\u2019s extra embarrassing for Graham given he had been skeptical earlier this week about whether an emergency declaration would work, before shifting behind the idea. Oops! More news is coming out re Trump\u2019s national emergency reversal. According to numerous reporters Trump said this at his cabinet meeting today: \u201cThis is where I ask the Democrats to come back to Washington and vote for money for the wall, the barrier. I don\u2019t care what they name it. They can name it peaches.\u201d That\u2019s quite a turnaround from Trump. On Thursday Trump was said to be consulting with lawyers over declaring a national emergency to appropriate money for the border wall \u2013 which would allow him to bypass Democrats in Congress. He claimed his lawyers had told him such a declaration would hold up to legal scrutiny \u201c100%\u201d. \u201cI have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. \u201cI haven\u2019t done it yet, I may do it. If this doesn\u2019t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.\u201d Now Trump is urging Democrats to \u201ccome back and vote\u201d \u2013 rather than attempting to go round them. \u201cWe want Congress to do its job,\u201d Trump said on Friday. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions that he would be able to declare an emergency, legal scholars have questioned the president\u2019s right to take such action. That legal ambiguity could have contributed to this about turn from Trump. Donald Trump said on Friday that he does not plan to declare a national emergency \u2013 a day after suggesting he would \u201cprobably\u201d do so. Speaking at a cabinet meeting over the government shutdown and the border wall, Trump said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re not looking to do right now is national emergency.\u201d The president instead urged Democrats to \u201ccome back and vote\u201d in Congress in a bid to end the government shutdown. Trump insisted he had the right to declare an emergency, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it so fast\u201d, according to a White House pool reporter. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has \u201cno evidence\u201d of remaining cancer, the Supreme Court said on Friday. In a statement the court said: \u201cPost-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required.\u201d Ginsburg had surgery in December to remove two nodules from her lung. \u201cJustice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments,\u201d the court said. Steve King, the Republican congressman and Trump ally who on Thursday said he didn\u2019t understand why the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was offensive, has declared himself an \u201cAmerican nationalist\u201d in a House speech. In an interview with the New York Times King had said: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d In his speech on Friday King did not dispute the quote. He said he was \u201can advocate for Western values\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve never been anti-immigrant, I\u2019ve been anti-illegal immigrant and I remain that way,\u201d King said. He described himself as \u201can advocate for western civilization\u2019s values\u201d and said: \u201cUnder any fair political definition, I am simply an American nationalist.\u201d He added: \u201cThis conviction does not make me a white nationalist or white supremacist.\u201d King, who has long been criticized for statements perceived as racist, had drawn ire for telling the New York Times: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d He added: \u201cWhy did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u201d The president\u2019s first born son has been tweeting some sage advice in the middle of the government shutdown... Oh no wait: he\u2019s actually been re-posting this video of a CNN figure getting run over by a golf cart. Donald Trump has not built a single mile of new wall so far. Also this is stretching the definition of \u2018beautiful\u2019. The House has passed a bill which would guarantee backpay to federal workers who have been impacted by the shutdown. The measure passed in the Senate last night. According to Mitch McConnell, Trump has said he will sign it. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers went unpaid today. Senate Democrats are also drafting a bill which would ensure government contractors, who have gone unpaid during the shutdown, would also get their money. S&amp;P Global estimate that the border wall shutdown has already cost the economy $3.6bn, and in another two weeks will have cost $6bn. Keen watchers will note that $6bn is more than the $5.7bn that Trump is demanding to build the wall. \u201cWe estimated that this shutdown could shave approximately $1.2 billion off real GDP in the quarter for each week that part of the government is closed,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, S&amp;P\u2019s chief US economist, said in a widely circulated memo. \u201cThat may seem like pennies for the world\u2019s biggest economy, but it means a lot to those workers trying to cover their household costs without their paychecks.\u201d According to CNBC, Wells Fargo estimates the shutdown could be costing as much as $2bn a week. An apparent response from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to that Politico article... citing hirsute British graphic novelist Alan Moore. Moore is known for his work on comic books such as Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Donald Trump\u2019s on deck, performing his greatest hits. Featuring Cryin\u2019 Chuck, Wall, and So Much Other Big Trouble. A terminal at Miami International airport will be closed this weekend due to a lack of Transportation Security Administration workers. Security checkpoints at Terminal G, one of six at the airport, will close at 1pm Saturday, reopen on Sunday morning, then shut again at 1pm on Sunday afternoon. Travelers are also being encouraged to arrive extra early \u201cdue to uncertainties created by the lapse in federal government funding\u201d. \u201cWe felt we had to make a decision before the weekend,\u201d said Greg Chin. \u201cThey\u2019re erring on the side of caution.\u201d Chin said if the shutdown continues the airport may have to close checkpoints at two more terminals. A statement on the Miami airport website suggests checking TSA.gov for more info, but the TSA website has not been updated since December 21 \u2013 due to the shutdown. Democrats are apparently trying to rein in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, using an approach which Politico says is \u201cpart carrot, part stick\u201d. But at the same time, many are fearful of the New Yorker, with some reportedly comparing her influence to that of Donald Trump. Lawmakers and aides are said to be urging Ocasio-Cortez to rein in her attacks on fellow Democrats \u2013 in November the congresswoman said she would support an effort to recruit left-leaning primary challengers to incumbents \u2013 and warning her she needs to play along to get along. Democratic congressman Emanuel Cleaver told Politico that he was \u201csure Ms. Cortez means well, but there\u2019s almost an outstanding rule: Don\u2019t attack your own people\u201d. He added: \u201cWe just don\u2019t need sniping in our Democratic Caucus.\u201d Two House Democratic sources compared her use of Twitter to Donald Trump\u2019s. Just as congressional Republicans constantly withhold criticism of the president out of fear he\u2019ll unleash a tweet at them, some Democrats have done the same with Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cPeople are afraid of her,\u201d said one senior Democratic aide. The latest edition of the Guardian\u2019s podcast, Today in Focus, addresses the shutdown. Tune in to hear Lauren Gambino, in Washington DC, and Bryan Mealer, in Texas, discuss how Trump\u2019s central campaign promise has led to this point of paralysis. So what\u2019s Trump up to this morning? So far, he\u2019s continuing the lie that Mexico is paying for the border wall. According to the non-partisan factcheck.org (and numerous other fact checkers) this is false. But here we go: Later on \u2013 at 2.30pm \u2013 Trump will be holding a public cabinet meeting about border security. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the day\u2019s politics news. Hundreds of thousands of people will miss their paychecks today as the government shutdown rolls on. It\u2019s the first payday that federal workers will forego due to the impasse. That comes as the deadlock between Donald Trump and Democratic leaders over $5.7bn funding for a border wall shows no sign of coming to an end. Trump is continuing to explore options which don\u2019t require negotiation, however. Specifically, the president is exploring a national emergency declaration, which would enable him to swipe government money without the approval of Congress. According to reports, Trump fancies taking money for his wall from money earmarked for disaster recovery. He could nab funding from the Army Corps of Engineers budget. The Washington Post says Trump \u201chas urged the Army Corps\u201d to determine how quickly they can get building contracts signed. In other news, the US has begun withdrawing troops from Syria. A spokesman for the US-led coalition against Isis said the withdrawl had begun but offered no further details. Trump surprised many with his abrupt announcement of the pull out last month.",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s match report from a feisty night at Elland Road. Thanks for joining me. Goodnight! Here\u2019s more from Ben Fisher on Jack Clarke, and nine other EFL teenagers to watch: Marcelo Bielsa speaks, via an interpreter: \u201cThis was a very impressive win, after losing our last two league games. We had to defend very well, which we did, and this made it easier to win the game.\u201d Pressed further on \u2018spygate\u2019, he says \u201cit\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand the situation. If for English football, this is unacceptable behaviour, then I have to accept it, because I work here. I have to accept that in this country, it\u2019s not common, but it doesn\u2019t mean I am someone who cheats.\u201d When asked if he would consider doing it again, he says \u201cI\u2019ve explained myself very well, so you can draw your own conclusions.\u201d Here\u2019s Leeds captain Liam Cooper: \u201cWe wanted to start on the front foot and I think we did that. The intensity we play at is hard to sustain sometimes, but we did it. I was a bit tired for the last 15 minutes [after coming back from injury]. It\u2019s always nice to win on a Friday night. Bielsa has got us believing, and coming into work with a smile on our face. We\u2019re all behind him.\u201d Waghorn picks up a late booking before the referee calls time. Leeds are five points clear at the top of the Championship! 93 mins: Leeds are still chasing everything down, giving Derby nothing to work with. 91 mins: Holmes hares after a loose ball to the right of goal, but the unflappable Jansson slides in to clear behind. 90 mins: Four added minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re top of the league\u201d is the factually accurate chant from the home fans. 88 mins: Leeds win a couple of corners, but Hernandez can\u2019t pick out a white shirt with his deliveries. 85 mins: Leeds win a free kick in midfield, but Hernandez overhits his diagonal pass. Time is ticking away for Derby. \u201cShackleton is on for Leeds? You can put the result on ice now\u201d honks Peter Oh. 82 mins: Roofe pounces on a Tomori error, and his shot rebounds towards Hernandez, who fires a volley into the side netting. Leeds should be out of sight. 80 mins: Alioski swings in a cross that Hernandez connects with \u2013 but his shot is scuffed wide. At the other end, Lawrence has a pot-shot that flies into the stands. 78 mins: Clarke is heading off, and gets a huge ovation. His crosses led to both Leeds goals and he was a constant menace down the right. He\u2019s replaced by Leif Davis, who celebrates his 18th birthday tomorrow. 75 mins: Derby get a free kick and their centre-backs get forward, but Mason Mount\u2019s ball in is underpowered and Leeds clear. 74 mins: After tenacious work from Nugent in the Leeds area, Bryson\u2019s shot is deflected into the path of Waghorn \u2013 but he\u2019s flagged offside as he shapes to shoot. 72 mins: Martyn Waghorn is on, replacing Jack Marriott, who couldn\u2019t get himself into the game. 71 mins: Holmes is crowded out by Hernandez, and then Alioski \u2013 both willowy wingers before Bielsa rocked up at Elland Road. 70 mins: Clarke, the standout performer so far on his first league start, motors down the right again and pings a fierce low cross that Roofe just can\u2019t get a boot to. Clarke, by the way, was born in November 2000. 69 mins: Shackleton gets into space down the right \u2013 Leeds have attacked that area all night \u2013 and fires a cross-shot across goal. Derby showing little sign of getting back into this. 67 mins: Leeds win a corner as Tomori blocks Roofe\u2019s shot. Jansson, having his shirt pulled by Keogh, tries to meet it at the near post, but puts his header wide. 65 mins: If VAR were in force here, Leeds may well have had two penalties, but their goalkeeper could have been sent off. 64 mins: Substitution for Leeds, as Shackleton replaces goalscorer Harrison. 62 mins: Duane Holmes flicks the ball over Ayling and challenges Peacock-Farrell, who collects it \u2013 but boots Holmes in the face in the process! I don\u2019t think it was intentional, but the keeper could have easily been sent off regardless \u2013 it was Man\u00e9-on-Ederson-esque. 61 mins: A second change for Derby, as Florian Jozefzoon replaces George Evans, who was booked in the first half. 60 mins: Klich and Roofe combine but Derby clear, only to concede a free kick in the centre circle. Leeds come forward again and Clarke swings in a cross, but it\u2019s too close to Carson. 58 mins: We\u2019ve cut away to Gareth Southgate and England U21 coach Aidy Boothroyd in the crowd. If it stays like this, Leeds are going five points clear \u2013 and seven ahead of third-placed Sheffield United. Replays show that Lawrence got none of the ball, and stood on Hernandez\u2019s foot. The referee was right behind it; I\u2019m not sure how he hasn\u2019t given a penalty. 53 mins: After a scrappy spell, Clarke is again the danger man, wriggling past Tomori and cutting back to Hernandez, who is challenged by Lawrence in the area... ... from which Peacock-Farrell, some 2.5 Neuers off his line, is almost embarrassed by Nugent! The keeper shanks into touch, and looks mighty relieved. 49 mins: Harrison skitters through the Derby defence, but tries to pass when he could have shot, and the visitors break... Jack Clarke causes more problems down the right, and his deep cross threatens to loop over Carson and in. The goalkeeper gets a touch, but it drops to Alioski, and his prod across goal is swept in by Jack Harrison! And Leeds have doubled their lead almost immediately! We\u2019re back under way, with David Nugent replacing Andre Wisdom. Unless Nugent is slotting in at right-back, that will mean a change of system... After the dramatic build-up, that was a rather one-sided first half. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s biggest worry would have been Leeds not adding to that Kemar Roofe goal. That, and whether Lampard spots the webcam in the Derby dressing room. Honk! Don\u2019t forget, you can follow all the latest transfers with our shiny interactive: The full story on Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s surprise \u2018spygate\u2019 confession: Leeds have a last-gasp corner, which Hernandez swings straight at Carson. Still, Leeds are ahead at the break. 47 mins: The temperature\u2019s rising late in the half, Leeds players not happy with Derby\u2019s agricultural approach there. Both Holmes and Evans are booked. 46 mins: Lowe crosses towards Marriott, who is bullied off the ball by Jansson. The defender charges forward, and is clattered first by Holmes, and then by George Evans! 45 mins: Replays show that both Ayling and Cooper were grappling with Derby players, both grabbing fistfuls of shirt as the ball came in. That\u2019s a risky move. 44 mins: The forward peels off towards the near post but mistimes his header, sending the ball into Roofe\u2019s path. Marriott appeals for a penalty, but that would have been very harsh. 43 mins: Derby win a corner, seeking an unlikely equaliser before half-time. It\u2019s held up by grappling between Alioski and Marriott... 42 mins: Derby\u2019s best opening so far, the visitors breaking as Leeds lose possession. Lawrence shapes to shoot but instead plays in Mason Mount on the left of the area. He takes a touch, but sees Ayling slide in to block his shot! 40 mins: Forshaw, pulling the strings in midfield, starts another move that ends with Clarke\u2019s low cross, which is cut out by Carson. 39 mins: Leeds stroke the ball around in front of the Derby defence, before Forshaw shoots from 25 yards out. It has Carson worried, but flies a foot wide of the far post. 37 mins: Hernandez\u2019s low ball into the near post finds Luke Ayling, who scuffs his shot wide. 36 mins: Bryson is penalised for handball, as Derby continue to struggle with Leeds\u2019 high intensity. The commentary team have reminded me of this World Cup spying saga. Improbably enough, it\u2019s the second one in a matter of months to involve a Pontus Jansson team... 34 mins: Tom Lawrence, more than capable of a long-range screamer, takes aim from distance but sends his shot high and wide. 32 mins: Leeds continue to cause problems down the flanks, with Alioski whipping in a cross that beats the Derby defence, but is just too quick for Clarke in the middle. 30 mins: Leeds have won every game where they\u2019ve scored first in the league this season; Derby have won five games from behind, the most in the division. Something\u2019s got to give. 29 mins: Alioski is penalised for a foul on Holmes, but Derby do nothing with the free kick. 28 mins: Harrison attempts to steer a header into the far corner, but it\u2019s at an awkward height and Carson collects. 27 mins: Keogh tries to break forward from defence but is quickly engulfed by white shirts. Guardian political correspondent weighs in on Spygate: 24 mins: Dazzling stuff from Clarke, who collects a diagonal pass from Forshaw on his chest and juggles the ball beyond a defender. He can\u2019t apply the finish, though, sending his shot wide. 22 mins: Derby, resolutely defensive thus far, will need to venture forward now. Leeds\u2019 recent results should give them encouragement \u2013 they\u2019ve conceded at least two goals in all their last five matches. A deserved lead for the hosts, and Scott Carson may have to take some of the blame for a weak punch clear. It was expertly set up by Clarke though, and ruthlessly finished at the near post by Roofe. The young winger motors down the right beyond Bryson and sweeps a low cross into Kemar Roofe, who slams a near-post shot into the net! 19 mins: Leeds corner, which Hernandez swings in towards Cooper. Carson punches clear, but it lands at the feet of Jack Clarke... 18 mins: Bryson picks the ball up in midfield, but has a lack of options upfield and his attempted waft up to Marriott is ineffective. 16 mins: Elland Road is rocking, but the free kick into the box is a big disappointment. Derby break but the move peters out. 14 mins: Alioski races forward from his left-back position to dispossess Andre Wisdom. He is unceremoniously upended by the Derby man, who goes in the book. 13 mins: Leeds continue to camp in the Derby half as the home fans twirl their scarves in the air. Just lacking that killer pass at the moment. Two things are bugging me about this whole Bielsa business. 1. Has this great managerial innovator not heard of drones and/or television? 2. Do Bielsa teams not largely play the same way regardless of opposition? Leeds are charging and pressing around in the usual style here, that\u2019s for sure. 10 mins: Ayling prods a pass through to Roofe, whose off-balance effort is easily collected by Carson. Charles Antaki chimes in on Spygate: \u201cFor cast-iron insurance against failure, all a club need do now is kit out one of their staff in camouflage, give them a pair of binoculars (need not be real) and get them to skulk about in the training ground undergrowth before the big game. Heavy defeat? \u201cGuy in the bushes\u201d. Beats \u201cif only there were VAR\u201d as the next modern cliche.\u201d 8 mins: Oooooh, what a chance! The corner skims across the six-yard line and Cooper gets a toe to it, but can\u2019t keep it under the bar. A strong start by the hosts... 7 mins: It\u2019s cleared but Leeds come again, and Harrison\u2019s cross from the left is chopped behind by Richard Keogh. 6 mins: Roofe is working hard up top for Leeds, and forces Tomori into conceding a corner... 4 mins: Marriott gets on the ball for Derby, but is dealt with by Pontus Jansson. The Leeds fans appear to be singing \u201cwe\u2019ll spy when we want\u201d, which is to be encouraged. Alioski pounces on a defensive error from Wisdom, who then bundles the Leeds man over! Referee Andy Davies points to the spot, but the assistant has flagged offside. After a quick chat, Derby are let off the hook. There\u2019s just one problem \u2013 Alioski wasn\u2019t offside. Dear oh dear. Here we go \u2013 Leeds charge forward, and Alioski goes over in the area... An extremely businesslike handshake between Bielsa and Lampard. All a bit awkward. Kick-off is seconds away! \u201cFrank is looking for an excuse in case Derby lose\u201d says Frank Downes. \u201cHow is it illegal or against the rules to watch training on public land?\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting it\u2019s illegal \u2013 just that it\u2019s, you know, not cool. Although in my impromptu poll, 57% reckon it\u2019s fine. You unscrupulous bunch. Have your say! Marcelo Bielsa is sorry that Derby were upset, but says eavesdropping on training sessions is not against the rules. The steam from Frank Lampard\u2019s ears told its own story. What do you think? Crikey. After all that drama, easy to forget there\u2019s a game on. Here are the teams: Naughty Leeds (4-1-4-1): Peacock-Farrell; Ayling, Cooper, Jansson, Alioski; Forshaw; Harrison, Klich, Hernandez, Clarke; Roofe. Subs: Huffer, Davis, Halme, Shackleton, Gotts, Stevens, Roberts. Mardy Derby (4-3-3): Carson; Wisdom, Keogh, Tomori, Lowe; Bryson, Evans, Mount; Holmes, Marriott, Lawrence. Subs: Roos, Waghorn, Jozefzoon, Nugent, Bogle, Huddlestone, Malone. Frank Lampard gives his thoughts. He\u2019s accepted Bielsa owning up, but it clearly still fuming: \u201cOn a sporting level, it\u2019s bad, in my opinion. Talking about \u2018I did it somewhere else, it\u2019s fine\u2019 \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work for me. It\u2019s disrupted our preparations. Police had to come to the training ground, so that was disruptive. \u201cWe were training on team tactics, shape, personnel, and the fact that Harry Wilson wasn\u2019t training. He\u2019s admitted it, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any further action \u2013 but we had a guy in the bushes before we played Leeds earlier this season, and we lost 4-1.\u201d Marcelo Bielsa has spoken to Sky, via an interpreter. He has taken full responsibility for the spying incident, and apologised to Frank Lampard. \u201cIt\u2019s true, there was someone from Leeds there. The responsibility for this incident is mine. It doesn\u2019t matter if this is legal or illegal, right or wrong \u2026 for me it\u2019s enough that Frank Lampard and Derby County were unhappy, to show that I didn\u2019t behave well. Yesterday I talked to Frank and he told me I didn\u2019t respect his club. I have a different point of view, but the important thing is what he and Derby think. \u201cI\u2019m the only one responsible for it, I didn\u2019t ask Leeds for permission to do that. I\u2019ve been using this kind of practice since the World Cup qualifiers with Argentina. This is not unlawful, we\u2019ve done it publicly, we talk about it in the press, for some people it\u2019s the wrong thing to do \u2013 for others it\u2019s not.\u201d Good evening. A rivalry that has been slowly cooling down for over 40 years is heating up again, fuelled by a furious promotion race and ignited today by an old-fashioned spying drama. Both of these big city clubs have been effectively rebranded by summer managerial appointments, but their bold moves are paying off. Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds United are leading the Championship, while Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County are in the top six. This match was already an intriguing prospect, pitting MBLU\u2019s high-press infantry up against the swashbuckling starlets of FLDC. Today\u2019s developing drama, with FLDC accusing MBLU of sending a bloke in a tracksuit to patrol their training compound, adds the necessary needle and takes us back in time. In the early 70s, Don Revie\u2019s Leeds and Brian Clough\u2019s Derby routinely muddied each other\u2019s pristine shirts as they tussled for major trophies, while the managers traded barbs and compared lapel sizes on the touchline. Now both clubs are heading back towards the big time, and are back in each other\u2019s business. Kick-off is 7.45pm, GMT.",

      "body": "<p>Gloucester did not so much bow out of Europe last night as sink without trace on another bruising evening for English self-esteem. Munster may not be quite the force of old but they were still comfortably too strong for the Cherry and Whites, this bonus-point victory all but ensuring the Irish province a place in the tournament\u2019s last eight.</p> <p>Long before the end the hosts had been chewed up and spat out by their visiting tormentors in spearmint green, whose outstanding fly-half Joey Carbery contributed 26 points including two of his side\u2019s five tries. If Johnny Sexton\u2019s sore calf does not clear up swiftly, Ireland have a ready-made pedigree alternative; as if his all-round game was not impressive enough, the 23-year-old has now landed every one of his last 17 kicks at goal.</p> <p>Danny Cipriani, sent off in the reverse fixture at Thomond Park and just back after a month out with a pectoral muscle injury, could only look on wistfully behind a retreating pack. Gloucester could conceivably have lost by even more, with Conor Murray enjoying an armchair ride at scrum-half. Tadhg Beirne had another influential game in the Munster second row and, in the back row too, this developed into another Irish masterclass around the tackle area.</p> <p>The wing Andrew Conway scored one try, this time from a deft left-footed Carbery chip, and almost collected another before his outside-half rounded off a classy night with a 60-metre interception try. In terms of close-quarters physicality and killer instinct, Munster were a cut above as they registered the most points Gloucester have ever conceded at home in Europe. The home side were slightly weakened by injury and their coach, Johan Ackermann, with his available players looking increasingly battered, would love to have had the same freedom to rest players as Munster did last weekend. The message to Eddie Jones\u2019s England, heading to Dublin for the opening round of the Six Nations in three weeks\u2019 time, was clear enough.</p> <p>Despite the atmospheric buzz around the stadium for a game the hosts simply could not afford to lose, Gloucester were forced to play catch-up from an early stage. Three psychologically important scrum penalties to Munster plus a glaring dropped high ball by Charlie Sharples did little to boost morale and gradually Munster\u2019s pack began to exert more consistent pressure. A prolonged spell of possession ended with Murray throwing a lovely pass to allow Carbery to skip over unopposed after 23 minutes and worse soon followed.</p> <p>The visiting loosehead Dave Kilcoyne, already enjoying himself opposite Fraser Balmain, put in a fine tackle to down his opposite number Josh Hohneck and, when Gloucester were subsequently pinged on the floor, Carbery\u2019s long penalty put his side 13-3 up after 27 minutes.</p> <p>The odd neat touch from Cipriani was never going to be enough. Before half-time Munster strung together another brutal 26 phases before Rory Scannell, cutting back against the grain and spinning out of Sharples\u2019s tackle split the home defence with ominous ease. The interval scoreline of 20-3 did not entirely reflect Gloucester\u2019s efforts but Munster\u2019s ceaseless commitment deserved its reward.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/toulouse-france-rugby-world-cup-toby-flood\">Resurgent Toulouse leading the French rugby renaissance | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was their sixth successive win over Gloucester and on each occasion the margin has been at least 12 points. Even when the Cherry and Whites did finally score their first try of the evening, after 52 minutes through Ollie Thorley, the wing\u2019s sharp finish was rather less memorable than the 35 phases it took to construct the score, Munster\u2019s defence close to their own line bordering on the extraordinary.</p> <p>Typically Munster, despite losing their captain, Peter O\u2019Mahony, with a popped rib which might threaten his availability against England, went straight back up the other end to create a score for the ever-reliable Keith Earls. A consolation try for Balmain was nowhere near enough to save Gloucester from the European scrapheap along with their compatriots Bath, Wasps, Leicester and, potentially, Exeter and Newcastle as well. Saracens could well be the only Premiership survivors in the last eight, food for thought for all connected with the English club game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/champions-cup-pool-by-pool-preview-johnny-sexton-leinster-injury\">Champions Cup pool-by-pool preview: Leinster\u2019s Johnny Sexton out injured</a> </p> </aside>",

The home side were slightly weakened by injury and their coach, Johan Ackermann, with his available players looking increasingly battered, would love to have had the same freedom to rest players as Munster did last weekend. The message to Eddie Jones\u2019s England, heading to Dublin for the opening round of the Six Nations in three weeks\u2019 time, was clear enough. Despite the atmospheric buzz around the stadium for a game the hosts simply could not afford to lose, Gloucester were forced to play catch-up from an early stage. Three psychologically important scrum penalties to Munster plus a glaring dropped high ball by Charlie Sharples did little to boost morale and gradually Munster\u2019s pack began to exert more consistent pressure. A prolonged spell of possession ended with Murray throwing a lovely pass to allow Carbery to skip over unopposed after 23 minutes and worse soon followed. The visiting loosehead Dave Kilcoyne, already enjoying himself opposite Fraser Balmain, put in a fine tackle to down his opposite number Josh Hohneck and, when Gloucester were subsequently pinged on the floor, Carbery\u2019s long penalty put his side 13-3 up after 27 minutes. The odd neat touch from Cipriani was never going to be enough. Before half-time Munster strung together another brutal 26 phases before Rory Scannell, cutting back against the grain and spinning out of Sharples\u2019s tackle split the home defence with ominous ease. The interval scoreline of 20-3 did not entirely reflect Gloucester\u2019s efforts but Munster\u2019s ceaseless commitment deserved its reward. This was their sixth successive win over Gloucester and on each occasion the margin has been at least 12 points. Even when the Cherry and Whites did finally score their first try of the evening, after 52 minutes through Ollie Thorley, the wing\u2019s sharp finish was rather less memorable than the 35 phases it took to construct the score, Munster\u2019s defence close to their own line bordering on the extraordinary. Typically Munster, despite losing their captain, Peter O\u2019Mahony, with a popped rib which might threaten his availability against England, went straight back up the other end to create a score for the ever-reliable Keith Earls. A consolation try for Balmain was nowhere near enough to save Gloucester from the European scrapheap along with their compatriots Bath, Wasps, Leicester and, potentially, Exeter and Newcastle as well. Saracens could well be the only Premiership survivors in the last eight, food for thought for all connected with the English club game.",

      "bodyText": "The head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-run parliament has thrown down the gauntlet to his country\u2019s embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, declaring himself ready to assume the presidency, in a rare and potentially destabilizing challenge to two decades of Bolivarian rule. Juan Guaid\u00f3 told a rally in Caracas that Maduro \u2013 who began his second six-year term as president on Thursday amid a tempest of international condemnation \u2013 was an illegitimate \u201cusurper\u201d. The 35-year-old politician claimed that he therefore had the constitutional right to assume leadership of the country until fresh elections were held. \u201cWe are going to change things in Venezuela,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told hundreds of cheering supporters in a speech he called his \u201cdeclaration to the Venezuelan people\u201d. \u201cWe aren\u2019t victims. We are survivors ... and we will lead this country towards the glory it deserves,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 added, calling on the people, the international community and, crucially, Venezuela\u2019s armed forces to support him. Guaid\u00f3, who became president of Venezuela\u2019s national assembly last week, admitted there were no \u201cmagic solutions\u201d to an economic crisis fuelling what the UN calls one of the greatest exoduses in Latin American history. But he called a day of nationwide demonstrations for 23 January to intensify pressure on Maduro before concluding by shouting the rallying cry: \u201cPeople of Venezuela: can we, or can\u2019t we?\u201d \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed, se puede!\u201d the crowd roared back. \u201cYes we can!\u201d The opposition took control of the national assembly in 2015 although it was effectively neutered by Maduro\u2019s controversial creation of a constituent assembly in 2017 that sparked deadly protests. Yesiret M\u00e9ndez, a 20-year-old student who was in the crowd, said she had come to hear Guaid\u00f3\u2019s plan for the future: \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready to take to the streets again if necessary.\u201d Carmen de Jes\u00fas, 70, said she hoped Guaid\u00f3 would be able to take control. \u201cMaduro is usurping the power and the president of the national assembly should take over as an interim president.\u201d There was international support for the move too, with the head of the Organisation of American States tweeting: \u201cWe welcome the assumption of @jguaido as interim President of #Venezuela in accordance with Article 233 of the Political Constitution. You have our support, that of the international community and of the people of Venezuela #OEAconVzla.\u201d But there was also apprehension Guaid\u00f3\u2019s audacious move might backfire, triggering a renewed crackdown on regime opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly going to generate some sort of response from the government,\u201d said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group. \u201cThey could dissolve [the national assembly] \u2026 or they could try and arrest opposition leaders or Guaid\u00f3.\u201d Addressing a sympathetic audience of Latin American leftists on Friday afternoon, Maduro mocked his challenger, claiming most Venezuelans did not even know who he was. \u201cIt is a show \u2026 a Hollywood-esque show,\u201d Maduro said, adding: \u201cThe Venezuelan right is hopeless.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s chavista prison minister, Mar\u00eda Iris Varela Rangel, tweeted a more sinister message: \u201cGuaid\u00f3, I\u2019ve already prepared your cell and your uniform, I hope you name your cabinet quickly so I know who is going down with you.\u201d Smilde said Guaid\u00f3\u2019s unexpectedly bold challenge to Maduro was a tactic the most radical members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition had been pushing for. \u201cBut the problem with that is that they have no actual real power: they don\u2019t control the institutions, they don\u2019t control the guns and they don\u2019t control the money.\u201d One Guaid\u00f3 ally told the energy news agency Argus Media he was aware of the \u201clife-threatening\u201d risks of his statement: \u201c[But] keeping silent and not invoking the constitution\u2019s authority to strip Maduro of his executive powers would have been a surrender to the dictatorial status quo and would have buried any chance of restoring democracy for years to come.\u201d",

The relief of Australia\u2019s first goal at the tournament, coming in the 18th minute, and the first of Jamie Maclaren\u2019s international career was a huge release of the pressure that had been building from the opening Asian Cup loss to Jordan. This was a vastly improved showing right from the start as the Socceroos pushed high up the pitch, moved the ball with far greater fluidity than they had against the Jordanians and scored three well-taken goals to kick-start their title defence in the glare of the early Dubai afternoon. The day began in unusual fashion as a massive fire at a nearby plastics factory sent billowing plumes of black smoke into the air that took three firefighting squads more than five hours to contain but the Socceroos had noticeably less trouble in extinguishing the limited threat of the West Asian minnows. Palestine have only scored once in the history of the Asian Cup and on the few occasions that they threatened here Ryan and a stout defence, marshalled well by Trent Sainsbury and Milos Degenek, dealt with those issues without a great deal of trouble. Having collected a second booking Sainsbury will be absent for the upcoming clash with Syria and Palestine showed just how hard it can be to cope with a defensive reshuffle. The nation\u2019s leading central defender, Mohammed Saleh \u2013 the Malta-based player rather than Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian forward \u2013 was suspended for this clash and Australia took full advantage of those enforced changes. Indeed, all three goals came from crosses, the first a delightful swipe of the magical left-foot of Tom Rogic that Maclaren nodded home and the next two, scored by Awer Mabil and Apo Gianno, via an impressive Chris Ikonomidis. The Perth Glory forward was one of three changes made by Graham Arnold, with Jackson Irvine and Rhyan Grant coming in for Robbie Kruse, Massimo Luongo and Josh Risdon.

      "bodyText": "It rains a lot in Nannup. The small timber town in south-western Western Australia, population of just over 1,300, receives almost a metre of rainfall a year. For a builder like Kevin Bird, that means a lot of days when it\u2019s too wet to work. It could be an opportunity to catch up on the accounts, or even leave off work for the day and read a book. Instead, Bird used his wet-weather days to build the largest wooden pendulum clock in the world. He started small, making made-to-order wooden grandfather clocks out of the workshop on his farm. Then the timber industry started facing pressure from environmental groups, and Bird, frustrated by a perception that Nannup timber was only used for \u201cwood chips and railway sleepers\u201d, decided upon the perfect protest: a really, really big clock. \u201cIt sounded like a good idea at the time, but it was a bit like a wart that just kept growing,\u201d he said. The finished clock is six metres tall, weighs two tonnes and took more than a decade to build. This month, 15 years after it first began \u2013 after a string of rejections, a failed community centre proposal and \u201csix months of crying\u201d \u2013 the wooden clock went on display in a purpose-built 14-metre-tall clocktower in the town centre: the highest point on the Nannup skyline. It joins Australia\u2019s ever-growing list of big things. \u201cIt seems to be very, very popular,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt has gone full circle. But I could have done without all the bullshit.\u201d The project began in 2004, with a promise that it would be housed in a new Nannup community centre. When the centre lost the backing of the Nannup shire council, Bird was lost. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cI was left with a pile of bits and nowhere for it to go. I probably cried for about six months, and then after a while I thought, \u2018nothing is changing, and you have to go do something about it yourself\u2019.\u201d With the encouragement of his wife, Margaret, he kept going, and built a new extra-tall shed in order to finish construction. There it stood for four years until it was dismantled and painstakingly moved into the new Nannup clocktower, run by local businesswoman Heather Walford. Bird snuck in earlier this week and watched some tourists admiring his handiwork from the viewing platform. \u201cThe one that surprised me the most is the women,\u201d he said. \u201cI never ever thought that a woman would appreciate something like that, because it\u2019s a mechanical thing, it\u2019s a bit blokey. But it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 they are looking at it as a beautiful piece of kinetic art, and it makes the most wonderful sound of wood hitting wood.\u201d He holds the phone up to a wooden grandfather clock in the living room of his home on an acerage a few kilometres out of town, and lets the ticking play down the line. \u201cHear that?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s wood on wood.\u201d The largest single gear in the big clock is just over a metre in diameter, and 50mm thick. The frame is made from locally cut jarrah while the mechanism was made with laminated western she-oak, a \u201cvery durable and stable wood\u201d cut from the gnarled trunks of Allocasuarina fraseriana, a little coastal species often stunted by sea breezes. Bird learned to build clocks while working as an aircraft engineer for now-defunct airline Ansett Australia in the 1960s, when it still used some Douglas DC-3 and DC-4 aircraft left over from the second world war. \u201cThey all had wind-up chronometers in the instrument panel as a final back-up to determine position and longitude,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to service them and I hated the bloody things.

In 2015 she moved to Sydney and enrolled at Westfields Sports High, as part of the school\u2019s football program. \u201cIt was very difficult at first, being 13, it was very young to move away from home by myself but I found it easier because I had a very supportive family, great coaches and the John Moriarty foundation,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am without them, really.\u201d Moriarty himself is sure Thursday night was just the beginning for his star graduate. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely her dream [to play for the Matildas] and the fact she\u2019s already played for the Young Matildas, she certainly has her sights firmly set on that,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned she certainly has the talent and the rest will be up to opportunity. The desire is there for her and I think that will come through provided she gets the opportunity.\u201d Quiet off the pitch, Evans has developed among her teammates at Sydney FC a reputation for her combative nature. Matildas veteran Lisa De Vanna describes her as a \u201cfighter\u201d who isn\u2019t afraid to take on her more senior teammates. \u201cI like to crack jokes when we have four v two drills that I want her on my side, because she\u2019ll go straight through you,\u201d she says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care who you are, whether you\u2019re a Matilda or a senior player, she\u2019ll treat you and challenge you like any other person. She always just wants the ball.\u201d The 34-year-old is Australia\u2019s leading international goalscorer and second most capped Matilda. De Vanna sees a drive in her young teammate that she believes will serve her well in the future. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve trained with the Young Matildas, she\u2019s probably the one with the most heart in terms of wanting to win and working hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows that she\u2019s passionate and has a winning mentality. She still has a lot to learn and a lot of room to grow [but] when you have someone with that kind of heart, they are the little 10% things you need. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really like about her, she\u2019s a winner, she\u2019s got a different background to a lot of the girls having left home at such a young age. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do for someone her age and to be where she\u2019s at is impressive.\u201d For now, Evans is still revelling in the excitement of her W-League debut. \u201cGoing from playing barefoot to where I am now, playing in front of crowds, on TV, it was a really unforgettable moment. I honestly really enjoyed last night.\u201d But she\u2019s ambitious to one day play for the Matildas, and has embraced being a role model in her community at such a young age. \u201cI think the younger ones definitely look up to me which I am pretty happy about\u201d she says. I would like the other Indigenous kids and everyone in the Northern Territory and especially in my community to see what I\u2019m doing and maybe help [give] them an idea of what football can do.\u201d",

Most government services are frozen, barring those that are deemed \u201cessential\u201d, such as the work of the Department of Homeland Security and FBI. During this shutdown, around 25% of the government workforce is placed on unpaid furlough and told not to work. Workers deemed essential, such as active duty military personnel, are not furloughed.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why might the government shut down?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The president and members of Congress are at an impasse over what should be included in a spending bill to keep the government open.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How common is a shutdown?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There have been more than a dozen government shutdowns in the US since 1981, although ranging in duration. The longest occurred under Bill Clinton, lasting a total of 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996, when the then House speaker, Newt Gingrich, demanded sharp cuts to government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and welfare.<br></p>\n    <p>This shutdown is on course to be the longest in US history.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What would be the cost of a shutdown?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A government shutdown would cost the US roughly $6.5bn a week, according to a report by S&amp;P Global analysts. \u201cA disruption in government spending means no government paychecks to spend; lost business and revenue to private contractors; lost sales at retail shops, particularly those that circle now-closed national parks; and less tax revenue for Uncle Sam,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThat means less economic activity and fewer jobs.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Hundreds of thousands of people are not receiving regular paychecks in this shutdown. In previous shutdowns, furloughed employees have been paid retrospectively \u2013 but those payments have often been delayed.</p>\n    <p><b>Sabrina Siddiqui</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress, said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Trump to consider taking billions of dollars intended to help the US territory recover from Hurricane Maria, a category 4 storm that ravaged the island and left nearly 3,000 dead.</p> \n<p>To reallocate disaster recovery funds toward the wall, she said, was akin to \u201cplaying with our pain and hope\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was not clear what a compromise might entail, and there were no indications that one was in the offing.

The one who had a great reputation. And the one who had multiple successes in the last 10 years. But a combination of their weaknesses with the club\u2019s own failings created a hell of a mess. We didn\u2019t learn from the history post-Busby. Whoever is the new permanent No 1 must ensure there are smiles on faces and get teams more concerned about us and players performing again.",

One close ally has warned he could be caricatured as \u201cRamsay MacCorbyn\u201d, if he entered any kind of formal arrangement with May \u2013 after Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour leader who was reviled by colleagues for entering a national government with the Conservatives in 1931. \u201cWe have no confidence whatsoever that she\u2019s capable of working collaboratively on a so-called soft Brexit,\u201d said one shadow cabinet member. But Corbyn has offered to support May if she offers a customs union and stronger promises on environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, widely regarded by Labour MPs as being warmer towards the idea of a people\u2019s vote than some other members of the shadow cabinet, has suggested Labour would be willing to talk to MPs from other parties about the best way forward.",

In a letter to the chair of the housing, communities and local government select committee of MPs, published on Friday, Sports Direct said: \u201cIf Debenhams does fail, the responsibility for that will rest solely with the Debenhams board.\u201d It said its offer of a \u00a340m interest-free loan before Christmas had been made in \u201cgood faith and the board may want to reconsider \u2026 whether turning down our latest offer of assistance was a dereliction of duty\u201d. Debenhams, which has net debts of \u00a3286m, is in talks with its bankers about refinancing before its current loan facilities expire next year. The group urgently needs to find a new way to raise cash after halting the planned sale of its Danish Magasin du Nord chain when it failed to receive strong enough offers. Debenhams said it had not ruled out any options, including an insolvency process that could speed up a plan to close up to 50 of its 165 UK stores over the next five years.

Debenhams has already been weakened by the ousting of its chairman and chief executive from the boardroom on Thursday after major shareholders Sports Direct and Dubai-based retail billionaire Micky Jagtiani\u2019s Milestone Resources voted against them at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. The chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire, stepped down immediately while the chief executive, Sergio Bucher, will stay on but not as a director. The Guardian has learned that the Debenhams\u2019 interim chairman, Terry Duddy, met Sports Direct\u2019s Ashley soon after the meeting and held \u201cconstructive\u201d talks on how to move forward. Cheshire, who is understood to have had a difficult relationship with Ashley, did not announce his resignation at the meeting as advisers attempted to persuade Jagtiani to change his mind right up until the final vote was held.

Two years later it went missing with local people not sure if had been accidentally removed or deliberately taken.

But some of the evidence heard in court \u2013 chiefly that referencing a WhatsApp group recording sexual conquests \u2013 is understood to have prompted the England and Wales Cricket Board to stand Clarke and Kohler-Cadmore down from the upcoming Lions tour pending an investigation by the governing body.

Also, if you had a problem with that, wouldn\u2019t you have a problem with the Leave campaign using actual illegal strategies to win a campaign?\u201d</p> <p>The somewhat tongue-in-cheek conceit masks the true aim of Lund\u2019s work, which is to provoke questions about and interrogate the ways the British public was manipulated during the campaign and in the two years since the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of coming off as arrogant, as the person who is going to fix it all. The defence is, it\u2019s not necessarily about Brexit, it\u2019s about the tools and mechanisms.

The installation looks every bit the modern political campaign headquarters, with bold logo, open-plan office and sessions including \u201cmindfulness\u201d breaks for the staff. \u201cWith this piece you either program or you are programmed,\u201d says Lund. \u201cYou need to learn how different algorithms can get your attention, or how Instagram is deeply manipulative in its reward system by triggering dopamine.\u201d Lund believes that in the current climate, with the UK poised to leave the EU after a referendum dominated by misinformation and falsehoods, we have a stark choice: either \u201cinform yourself or become a slave to the systems that control us\u201d. \u201cThe level of profiling and modelling that Facebook and other data-gathering operations enable I find deeply problematic,\u201d says Lund. \u201cIt would make George Orwell turn in his grave because it\u2019s far more dystopian than 1984. How much data have we been tricked to give up? Facebook is the greatest surveillance apparatus ever made.\u201d But can a work like this be relevant when it\u2019s based in a pro-remain area of the country and run by what pro-Brexit voices might call \u201cliberal elites\u201d? \u201cThe physical aspect of the campaign is here [in central London] but the tools can be used anywhere,\u201d says Lund. \u201cLike we see with the Russian influence in decisions made in the EU and America. So location is slightly irrelevant.\u201d What about the idea that this is the cultural elite trying to spread its leftist views? \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s not that,\u201d he counters. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to unmask the mechanisms that are being used and abused by both sides \u2013 left and right. Also, if you had a problem with that, wouldn\u2019t you have a problem with the Leave campaign using actual illegal strategies to win a campaign?\u201d The somewhat tongue-in-cheek conceit masks the true aim of Lund\u2019s work, which is to provoke questions about and interrogate the ways the British public was manipulated during the campaign and in the two years since the referendum. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of coming off as arrogant, as the person who is going to fix it all. The defence is, it\u2019s not necessarily about Brexit, it\u2019s about the tools and mechanisms. And these are available to everybody.\u201d As the vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal approaches next week and the repercussions of the UK\u2019s divorce from the EU start to be realised, perhaps there\u2019s no better time to get to grips with the technology that made it possible.",

He drew his animals and plants as they were (he was always interested in habitats too), but also as he experienced them. Many wildlife artists start out with art and find their subject; he began as a birdwatcher and wildlife observer and found art the only release for what nature stirred in him. He worked in the field, sprawled on the ground, with paper clipped to a card (no easel, no artist\u2019s stool) and often used twigs as his pens or brushes. Encamped in a Norfolk saltmarsh, he requisitioned old cornflake boxes to print miraculous images of the samphire at his feet and the oystercatchers in a creek.</p> <p>He gathered his material directly, but made his marks from memory, turning from the storm of life that he loved, and putting down on paper what of it, in his head, he knew and felt.

      "body": "<p>Small, wet, overweight countries should not \u2013 and usually do not \u2013 produce tennis superstars. And although it was a time his many followers in Scotland and beyond had been expecting for a while, the pain and frustration etched on Andy Murray\u2019s face as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-announces-impending-retirement-from-tennis-live\" title=\"\">announced his retirement</a> from tennis at a tearful press conference in Australia, still came as a shock. The fairytale Federer-style comeback we all wished for was not to be.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/hes-an-idol-dunblane-reacts-to-andy-murrays-impending-retirement\">'He\u2019s an idol': Dunblane reacts to Andy Murray's impending retirement</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The visceral authenticity of the emotion made it difficult to watch. But it said everything you need to know about Murray: still utterly committed to the game he loves, struggling to free himself from the only life he has ever known \u2013 even though it is now causing him excruciating pain.</p> \n<p>Two Wimbledon crowns, a US Open, two gold medals, a Davis Cup and world number one in a sport that Scottish people have no history of \u2013 many might say no business \u2013 being good at; Murray has nothing to prove to anyone. But it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow that the tennis gods did not see fit to allow him to bow out on a high, at a time of his choosing. I cannot think of another living Scot who elicits in their compatriots such genuine pride. As only those from other small countries can appreciate \u2013 the Swiss and the Jamaicans perhaps \u2013 possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller. A tiny smidgeon of the glory and the glamour reflects back on you, and because you\u2019re not used to it, you make sure you savour every moment.</p> \n<p>The skill, grit and courage shown by Murray on court speaks for itself, and the buzz of being utterly consumed in the moment of watching him play, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body, is something many of us will never experience again. Murray\u2019s announcement prompted an outpouring of love and praise from around the world that will, no doubt, give him comfort. Maybe all the more so since such support and admiration were noticeably lacking early in his career. To sections of the English media and many Tim Henman-loving English tennis fans, the young pretender, with his sweary on-court passion and intensity, was uncouth and arrogant; his dry, very Scottish off-court banter simply not cricket.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b57c0a7f-6355-4cd1-9ee4-33b5d615953c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EyDXcG2MhHs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This early antipathy was also driven by Murray being an outsider in UK tennis terms, having come up outside of the Lawn Tennis Association system. He was coached by his mother, Judy, a force of nature who begged, borrowed and sacrificed to give her son the opportunity to train at the highest level in Spain. The tennis establishment didn\u2019t like the fact that the Murrays had done it on their own terms, though they were only forced to go elsewhere because the infrastructure did not exist to create champions in the UK, never mind a tennis backwater like Scotland. Shockingly, it still doesn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>Even back before he had won anything big, the animosity and coldness from down south only made people in Scotland love Murray more.</p> \n<p>Eventually, Murray won round many of his detractors. Winning grand slams helped, of course, but one of the other ways he did this was by overturning a major stereotype in Scottish masculinity, the macho fear of showing emotion that still plagues so many men in our country.</p> \n<p>Murray taught Scots how to dream big. But he also made the call to be himself in public, to share his hurt and pain as well as his joy \u2013 and that takes guts. The shyness and awkwardness of the teenager we first got to know matured, through all the euphoric highs and painful lows, into the endearing, hard-won openness that we recognise in the battle-scarred veteran we saw today, and to whom our hearts reached out.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Marianne Taylor is a Glasgow-based freelance journalist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Small, wet, overweight countries should not \u2013 and usually do not \u2013 produce tennis superstars. And although it was a time his many followers in Scotland and beyond had been expecting for a while, the pain and frustration etched on Andy Murray\u2019s face as he announced his retirement from tennis at a tearful press conference in Australia, still came as a shock. The fairytale Federer-style comeback we all wished for was not to be. The visceral authenticity of the emotion made it difficult to watch. But it said everything you need to know about Murray: still utterly committed to the game he loves, struggling to free himself from the only life he has ever known \u2013 even though it is now causing him excruciating pain. Two Wimbledon crowns, a US Open, two gold medals, a Davis Cup and world number one in a sport that Scottish people have no history of \u2013 many might say no business \u2013 being good at; Murray has nothing to prove to anyone. But it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow that the tennis gods did not see fit to allow him to bow out on a high, at a time of his choosing. I cannot think of another living Scot who elicits in their compatriots such genuine pride. As only those from other small countries can appreciate \u2013 the Swiss and the Jamaicans perhaps \u2013 possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller. A tiny smidgeon of the glory and the glamour reflects back on you, and because you\u2019re not used to it, you make sure you savour every moment. The skill, grit and courage shown by Murray on court speaks for itself, and the buzz of being utterly consumed in the moment of watching him play, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body, is something many of us will never experience again. Murray\u2019s announcement prompted an outpouring of love and praise from around the world that will, no doubt, give him comfort. Maybe all the more so since such support and admiration were noticeably lacking early in his career. To sections of the English media and many Tim Henman-loving English tennis fans, the young pretender, with his sweary on-court passion and intensity, was uncouth and arrogant; his dry, very Scottish off-court banter simply not cricket. This early antipathy was also driven by Murray being an outsider in UK tennis terms, having come up outside of the Lawn Tennis Association system. He was coached by his mother, Judy, a force of nature who begged, borrowed and sacrificed to give her son the opportunity to train at the highest level in Spain. The tennis establishment didn\u2019t like the fact that the Murrays had done it on their own terms, though they were only forced to go elsewhere because the infrastructure did not exist to create champions in the UK, never mind a tennis backwater like Scotland. Shockingly, it still doesn\u2019t. Even back before he had won anything big, the animosity and coldness from down south only made people in Scotland love Murray more. Eventually, Murray won round many of his detractors. Winning grand slams helped, of course, but one of the other ways he did this was by overturning a major stereotype in Scottish masculinity, the macho fear of showing emotion that still plagues so many men in our country. Murray taught Scots how to dream big. But he also made the call to be himself in public, to share his hurt and pain as well as his joy \u2013 and that takes guts. The shyness and awkwardness of the teenager we first got to know matured, through all the euphoric highs and painful lows, into the endearing, hard-won openness that we recognise in the battle-scarred veteran we saw today, and to whom our hearts reached out. \u2022 Marianne Taylor is a Glasgow-based freelance journalist",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest independent toy retailer has stockpiled 100 container loads of paddling pools, slides, wheelbarrows and other toys to try to ensure there are no shortages this summer in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Gary Grant, the managing director and founder of The Entertainer chain, said it had doubled the amount of containers it usually brought into the UK at this time of year to ensure seasonal stock was in place before any hold-ups at ports linked to the UK\u2019s Brexit deadline in March. \u201cThere will be no shortage of toys in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThe items we ship from the far east, we have brought the containers forward to make sure we have adequate stocks. It might take three months for things to settle down [after Brexit]. The second biggest time for buying toys is Easter.\u201d Grant said The Entertainer had not had to take on extra warehouse space to store the toys as it had spare capacity after Christmas. He said The Entertainer had shipped own-label items early but expected toy-makers with European distribution centres such as Lego or Playmobil to present their own plans to ensure supply. Similar tactics have been adopted by a number of British manufacturers, food processors and retailers including Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 which said they were stockpiling tinned and packaged foods \u2013 folding bike-maker Brompton, carmaker Bentley, pharmaceutical firms such as Sanofi and off-licence Majestic Wine. Companies are concerned that lorries will face major delays at ports by even minor changes in bureaucracy related to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, where there is currently a free flow of goods across UK borders with minimal checks. While goods coming from the far east will not face changes to paperwork, the fear is they will get stuck behind European goods on the last leg of their journey. The Metropolitan police has been suggesting retailers hire additional security to cope with queues of shoppers trying to stockpile goods if concerns about shortages ramp up ahead of March. The challenges around Brexit are piling pressure on retailers during an already difficult period as they try to adapt to a shift to online shopping, rising costs and low consumer confidence. Earlier this week, Sainsbury\u2019s, the owner of the UK\u2019s biggest toy retailer Argos, said its toy sales had fallen as the market had shrunk by more than 10%. But Grant said The Entertainer had enjoyed a strong Christmas, with sales up by more than 10% as it had benefited from the demise of Toys R Us last February. \u201cDuring 2018, we opened 16 new stores and we traded better than double digits up,\u201d Grant said. He said sales had risen in established stores and online thanks to the popularity of trends including L.O.L dolls and slime. \u201cWe have had a shiningly good year. We believe in the high street and the high street is nowhere near dead. Our market share is growing and going into 2019 we are as optimistic as we can be with Brexit looming.\u201d",

Not to mention, in a surprising twist given his awkward, un-fluffy adolescence, perhaps the most widely loved, most uplifting and, in men\u2019s sport at least, most politically progressive too.</p> \n<p>As Murray is universally garlanded over the coming days there will no doubt be a wry smile or two among hardened tennis hacks who were there at the start of the Murray Supremacy, as an 18-year-old Wimbledon wild card back in 2005. The embryonic Murray was all talent, all potential; but somehow not quite cut from the same physical stuff as your average steamrollering alpha athlete.</p> \n<p>For one thing Murray was rake-thin and slouchy, a gangly kid next to the slabbed and ripped power-players of the modern men\u2019s game. For another he was funny and acerbic, with the kind of prickly, questing intelligence that doesn\u2019t often go hand in hand with a tennis childhood spent racking up a million drive-volley practice repetitions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/murray_v_british_players/giv-3902n405dWmT4uQD/\" data-alt=\"Andy Murray\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/murray_v_british_players/giv-3902n405dWmT4uQD/\">Andy Murray</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Plus, of course he was British. And ever since the first great Summer of Tim, start of that annual emotional incontinence around the the inevitable collapse of Tim Henman in the late stages of Wimbledon, British tennis had wallowed in its status as an oddly comforting vale of summer tears, a lucrative tableau of almost-but-not-quite home county heroism.</p> \n<p>One of the best things about Murray is that he ripped all that up. The 2013 men\u2019s Wimbledon singles title will remain his defining achievement. Forget the surrounding noise. Forget about being a nice guy, or the perfect example of how to wring every final drop of sweetness from whatever talent your genes have given you. Winning that title, 77 years on from the last British champion and at a time when three of the greatest tennis players ever were also operating, remains a genuinely vertiginous sporting achievement.</p> \n<p>In the moment of victory Murray dropped his racket and yelled, mouth agape, into the nearest face in the crowd before crumpling on to the sun-bleached grass. If he was overcome, briefly, then this was understandable given the many layers of skin shed along the way, the ascetic, violently punishing nature of his journey to that moment, the end point of which sees him needing surgery on his hip just to regain the ability to walk without serious pain.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-next-pundit-politician-tennis\">Pundit? Tech investor? Politician? What next for Andy Murray?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Also fitting was the grimly fascinating collection of VIPs there, among them David Cameron, Ed Miliband and, of course, Alex Salmond, waving a vast Scottish saltire just behind the royal party. Even this seems decidedly Murray. If there is a defining note to his elite career it is the constant battle to find his own way through the disorientating gravity around him, remaining throughout decisively and productively himself.</p> \n<p>The single-mindedness is there even in his quietly unyielding advocacy for equality of the sexes in sport.

      "bodyText": "Stop all the green and yellow Timex clocks. Put away that union jack tea towel. Stow the Pimms-sodden crash barriers at the foot of the Aorangi Terrace. Andy Murray may yet play another Wimbledon this summer, depending on the state of his chronic, career-capping hip injury. But in the wake of a raw and tearful press conference on Friday morning it seems highly likely that next week\u2019s Australian Open will be the final appearance of a stellar, transformative, broadly-sketched tennis career. At the end of which Murray will retire as arguably the greatest individual British sports person of the modern age. Not to mention, in a surprising twist given his awkward, un-fluffy adolescence, perhaps the most widely loved, most uplifting and, in men\u2019s sport at least, most politically progressive too. As Murray is universally garlanded over the coming days there will no doubt be a wry smile or two among hardened tennis hacks who were there at the start of the Murray Supremacy, as an 18-year-old Wimbledon wild card back in 2005. The embryonic Murray was all talent, all potential; but somehow not quite cut from the same physical stuff as your average steamrollering alpha athlete. For one thing Murray was rake-thin and slouchy, a gangly kid next to the slabbed and ripped power-players of the modern men\u2019s game. For another he was funny and acerbic, with the kind of prickly, questing intelligence that doesn\u2019t often go hand in hand with a tennis childhood spent racking up a million drive-volley practice repetitions. Plus, of course he was British. And ever since the first great Summer of Tim, start of that annual emotional incontinence around the the inevitable collapse of Tim Henman in the late stages of Wimbledon, British tennis had wallowed in its status as an oddly comforting vale of summer tears, a lucrative tableau of almost-but-not-quite home county heroism. One of the best things about Murray is that he ripped all that up. The 2013 men\u2019s Wimbledon singles title will remain his defining achievement. Forget the surrounding noise. Forget about being a nice guy, or the perfect example of how to wring every final drop of sweetness from whatever talent your genes have given you. Winning that title, 77 years on from the last British champion and at a time when three of the greatest tennis players ever were also operating, remains a genuinely vertiginous sporting achievement. In the moment of victory Murray dropped his racket and yelled, mouth agape, into the nearest face in the crowd before crumpling on to the sun-bleached grass. If he was overcome, briefly, then this was understandable given the many layers of skin shed along the way, the ascetic, violently punishing nature of his journey to that moment, the end point of which sees him needing surgery on his hip just to regain the ability to walk without serious pain. Also fitting was the grimly fascinating collection of VIPs there, among them David Cameron, Ed Miliband and, of course, Alex Salmond, waving a vast Scottish saltire just behind the royal party. Even this seems decidedly Murray. If there is a defining note to his elite career it is the constant battle to find his own way through the disorientating gravity around him, remaining throughout decisively and productively himself. The single-mindedness is there even in his quietly unyielding advocacy for equality of the sexes in sport. Murray didn\u2019t appoint Amelie Mauresmo, the first high-profile female coach in any major global male sport, to garner approval points. He did it because she was the best person available. He didn\u2019t publicly defend Mauresmo\u2019s appointment out of a desire to make her gender an issue: he defended her because lazy thinking, prejudice, and judging on anything other than merit is something he finds entirely illegal and counterproductive. Even in the moments after he\u2019d lost to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon in 2017, a significant staging post in his own grand slam career, he couldn\u2019t help coming back to this. As an American journalist gushingly congratulated Querrey on his status as \u201cthe first American player\u201d to reach a Wimbledon semi-final in eight years, Murray could be heard interjecting, deadpan, not once but twice with the words \u201cmale player\u201d. This isn\u2019t virtue signalling: it\u2019s accuracy signalling, human merit-signalling. Murray loves and venerates the great players of his time, from Roger to Serena to Novak to Venus, sees only talent and character and human meritocracy. So often during his years at the top his deeds and words have made feminism in sport look less like an ideological choice, more like the only logical position of anyone with half a brain and a shot of basic integrity. Murray applied this same emotional honesty to the single biggest challenge of his sporting life. To win Wimbledon as a Brit, and beyond that a Scot, is not simply to win a prestigious tennis tournament. It is to slay an entire circling chorus of invisible dragons. Winning Wimbledon required Murray to meet the weight of those swirling expectations, but also to present himself to that green and yellow arena in a way that retained his own equilibrium, to find just the right emotional pitch. There has always been an echo of the Jane Austen hero about this, about smouldering Mr Murray\u2019s need to balance a tension around his own desire for victory, and Wimbledon\u2019s own needy emotional hauteur. Something of the Wimbledon atmosphere still speaks to class and privilege and sex too, a sport whose rhythms and texture were born out of flannel-trousered country house filtration, something that perhaps explains why so many members of the crowd spend most of their time there tittering and giggling. For a while there was talk of Murray\u2019s emotional frigidity, the need to shed his Celtic chill and embrace a more unbound engagement with that flushed and draining centre court crowd. But forbidding Mr Murray did seduce the crowd, turning its strange, distracting energy to his own ends. His Mr Darcy in the duckpond moment came the year before he finally won it. There was some surprise when Murray burst into tears at the end of his 2012 defeat to Roger Federer. But Murray came back the next year leaner and more shark-like and looking utterly relaxed.

Britain\u2019s largest trade union, Unite, vowed to fight against any compulsory redundancies. \u201cIt is a devastating blow for our members and their families, as well as having grave implications for the Welsh economy and the supply chain,\u201d said Des Quinn, Unite\u2019s national officer for the automotive industry. \u201cThere are a number of factors behind this grim news \u2013 the main ones being challenging market conditions for carmakers generally, a lack of a coherent industrial strategy from the UK government and the uncertainty created by Brexit. \u201cOver the last two decades the UK car industry has experienced a renaissance of which we can all be proud of. \u201cThe challenge for government, the carmakers and the unions in the near future is to fight very hard to maintain the environment that made that success possible,\u201d Quinn said. Jo Stevens, the Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said Ford\u2019s decision was \u201cawful news for Bridgend and the whole of south Wales\u201d. Ford is overhauling its European operations in an attempt to increase profit margins, including the shutting down of loss-making vehicle lines. It is to abandon the multivan market \u2013 vehicles with more than five seats \u2013 stop manufacturing automatic transmissions in Bordeaux from August, review its operations in Russia and combine the headquarters of Ford UK and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex. \u201cWe are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe,\u201d said Steven Armstrong, Ford\u2019s group vice-president and president of its Europe, Middle East and Africa region. \u201cWe will invest in the vehicles, services, segments and markets that best support a long-term sustainably profitable business, creating value for all our stakeholders and delivering emotive vehicles to our customers.\u201d Details of large-scale job cuts at Ford follow hard on the heels of Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s announcement that it plans to reduce its workforce by 4,500, the majority via voluntary redundancies in UK management roles at sites including Coventry and Gaydon in Warwickshire. JLR has suffered because of falling Chinese demand and a fall-off in diesel sales after the Dieselgate emissions-testing scandal, which has led several cities and countries to impose punitive taxes on cars powered by the fuel. Ford and JLR have also warned that the longer-term future for the British car industry remains uncertain because of Brexit. The Japanese carmaker Honda said on Thursday that it would shut down its Swindon factory for six days in April, following the planned Brexit departure date on 29 March.",

He told the audience:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My friend the prime minister has been doing her very best to try to find a way out of this problem that minimises the damage while trying to honour the referendum result. </p> <p>The unpleasant truth for her is that it can satisfy no one. </p> <p>There is only one way out. When the PM\u2019s deal is defeated, what else can we possibly offer to the British public which has any chance at all, but to go back to ask them to reconsider their decision. </p> <p>Parliamentarians do have some duties and one of them is to prevent people from committing national suicide.</p> </blockquote> <p>Grieve, who received a standing ovation, said that options such as a Norway-style deal or customs union with the EU would just \u201cbrush problems under the carpet\u201d and the only option was to go back to the public. </p> <p>He also said had told sixth form students that what it meant to be a conservative was to believe in principals of \u201ccontinuity\u201d and \u201cpragmatism\u201d and to try to avoid \u201crevolutionary changes\u201d. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I then explained to them that we had blown it because we allowed a revolutionary change to take place in the name of tradition, and such things can never work.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m talking myself into supporting the prime minister\u2019s deal next Tuesday against no deal and against further delay. I\u2019m not quite there yet but I\u2019m not far away. </p> <p>It seems the House isn\u2019t yet there at all but at some point we need to recognise the danger of no deal is still there and the only real alternative on the table is the prime minister\u2019s deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Mike Gapes</strong> mocked his own party\u2019s stance on Brexit. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the brief from the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] this week we\u2019re going for a sensible Brexit - whatever that is. </p> <p>The reality is all over the country we know there is no such thing as a jobs-first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage ...</p> <p>There\u2019s no socialist Brexit, there\u2019s no jobs-first Brexit, there\u2019s no better Brexit.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Conservative<strong> Michael Tomlinson </strong>said he would not support May\u2019s deal even though he considered himself a \u201cserial loyalist\u201d. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have never rebelled against the government in my three-and-a-half years in this place, and I do so with a heavy heart but with a clear head that this is not the right deal.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Mike Penning,</strong> the Conservative Brexiter and former minister, recalled John Bercow\u2019s Eurosceptic youth. He recalled campaigning against the EU some years ago.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember vividly being in Blackpool in the Odeon for a fringe meeting. There was some chap called Norman Tebbit on that platform and a young upstart called John Bercow, and John Bercow made Mr Tebbit look a bit left wing. I think I\u2019m absolutely right about that. </p> <p>Following that excellent fringe meeting which was packed to the gunnels, mostly by Government whips trying to find out what we were up to, I got a phone call from the then said John Bercow, \u2018could you make sure I\u2019m on your fringe next year?\u2019, I remember this very vividly, it\u2019s in my diaries for future publication.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Peter Grant</strong>, the SNP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said that Michael Gove, the environment secretary, admitted in the debate yesterday that the \u201cfree movement\u201d of race horses could be curtailed by a no-deal Brexit, affecting the Grand National. Grant went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I find it astonishing from the comments from the secretary of state for environment yesterday that this party of government seems more concerned about the welfare and free movement of race horses than they are about the welfare and free movement of people.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Bernard Jenkin</strong>, the Conservative Brexiter, said a no-deal Brexit would be better than extending article 50 or May\u2019s deal. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The leadership of this country, and that includes the government and the opposition, should stop reinforcing weakness and start talking up our strengths and building up our confidence. </p> <p>History has proved that our country can always rise to the challenge and our people will never forgive the politicians who allow the EU to inflict defeat, and it saddens me greatly that even some in my own party are promoting such a defeat.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mark Francois</strong>, another Tory Brexiter and vice chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, said May\u2019s deal would leave the UK a \u201cvassal state\u201d. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This treaty, if we were to approve it, would involve us giving up \u00a339bn for nothing, would leave us as a rule-taker, would potentially lead us into a backstop from which there\u2019s no escape, would threaten the break-up of the UK, and would still leave us under the suzerainty of the European Court of Justice - a vassal state. </p> <p>This country has never bowed the knee to anyone in almost 1,000 years and I don\u2019t believe we should start now. </p> <p>We have never surrendered to anyone in this House and we never, ever will, including next Tuesday night.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c38b51fe4b0cebe761846bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T15:37:18.494Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to <strong>Sam McBride,</strong> political editor of the Belfast News Letter, the civil service in Northern Ireland has <a href=\"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/civil-servants-asked-to-volunteer-to-man-75-crisis-filling-stations-across-northern-ireland-1-8765757\">contingency plans for fuel rationing. </a>Officials have been asked to volunteer should it be necessary to set up 75 \u201cstrategically located\u201d filling stations supplying \u201cpriority\u201d vehicles if there is a major oil supply emergency.

The full speech is <a href=\"https://www.carolinelucas.com/latest/think-anew-act-anew\">here,</a> and it is well worth reading. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lucas said there was a valid message behind the leave vote in 2016.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many people took the question they were being asked to mean \u201cShould the country go on being run in the way that it is?\u2019</p> <p>And they voted \u201cNO!\u201d with a collective howl of rage.</p> <p>That response was justified then - and it\u2019s justified now.</p> <p>For some, it might have been mixed up with fear, even bigotry, and an impossible longing for the past.</p> <p>But there was - and is - a core message at the heart of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>That the status quo in this country is intolerable for huge numbers of people. </p> <p>That the social contract is broken and the power game is rigged.</p> <p>It is right and reasonable to be furious.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the reluctance of the remain campaign in 2016 to make the case for free movement amounted to a \u201cmoral failure\u201d. </strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Changing the Brexit conversation means proudly celebrating free movement - and the opportunities it\u2019s given to individuals and to our country. </p> <p>It was not just a political failure, but a moral failure, that saw the Remain campaign hide away from talking about migration in 2016 - preferring instead to bandy about economic threats, rather than engage in a serious debate on this pressing issue.</p> <p>It also means making those opportunities of free movement genuinely available to <em>all </em>- when for vast swathes of people today they\u2019re not even imaginable.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the \u201clie\u201d at the heart of the leave campaign was the claim that Brexit would address inequality.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As inequality spins out of control, people in all classes feel helpless. That\u2019s why the slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d had such resonance.</p> <p>It promised agency in a system in which the rich and powerful, who clearly <em>do</em> have agency, were telling us that the market rules, and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do.</p> <p>In short, this is a country where what dictates your success isn\u2019t how hard you work, or how much you care. </p> <p>It\u2019s not your passion or your commitment.</p> <p>No. This is a country where your success is dictated by your postcode, the income of your parents, the year in which you were born.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said any new referendum campaign could not be won by a \u201cProject Fear\u201d approach.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 2016 result should tell us that \u201cproject fear\u201d won\u2019t win people over.</p> <p>They want hope ...</p> <p>To stand any chance of winning a People\u2019s Vote, we have to abandon all association with a vapid centrism that has failed to deliver for so many people, and would fail again.</p> <p>We have to think and act anew.</p> <p>To start using the ideas and language <em>now </em>that will set the tone for a very different kind of referendum campaign.</p> <p>One that\u2019s hopeful, inclusive, energetic and radical. One we can all feel part of and one that appeals to our hearts as well as our heads.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that parliament should be moved out of London as part of sweeping programme of constitutional change intended to \u201cgenuinely democratise the UK\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the best ways to \u201ctake back control\u201d is to rid ourselves of a winner takes all politics, and an outdated electoral system that systematically shuts people out ...</p> <p>No democratic renewal is complete without proportional representation.</p> <p>And let\u2019s seriously explore ideas like parliament moving out of London to a city such as Leeds or Manchester \u2013 with the chance to rebalance our economy as well as our politics.</p> <p>The Palace of Westminster, Gothic, rat-infested, and crumbling into the Thames, has become a powerful symbol of political decay.</p> <p>If we mean what we say about changing this country for good, then why not make moving parliament out of London the first in a series of changes which turn the UK into a 21st century democracy?</p> <p>Let\u2019s learn from the inspiring way in which citizens assemblies have been used in Ireland, for example, to facilitate informed debate on contentious topics and build deep consensus and understanding.</p> <p>And let\u2019s ensure that democracy can no longer be undermined by fake news and post-truth advertising by introducing new ground-breaking digital democracy laws.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03aa640046a697ae7214ce0ad1bd89fa3177f229\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03aa640046a697ae7214ce0ad1bd89fa3177f229/0_135_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Lucas speaking during a convention on a second EU referendum at the Emmanuel Centre in central London today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Lucas speaking during a convention on a second EU referendum at the Emmanuel Centre in central London today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c389181e4b072dc52e6cd0c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T12:53:39.713Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is Channel 4 News\u2019 <strong>Michael Crick</strong> on what the Unite general secretary <strong>Len McCluskey</strong> is saying about <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/may-turns-to-trade-unions-in-plea-for-brexit-backing\">his telephone call with Theresa May about Brexit yesterday.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/1083695596656046085\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Len McCluskey tells it was the first time he had ever spoken to Theresa May (he never ever had a conversation with Cameron).  &quot;There was nothing acrimonious or disrespectful&quot; about it, he says.

One is an amendment to the Labour amendment, and another is an amendment to the motion in its own right.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know yet whether they will be put to a vote.</p> <p>One possibility is that the Lib Dems might withdraw them (ie, choose voluntarily not to put them to a vote if given the chance). The People\u2019s Vote campaign want them to do that. That\u2019s because People\u2019s Vote don\u2019t want the vote on this issue to take place until Labour is committed to whipping its MPs in favour, and they fear that if the vote happens on Tuesday, and the second referendum option gets defeated (perhaps by a large majority), then the campaign will lose momentum. People\u2019s Vote would like to see a vote on a no confidence motion soon, because if the government were to win that, then at that point Jeremy Corbyn would come under pressure to formally back a second referendum.</p> <p>Another possibility is that the Lib Dem amendments won\u2019t get called anyway.</p> <p>But if there is no vote on a second referendum next week, then it is quite likely we will get one soon, following the vote which means MPs would have to debate \u2018plan B\u2019 options by Monday week.</p> <p>If there is a vote in the Commons before MPs have voted on a no confidence motion (which could conceivably trigger a general election - Corbyn\u2019s preferred option), then I expect Labour to order its MPs to abstain. That is what happened when there was a vote on a second referendum amendment to the EU withdrawal bill in December 2017. <a href=\"https://brexitcentral.com/23-mps-voted-second-referendum/\">Only nine Labour MPs rebelled,</a> and backed the amendment, and it was defeated by 319 votes to 23.</p> <p>If there were a vote now, then I would expect dozens of Labour MPs to defy a whip to abstain and to vote in favour, and perhaps a dozen or more Tories. But even with the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Caroline Lucas also voting for a second referendum, I can\u2019t see the People\u2019s Vote camp having any chance of winning, or even coming close, without Labour whipping its MPs in favour. There is much more support for the idea now than there was in December 2017, but MPs do not rebel against the party whip lightly, and it is important to remember than many MPs in the party - remainers as well as the relatively small number of leavers - have deep reservations about a second referendum.</p> <p>(It is also worth pointing out that some in Labour claim that, even if the party did whip its MPs in favour, there is no guarantee a second referendum motion would pass because a large number of Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum would abstain, or vote against.)</p> <p>Even if MPs were to pass a motion calling for a second referendum, it would still not happen without legislation. And for that to happen you would need a government willing to draft a bill, allow time for it to be debated, and whip its MPs to vote for it. Personally, I find it almost impossible to imagine Theresa May, or any other Conservative leader, doing all of that. I also find it almost fairly hard imagine Corbyn going through that process too, although if the Labour party membership had him in an armlock, in those circumstances it could happen. At least he leads a party that wants a second referendum. But only around 10% of Conservative members support the idea, <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2018/12/a-second-referendum-remains-deeply-unpopular-among-conservative-party-members.html\">according to one survey,</a> which is why it is such a remote possibility.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T12:07:23.479Z\">at 12.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c3871e3e4b02fb91ff12711\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T10:42:59.398Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Soames says MPs will be 'voting for chaos' if they reject May's Brexit deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sir Nicholas Soames,</strong> the Conservative former defence minister, is speaking in the Brexit debate now.

Labour MPs are complaining about the fact that Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is announcing changes to her policy on universal credit in a speech outside the Commons, not in a statement to MPs. <strong>John Bercow, </strong>the speaker, has just effectively reprimanded her, saying major policy changes should be announced to parliament first. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3855f5e4b072dc52e6ca57\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T09:35:46.166Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hunt claims Commons votes this week have made staying in EU more likely</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt,</strong> the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and he made an interesting assertion. The chances of Brexit being halted are going up, he claimed. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hunt claimed that events in the Commons this week showed the chances of Brexit being stopped are rising. </strong>Speaking about the vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal next Tuesday, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The parliamentary arithmetic is challenging. But, also, the choices are very clear. And I think after this week things have changed. Up till now I think people have quite rightly been worrying about the prospects of no deal. Now there is another possibility coming into sight, which is actually no Brexit.</p> <p>And why is that? We have a government that is committed to delivering Brexit. But it doesn\u2019t have a majority. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also claimed that, if Brexit were halted, the consequences for democracy would be very severe.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis. And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit. </p> <p>I\u2019m saying this would be [an] incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain\u2019s reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found we weren\u2019t able to do it.</p> <p>If we were, as a political class, not to deliver Brexit, that would be a fundamental breach of trust between the people and the politicians. I think that is something that we would regret for many, many generations.</p> </blockquote> <p>For many Guardian readers, the claim that the odds on Britain staying in the EU are shortening may come as a welcome piece of good news. But it was fairly obvious that Hunt was not speaking with the intention of cheering remainers. Instead, he wants to scare Tory Brexiters into supporting May\u2019s deal.</p> <p>This is not the first time the government has talked about the possibility of Brexit being halted. <strong>Theresa May </strong>explicitly raised this as one of three possible Brexit outcomes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2018/nov/14/brexit-deal-theresa-may-conservatives-meet-decide-cabinet-politics-live?page=with:block-5bec76cce4b0772932e1fd44#block-5bec76cce4b0772932e1fd44\">when she addressed the nation</a> after the five-hour cabinet meeting that approved her Brexit plan. But she since she has been wary about repeating the claim, sometimes admitting that Brexit could be stopped and at other times declaring that the the UK will leave the EU on 29 March come what may. ITV\u2019s<strong> Robert Peston</strong> suspects that she may not be happy with Hunt saying the choice is now just her deal or remain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1083638252484132864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Jeremy_Hunt</a> now framing the choice as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@theresa_may</a>\u2019s Brexit or a referendum and no Brexit.

We have seen from this week that parliament has the ability to assert itself and to shape outcomes. </p> <p>I think parliament is very committed to try to stop no-deal, but I think we have to recognise that there is a deal on the table, it does broadly deliver the Brexit people voted for, and if we don\u2019t find a way to get this through, we are taking some very big risks. </p> </blockquote> <p>This was another part of Hunt\u2019s argument as to why Brexit being abandoned has become more likely. His claim is arguable, although not wholly persuasive. Although the Commons has flexed his muscles this week, it is still a mistake to think that, just because a majority of MPs oppose a no-deal Brexit, a no-deal Brexit cannot happen. I explained why in a lengthy post <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/nov/21/brexit-pmqs-may-corbyn-rudd-says-mps-wont-allow-no-deal-brexit-contradicting-may-politics-live?page=with:block-5bf5889de4b0c6aba9993a56#block-5bf5889de4b0c6aba9993a56\">here </a>towards the end of last year.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>Sajid Javid, the home secretary, opens day three of the Brexit debate.

      "bodyText": "Dominic Grieve, a leading Conservative pro-European, has said that Brexit would be similar to \u201cnational suicide\u201d. He was speaking at The Convention: Another Vote is Possible, a conference promoting a second referendum. (See 4.42pm.) At the same event Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said that there was a valid message behind the leave vote in 2016 and that any new remain campaign should include inspiring plans for radical democratic reform. (See 1.37pm.) Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has claimed that events in the Commons this week have increased the chances of Brexit being halted. (See 9.35am.) One of Japan\u2019s largest banks has blamed Brexit for its decision to move part of its business to Amsterdam, 24 hours after Theresa May sought to enlist the Japanese prime minister in the fight to save her deal with the EU. The government will seek to make universal credit payments to women if they are the household\u2019s main carer, Amber Rudd has said, as part of a package of changes to the heavily criticised benefits system that have been unveiled by the work and pensions secretary. Four working single mothers have won a legal victory that could force the government to radically overhaul the way it operates the controversial universal credit scheme. Boris Johnson received \u00a323,000 in loans and donations last month from a company run by the Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby, official documents have revealed. The government has been accused of defying parliament by delaying plans to require British tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands to bring in public registers that reveal the true identity of owners of companies sheltering assets. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Have a good weekend. Comments will close around 6pm. In his speech to the second referendum convention in London this morning Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, described Brexit as \u201cnational suicide\u201d. He told the audience: My friend the prime minister has been doing her very best to try to find a way out of this problem that minimises the damage while trying to honour the referendum result. The unpleasant truth for her is that it can satisfy no one. There is only one way out. When the PM\u2019s deal is defeated, what else can we possibly offer to the British public which has any chance at all, but to go back to ask them to reconsider their decision. Parliamentarians do have some duties and one of them is to prevent people from committing national suicide. Grieve, who received a standing ovation, said that options such as a Norway-style deal or customs union with the EU would just \u201cbrush problems under the carpet\u201d and the only option was to go back to the public. He also said had told sixth form students that what it meant to be a conservative was to believe in principals of \u201ccontinuity\u201d and \u201cpragmatism\u201d and to try to avoid \u201crevolutionary changes\u201d. He went on: I then explained to them that we had blown it because we allowed a revolutionary change to take place in the name of tradition, and such things can never work. It ends up where you do not want to be. You can read the speeches from today\u2019s Brexit debate on Hansard online, at least those delivered until 1pm, here. The rest will come online a bit later. It wasn\u2019t an especially memorable debate, but here are some of the highlights not already featured. The Labour former minister Jim Fitzpatrick said he was close to backing Theresa May\u2019s deal. He said: I\u2019m talking myself into supporting the prime minister\u2019s deal next Tuesday against no deal and against further delay. I\u2019m not quite there yet but I\u2019m not far away. It seems the House isn\u2019t yet there at all but at some point we need to recognise the danger of no deal is still there and the only real alternative on the table is the prime minister\u2019s deal. Labour\u2019s Mike Gapes mocked his own party\u2019s stance on Brexit. He said: According to the brief from the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] this week we\u2019re going for a sensible Brexit - whatever that is. The reality is all over the country we know there is no such thing as a jobs-first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage ... There\u2019s no socialist Brexit, there\u2019s no jobs-first Brexit, there\u2019s no better Brexit. The Conservative Michael Tomlinson said he would not support May\u2019s deal even though he considered himself a \u201cserial loyalist\u201d. He said: I have never rebelled against the government in my three-and-a-half years in this place, and I do so with a heavy heart but with a clear head that this is not the right deal. Sir Mike Penning, the Conservative Brexiter and former minister, recalled John Bercow\u2019s Eurosceptic youth. He recalled campaigning against the EU some years ago. I remember vividly being in Blackpool in the Odeon for a fringe meeting. There was some chap called Norman Tebbit on that platform and a young upstart called John Bercow, and John Bercow made Mr Tebbit look a bit left wing. I think I\u2019m absolutely right about that. Following that excellent fringe meeting which was packed to the gunnels, mostly by Government whips trying to find out what we were up to, I got a phone call from the then said John Bercow, \u2018could you make sure I\u2019m on your fringe next year?\u2019, I remember this very vividly, it\u2019s in my diaries for future publication. Peter Grant, the SNP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, said that Michael Gove, the environment secretary, admitted in the debate yesterday that the \u201cfree movement\u201d of race horses could be curtailed by a no-deal Brexit, affecting the Grand National. Grant went on: I find it astonishing from the comments from the secretary of state for environment yesterday that this party of government seems more concerned about the welfare and free movement of race horses than they are about the welfare and free movement of people. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative Brexiter, said a no-deal Brexit would be better than extending article 50 or May\u2019s deal. He went on: The leadership of this country, and that includes the government and the opposition, should stop reinforcing weakness and start talking up our strengths and building up our confidence. History has proved that our country can always rise to the challenge and our people will never forgive the politicians who allow the EU to inflict defeat, and it saddens me greatly that even some in my own party are promoting such a defeat. Mark Francois, another Tory Brexiter and vice chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, said May\u2019s deal would leave the UK a \u201cvassal state\u201d. He explained: This treaty, if we were to approve it, would involve us giving up \u00a339bn for nothing, would leave us as a rule-taker, would potentially lead us into a backstop from which there\u2019s no escape, would threaten the break-up of the UK, and would still leave us under the suzerainty of the European Court of Justice - a vassal state. This country has never bowed the knee to anyone in almost 1,000 years and I don\u2019t believe we should start now. We have never surrendered to anyone in this House and we never, ever will, including next Tuesday night. According to Sam McBride, political editor of the Belfast News Letter, the civil service in Northern Ireland has contingency plans for fuel rationing. Officials have been asked to volunteer should it be necessary to set up 75 \u201cstrategically located\u201d filling stations supplying \u201cpriority\u201d vehicles if there is a major oil supply emergency. According to Stormont, this is routine planning, rather than Brexit-related, McBride reports. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a useful Twitter thread on what the EU might, or might not, do to help Theresa May get her deal through the Commons. It starts here. The Commons debate is now over. Hunt says leave-voting Labour voters will never forgive the party if it uses parliamentary procedures to stop Brexit. Holding a second referendum would undermine trust in politics, he says. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens intervenes. She asks Hunt if he accepts that the false claims and cheating by the leave campaign in the referendum undermined trust. Hunt says the allegations about broken rules are a matter for the Electoral Commission. But there were false claims on both sides of the campaign, he says. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is speaking now. He says Thornberry confirmed that Labour wants to end free movement. But he says Labour also wants frictionless trade, as if it were still in the single market. Both of those will not be possible, he says. Hunt intervenes again: does Labour want end free movement? Thornberry says, when the UK leaves the EU, free movement will end. What Labour wants after that is a fair migration system and managed migration, she says. In the Commons we\u2019re now on the frontbench winding up speeches. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is speaking for Labour. She says Jeremy Hunt told the Today programme this morning that the government wanted assurances from the EU on the backstop with legal force. She challenges Hunt to confirm this when he speaks after her, and says, if there are legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement, the government should be tabling amendments to the EU Withdrawal Act. But there won\u2019t be legally binding changes to the agreement, she says. She says at various times Hunt has appeared to dismiss a no-deal Brexit as unaccepable, and at other times he has said it might be necessary. Hunt intervenes. He says he has always been consistent. He says he does not want no deal, but he thinks that in the end, even if there were one, the UK would be able to prosper. And Dominic Grieve, one of the few Conservatives publicly calling for a second referendum on Brexit, is also urging Theresa May to delay Brexit, the BBC reports. Grieve was one one of the speakers at the second referendum convention this morning also addressed by Caroline Lucas. (See 1.37pm.) Some cabinet ministers think it is increasingly likely that Brexit will have to be delayed, Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil report in the Evening Standard, because there is not enough time to pass all the legislation required by 29 March. Their report goes on: A backlog of at least six essential bills that must be passed before Britain leaves the European Union has left ministers convinced the timetable will be extended. They include the much-delayed immigration bill. Even asking MPs to sit at weekends and cancel their half-term holiday in February may not provide enough time to avoid asking for a delay, several sources have disclosed. In an interview for the Telegraph\u2019s Brexit podcast, the pro-European Conservative Nicky Morgan says Theresa May should give up trying to win the supporter of hardline Tory Brexiters and the DUP and instead try to get Labour MPs to support her deal. According to Christopher Hope\u2019s write-up (paywall), Morgan said: The prime minister will have to decide \u2013 and some of us have been urging her for months \u2013 she either carries on trying to win over the DUP and some of the hardest Brexiteers in the Conservative party, or she builds a cross party consensus ... Brexit should be a non-party political issue \u2026 At the end of the day if we want to deliver this and get the right result for the country then it should be a cross party effort. What we have seen in the past few months is backbenchers talking to each other, that is now in the open because amendments are being signed on a cross party basis. Anti-Brexit campaigners have been speaking in London at an event called The Convention: Another Vote is Possible. One of the highlights was a speech from Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, who began with a tribute to the 17.4m people who voted to leave - \u201cI also want to say a genuine thank you to the 17.4m people who gave the establishment such a well-deserved kicking in 2016\u201d - and who went on to set out a blueprint for running a radical, remain campaign in a second referendum. The full speech is here, and it is well worth reading. Here are the key points. Lucas said there was a valid message behind the leave vote in 2016. Many people took the question they were being asked to mean \u201cShould the country go on being run in the way that it is?\u2019 And they voted \u201cNO!\u201d with a collective howl of rage. That response was justified then - and it\u2019s justified now. For some, it might have been mixed up with fear, even bigotry, and an impossible longing for the past. But there was - and is - a core message at the heart of the Brexit vote. That the status quo in this country is intolerable for huge numbers of people. That the social contract is broken and the power game is rigged. It is right and reasonable to be furious. She said the reluctance of the remain campaign in 2016 to make the case for free movement amounted to a \u201cmoral failure\u201d. Changing the Brexit conversation means proudly celebrating free movement - and the opportunities it\u2019s given to individuals and to our country. It was not just a political failure, but a moral failure, that saw the Remain campaign hide away from talking about migration in 2016 - preferring instead to bandy about economic threats, rather than engage in a serious debate on this pressing issue. It also means making those opportunities of free movement genuinely available to all - when for vast swathes of people today they\u2019re not even imaginable. She said the \u201clie\u201d at the heart of the leave campaign was the claim that Brexit would address inequality. As inequality spins out of control, people in all classes feel helpless. That\u2019s why the slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d had such resonance. It promised agency in a system in which the rich and powerful, who clearly do have agency, were telling us that the market rules, and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do. In short, this is a country where what dictates your success isn\u2019t how hard you work, or how much you care. It\u2019s not your passion or your commitment. No. This is a country where your success is dictated by your postcode, the income of your parents, the year in which you were born. She said any new referendum campaign could not be won by a \u201cProject Fear\u201d approach. The 2016 result should tell us that \u201cproject fear\u201d won\u2019t win people over. They want hope ... To stand any chance of winning a People\u2019s Vote, we have to abandon all association with a vapid centrism that has failed to deliver for so many people, and would fail again. We have to think and act anew. To start using the ideas and language now that will set the tone for a very different kind of referendum campaign. One that\u2019s hopeful, inclusive, energetic and radical. One we can all feel part of and one that appeals to our hearts as well as our heads. She said that parliament should be moved out of London as part of sweeping programme of constitutional change intended to \u201cgenuinely democratise the UK\u201d. One of the best ways to \u201ctake back control\u201d is to rid ourselves of a winner takes all politics, and an outdated electoral system that systematically shuts people out ... No democratic renewal is complete without proportional representation. And let\u2019s seriously explore ideas like parliament moving out of London to a city such as Leeds or Manchester \u2013 with the chance to rebalance our economy as well as our politics. The Palace of Westminster, Gothic, rat-infested, and crumbling into the Thames, has become a powerful symbol of political decay. If we mean what we say about changing this country for good, then why not make moving parliament out of London the first in a series of changes which turn the UK into a 21st century democracy? Let\u2019s learn from the inspiring way in which citizens assemblies have been used in Ireland, for example, to facilitate informed debate on contentious topics and build deep consensus and understanding. And let\u2019s ensure that democracy can no longer be undermined by fake news and post-truth advertising by introducing new ground-breaking digital democracy laws. Here is Channel 4 News\u2019 Michael Crick on what the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey is saying about his telephone call with Theresa May about Brexit yesterday. On a visit to Romania, which currently has the presidency of the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said the EU would be offering the UK \u201cclarifications\u201d relating to the Brexit deal, but not a renegotiation. He said: We are checking with Downing Street what the clarifications could amount to. They should not be confused with a renegotiation. He added: I don\u2019t like the prospect of a no-deal. It would be a catastrophe. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, has sidestepped a question about whether the party would be for or against Brexit in a general election camapaign. On the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland this morning, he was asked directly about what the party\u2019s stance would be if a general election was to be called. He replied: It\u2019s not a matter of campaigning for or against Brexit. There has been a referendum in which people overall decided that we should leave the European Union and I have said repeatedly that I think the job of elected politicians is to look at the best way of extracting the best deal under those circumstances. Our policy on Brexit so far has been to try to secure the best deal. The manifesto of the Labour party will be decided by the Labour Party and we\u2019ve got a process for determining that. My view is that we had a referendum in 2016, our job has been to try to get the best deal. In response the SNP deputy leader Keith Brown described Labour\u2019s position on Brexit as \u201claughable\u201d. He said: Labour have proved that they are gearing up, once again, to sell-out the people of Scotland - this time on Brexit. Their members must be in despair. Demanding a general election without a position on the biggest political issue of the day is the height of incompetence. In fact, it\u2019s laughable. Downing Street has responded to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s remarks on Today this morning. (See 9.35am.) A spokeswoman insisted to journalists at the lobby briefing that the foreign secretary had not said parliament would block no deal - but that it would \u201ctry very hard\u201d to do so. The default position is that if the deal is not voted for, the UK will leave without one, and the only way to avoid that is to vote for her deal, she added. Asked whether article 50 might have to be extended to allow time to pass all the necessary legislation, either in the event of Theresa May\u2019s deal being passed, or a no deal, the spokeswoman said: We are obviously making progress with the legislation required in either scenario, and we will ensure that either way, we will have passed the necessary legislation - we will make sure the time is made available. Pressed on an extension, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s government policy that that\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to do.\u201d The spokeswoman added that MPs could still expect to hear from the EU27 before next Tuesday\u2019s meaningful vote. I think in terms of the assurances that the PM has said will be forthcoming, that will happen in the lead-up to the vote. Government sources suggest that is likely to happen on Monday. In the comments rscnrscn asks this. It\u2019s a fair question and merits a reply. The Lib Dems have already tabled two amendments to the Brexit deal motion being put to a vote next Tuesday calling for a people\u2019s vote. One is an amendment to the Labour amendment, and another is an amendment to the motion in its own right. We don\u2019t know yet whether they will be put to a vote. One possibility is that the Lib Dems might withdraw them (ie, choose voluntarily not to put them to a vote if given the chance). The People\u2019s Vote campaign want them to do that. That\u2019s because People\u2019s Vote don\u2019t want the vote on this issue to take place until Labour is committed to whipping its MPs in favour, and they fear that if the vote happens on Tuesday, and the second referendum option gets defeated (perhaps by a large majority), then the campaign will lose momentum. People\u2019s Vote would like to see a vote on a no confidence motion soon, because if the government were to win that, then at that point Jeremy Corbyn would come under pressure to formally back a second referendum. Another possibility is that the Lib Dem amendments won\u2019t get called anyway. But if there is no vote on a second referendum next week, then it is quite likely we will get one soon, following the vote which means MPs would have to debate \u2018plan B\u2019 options by Monday week. If there is a vote in the Commons before MPs have voted on a no confidence motion (which could conceivably trigger a general election - Corbyn\u2019s preferred option), then I expect Labour to order its MPs to abstain. That is what happened when there was a vote on a second referendum amendment to the EU withdrawal bill in December 2017. Only nine Labour MPs rebelled, and backed the amendment, and it was defeated by 319 votes to 23. If there were a vote now, then I would expect dozens of Labour MPs to defy a whip to abstain and to vote in favour, and perhaps a dozen or more Tories. But even with the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Caroline Lucas also voting for a second referendum, I can\u2019t see the People\u2019s Vote camp having any chance of winning, or even coming close, without Labour whipping its MPs in favour. There is much more support for the idea now than there was in December 2017, but MPs do not rebel against the party whip lightly, and it is important to remember than many MPs in the party - remainers as well as the relatively small number of leavers - have deep reservations about a second referendum. (It is also worth pointing out that some in Labour claim that, even if the party did whip its MPs in favour, there is no guarantee a second referendum motion would pass because a large number of Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum would abstain, or vote against.) Even if MPs were to pass a motion calling for a second referendum, it would still not happen without legislation. And for that to happen you would need a government willing to draft a bill, allow time for it to be debated, and whip its MPs to vote for it. Personally, I find it almost impossible to imagine Theresa May, or any other Conservative leader, doing all of that. I also find it almost fairly hard imagine Corbyn going through that process too, although if the Labour party membership had him in an armlock, in those circumstances it could happen. At least he leads a party that wants a second referendum. But only around 10% of Conservative members support the idea, according to one survey, which is why it is such a remote possibility. Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative former defence minister, is speaking in the Brexit debate now. He starts by questioning Diane Abbott\u2019s decision to raise the Dearlove/Guthrie letter. (See 10.15am and 10.26am.) He says he has looked into the claims very carefully and concluded that the letter is \u201cnot only incorrect but ... also inappropriate\u201d. He says he deeply regrets the fact that it was written. He is now backing the deal. He says the public are getting fed up with this debate and want MPs to make a decision. He praises Theresa May\u2019s deal as a clever compromise and he says if MPs reject it, \u201cthey will with absolute certainty be voting for chaos, with the outcome very likely the opposite of what they intended.\u201d Abbott is still speaking, but the Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones intervenes to raise a point about the Dearlove/Guthrie letter. (See 10.15am.) He quotes this tweet from Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, saying the claims in their letter are wrong. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, also intervenes. He says he has a lot of respect for Sir Richard Dearlove and Lord Guthrie, but that their claims in this letter \u201care wrong\u201d. He says there is nothing in the withdrawal agreement that affects the UK\u2019s membership of Nato, or its security alliance with the US and its other \u201cfive eyes\u201d partners. In response, Abbott does not defend the arguments in the letter fully, but she says that these issues are at least debatable and that the Brexit deal does not provide enough assurances. She also says that one of Labour\u2019s six tests for the Brexit deal relates to security (\u201cdoes it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime?\u201d). She says the deal fails this test, because it does not necessarily protect national security and maintain the UK\u2019s ability to deal with cross-border crime. In the Commons Abbott has just raised this letter, from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, and Lord Guthrie, the former head of the army, saying Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement would threaten national security. Abbott says Dearlove and Guthrie \u201cknow a lot more about security\u201d than either Sajid Javid, the home secretary, or indeed herself. In the Commons Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is speaking now. She says that Labour wants to \u201chonour the referendum vote\u201d. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has become the third cabinet minister in recent days to signal that she would resign rather than support a government implementing a no-deal Brexit. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Rudd said she was \u201ccommitted\u201d to ensuring the UK does not leave the EU without a deal. Asked whether she agreed with a previous claim from Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, that the UK could thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit, she replied: This is a strong and great country, we will find a way to succeed, but I do not think that no deal would be good for this country and I\u2019m committed to making sure we find an alternative. Rudd declined three times to say that she would remain in the government if it opted for a no-deal Brexit. On the final occasion, when Today\u2019s Justin Webb asked if she would quit if Theresa May implemented a no-deal Brexit, Rudd cut him short by saying: \u201cThank you very much, Justin.\u201d Yesterday Greg Clark, the business secretary, signalled that he would resign if the government opted for no deal. And David Gauke, the justice secretary, has also effectively said the same thing. Labour\u2019s Mike Gapes intervenes. He asks Javid to admit that the claim by Vote Leave in the EU referendum, that 75m Turks could come to the UK if the UK stayed in the EU and Turkey joined, was wrong. Javid says it was wrong. He says people from Vote Leave have admitted as much. That seems to be a reference to Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who has spoken about his reservations about this aspect of the Vote Leave campaign. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is opening the debate now. He says people voted in the referendum to take back control of immigration policy and to ensure immigration is reduced to sustainable levels. The policy announced in the immigration white paper at the end of last year will achieve that, he says. The Commons Brexit debate is about to start. But, first, there are a series of points of order. Labour MPs are complaining about the fact that Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is announcing changes to her policy on universal credit in a speech outside the Commons, not in a statement to MPs. John Bercow, the speaker, has just effectively reprimanded her, saying major policy changes should be announced to parliament first. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and he made an interesting assertion. The chances of Brexit being halted are going up, he claimed. Here are the key points. Hunt claimed that events in the Commons this week showed the chances of Brexit being stopped are rising. Speaking about the vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal next Tuesday, he said: The parliamentary arithmetic is challenging. But, also, the choices are very clear. And I think after this week things have changed. Up till now I think people have quite rightly been worrying about the prospects of no deal. Now there is another possibility coming into sight, which is actually no Brexit. And why is that? We have a government that is committed to delivering Brexit. But it doesn\u2019t have a majority. He also claimed that, if Brexit were halted, the consequences for democracy would be very severe. If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis. And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit. I\u2019m saying this would be [an] incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain\u2019s reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found we weren\u2019t able to do it. If we were, as a political class, not to deliver Brexit, that would be a fundamental breach of trust between the people and the politicians. I think that is something that we would regret for many, many generations. For many Guardian readers, the claim that the odds on Britain staying in the EU are shortening may come as a welcome piece of good news. But it was fairly obvious that Hunt was not speaking with the intention of cheering remainers. Instead, he wants to scare Tory Brexiters into supporting May\u2019s deal. This is not the first time the government has talked about the possibility of Brexit being halted. Theresa May explicitly raised this as one of three possible Brexit outcomes when she addressed the nation after the five-hour cabinet meeting that approved her Brexit plan. But she since she has been wary about repeating the claim, sometimes admitting that Brexit could be stopped and at other times declaring that the the UK will leave the EU on 29 March come what may. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston suspects that she may not be happy with Hunt saying the choice is now just her deal or remain. Hunt said John Bercow, the speaker, was now actively working against the government. He said: And we have seen this week that there is a speaker who is willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity. He cited this as one reason why remaining in the EU has become more likely. Hunt claimed parliament was not likely to allow a no-deal Brexit. He said: I think it\u2019s now looking much less likely that parliament would allow a no-deal outcome anyway. We have seen from this week that parliament has the ability to assert itself and to shape outcomes. I think parliament is very committed to try to stop no-deal, but I think we have to recognise that there is a deal on the table, it does broadly deliver the Brexit people voted for, and if we don\u2019t find a way to get this through, we are taking some very big risks. This was another part of Hunt\u2019s argument as to why Brexit being abandoned has become more likely. His claim is arguable, although not wholly persuasive. Although the Commons has flexed his muscles this week, it is still a mistake to think that, just because a majority of MPs oppose a no-deal Brexit, a no-deal Brexit cannot happen. I explained why in a lengthy post here towards the end of last year. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, opens day three of the Brexit debate. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, will close the debate at about 2pm. 9.30am: Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, speaks at a convention on a second EU referendum. Other speakers include Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, and the singer Jarvis Cocker. 10.15am: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, she will announce a partial rollback to the two-child limit on universal credit payments. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I finish, after 4pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

There has long been the sense that he has been anticipating a second career, away from the courts and sweaty locker rooms.</p> <p>In 2013 he set up his sports management consultancy 77 with his business advisers Matt Gentry and Gawain Davies.

      "bodyText": "It is almost 14 years since Andy Murray\u2019s grand slam career began against George Bastl on Wimbledon\u2019s old No 2 Court, known as the graveyard of champions. Soon, following all the tears and tributes, the glorious career of Britain\u2019s greatest tennis player will also be laid to rest and he will have to work out what to do next. Pundit? Commentator? Tech investor? Perhaps even politician? Mark Borkowski, a PR expert who has worked with Michael Jackson, Van Morrison and a host of other stars and brands, believes Murray\u2019s options are vast. \u201cThere is almost nothing he couldn\u2019t do next,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we look for in PR these days is authenticity and raw emotion, and Murray has got that in droves. Sponsors will be salivating at having him because he is so open and honest and because he is an inspiration to so many people.\u201d For more than a decade Murray had a preternatural desire to be the best player in the world. Then, after his hip injury in 2017, his drive switched to returning to the sport he loves. A big issue will be how he copes with losing his primary reason to get up in the morning. Andr\u00e9 Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School, says: \u201cDuring their successful years, sports stars invest heavily in their identity as high performers and often neglect other sides of themselves. That means when they quit they have no other identity to fall back on.\u201d That cannot be said about Murray. There has long been the sense that he has been anticipating a second career, away from the courts and sweaty locker rooms. In 2013 he set up his sports management consultancy 77 with his business advisers Matt Gentry and Gawain Davies. Among others, he represents and mentors the teenagers Aidan McHugh and Katie Swan who are tipped to be the next generation of British tennis talent. Murray also has a keen interest in technology and in 2015 partnered with crowdfunding platform Seedrs. Last year he told Forbes that he has stakes in more than 30 ventures, the latest of which is Deuce, a mobile app that helps tennis players find courts and coaching sessions around the UK, making it easier and more affordable to find a game. An obvious next step would be to step in front of the camera, following in the footsteps of Tim Henman and Gary Lineker. Murray certainly looked a natural as a pundit during last year\u2019s Wimbledon, not only forthright and wise but witty with it. He also excelled as a co-commentator during Rafael Nadal\u2019s epic quarter-final with Juan Mart\u00edn del Petro, although few would have watched it given England were playing Croatia in a World Cup semi-final at the same time. There is certainly scope for Murray to be tennis\u2019s answer to Gary Neville, although he has no great desire to be in front of the camera and is likely to dip in and out rather than make it a full-time job. Whatever happens next Murray\u2019s finances are rosy. According to Forbes magazine, he will finish his career with at least \u00a3128m in career earnings, including \u00a348m in prize money and nearly \u00a380m in earnings from appearance fees, bonuses and endorsements from blue-chip companies such as Under Armour, Head and Jaguar. While those numbers will obviously take a hit, retirement does not always mean a steep loss of earnings. The heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill, for instance, made \u00a34.2m in 2017 \u2013 a year after she retired \u2013 compared to \u00a33.5m in 2016 when she won an Olympic silver medal. It would be no surprise to see Murray occasionally get involved in sports politics. Given his dedication to Team GB it is understood that the British Olympic Association is keen to formally harness his ambassadorial support since it has seen at first-hand his ability to inspire athletes and the public. Borkowski, meanwhile, believes that Murray would be a natural politician. The fact he is a three-times winner of the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year Award also shows he has plenty of support among the public. \u201cMurray is accessible, is a vigorous supporter of women\u2019s rights and has a dry sense of humour so I could certainly see him as politician,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe fact that he is a little unpolished \u2013 and he says things as they are \u2013 is no bad thing either.\u201d Long before then there is likely to be a trip to Buckingham Palace to have his OBE formally upgraded to the knighthood that was bestowed on him two years ago. And in the coming years it would be no surprise if he replaced Leon Smith as Great Britain\u2019s Davis Cup captain. But whatever happens next, Murray will remain a compelling, and vital, figure in the British sporting landscape.",

The Norway plan has attracted renewed interest in recent days. On the Tory benches, the thoughtful Conservative <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-01-10/debates/159740E3-991B-4DF4-A29C-D04B2F1CE10F/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Act#contribution-D895FC4C-6926-4A44-A923-C28F1E421302\" title=\"\">George Freeman</a> announced he\u2019d back May and then, when that plan failed, support Efta membership. Meanwhile, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is said to have had friendly conversations with the Norway group, and there have been other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/10/norway-plus-labour-brexit\" title=\"\">public smoke signals</a> in that direction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a36ed34b-e7af-4063-b6fb-655028a7046d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5FNey_iUrl8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>McDonnell\u2019s move suggests a shift in the Labour leadership\u2019s thinking. The realisation has come that allowing a hard, or even no-deal, Brexit won\u2019t just be blamed on the Tories: Labour too will be held responsible, including by its own devotedly pro-remain members. Accordingly, any earlier attraction to no deal as a route to economic collapse and calamity, after which the British public would thirst for a radical Labour government, has faded. On the other hand, the high command of the party does not much like the prospect of a second referendum \u2013 partly because they fear it would alienate leave voters, and partly because they regard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/26/letter-jeremy-corbyn-peoples-vote-brexit-labour-gina-miller\" title=\"\">People\u2019s Vote campaign</a> warily, imagining it as a Blairite shadow army.</p> \n<p>And yet it\u2019s not easy for them to jump into the Norway lifeboat, either. True, Britain would stay in the single market, which avoids the economic self-harm of Brexit. But we would have lost our seat at the EU table, deprived of a voice and a veto.

And there\u2019s no guarantee our European neighbours would even allow a country of Britain\u2019s size to join Efta. Besides, people\u2019s vote campaigners suspect some Tories are attempting to use the appeal of Norway to get Brexit across the line, only to harden our exit from the EU once we\u2019ve formally left on 29 March. As one puts it: \u201cYou think you\u2019re going for a nice weekend trip to Oslo, only to wake up in the frozen tundra of Canada.\u201d</p> \n<p>One remain MP is upfront, admitting he might well resort to Norway eventually, but not yet. Only when remain is certifiably dead as an option, if we leave on 29 March, will he countenance it. While there\u2019s still a chance to stay in the EU, he\u2019ll fight any form of Brexit, including even the softest, Norway version. </p> \n<p>Which leaves only one lifeboat: a public vote. The case for a second referendum suffered a blow this week, at least among the 1.3 million who watched James Graham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/you-whitewashed-the-corruption-james-graham-and-carole-cadwalladr-on-brexit-the-uncivil-war\" title=\"\">Brexit drama on Channel 4</a>. It was a reminder of just how dispiriting and sour an affair the 2016 campaign was. No one could watch that and want to relive the experience. And because Britain still lacks any equivalent to the US\u2019s Mueller investigation, we haven\u2019t got to the bottom of either the methods or funding of the leave campaign \u2013 including its use of social media, the focus of the Channel 4 film. We can hardly be confident that the same tricks won\u2019t be used again.</p> \n<p>And yet, what other escape do we have from the looming iceberg? This is the question that now presses on MPs with urgency, Labour MPs especially, the party leadership most of all. Rarely for an opposition, they can shape events. They can steer the country to safety. If they don\u2019t, the ship of state is sailing towards catastrophe \u2013 and it\u2019s getting nearer every day.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

This is the question that now presses on MPs with urgency, Labour MPs especially, the party leadership most of all. Rarely for an opposition, they can shape events. They can steer the country to safety. If they don\u2019t, the ship of state is sailing towards catastrophe \u2013 and it\u2019s getting nearer every day. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

The view was shared by Caroline Lucas MP, who was a guest on Dimbleby\u2019s final episode in December and knows well the lurching feeling as the opening credits roll (\u201cIt\u2019s when you hear the music. It\u2019s the most terrifying thing you ever do, and many politicians will say the same thing\u201d). \u201cWhat I liked about Fiona Bruce was that she had a quiet authority,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cShe was able to keep order and assert herself as necessary, but she did it in quite a light-touch way. She wasn\u2019t letting anyone get away with anything, but it didn\u2019t feel obtrusive, it was just helpful. Politicians, when they go on that programme, need to be held to account, and I think she did it very well.\u201d Was it significant that Bruce is the first female presenter in 40 years? \u201cThese panel programmes where women in the past have been marginalised, it\u2019s so good to see a majority of women and a female chair. But I don\u2019t think there was anything gender specific about the way she was conducting it.\u201d Ayesha Hazarika, a political commentator and former Labour advisor who has appeared on the programme twice, felt Bruce\u2019s quietly cool manner had brought a different tone to the show. \u201cShe was much more of an active chair than there has been in the past. I think there has been a tendency a little bit to let people scrap and shout over each other. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was because it was the first one, but I thought everybody just behaved a bit better; she didn\u2019t let people get away with the normal shenanigans where the strongest voice and the most confident person can trot out soundbite after soundbite.\u201d For a programme that pulls in around 2 million viewers and finishes close to midnight, Question Time retains a curious place in the national consciousness \u2013 disliked by many as an angry bear pit, but still, even after almost 1,400 editions, appointment-to-view television for many. \u201cIt\u2019s a programme people love to hate, don\u2019t they?\u201d says Lucas. \u201cEven the people who hate it watch it so they can say they hate it.\u201d It is also one of the few occasions where ordinary people can regularly challenge those in power on their performance, \u201cand surely our goal should be to make that normal again,\u201d notes Polly Mackenzie, the chief executive of the thinktank Demos, who has also appeared on the panel. \u201cI like Question Time. If it was the sum total of all political accountability in our national life, it would obviously be a disaster, but it\u2019s just a show.\u201d As for having a woman in charge after four decades, \u201cit\u2019s great,\u201d says Mackenzie. \u201cBut what would be really brilliant would be for it to be unremarkable.\u201d",

You cannot put him in a box. You need to give freedom and trust him. Like my dog, in the park. I trust my dog. I say, \u2018Go, I trust you\u2019.

We hope that he can be here for a long time. I think Christian is a fantastic player. I was in Copenhagen in the summer. I spent time with Jesus (Perez), my wife and Christian - very nice restaurant. We all hope that Christian will agree with the club a long-term contract because he\u2019s a great player.</p> </blockquote> <p> And here\u2019s what Pochettino had to say about Solskjaer\u2019s exploits at the Nou Camp in 1999:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember him when he scored the second goal in the injury-time and how I shouted the goal of Manchester United, that was unbelievable. We were neutral people watching a fantastic game. I have good memories of him. On Sunday we are going to meet at Wembley when 20 years ago I was shouting a goal that he scored for Manchester United and now we are going to play them at Wembley.</p> </blockquote> <p>And does Pochettino think Solskjaer will have added motivation to beat him, given that the Spurs manager is the favourite to succeed him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The motivation is always going to be there. Of course when you\u2019re a manager or coach you cannot be focused on all the rumours. The most important thing is the motivation that we have to do our job in our best way. Of course Manchester is going to come on Sunday trying to win. Of course for him it\u2019s a massive motivation or challenge to manage Manchester United, like for me it\u2019s a massive challenge to be in front for this football club, Tottenham. Always the motivation is to win because we\u2019re so competitive.

The likelihood of J\u00fcrgen Klopp throwing 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever into the centre of his defence is unlikely, despite his impressive debut against Wolves.

Be sure to check back in on the site later to follow updates from Leeds v Derby with our minute-by-minute report. It should be extra spicy. Thanks for reading. Enjoy your weekend. Benjamin Oates has put forward another five footballers who should be at least 35: Aaron Lennon (31) James Vaughan (30) Niko Kranjcar (34) Paddy Madden (28) Vincent Kompany (32) And for some reason, Brian Hudner has spent the afternoon reimagining the Liverpool team with a series of local bands and artists. Echo and Bunnymignolet Fab(four)inho Gomez Orchestral Manhoevers in the Dark Tremz Alexander-Arnold Gini and the Pacemakers Billy J Kramer and the Dekeitas Shack The La(lana)s The Farmino Half Man\u00e9 Half Biscuit My main problem with this, is that Virgil van Dijk, Allison and Mo Salah miss out. Mauricio Pochettino has been in good form today, enthusiastically talking about Argentinian football spies, why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave him great memories when Manchester United won the treble in 1999 and how Christian Eriksen reminds him of his faithful Rhodesian Ridgeback. Eriksen has been biding his time on signing a new deal amid reported interest from Real Madrid: Christian is a very special person and you need to give him freedom, like on the pitch. You cannot put him in a box. You need to give freedom and trust him. Like my dog, in the park. I trust my dog. I say, \u2018Go, I trust you\u2019. And Christian is a very clever person and of course there\u2019s going to be a decision from him, from the club, from different parts and I hope he can be committed to the club long-term. We hope that he can be here for a long time. I think Christian is a fantastic player. I was in Copenhagen in the summer. I spent time with Jesus (Perez), my wife and Christian - very nice restaurant. We all hope that Christian will agree with the club a long-term contract because he\u2019s a great player. And here\u2019s what Pochettino had to say about Solskjaer\u2019s exploits at the Nou Camp in 1999: I remember him when he scored the second goal in the injury-time and how I shouted the goal of Manchester United, that was unbelievable. We were neutral people watching a fantastic game. I have good memories of him. On Sunday we are going to meet at Wembley when 20 years ago I was shouting a goal that he scored for Manchester United and now we are going to play them at Wembley. And does Pochettino think Solskjaer will have added motivation to beat him, given that the Spurs manager is the favourite to succeed him: The motivation is always going to be there. Of course when you\u2019re a manager or coach you cannot be focused on all the rumours. The most important thing is the motivation that we have to do our job in our best way. Of course Manchester is going to come on Sunday trying to win. Of course for him it\u2019s a massive motivation or challenge to manage Manchester United, like for me it\u2019s a massive challenge to be in front for this football club, Tottenham. Always the motivation is to win because we\u2019re so competitive. We\u2019re people that love to win and hate to lose, and always when you play a friendly game or a competitive game like Sunday always it\u2019s about winning. You want more match previews? Take two helpings then, go on: So, what have Leeds had to say about the Derby spying accusations then? Yes, that\u2019s the sound of silence. Cesc F\u00e0bregas will be confirmed as a Monaco player in the next few hours, according to L\u2019Equipe, which means he would be available to play against Marseille on Sunday evening. Thierry Henry could really do with freshening his squad up having overseen only two league wins since he took over on 13 October. He\u2019s been linked with a move for Michy Batshuayi too, also of Chelsea but who is on loan at Valencia. And how is F\u00e0bregas only 31? I swear he made his Arsenal debut when poll tax was the big political issue of the day. He\u2019s in my top five of players who should at least be 35: 1) Lee Cattermole (only 30!) 2) Cesc F\u00e0bregas (still only 31) 3) Diego Costa (still only 30) 4) Phil Jones (26 years of age, yup) 5) Thomas M\u00fcller (he\u2019s 29!) There was only ever going to be one subject for The Fiver to write about this afternoon. So here\u2019s our (sometimes) funny and (always) free (occasionally) tea-timely football email\u2019s take on the Leeds v Derby spying row: And why not sign up for The Fiver here if you haven\u2019t done so already: Pep Guardiola has said Manchester City will do all they can to support Gabriel Jesus after the 21-year-old\u2019 striker\u2019s family had to fly back to Brazil after their visas expired. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s story: If you thought the Derby-Leeds spy row was weird, get on to this from Palermo. The Serie B leaders have denied that former Bolton striker Dean Holdsworth is their new sporting director. In relation to some news reported today by local newspapers, the U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo announces that no changes have been made to the position of Director of the Technical Area of the Club which remains entrusted to Mr Rino Foschi, who keeps his position. At the same time, it is specified that Mr Dean Holdsworth is a consultant for Global Futures Sports Ltd in the staff of Mr Clive Richardson. It was announced on Saturday 29 December that Sport Capital Group Investments Ltd had completed a takeover of Palermo. The consortium involves Clive Richardson, who was part of the Global Futures Sports venture, for whom Dean Holdsworth is an advisor. Wayne Hennessey has the full backing of Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson who insists the Wales goalkeeper did not make a Nazi salute during a night out. Hennessey appeared to perform the gesture in a picture posted on Instagram by Eagles teammate Max Meyer as the players celebrated their FA Cup win against Grimsby on Saturday. The 31-year-old denied doing so, instead claiming on Twitter that he was calling out to the person taking the photograph \u201cto get on with it\u201d and \u201cat the same time put my hand over my mouth to make the sound carry\u201d. The Football Association is looking into the incident, but Hodgson is convinced by the player\u2019s explanation. I believe him totally. I have no reason to disbelieve him,\u201d the Palace boss said. The other players had no awareness of anything inappropriate, so much so that they had no idea before the photo was posted that it had happened. Wayne has explained himself very satisfactorily to both me and the club. I know Wayne, I know the type of man he is and I have no hesitation whatsoever in backing him and backing his version of the story. Hodgson also denied making any move for Jermain Defoe, after the striker claimed that he rejected a move to Selhurst Park in favour of joining Rangers. That\u2019s not true. We had no interest in Jermain Defoe. As with a number of strikers, I saw Defoe\u2019s name mentioned in relation to the club. Nathaniel Clyne has channelled his inner John Lennon in this conciliatory response to Neil Warnock over his decision to join Bournemouth over Cardiff. My intention wasn\u2019t to hurt anyone. It\u2019s down to footballing reasons. Me and Neil Warnock have a good relationship. I enjoyed working with him at Crystal Palace and I have a lot of respect for the man. Get your West Ham v Arsenal team news here! What kind of reception will Marko Arnautovi\u0107 get from the home fans after his agent said he wants to be allowed to leave and trouser loads of cash challenge for titles in China? Honk! Not surprisingly, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been named Premier League manager of the month for December and Virgil Van Dijk has gobbled up the player-of-the-month gong. A defender has not won the player-of-the-month award since March 2013, when Jan Vertonghen took it home. Look at Virgil, making defending cool again. \u201cToday\u2019s spying row is tremendous fun of course,\u201d writes David Hopkins. \u201cHowever, how much more fun would it have been had these still been the days of the Clough v Revie rivalry? I\u2019m sure Frank Lampard can raise his voice when he needs to, but imagine what fun Mr Clough would have had with it.\u201d I expect Clough would have stormed into the Leeds dressing room with a stepladder and checked for bugs before throttling Bielsa had he been in charge of Derby . Over to Spain now, where Real Madrid are in danger of not qualifying for the Champions League. It\u2019s unthinkable, right? Well, it would be if they were playing well, but as our Spanish football correspondent Sid Lowe detailed recently, they\u2019re just not very good. Madrid, in fifth, play sixth-placed Real Betis away tomorrow. Betis are breathing down their neck. Solari will probably be grateful that the game is away as the atmosphere at the Bernab\u00e9u in recent games has been one of resignation. Madrid beat Leganes 3-0 in the first leg of the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday. But there was still no starting place for Isco despite injuries to key players. Here\u2019s what he had to say about that: \u201cThere\u2019s 24 players and my duty is to pick the players. It\u2019s not the most pleasant duty. Why Isco didn\u2019t play today as starter? Today we made a big game. The Betis match is bigger, so we can probably expect Isco to sit on the bench again for that one. Genoa coach \u2018hid like Rambo\u2019 to spy on rivals Back in 2013, Italian side Genoa suspended one of their coaches after he was found spying on a training session held by city rivals Sampdoria. Luca De Pra, a youth-team coach, was said to be hiding in bushes while dressed in camouflage gear. In a statement, Sampdoria said De Pra was hiding like \u201cRambo under a tree\u201d. Genoa, who denied any knowledge of De Pra\u2019s activities, won the ensuing match 3-0. Man detained ahead of England World Cup semi-final A man was arrested ahead of England\u2019s World Cup semi-final against Croatia last summer, suspected of spying on Gareth Southgate\u2019s side. The man was accused of acting suspiciously on a roof, 180 metres away from England\u2019s training base. He was asked to delete panorama photos and then released without charge. Honduras send up the drones Honduras accused Australia of spying on their training session before the second leg of their World Cup 2018 playoff match. \u201cAustralia spy on the official training of the Honduras team from a drone; this caused discontent amongst the team and its representatives\u201d said a tweet from the Honduran Football Federation. It\u2019s was not the first time Honduras had been spooked by drones. According to Honduran newspaper La Prensa, the national team flew defence drones of their own in 2016 to ensure their training sessions were not spied on. Team news alert! Rafael Ben\u00edtez has a depleted Newcastle squad as his side prepare to face one of his former clubs. It\u2019s all right Rafa, you\u2019ll have loads of money to sp \u2026 oh! Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking about the Leeds-Derby spy row. He said spying on opponents was common in Argentina when he was a young player there: I played for [Bielsa]. I learned a lot from him. I learned the good and the not so good. There is nothing wrong with trying to find out a little more information. When I was 17 years old, all the managers in Argentina, like [Carlos] Bilardo and many others, used to send people to watch trainings sessions. Here, maybe it is a little bit weird. But in Argentina it happened \u2026 it is not a big issue, It is not a big deal. More team news ahoy! And if you haven\u2019t read Paul Doyle\u2019s defence of Wilfried Zaha over diving accusations, it has quite the intro. Marco Silva is feeling the heat at Everton. Having been told by chairman Farhad Moshiri at the AGM that the club\u2019s position in the league is \u201cjust not good enough\u201d, he then had to listen to Everton\u2019s CEO Denise Barrett-Baxendale spell out that the ultimate ambition is to win the Premier League. So is he feeling the pressure then? With our owner and chairman we are talking every week, we don\u2019t need a General Meeting to contact each other. Every game is really tough. Even when you think it will be an easy game, it is really tough. We need to make sure we get a result [against Bournemouth]. Everyone is proud of us and our team and what we are doing. We want to win the next match. If you are achieving good results, we will have confidence to play good football. Things can change very quickly. One season is not just one month. We had a fantastic run before December. They have a tough game at home against Bournemouth on Sunday. He also played down rumours that the club was considering a bid for Chelsea\u2019s Michy Batshuayil, who has been underwhelming on loan at Valencia. For us to do something in this moment it would mean another player would leave the club and it is not something in our mind. If you do something it because something has happened in our squad.\u201d Quiz time! Mo Salah was crowned African player of the year this week. Who else won the award while playing for Liverpool? If you know the answer to this, then you\u2019ll get at least 1/10 in the sports quiz of the week. Will Derby be checking the away dressing room at Leeds for bugs and cameras tonight? In December, Spanish second-tier club Granada were accused of spying on opponents after a number of cameras were found hidden in smoke detectors in their stadium. According to El Mundo, the club blamed their former director of operations for planting them. Like Leeds, Granada are top of the second division. Hmmm. Thanks to @maxbluer for pointing me in the direction of this. The EFL have released a statement about spygate saying, well, not very much really. We are aware of the reports in relation to an incident at the training ground of Derby County. It is, of course, up to Derby County as to how they progress this matter but as of yet we have received no complaint or contact from the club. Confirmed transfer move alert! As David Hytner reported on Wednesday, Manolo Gabbiadini has joined Sampdoria for \u00a310.8m after successfully coughing for the doctor. Come and get your team news! Especially if you want an idea of how Liverpool will line up at the back against Brighton (spoiler alert: Sturridge probably isn\u2019t going to play alongside Van Dijk unfortunately). Back to the Leeds-Derby spy row. We know Marcelo Bielsa has a ridiculous level of attention to detail, but does he, or his team of coaches, have a history of spying? According to this piece in The National, as a young coach Bielsa had a teenager scramble up trees to gather information on opponents for him. Thanks James. So Maurizio Sarri has had a lot to say this afternoon. Away from his beef with Bayern over Callum Hudson-Odoi, he has spoken about more possible transfer ins and outs at Chelsea. Sarri declined to comment on persistent links with his former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain, who is on loan at Milan from Juventus. He did say if Alvaro Morata leaves, with loan moves to Sevilla and Atletico Madrid mooted, Chelsea would need a replacement. Of course, if Morata will go to another club we need a replacement. It\u2019s normal. At the moment Morata is here, so I think he has to think only to play. Because in this moment in Europe there are 300 players involved in the market and they need to think only to the next match otherwise it\u2019s impossible to play.\u201d And on Willian, who was on Thursday linked with Barcelona, he said: Willian for us is really very important. I think it\u2019s impossible to lose him in January. Sarri added Cesc Fabregas was not in a psychological condition to play, with his move to Monaco yet to be completed. Ruben Loftus-Cheek (back) is out and Morata (hamstring) is doubtful for the match with Newcastle. And with that largely unedifying slice of transfer non-news, I shall pass you back to Gregg Bakowski for your afternoon session. Cheers! Not to underrate or undermine Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s scouting but, given his limited time at Southampton, it\u2019s fair to say any new signings arriving at St Mary\u2019s this month are likely to be Bundesliga based. One player Saints have been linked with his Borussia Monchengladbach winger Patrick Herrmann; exactly the sort of fast, dynamic footballer Hasenh\u00fcttl likes in a team with not much width and has only made three league starts this season. Anyway, the 27-year-old\u2019s not for sale, according to \u2018Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl. Patrick stays. It\u2019s too late for a transfer now, considering how early the second half of the season starts. Additionally, in Ibrahima Traor\u00e9 and Fabian Johnson, we have two players on the wings who both have minor injuries. More from Maurizio Sarri, who wants Chelsea to sign two players this month but hasn\u2019t stated which positions. Think it\u2019s fair to say at least one of them is a striker... As you know very well I am not involved in the market. I spoke with the club and the club knows very well my opinion. In my opinion we need two players. Then it depends on the club decision. I don\u2019t know anything about the market day by day or minute by minute. Some further detail from the Press Association on the spying row which, while all very serious, makes for a brilliant tale... Derbyshire Police attended County\u2019s training ground on Thursday after a man was seen at the perimeter fence of the Moor Farm complex. A Derby statement read: \u201cDerby County Football Club can confirm that officers from the Derbyshire Constabulary were called to the Derby County training centre at around 11:20am on Thursday 10th January 2019 following reports of a man acting suspiciously outside the premises. \u201cIt has since been confirmed to Derby County that the individual concerned is an employee of the footballing staff at Leeds United Football Club. \u201cThe club is now in discussion with Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident. At this time no further comment will be made.\u201d Earlier a Derbyshire Police statement had confirmed a man was removed from a position near the club\u2019s training ground. It read: \u201cA man was found at the perimeter fence of Moor Farm training ground and spoken to. Officers conducted routine checks which were all above board. \u201cDespite media reports, no damage to the fence was found, and the man was stopped outside the grounds. No arrests were made and the man was sent on his way.\u201d Maurizio Sarri doesn\u2019t look an overtly happy man at the best of times but the Chelsea manager appears to been left truly cheesed off by Bayern Munich\u2019s pursuit of Callum Hudson-Odoi. Bayern\u2019s offers for the teenager winger have extended to \u00a335m with sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic admitting on Wednesday that: \u201cHe has qualities that fit our game. He can dribble, he is fast, he moves well towards the goal. He is a young player who has great potential to evolve.\u201d In response today, here\u2019s Sarri... I think that it\u2019s not professional, because they are talking about a player under contract with Chelsea. So they didn\u2019t respect our club, I think. Stephen Ganavas was our man at the Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum Stadium in Dubai as Australia beat Palestine 3-0. Returning to Spygate, it *seems* Leeds, or at least the city of, has previous with this sort of thing. Ian Fleming\u2019s inspiration for James Bond was drawn from four real-life spooks, three of which had strong links with Yorkshire. As this piece in the Yorkshire Evening Post details: \u201cGeoffrey Appleyard and Graham Hayes came from Linton on Wharfe, near Wetherby, while Gus March-Phillipps was educated at Ampleforth College, near York.\u201d Burnley fans! Fulham fans! Fantasy Football fans looking for some team news! Any fans! Here is a match preview for you... And the big ol\u2019 lad that is Southampton defender Jannik Vestergaard in conversation with David Hytner on the implications, beyond just being a bit rubbish, of Premier League relegation J\u00fcrgen Klopp has also been discussing Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup exit to Wolves Afternoon all, and thanks Greg. Some housekeeping to kick off with as Australia have just beaten Palestine 3-0 in the Asian Cup having lost their first game of the tournament to Jordan. The Socceroos play Syria in their final group match on Tuesday. I\u2019m heading for some lunch now. So I\u2019ll leave you in the capable hands of James Piercy for 30 minutes or so. According to reports, the \u201cspy\u201d escorted away from the perimeter of Derby\u2019s training ground by police had binoculars, a change of clothes and pliers. But no bucket. That\u2019s a lot of effort to find out whether Harry Wilson is injured or not. The spy row rumbles on. Derby have claimed a man escorted from the perimeter of their training ground by police on Thursday after \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d was an employee of tonight\u2019s Championship opponents Leeds. \u201cThe club is now in discussion with Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident,\u201d said a Derby statement. Perhaps having seen Manchester City beat Liverpool after Pep Guardiola lavished praise on the league-leaders, Chris Hughton has decided to try a similar glowing-tribute tactic before Brighton take on J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side. I think [Klopp] has been outstanding for the game here. When you see how their team work without the ball to get it back and the quality they show, it\u2019s orchestrated by the manager and the demands of the manager. This season shows what a great job that he has done. They are better prepared than any other team with the quality they have got. It is all led by J\u00fcrgen Klopp and they are a great team to watch \u2026 Liverpool are the best team in this league and their league position says that. Brighton will be without midfielder Bernardo (hamstring) and winger Jose Izquierdo (knee), while goalkeeper Mat Ryan and winger Alireza Jahanbakhsh are on international duty at the Asian Cup. What about Alessio Da Cruz\u2019s loan move from Parma to Spezia huh? You can keep up to speed with hipster transfer moves like this one, as well as mainstream offerings, in our shiny transfer interactive here. Philippe Coutinho scored his first goal \u2013 from the spot \u2013 for Barcelona since October in a 2-1 Copa del Rey first-leg defeat at Levante on Thursday night. He has fallen out of favour in recent La Liga games with Ernesto Valverde preferring Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 as a left-sided attacking midfielder/forward. This has caused much chuntering from Barcelona fans about how much value they are getting out of Coutinho for the \u00a3142m Bar\u00e7a lavished on him. It doesn;t sound like he\u2019s immediatly going to be sold, mind. Here\u2019s Valverde speaking about him after the match: When Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 wasn\u2019t playing, everyone was asking me about him. Now Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s playing and Coutinho isn\u2019t and the reverse is happening. When you do not play and you are not happy, you have to fight to change the situation. Today was a match for that. Coutinho is a great player who has given us a lot and will give us a lot. I will say the same about Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. It\u2019s a repetitive question with interchangeable names.\u201d Here\u2019s Paul Wilson on why David Wagner still believes Huddersfield can stay up: Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t sell\u201d Callum Wilson \u201cat any price\u201d. The striker has been linked with a \u00a350m move to Chelsea but Howe doesn\u2019t even want to entertain the idea of his top scorer leaving for Stamford Bridge, even if he was offered the moon on a stick for him. I\u2019ve been told about the speculation, it\u2019s not something I seek to read. It\u2019s a waste of time for me to do so. It\u2019s business as normal, Callum has been bright and bubbly this week so no problems there. In my opinion, and it\u2019s just my opinion I wouldn\u2019t sell at any price but I\u2019m the manager of the team trying to create the best team that I can. We desperately want to take the team forward and to do that we have got to keep our best players. Nathaniel Clyne could make his league debut for the Bournemouth against Everton on Sunday but \u00a319m signing Dominic Solanke is still recovering from a hamstring injury. Wilson, Joshua King and Ryan Fraser will undergo late fitness tests. It\u2019s officially lunchtime (in the UK). So here\u2019s something for you to read while you chomp on that sandwich. The general gist is that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will have to up his tactical game to get one over Spurs. After every major tournament it appears that Carlos Queiroz has flirted with the idea of leaving Iran due to meddling from the Iranian FA, but after the Asian Cup it seems like he really will be calling it a day. He said before the tournament \u201cwe must be protected from crocodiles\u201d, which suggests he\u2019s either not very happy with the background noise at Iran or that there was an unexpected influx of aquatic reptiles into UAE. Anyway, according to reports in Spain, he\u2019s set to take the Colombia job. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what he can do with that squad given how well he has done with players who have limited ability at Iran. Here\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp on his defensive options. He seems a little more optimistic about Matip\u2019s fitness than I thought he might be: Joel [Matip] trained yesterday first time with the team, which is already really good but we have to see. We have to decide day-by-day how he is doing. He feels good, that\u2019s good for us. Hendo [Jordan Henderson] will train today, first time, and we will see what that means exactly. Adam [Lallana] out. Dejan out. Joe [Gomez] of course out. All are improving, obviously, that is clear. I know they are not available. Robert Huth has taken a large jug of cold water and poured it all over speculation that he may be about to return to competitive football. He also found room in a short tweet for a what I think is a sly dig at Andy Murray: A blow for West Bromwich Albion\u2019s promotion push! Leicester have recalled Harvey Barnes from his loan deal. Puel had intended to leave Barnes on loan all season but he has been impressed by the forward\u2019s nine goals in 28 games and with Puel\u2019s job seemingly in the balance, he might need Barnes to bring some of that form into Leicester\u2019s forward play. Here\u2019s Hubert O\u2019Hearn: I\u2019m sure people on the internet would have nothing to say about that Hubert. Surely hiring Mauricio Pochettino would be evidence that Ed Woodward has finally twigged that Manchester United need a manager with a long-term plan. As for Solskj\u00e6r, if he continues as he is doing, he will probably not be managing Molde next season. But I doubt he will get the United job either. Lovren\u2019s absence leaves Liverpool in a little bit of a pickle defensively before they face Brighton. Joel Matip trained for the first time yesterday so is unlikely to be fit enough to start alongside Virgil van Dijk. The likelihood of J\u00fcrgen Klopp throwing 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever into the centre of his defence is unlikely, despite his impressive debut against Wolves. So, that probably leaves Fabinho as the most sensible choice in a back four. Liverpool had a similar crisis before their match against Brighton last season, when Klopp reverted to three at the back with Emre Can, Gini Wijnaldum and Dejan Lovren. Liverpool won 5-1 that day despite Wijnaldum admitting he \u201cdidn\u2019t know hat to do\u201d. It won\u2019t be as easy as for Liverpool this time. Brighton are hard to beat at home. They\u2019ve only lost to Spurs and Chelsea in the league at the Amex. The decision to let Nathaniel Clyne leave on loan appears a bit hasty now. A couple of bits of news about Dejan Lovren now. Firstly, he won\u2019t be fit for Liverpool\u2019s match at Brighton this weekend because his hamstring is still twanging. And secondly, he has been banned by Uefa for one international match for being a bit gobby on Instagram. Here\u2019s the story from Reuters: Dejan Lovren has been banned for one international match over comments he made on social media about opponents Spain following his side\u2019s 3-2 Nations League win in November. Lovren posted a video on Instagram where he appeared to brag about elbowing Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos and made insulting comments about the Spain team following the game on March 15. He also told reporters after the match that Spain were \u201crude on the pitch\u201d and bad losers. Uefa said that Lovren had fallen foul of a clause in its disciplinary rules which penalises anyone \u201cwhose conduct is insulting or otherwise violates the basic rule s of decent conduct.\u201d He was suspended from Croatia\u2019s next Uefa competition match, which is the Euro 2020 qualifiers at home to Azerbaijan in March. Despite the win, Croatia finished bottom of Group A4 after losing their final game to England and were relegated to League B of Uefa\u2019s new competition. Ben Fisher has written this piece on Sheffield United captain Billy Sharp who, on New Year\u2019s Day, scored his 220th league goal in 496 matches. That\u2019s some record. Here\u2019s the interview: It\u2019s fair to say Neil Warnock finds the January transfer window bloody annoying. Actually, he finds everything bloody annoying. In his press conference to preview the Huddersfield game he said he doesn\u2019t blame Nathaniel Clyne for joining Eddie Howe and Bournemouth ahead of Cardiff as he would have done the same. But he would have liked a phone call so that he could have had a few other irons in the fire. The latest players who look likely to slip from his grasp are Nice midfielder Adrien Tameze Marseille winger Clinton N\u2019Jie. He came out with this zinger a few moments ago: The transfer window is like climbing a mountain with butter on your hands. One day you think you are there and then you slide back down. LLLLLLLLL. That\u2019s Huddersfield\u2019s sorry form, right there. They\u2019re on a club-record run of nine consecutive defeats and face Cardiff on Saturday. With Manchester City following their trip to Wales, they need a result or that run will stretch to 11 losses by next weekend. But David Wagner says he doesn\u2019t fear the sack. David Wagner does not fear for his job despite Huddersfield starting the new year rooted to the foot of the Premier League table. It\u2019s not about fear, it\u2019s about that I\u2019m not happy, which is how I should be after all these results. It\u2019s about how I feel responsibility. I like to put smiles on people\u2019s faces like we have done over the last three years and a couple of months. I\u2019m not able to deliver this and this is nothing that satisfies me and this is what I meant when I said I know and I feel the responsibility for it. I can\u2019t ask for more support than I have had from the board, especially from Dean our chairman.\u201d Huddersfield are right to back their manager aren\u2019t they? No other manager in the Premier League could have got Huddersfield promoted as Wagner did. If they go down, which they probably will, they will have the best man in charge to attempt to get them back up.as they most probably will do, go down. They can\u2019t score goals. that\u2019s why the forward Jason Puncheon has joined on loan from Crystal Palace and is expected to make his debut against Cardiff. But Wagner refused to comment on speculation that Leicester have turned down a bid for striker Shinji Okazaki. Midfielders Aaron Mooy, Danny Williams (both knee) and Abdelhamid Sabiri (collarbone), plus defender Tommy Smith (hamstring) are still out. It is 10 years to the day since \u201cthe next Zidane\u201d Yoann Gourcuff appeared to have the ball on a string as he scored this beautiful goal for Bordeaux in a 4-0 win over a PSG team that were yet to be fuelled by Qatari cash. Just look at his feet! \u201cThe next Zidane\u201d is at Dijon now, where he has\u2019t played a game all season. Guess, who\u2019s back, back again? Paul Pogba, that\u2019s who. He\u2019s recovered from having Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s studs introduced to the back of his leg and he is fit to face Spurs. The Frenchman missed last weekend\u2019s FA Cup win over Reading but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes the midfielder is bang up for a return to United\u2019s midfield at Wembley on Sunday. In other United injury news, Marcos Rojo has returned to his native Argentina as his injury is taking longer to heal than anticipated, while Chris Smalling (foot) is a doubt and Eric Bailly completes a three-match suspension. Manchester United provisional squad: De Gea, Romero, Grant, Dalot, Darmian, Valencia, Shaw, Young, Jones, Lindelof, Smalling, Fred, Gomes, Matic, Pereira, Herrera, McTominay, Pogba, Lingard, Fellaini, Mata, Rashford, Martial, Lukaku, Sanchez. If you want some live football on a Friday morning (in the UK), look no further than Palestine v Australia in the Asian Cup. Our man Down Under, Jonathan Howcroft, is liveblogging it. The Socceroos lost their opener to Jordan, so it\u2019s a crunch game for them. Where\u2019s Scott Chipperfield when you need him? You can follow it here: Predicting what Leicester will do from week to week is nigh on impossible. They\u2019re seventh in the Premier League, which is exactly where they should hope to be, but fans \u2013 and the Leicester hierarchy \u2013 do not appear overly enamoured with Puel\u2019s style of football or the fluctuating results. They will be grateful to have a home game against Southampton this weekend who, despite having an upturn in fortunes since Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl took charge, have no senior strikers available. Danny Ings and Michael Obafemi have hamstring problems, while Charlie Austin has been given a two-match suspension for flicking the V sign at Manchester City fans, which must have really, really hurt their feelings. Thomas M\u00fcller has been banned for both legs of Bayern Munich\u2019s last-16 Champions League tie with Liverpool after doing a fine impression of Bruce Lee in a challenge with Ajax\u2019s Nico Tagliafico. Funnily enough, he was shown a straight red card. M\u00fcller claimed he didn\u2019t mean it. He may be right \u2013 but just look at the state of this picture: So who will be the next Nottingham Forest manager then? Here\u2019s are the odds: Slavisa Jokanovic 1/2, Martin O\u2019Neill 6/1, Leonardo Jardim 6/1, Nigel Clough 12/1, Gary Rowett 14/1, Damir Canadi 16/1, David Moyes 16/1, Razvan Lucescu 16/1, Jos\u00e9 Anigo 18/1, Alan Pardew 20/1, Carlos Carvalhal 20/1, Chris Wilder 20/1, Pedro Martins 20/1, Roy Keane 20/1, Billy Davies 25/1. Jokanovic is the clear favourite, and his recent experience of taking Fulham up to the Premier League last season is clearly the reason why. With Forest only four points off Derby in sixth, promotion is still very much on the table this season. But he turned down the chance to speak to Stoke about the job there this week \u2013 so might he not be ready to take on another challenge yet? Forest fans, who would you go for? The Premier League weekend kicks off on Saturday with a tasty London derby as Arsenal travel to West Ham. The Gunners are in much ruder health than their hosts, though. Arsenal manager Unai Emery has six players back in contention for the match. The Gunners can call on fit-again Mesut \u00d6zil (knee), Laurent Koscielny (back), Hector Bellerin (calf), Konstantinos Mavropanos (groin), Shkodran Mustafi and Nacho Monreal (both hamstring) if required at the London Stadium. Arsenal provisional squad: Leno, Cech, Martinez, Jenkinson, Lichtsteiner, Bellerin, Koscielny, Papastathopoulos, Mustafi, Mavropanos, Kolasinac, Monreal, Maitland-Niles, Xhaka, Elneny, Torreira, Guendouzi, Ramsey, Iwobi, Ozil, Lacazette, Aubameyang, Nketiah. As for West Ham, well Fabian Balbuena is the latest addition to Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s lengthening long-term injury list. The Paraguayan defender resumed training this week after a knee problem but suffered a setback and has now undergone surgery which will rule him out for up to eight weeks. And will Marko Arnautovic play after his agent (who happens to be his brother) claimed the striker wants to move to China to \u201cwin titles\u201d. Jack Wilshere, Manuel Lanzini, Carlos S\u00e1nchez, Andriy Yarmolenko, Winston Reid, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Ryan Fredericks are all still injured, although the latter pair are due back in training next week. Provisional squad: Fabianski, Zabaleta, Ogbonna, Diop, Cresswell, Snodgrass, Rice, Noble, Nasri, Anderson, Arnautovic, Adrian, Masuaku, Obiang, Diangana, Antonio, Carroll, Perez, Silva. If you like John le Carr\u00e9 novels and Championship football then this story will be right up your street. Derbyshire police believe they may have helped Frank Lampard\u2019s team in their efforts to beat league-leading Leeds by stopping a suspicious person (who may or may not have been reading a newspaper with two holes cut into it) from spying on a Derby training session. Here\u2019s the Press Association story: Derby\u2019s preparations for Friday night\u2019s Sky Bet Championship showdown with Leeds were disrupted by a suspected spy. Police say they attended County\u2019s training ground on Thursday after a man was seen at the perimeter fence of the Moor Farm complex. Derbyshire Police tweeted to say they had located and removed the man amid suspicion he was attempting to spy on Frank Lampard\u2019s squad. The tweet from the Derby Response Unit of Derbyshire Constabulary read: \u201cOfficers have just attended the Training Ground for @dcfcofficial after a suspicious male was seen at the perimeter fence. \u201cExcellent searching conducted and male was located. All checks above board! Keeping the team safe to bring home a win against #LUFC on 11th! #SpyingIsCheating.\u201d The big match this weekend is undoubtedly Tottenham v Manchester United at Wembley, where Mauricio Pochettino will get to have a good look at the team he reportedly could inherit if he wants the job at Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r can understand why the Spurs boss is being heavily linked with the United job \u2013 \u201cThe speculation is there for a reason, because he\u2019s done well\u201d \u2013 but could another resounding win for Spurs over United convince Pochettino that his long-term future still lies at White Hart Lane (if the stadium is ever finished, that is)? Our columnist Eni Aluko believes Pochettino should stay at Spurs and try to make history. Do you agree with her? One thing for certain is that United are a much more vibrant team than the Spurs side they thrashed 3-0 at Old Trafford in September, and it will be interesting to see how Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s rampant side \u2013 they have won five from five since he took charge \u2013 fair in their first real test since he took over. Is Willian off to Barcelona in exchange for Malcolm and some cash?

He should have been doing stadium tours by now.</p> <p>The home secretary languidly uncoiled himself to take his place at the despatch box. If no one else was going to make an effort, then why should he? So rather than deliver a new speech, making the case for accepting Theresa May\u2019s deal, he chose instead to go through the motions by making much the same one he had given when announcing the government\u2019s immigration policy several weeks previously. Only he managed to do it worse. An achievement of sorts. When he comes to look back on today, The Saj will be grateful so few MPs were there to witness his performance.</p> <p>Most people had voted to leave the EU because they wanted more control over immigration, he began, apparently unaware that many Conservatives who were backing the prime minister\u2019s deal had argued the exact opposite the previous day. Luckily they weren\u2019t in the chamber to correct him.</p> <p>The country needed a policy that would simultaneously ban and welcome immigration, he declared. Not for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/18/theresa-may-puts-her-faith-in-the-miracle-of-schrodingers-brexit\">Schrodinger\u2019s Brexit</a> was being presented as credible government policy. The Saj was going to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands by not allowing anyone into the country who earned less than about \u00a330,000 but would still keep the NHS and the hospitality and agriculture sectors running by letting people in who earned considerably less. Suck on that.</p> <p>What made this still more depressing was that The Saj clearly knew he was talking bollocks but didn\u2019t much care one way or the other. And nor did anyone else. We have reached the point where no one really expects a minister to be coherent about Brexit any more. Minds have long since been made up and MPs are at liberty to construct their own alternative realities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/10/may-and-abe-the-end-of-the-affair\">Shinz\u014d Abe given the silent treatment as the Maybot runs on fumes | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Diane Abbott being a prime example.

Perhaps the early start had also caught her on the hop. Or maybe she had decided that, on reflection, she too was a bit bored with talking about Brexit.</p> <p>Then she went full Ukip by citing an intelligence report by former MI6 and defence chiefs that had ended with the suggestion the UK would be better off leaving the EU with no deal.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 9.30am on day three \u2013 or day six, if you count December\u2019s false start \u2013 in the Big Brother house and almost all the contestants are still in bed. Parliament may have broken with tradition to sit on a Friday to debate the EU withdrawal bill but MPs weren\u2019t going to let that spoil their weekend. Brexit, what Brexit? The Commons chamber was more like an echo chamber. You get a bigger crowd for an adjournment debate on the illegal trade of seahorses. Sajid Javid certainly didn\u2019t look best pleased to be called upon to resume the debate. The Sajid has his eyes on becoming prime minister one day in the not too distant future, and an early morning, end-of-the pier gig in front of a barely conscious audience of a few dozen had not been part of his planned career trajectory. He should have been doing stadium tours by now. The home secretary languidly uncoiled himself to take his place at the despatch box. If no one else was going to make an effort, then why should he? So rather than deliver a new speech, making the case for accepting Theresa May\u2019s deal, he chose instead to go through the motions by making much the same one he had given when announcing the government\u2019s immigration policy several weeks previously. Only he managed to do it worse. An achievement of sorts. When he comes to look back on today, The Saj will be grateful so few MPs were there to witness his performance. Most people had voted to leave the EU because they wanted more control over immigration, he began, apparently unaware that many Conservatives who were backing the prime minister\u2019s deal had argued the exact opposite the previous day. Luckily they weren\u2019t in the chamber to correct him. The country needed a policy that would simultaneously ban and welcome immigration, he declared. Not for the first time, Schrodinger\u2019s Brexit was being presented as credible government policy. The Saj was going to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands by not allowing anyone into the country who earned less than about \u00a330,000 but would still keep the NHS and the hospitality and agriculture sectors running by letting people in who earned considerably less. Suck on that. What made this still more depressing was that The Saj clearly knew he was talking bollocks but didn\u2019t much care one way or the other. And nor did anyone else. We have reached the point where no one really expects a minister to be coherent about Brexit any more. Minds have long since been made up and MPs are at liberty to construct their own alternative realities. Diane Abbott being a prime example. Her reply was a classic of the genre. First she appeared to have printed out her speech in the wrong order, frequently ignoring huge chunks of text by turning over several pages at a time. Perhaps the early start had also caught her on the hop. Or maybe she had decided that, on reflection, she too was a bit bored with talking about Brexit. Then she went full Ukip by citing an intelligence report by former MI6 and defence chiefs that had ended with the suggestion the UK would be better off leaving the EU with no deal. It was almost as if she had no idea of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. There again, few people do. The most heartfelt speech was made by the Conservative Nicholas Soames, who has spent the past 35 years trying to channel the ghost of his grandfather, Winston Churchill. Only without ever achieving quite the passion or the plausibility. Soames insisted the public wouldn\u2019t forgive the Commons for any delay \u2013 one wonders what he imagines May has been doing all this time \u2013 and that a vote against the deal would be a vote for chaos. Because everything was going so smoothly now \u2026 Thereafter it was a matter of MPs using the time to wind down the clock with their favourite Brexit soundbites. The war. Maastricht. Vassal state. The war. Second referendum. Few people bothered to interrupt, mostly because no one was listening. This wasn\u2019t a debate so much as a procedural formality. The Commons had promised it would fill the time and that was one promise everyone would keep. Nor did the closing speeches offer any enlightenment.

      "body": "<p>Families who lost loved ones in the London Bridge attacks will demand answers from MI5 as to how the terrorist ringleader Khuram Butt directed the atrocity despite being under investigation by the security services.</p> <p>A pre-inquest hearing decided on Friday that the security services should face questions and that family lawyers should be given documents from MI5 about their decision making in the run-up to the June 2017 attacks.</p> <p>Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people when they ploughed into pedestrians on London Bridge in a van, then ran through Borough market stabbing people with pink ceramic knives bought for \u00a34 each from a Lidl supermarket.</p> <p>The atrocity, which lasted for eight minutes, was only halted when the three attackers, who had taken steroids, tried to kill armed police officers, who shot all three of them dead.</p> <p>Gareth Patterson QC, the barrister for six of the bereaved families, said: \u201cThe fact that Khuram Butt was under investigation is very troubling and a significant issue.\u201d</p> <p>MI5 started investigating Butt in 2015, assessing him as a suspect who may want to carry out an attack in the UK. In 2016, he appeared in a TV documentary with an Isis flag.</p> <p>At Friday\u2019s hearing at the Old Bailey, the chief coroner of England and Wales, Mark Lucraft QC, said MI5 would be handing over documents. However, a public interest immunity hearing may be held, possibly heard in private, if MI5 objects to the handing over of further documents the families believe are needed to explore why Butt was not stopped beforehand.</p> <p>The terrorists hired the van from a Hertz rental outlet on the day of the attack, having tried and failed to rent a 7.5-tonne lorry to inflict greater death.</p> <p>Two people were killed in the van attack on London Bridge. Patterson said families could not understand why the bridge had no protective barriers three months after a similar vehicle attack at Westminster Bridge by Khalid Masood.</p> <p>Patterson set out his key concerns ahead of a full inquest at the Old Bailey starting on 7 May.</p> <p>He criticised the lack of barriers on the bridge, saying: \u201cThe pavements of London Bridge were wide open, despite what happened at Westminster several months earlier. No consideration was given to protecting the pavement, but, after London Bridge, work began within a day or two.\u201d</p> <p>Those who died were Sara Zelenak, 21, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Christine Archibald, 30, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio Echeverria, 39 and Xavier Thomas, 45.</p> <p>The families will also press for better restrictions on rental companies. Three of the terrorist attacks in 2017, at Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park involved vehicles ploughing into civilians. They followed similar deadly attacks overseas in Nice in France and Berlin in Germany.</p> <p>Patterson said: \u201cThey are renting vehicles that can be used as lethal weapons and they have been used in terrorist attack after terrorist attack.\u201d</p> <p>The attackers wrapped water bottles in grey tape to look like suicide belts, which were strung around their upper bodies.</p> <p>During the hearing, Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the coroner, said: \u201cWe understand the families have concerns about the lack of barriers on the bridge, this attack coming after the Westminster attack. We can assure [them] this is a topic which will be pursued.\u201d</p> <p>Hough said the counter-terrorism police had taken 2,701 statements and seized \u201cvast\u201d amounts of CCTV footage of the attacks and the terrorists\u2019 movements.

      "bodyText": "Families who lost loved ones in the London Bridge attacks will demand answers from MI5 as to how the terrorist ringleader Khuram Butt directed the atrocity despite being under investigation by the security services. A pre-inquest hearing decided on Friday that the security services should face questions and that family lawyers should be given documents from MI5 about their decision making in the run-up to the June 2017 attacks. Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people when they ploughed into pedestrians on London Bridge in a van, then ran through Borough market stabbing people with pink ceramic knives bought for \u00a34 each from a Lidl supermarket. The atrocity, which lasted for eight minutes, was only halted when the three attackers, who had taken steroids, tried to kill armed police officers, who shot all three of them dead. Gareth Patterson QC, the barrister for six of the bereaved families, said: \u201cThe fact that Khuram Butt was under investigation is very troubling and a significant issue.\u201d MI5 started investigating Butt in 2015, assessing him as a suspect who may want to carry out an attack in the UK. In 2016, he appeared in a TV documentary with an Isis flag. At Friday\u2019s hearing at the Old Bailey, the chief coroner of England and Wales, Mark Lucraft QC, said MI5 would be handing over documents. However, a public interest immunity hearing may be held, possibly heard in private, if MI5 objects to the handing over of further documents the families believe are needed to explore why Butt was not stopped beforehand. The terrorists hired the van from a Hertz rental outlet on the day of the attack, having tried and failed to rent a 7.5-tonne lorry to inflict greater death. Two people were killed in the van attack on London Bridge. Patterson said families could not understand why the bridge had no protective barriers three months after a similar vehicle attack at Westminster Bridge by Khalid Masood. Patterson set out his key concerns ahead of a full inquest at the Old Bailey starting on 7 May. He criticised the lack of barriers on the bridge, saying: \u201cThe pavements of London Bridge were wide open, despite what happened at Westminster several months earlier. No consideration was given to protecting the pavement, but, after London Bridge, work began within a day or two.\u201d Those who died were Sara Zelenak, 21, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Christine Archibald, 30, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio Echeverria, 39 and Xavier Thomas, 45. The families will also press for better restrictions on rental companies. Three of the terrorist attacks in 2017, at Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park involved vehicles ploughing into civilians. They followed similar deadly attacks overseas in Nice in France and Berlin in Germany. Patterson said: \u201cThey are renting vehicles that can be used as lethal weapons and they have been used in terrorist attack after terrorist attack.\u201d The attackers wrapped water bottles in grey tape to look like suicide belts, which were strung around their upper bodies. During the hearing, Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the coroner, said: \u201cWe understand the families have concerns about the lack of barriers on the bridge, this attack coming after the Westminster attack. We can assure [them] this is a topic which will be pursued.\u201d Hough said the counter-terrorism police had taken 2,701 statements and seized \u201cvast\u201d amounts of CCTV footage of the attacks and the terrorists\u2019 movements. Other evidence included body-worn video from police officers and videos from members of the public caught up in the carnage. Hough said extensive work had been done by forensic experts on the attackers\u2019 vehicle, the knives used and petrol bombs found in the aftermath.",

It also explains that music-making initiatives are often impossible to implement because of the cost.</p> <p>Some years ago, when I first had experience of family members in care, I realised that live music was a nice thing for dementia patients. As I am a professional pianist, I volunteered to go and play concerts of light and \u201cvintage\u201d piano music in care homes and hospitals. I did a supervised trial event in a long-stay unit, which seemed to show that residents would enjoy more of it.</p> <p>Ultimately, \u201cmore\u201d never happened because I was told I\u2019d have to submit to background checks, agree never to be on my own on the premises with any resident, arrange to be escorted through the grounds each time I came, and so on. I know such rules are put in place for good reason, but they were sufficiently intrusive that my enthusiasm ebbed away, and in the end I withdrew my offer, feeling it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. There must, however, be many musicians like me who would be glad to offer their skills free of charge to dementia homes if there were a simple way of doing so.<br><strong>Susan Tomes</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article on dementia care exposes the flawed model of social prescribing being adopted by parts of the NHS. On the one hand you note the investment in 1,000 link workers by April 2021; on the other you warn that the availability of community-based groups for dementia patients is limited. Who will these link workers be referring the 900,000 people to? The care homes charging \u00a330 per person? Creating a social prescribing industry will indeed come at a price \u2013 but it won\u2019t support the growth of health-creating communities that, at a lower cost, can sustain music, dance and a host of other healthy living activities that are truly person-centred and far more likely to achieve the goals set out in the NHS\u2019s long-term plan. Better to invest in volunteers based at GP surgeries who are trained to connect people with what\u2019s going on in their area and sustained, inclusive support for communities that are setting up and running their own local activities.<br><strong>Steve Phaure</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Croydon Voluntary Action</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here to upload it</em></strong></a><strong><em> and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Your article on music in dementia care (Making music isn\u2019t a nicety, it\u2019s a necessity, 9 January) illustrates the benefit of using live music to unlock happy memories and powers of communication in dementia sufferers. It also explains that music-making initiatives are often impossible to implement because of the cost. Some years ago, when I first had experience of family members in care, I realised that live music was a nice thing for dementia patients. As I am a professional pianist, I volunteered to go and play concerts of light and \u201cvintage\u201d piano music in care homes and hospitals. I did a supervised trial event in a long-stay unit, which seemed to show that residents would enjoy more of it. Ultimately, \u201cmore\u201d never happened because I was told I\u2019d have to submit to background checks, agree never to be on my own on the premises with any resident, arrange to be escorted through the grounds each time I came, and so on. I know such rules are put in place for good reason, but they were sufficiently intrusive that my enthusiasm ebbed away, and in the end I withdrew my offer, feeling it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. There must, however, be many musicians like me who would be glad to offer their skills free of charge to dementia homes if there were a simple way of doing so. Susan Tomes Edinburgh \u2022 Your article on dementia care exposes the flawed model of social prescribing being adopted by parts of the NHS. On the one hand you note the investment in 1,000 link workers by April 2021; on the other you warn that the availability of community-based groups for dementia patients is limited. Who will these link workers be referring the 900,000 people to? The care homes charging \u00a330 per person? Creating a social prescribing industry will indeed come at a price \u2013 but it won\u2019t support the growth of health-creating communities that, at a lower cost, can sustain music, dance and a host of other healthy living activities that are truly person-centred and far more likely to achieve the goals set out in the NHS\u2019s long-term plan. Better to invest in volunteers based at GP surgeries who are trained to connect people with what\u2019s going on in their area and sustained, inclusive support for communities that are setting up and running their own local activities.

However, No 10 says the plan B debate will only be allocated 90 minutes, which feels quite a symbolic stretch of time.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to decide on the precise football match to which it will be analogous. But there was a lower league Nigerian game in 2013 in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/09/nigeria-scandalous-scorelines\" title=\"\">Akurba FC lost 79-0 to Plateau United Feeders</a>.

In fact, the very calling of the referendum was an admission of that. We live in a representative democracy.

Indeed, Dominic Grieve\u2019s amendment means that when the prime minister\u2019s withdrawal deal is voted down next week, May will have to come to the house to explain her so-called plan B within three working days. I assumed that was about a year in parliamentary time, but it turns out it\u2019s actually the following Monday. However, No 10 says the plan B debate will only be allocated 90 minutes, which feels quite a symbolic stretch of time. It\u2019s difficult to decide on the precise football match to which it will be analogous. But there was a lower league Nigerian game in 2013 in which Akurba FC lost 79-0 to Plateau United Feeders. Seventy-two of those goals were scored in the second half, in case that affects any plan to bring on Grayling at some point. As for the specific details of May\u2019s plan B, it is believed to be a variety of tinned goods and the contact details for Ray Mears. It\u2019s her bad deal or no deal, kids \u2013 and no deal is no longer better than a bad deal, even if she told you for way more than a year that it was. Given how well that strategy went, it\u2019s intriguing that May should have spent this week veering between suggesting that no deal was more likely, and suggesting that no Brexit was more likely. She\u2019s good cop AND bad cop. Playing more than one character in a movie is fairly excruciating when Eddie Murphy does it; when a performer of the calibre of May attempts it, it is less watchable than gamma rays. As for her conviction that now is the moment to reach out to Labour leavers, a cool 19 months after her Darwin award-winning election, it is once again only possible to rationalise if you realise that the prime minister has been experiencing reality on a massive tape delay. On these calculations, May will wait until February 2020 to wish the England squad good luck as they head to Russia to kick off their World Cup campaign. For now, she remains the comic character pointing the gun at their own head and warning: \u201cone false move and I\u2019ll shoot\u201d \u2013 even as the timer she so foolishly set clicks down to zero. Amid such desperately chaotic scenes, suggestions of a temporary \u201cnational unity administration\u201d prompt an involuntary laugh. These feel like suggesting that Mordor might benefit from a couple of months of technocratic government. I suppose so. But things are quite \u2026 far gone down there, now? As for that self-styled Frodo, David Cameron, we are still unable to quantify how wrong his plan to destroy the ring has gone, other than to say the Shire is now primarily a vast Orc brothel. In the end, you only needed to watch the news for 15 seconds this week to surmise that most of our political class is not up to the job, and hasn\u2019t been for years. In fact, the very calling of the referendum was an admission of that. We live in a representative democracy. Though it may have been subconscious for Cameron, if he\u2019d been a politician capable of finessing the internal Tory politics of the situation, he wouldn\u2019t have thrown the entire question open to the floor. But he did. He took what he thought would be an easy shortcut to an easy life, and we will all be living with the difficult, long-term implications of it for so many years to come. Cameron remains cocooned in his 25-grand shed, apparently still working on his memoir. What can you say? Other than: would you like me to come over and help you with the ending, dear? Failing that, I hear there\u2019s a winter caretaker job going in a Colorado Rockies hotel \u2013 perhaps you\u2019d consider applying and trying to finish it there. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Though these men now lie in their graves, their stories linger in search of justice.\u201d</p> <p>Friday\u2019s discussions were originally indicated to be preliminary in nature, intended to allow the board, consisting of DeSantis, the new attorney general, Ashley Moody, chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, and agricultural commissioner, Nikki Fried, Florida\u2019s only statewide-elected Democrat, to \u201cget a handle\u201d on the case and plot a timeline.</p> <p>But all four cabinet members were believed keen to push the process forward and the pardons were duly announced.</p> <p>The Groveland case had looked likely to be consigned to Florida\u2019s forgotten history until the publication of Devil in the Grove, which <a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/gilbert-king\">won a Pulitzer prize in 2013</a> for its author, historian Gilbert King.</p> <p>The book, which focused on the role in the case of Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and later a US supreme court justice, also presented evidence that the girl made up the story of the attack.</p> <p>The alleged victim, Norma Padgett, then 17, and her husband Willie, 22, who had a reputation as a violent drunk, claimed they were approached by the four men on a rural highway in July 1949, after their car broke down as they returned home from a night out. They insisted that Samuel Shepherd and Walter Irvin, both 22 and army veterans from the second world war, together with Ernest Thomas, 26, and Charles Greenlee, 16, confronted them, robbed Padgett of his wallet and took his wife off in their car, raping her on the back seat.</p> <p>When the Padgetts reported the alleged attack, Shepherd and Irvin were quickly picked up by the Lake county sheriff, Willis McCall, and beaten by officers. Greenlee, who insisted he had never met Shepherd or Irvin, was arrested later and tortured in a police station basement until he confessed.</p> <p>Thomas escaped after hearing his friend Greenlee had been arrested. A posse appointed by McCall tracked him to Madison county, almost 200 miles away, three days later and shot him dead, a murder later ruled a \u201cjustifiable homicide\u201d by a coroner.</p> <p>McCall\u2019s involvement did not end with Thomas\u2019s killing. After the US supreme court ordered a retrial for Shepherd and Irvin in 1951, McCall chose to drive alone to collect them from the state prison. He stopped his car on a remote road and shot the pair, who were handcuffed together. Irvin survived by playing dead, and claimed after his recovery that McCall shot them in cold blood. However, an all-white coroner\u2019s jury in Lake county, consisting largely of McCall\u2019s friends, according to King\u2019s book, took fewer than 30 minutes to endorse the sheriff\u2019s account that the restrained pair attacked him.</p> <p>Irvin was convicted and sentenced to death at his second trial before his sentence was commuted to life in 1955. He died in 1969, a year after he was paroled. Greenlee was released in 1962 after serving more than 12 years in prison. He died in 2012.</p> <p>Chris Hand, a Jacksonville-based attorney who is an adviser to Fried, and who helped form a bipartisan coalition of politicians, lawyers and activists seeking a pardon for the four, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to move forward with the future of state until you\u2019ve recognised and rectified the mistakes of the past.\u201d </p>",

But on Friday in Tallahassee, barely 72 hours after his inauguration, the new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, convened his first meeting of the clemency board and fulfilled a campaign promise to prioritise the case of the four, who he said were \u201cwrongly written into Florida history for crimes they did not commit and punishments they did not deserve\u201d. \u201cMake no mistake, these men were victims,\u201d DeSantis said in a statement in which he praised the tenacity of the campaigners. \u201cSeventy years is a long time to wait, but it is never too late to do the right thing. Though these men now lie in their graves, their stories linger in search of justice.\u201d Friday\u2019s discussions were originally indicated to be preliminary in nature, intended to allow the board, consisting of DeSantis, the new attorney general, Ashley Moody, chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, and agricultural commissioner, Nikki Fried, Florida\u2019s only statewide-elected Democrat, to \u201cget a handle\u201d on the case and plot a timeline. But all four cabinet members were believed keen to push the process forward and the pardons were duly announced. The Groveland case had looked likely to be consigned to Florida\u2019s forgotten history until the publication of Devil in the Grove, which won a Pulitzer prize in 2013 for its author, historian Gilbert King. The book, which focused on the role in the case of Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and later a US supreme court justice, also presented evidence that the girl made up the story of the attack. The alleged victim, Norma Padgett, then 17, and her husband Willie, 22, who had a reputation as a violent drunk, claimed they were approached by the four men on a rural highway in July 1949, after their car broke down as they returned home from a night out. They insisted that Samuel Shepherd and Walter Irvin, both 22 and army veterans from the second world war, together with Ernest Thomas, 26, and Charles Greenlee, 16, confronted them, robbed Padgett of his wallet and took his wife off in their car, raping her on the back seat. When the Padgetts reported the alleged attack, Shepherd and Irvin were quickly picked up by the Lake county sheriff, Willis McCall, and beaten by officers. Greenlee, who insisted he had never met Shepherd or Irvin, was arrested later and tortured in a police station basement until he confessed. Thomas escaped after hearing his friend Greenlee had been arrested. A posse appointed by McCall tracked him to Madison county, almost 200 miles away, three days later and shot him dead, a murder later ruled a \u201cjustifiable homicide\u201d by a coroner. McCall\u2019s involvement did not end with Thomas\u2019s killing. After the US supreme court ordered a retrial for Shepherd and Irvin in 1951, McCall chose to drive alone to collect them from the state prison. He stopped his car on a remote road and shot the pair, who were handcuffed together. Irvin survived by playing dead, and claimed after his recovery that McCall shot them in cold blood. However, an all-white coroner\u2019s jury in Lake county, consisting largely of McCall\u2019s friends, according to King\u2019s book, took fewer than 30 minutes to endorse the sheriff\u2019s account that the restrained pair attacked him. Irvin was convicted and sentenced to death at his second trial before his sentence was commuted to life in 1955. He died in 1969, a year after he was paroled. Greenlee was released in 1962 after serving more than 12 years in prison. He died in 2012. Chris Hand, a Jacksonville-based attorney who is an adviser to Fried, and who helped form a bipartisan coalition of politicians, lawyers and activists seeking a pardon for the four, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to move forward with the future of state until you\u2019ve recognised and rectified the mistakes of the past.\u201d",

Like Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe, her health has deteriorated and she has been denied adequate medical treatment.</p> <p>Their fate, and that of uncounted other activists, female and male, is uncertain. The regime\u2019s ultra-harsh treatment of dissent breaches Iran\u2019s own laws and its legal obligations under UN covenants.

They invite ostracism and reciprocal bigotry. They open the way to greater violence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s plain that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, though old, ailing and underqualified, still casts a reactionary shadow over the regime\u2019s external dealings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every time Donald Trump traduces Iran\u2019s government as the world\u2019s leading sponsor of terrorism and urges its people to revolt, somebody, somewhere will think of Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe or the many other innocents languishing in Iran\u2019s jails, and conclude the US is right to go after the mullahs. Every time the EU defends the breakthrough 2015 nuclear pact against American opposition, the more once supportive western politicians dismayed by regime abuses will question the strategy.</p> <p>The more the public hears of the suffering of those terrorised and tortured in Tehran, the more they may question the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/07/iran-digging-diplomatic-grave-over-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-says-emily-thornberry\" title=\"\">policy of engagement</a>, supporting instead a policy of attrition. Sadly, a showdown with the Great Satan and chums is exactly what some hardliners want. If for no other reason, such a catastrophe should be resisted by all means. </p> <p>The real danger Iran now faces emanates not from people such as Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe, or the BBC, or even from those within Iran who seek reform, a freer society and a more open politics. It comes from the west\u2019s own fundamentalists: people such as the Iraq war-hawk John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser; Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s bellicose premier; and the Saudi crown prince, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/06/us-senators-keen-to-punish-saudi-crown-prince-but-divided-on-tactics\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman</a>. And who in Tehran would give the west\u2019s hardliners the justification they seek to foment regime change? Answer: the very same people whose personal ambition, nationalist rhetoric and heedless cruelty leads them to penalise the likes of Zaghari-Ratcliffe.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to penetrate the clouds of Tehran\u2019s factional rivalries.

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s merciless persecution of Nazanin Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British woman held in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison on spurious charges of spying, is deeply disturbing. What possible purpose was served by the airing this week on state television of a video showing her arrest in April 2016, as she prepared to board a plane to London? When accosted by security men, Zaghari-Ratcliffe does not for a moment act guilty. She is not concealing anything. She does not try to run away. She looked then like the person she still is today: frightened, alarmed, uncomprehending and, above all, innocent. Showing this video was the regime\u2019s latest, pathetic effort to justify the unjustifiable. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not alone, figuratively at least. Her incarceration is part of Iran\u2019s wider war on women\u2019s rights \u2013 a war waged with fluctuating intensity by the exclusively male clerical establishment since the 1979 revolution, using legalised gender discrimination, fear and brute force. What of Nasrin Sotoudeh, for example, the valiant human rights lawyer awarded Europe\u2019s 2012 Sakharov prize while locked inside Evin? Sotoudeh helped defend women arrested for defying rules on the wearing of hijab in public, some of whom were attacked with acid. She was jailed again last year and began a hunger strike in November. Or what of Narges Mohammadi, with whom Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe also intends to stage a hunger strike inside Evin, beginning on Monday? Mohammadi, originally jailed for \u201cpropaganda against the state\u201d, was handed an additional 16-year term in May for campaigning to abolish the death penalty. Like Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe, her health has deteriorated and she has been denied adequate medical treatment. Their fate, and that of uncounted other activists, female and male, is uncertain. The regime\u2019s ultra-harsh treatment of dissent breaches Iran\u2019s own laws and its legal obligations under UN covenants. Human Rights Watch reported last month that a crackdown on independent lawyers is escalating. \u201cNow Iran is not only arresting dissidents, human rights defenders and labour leaders, but their lawyers as well,\u201d it said. What the Zaghari-Ratcliffe scandal, and cases involving Iranian nationals such as Sotoudeh, have vividly demonstrated is the willingness of hardline clerics to use any means, however immoral and unjust, to validate their belief that the Islamic Republic is besieged by malevolent western governments scheming counter-revolution. What this unrepresentative yet powerful minority fails to grasp is that they themselves, not women\u2019s rights campaigners or states such as Britain, are the real threat to Iran\u2019s security, prosperity and independence alongside the US. The systemic abuses endured by Zaghari-Ratcliffe confirm all the worst prejudices and stereotypes about Iran peddled by enemies in the Arab Gulf states, Israel and Washington. They invite ostracism and reciprocal bigotry. They open the way to greater violence. Every time Donald Trump traduces Iran\u2019s government as the world\u2019s leading sponsor of terrorism and urges its people to revolt, somebody, somewhere will think of Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe or the many other innocents languishing in Iran\u2019s jails, and conclude the US is right to go after the mullahs. Every time the EU defends the breakthrough 2015 nuclear pact against American opposition, the more once supportive western politicians dismayed by regime abuses will question the strategy. The more the public hears of the suffering of those terrorised and tortured in Tehran, the more they may question the policy of engagement, supporting instead a policy of attrition. Sadly, a showdown with the Great Satan and chums is exactly what some hardliners want. If for no other reason, such a catastrophe should be resisted by all means. The real danger Iran now faces emanates not from people such as Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe, or the BBC, or even from those within Iran who seek reform, a freer society and a more open politics. It comes from the west\u2019s own fundamentalists: people such as the Iraq war-hawk John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser; Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s bellicose premier; and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. And who in Tehran would give the west\u2019s hardliners the justification they seek to foment regime change? Answer: the very same people whose personal ambition, nationalist rhetoric and heedless cruelty leads them to penalise the likes of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. It\u2019s hard to penetrate the clouds of Tehran\u2019s factional rivalries. But it seems clear that Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s twice\u2011elected president, the foreign minister Javad Zarif, and like\u2011minded centrists and \u201cmoderates\u201d, are on the back foot \u2013 their tentative western outreach torpedoed by American bad faith and sanctions. It\u2019s plain too that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, though old, ailing and underqualified, still casts a reactionary shadow over the regime\u2019s external dealings. It\u2019s unarguably the case that the Revolutionary Guard Corps, personified by the Quds Force general, Qassem Suleimani, wields enhanced influence, in part due to its success in Syria. But it is also evident that Sadegh Amoli Larijani, head of Iran\u2019s powerful judiciary, protege and confidant of Khamenei, and younger brother of the speaker of parliament, is among those principally responsible for Iran\u2019s regressive slide into confrontation. Last week he moved closer to the top of the pile, taking the chairmanship of the expediency council, which advises the supreme leader. An arch-conservative, Larijani is escalating a self\u2011interested battle with the west. He recently portentously declared Iran to be surrounded by \u201cenemies outside the borders\u201d. He maintains close ties with the security and intelligence agencies. And it is he, more than any other, who controls the fate of Zaghari\u2011Ratcliffe and other judicial victims, as he showed last month when he dismissed the concerns of Jeremy Hunt, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary. Iran needs saving from men such as Larijani, just as Zaghari-Ratcliffe needs saving from Iran. But, for all our sakes, it is up to Iranians to make the change, calmly, in their own fashion and without outside interference.

Last time out in November the national team were beaten at home by Fiji; it is now almost nine years since Les Bleus won a Six Nations title.

That club is Toulouse, who have lifted it a record four times in their distinguished history. It used to be said that if rugby in the north of England was strong the national team would follow suit.

The rangy Stade Francais flanker Sekou Macalou, 23, is another with massive athletic talent and a big engine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s a phenomenon, he\u2019s as fit as a bull.</p> <footer> <cite>Kaino on Dupont</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Among those who reckon the French may just have a golden generation on their hands is Toby Flood, now back at Newcastle after an instructive spell at Toulouse. \u201cI do think there is a new generation coming,\u201d says Flood. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a wealth of talent now. The argument always used to be that foreigners in the Top 14 were stopping the talent coming through. Well, not if that talent\u2019s good enough.

No less a judge than the former All Black Jerome Kaino, meanwhile, reckons Dupont offers a different dimension to the slightly-built distributors latterly favoured by Les Bleus. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenon, he\u2019s as fit as a bull,\u201d suggested Kaino. \u201cHe needs to look around him a bit more, to take his time a bit more, but he\u2019s a super youngster.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab889b409a288f77691f167c2d4376bf3fc9af13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab889b409a288f77691f167c2d4376bf3fc9af13/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toulouse\u2019s South Africa winger Cheslin Kolbe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toulouse\u2019s South Africa winger Cheslin Kolbe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pavani/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flood is also interesting on the subject of Ramos, who wears the 10 jersey this weekend and is currently the tournament\u2019s leading scorer with 51 points from four games. \u201cWhen I was at Toulouse, Thomas was sent out on loan to Colomiers and was exceptional for them: scoring tries, kicking everything. That game time has done him a lot of favours and given him a huge amount of confidence.

Leinster have their structures in place and possess talent within those structures but they\u2019ll be up against a team who are a bit off the cuff and will do some random stuff.

      "bodyText": "To say French rugby is overdue a renaissance is easier than predicting precisely when it will occur. Last time out in November the national team were beaten at home by Fiji; it is now almost nine years since Les Bleus won a Six Nations title. Since the 2015 Rugby World Cup they have managed only 10 victories in 32 Tests, mostly against lower-ranked opposition, and won away from home twice. Aside from the exceptional galactico-stuffed Toulon squad between 2013-15, only one other Top 14 side has secured the European Cup in more than two decades. That club is Toulouse, who have lifted it a record four times in their distinguished history. It used to be said that if rugby in the north of England was strong the national team would follow suit. The French barometer is Stade Toulousain which, given they are currently unbeaten in Pool One in Europe, suggests the Gallic mercury may just be rising again. With seven Toulouse players in France\u2019s Six Nations squad this week, this weekend\u2019s game in Leinster will certainly showcase some of the shimmering young talent which could yet transform their country\u2019s fortunes over the next few years. Behind the scrum, in particular, there are distinct signs of life, with the alert, strong 22-year-old scrum-half Antoine Dupont and the in-form 23-year-old full-back Thomas Ramos helping to reinvigorate Yoann Huget and Maxime M\u00e9dard. Romain Ntamack, the teenage son of the former French international Emile, and Clermont\u2019s Damian Penaud, son of Alain, are also impressive chips off well-known blocks. The list goes on and on. At 20, huge things are predicted for the precocious prop Demba Bamba, on loan at Brive from Lyon this season and now in the full French squad. Back-rowers Jordan Joseph and Cameron Woki, both members of France\u2019s U20 World Cup winning team last June, are similarly highly rated and the gifted 20-year-old Bordeaux fly-half Matthieu Jalibert is already a full international.

Residents in a rural area of southern Minas Gerais state have reported skies \u201craining spiders\u201d, a phenomenon which experts say is typical in the region during hot, humid weather. Photos and videos shared on social media show hundreds of spiders hanging in the sky. Jo\u00e3o Pedro Martinelli Fonseca, who filmed one of the most widely shared clips, was traveling with his family to his grandparents\u2019 farm in Esp\u00edrito Santo do Dourado, about 250km north-east of S\u00e3o Paulo, when he realized the sky was covered with black dots. He told a local newspaper that he was \u201cstunned and scared\u201d \u2013 especially when one of the spiders fell through the open window. The boy\u2019s grandmother, Jercina Martinelli, told another local paper: \u201cThere were many more webs and spiders than you can see in the video. We\u2019ve seen this before, always at dusk on days when it\u2019s been really hot.\u201d In 2013, the same phenomenon made international headlines when residents of Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Platina in southern Brazil registered \u201craining spiders\u201d around telephone poles. While it looks like the spiders are falling from the sky, they are actually hanging in a giant web to catch prey, said Adalberto dos Santos, a biology professor specialising in arachnology at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. The species parawixia bistriata, is a rare \u201csocial\u201d spider and the community web they build is so fine that it is nearly impossible for the human eye to see, giving the illusion that the spiders are floating on air. During the day, the spiders nest in a giant ball in the vegetation, emerging in the early evening to construct the giant web ceiling which hangs between trees and bushes, said Dos Santos. Each web can measure up to four meters wide and three meters thick. At dawn, they feast on prey they have caught overnight \u2013 usually small insects, but sometimes even small birds \u2013 before retreating to the vegetation again. Witnessing a sky full of spiders may be unnerving, but Dos Santos said humans have nothing to fear: the venom of this species is not harmful to humans and its bite causes little more discomfort than a red ant bite. Dos Santos said that the spiders\u2019 vast net serves to regulate insects like flies and mosquitoes that come out during the muggy early evenings. \u201cThey benefit us far more than they harm us,\u201d he said.",

With no clear favourite it proved a low-scoring and open contest which ended with players from six different countries sharing first on 7/10.</p> \n<p>It was a messy outcome, which should have been replaced by a sole English winner. Danny Gormally was half a point clear at the start of the final round and soon established what looked like a winning endgame. But then his chess demons got to him, he missed clear chances and at the end he had to settle for rook and knight against rook and the large chasing pack took advantage.</p> \n<p>Gormally had the best performance rating of the sextet, 2576, so was awarded the Golombek Trophy although the cash prizes were shared. It was a welcome comeback for a player whose career was defined 12 years ago by a highly publicised dance floor incident at the 2006 Turin Olympiad.</p> \n<p>Levon Aronian was the victim, but for the Armenian it brought triumph then and later. He led his team to the gold medals, a small Caucasian nation defeating the big guns, and they were flown back to Erevan in the presidential jet. He is now married to Arianne Caoili, his dance partner in Turin.</p> \n<p>Gormally was sent home early and has never played for England since, yet that disaster seemed to spark his talent as an original writer and commentator on the game. Play Chess Like The Pros is a fine instructional book while his personal opinions in articles, videos and interviews are always stimulating.</p> \n<p>The other significant name in the sextet was Conor Murphy. Irish victories in major tournaments are rare, excepting the annual weekenders in Bunratty and Kilkenny, and it is more than 20 years since Alex Baburin won at Isle of Man 1997 with 8/9. The Cambridge mathematics student, 19, who plays for the Charlton club in Kent, achieved an IM result, the only one at Hastings, with a confident attacking style.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/26/russia-arkady-dvorkovich-former-putin-aide-overseeing-world-chess-fide\">Saudi loss is Russian gain under ex-Kremlin chess boss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murphy\u2019s tactical win here could have been a memorable brilliancy.

The Icelander could have got better counterplay with 8\u2026a6 and b5 than his homespun Ng4 and Bh6 idea, which cost time and position.</p> \n<p>Murphy dominated the middle game, increased his advantage by the 23 Nb5! trick, boldly gave up a rook for the final attack, but then chose a mundane finish when 38 Rf1!

Indian and Chinese grandmasters have been winners at six of the past eight Hastings but in 2018 the large Indian group preferred Stockholm\u2019s Rilton Cup while the Chinese stayed at home. With no clear favourite it proved a low-scoring and open contest which ended with players from six different countries sharing first on 7/10. It was a messy outcome, which should have been replaced by a sole English winner. Danny Gormally was half a point clear at the start of the final round and soon established what looked like a winning endgame. But then his chess demons got to him, he missed clear chances and at the end he had to settle for rook and knight against rook and the large chasing pack took advantage. Gormally had the best performance rating of the sextet, 2576, so was awarded the Golombek Trophy although the cash prizes were shared. It was a welcome comeback for a player whose career was defined 12 years ago by a highly publicised dance floor incident at the 2006 Turin Olympiad. Levon Aronian was the victim, but for the Armenian it brought triumph then and later. He led his team to the gold medals, a small Caucasian nation defeating the big guns, and they were flown back to Erevan in the presidential jet. He is now married to Arianne Caoili, his dance partner in Turin. Gormally was sent home early and has never played for England since, yet that disaster seemed to spark his talent as an original writer and commentator on the game. Play Chess Like The Pros is a fine instructional book while his personal opinions in articles, videos and interviews are always stimulating. The other significant name in the sextet was Conor Murphy. Irish victories in major tournaments are rare, excepting the annual weekenders in Bunratty and Kilkenny, and it is more than 20 years since Alex Baburin won at Isle of Man 1997 with 8/9. The Cambridge mathematics student, 19, who plays for the Charlton club in Kent, achieved an IM result, the only one at Hastings, with a confident attacking style. Murphy\u2019s tactical win here could have been a memorable brilliancy. The unusual opening contains a trap if Black tries 3\u2026Bg4 4 d5 Ne5?? when 5 Nxe5! Bxd1 6 Bb5+ is winning. The Icelander could have got better counterplay with 8\u2026a6 and b5 than his homespun Ng4 and Bh6 idea, which cost time and position. Murphy dominated the middle game, increased his advantage by the 23 Nb5! trick, boldly gave up a rook for the final attack, but then chose a mundane finish when 38 Rf1! Ke8 39 fxg6 Rxg6 40 Qxg6+! hxg6 41 h7 creates a new queen. 3601 1It is a draw by 1 axb7 Re6+! 2 Kxe6 Kc6! when 3 b8=Q or 3 b8=R gives stalemate, 3 b8=B cannot win with two dark-squared bishops while 3 b8=N+ Kb7 forks White\u2019s two pieces.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>I SPY?</strong></h2> <p>At this stage in the season it should not be hard for a team to have some idea how a rival might play. Most have, after all, played a couple of dozen games already. The greatest clue of all would have come in their previous meeting, most teams having already played most other teams in their division. Sometimes, however, this alone will not do. Take Nasty Leeds, for example, who thumped Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County 4-1 when they met way back in early August and host the return fixture on Friday evening. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on the fact we played against them five months ago,\u201d sniffed Marcelo Bielsa. \u201c[FLDC] is not the same team any more. They are a lot better now.\u201d</p> <p>That is something that Lampard certainly seemed to agree with. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve improved since then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had a lot of time to work. I would like to think we will give them a better challenge in this game than we did in that one.\u201d But if Nasty Leeds could not rely on the fact they played against Derby five months ago, what could they rely on? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jan/11/premier-league-team-news-transfer-updates-tottenham-manchester-united-live?page=with:block-5c38af2ee4b072dc52e6cebf#block-5c38af2ee4b072dc52e6cebf\">Well</a>, at about 11.20am on Thursday \u201ca suspicious male was seen at the perimeter fence\u201d of Derby\u2019s Moor Farm training ground. A club employee called the police \u201cregarding a man acting suspiciously on Morley Road\u201d. Some fine officers of the Derbyshire Constabulary located him, put him in the back of a police van, tweeted a picture of him \u2013 face obscured \u2013 with the hashtag #SpyingIsCheating and escorted him from the premises.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/11/nottingham-forest-manager-aitor-karanka-leaves-club\">Nottingham Forest manager Aitor Karanka leaves club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A major diplomatic row swiftly ignited. \u201cIt has been confirmed to Derby County that the individual concerned is an employee of the footballing staff at [Nasty] Leeds United Football Club,\u201d FLDC said in a statement. \u201cThe club is now in discussion with [Nasty] Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident.\u201d Now let\u2019s consider this for a moment. Training-ground espionage is not necessarily stupid, but this man was allegedly lurking on the side of a busy road, poking his nose through a particularly visible stretch of fence and carrying a pair of binoculars and some pliers. He was, essentially, wearing a generic up-to-no-good fancy dress costume. It is akin to a would-be burglar approaching a target house in broad daylight sporting a balaclava and hefting over one shoulder a large sack labelled \u201cswag\u201d.</p> <p>Something here does not ring true. Bielsa, after all, is a man labelled \u201ca genius\u201d by Fernando Llorente and a man declared \u201cthe best coach in the world\u201d by Pep Guardiola. If he wanted to surreptitiously learn the finer details of a rival side\u2019s tactical approach, he would find a method of doing so so devious and shrewd nobody could possibly discover it. However, if he wanted to disrupt their training, confuse their coaches and distract their attention from the match they were supposed to be preparing for, perhaps things could hardly have gone any better.

      "bodyText": "I SPY? At this stage in the season it should not be hard for a team to have some idea how a rival might play. Most have, after all, played a couple of dozen games already. The greatest clue of all would have come in their previous meeting, most teams having already played most other teams in their division. Sometimes, however, this alone will not do. Take Nasty Leeds, for example, who thumped Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County 4-1 when they met way back in early August and host the return fixture on Friday evening. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on the fact we played against them five months ago,\u201d sniffed Marcelo Bielsa. \u201c[FLDC] is not the same team any more. They are a lot better now.\u201d That is something that Lampard certainly seemed to agree with. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve improved since then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had a lot of time to work. I would like to think we will give them a better challenge in this game than we did in that one.\u201d But if Nasty Leeds could not rely on the fact they played against Derby five months ago, what could they rely on? Well, at about 11.20am on Thursday \u201ca suspicious male was seen at the perimeter fence\u201d of Derby\u2019s Moor Farm training ground. A club employee called the police \u201cregarding a man acting suspiciously on Morley Road\u201d. Some fine officers of the Derbyshire Constabulary located him, put him in the back of a police van, tweeted a picture of him \u2013 face obscured \u2013 with the hashtag #SpyingIsCheating and escorted him from the premises. A major diplomatic row swiftly ignited. \u201cIt has been confirmed to Derby County that the individual concerned is an employee of the footballing staff at [Nasty] Leeds United Football Club,\u201d FLDC said in a statement. \u201cThe club is now in discussion with [Nasty] Leeds United club officials in relation to this incident.\u201d Now let\u2019s consider this for a moment. Training-ground espionage is not necessarily stupid, but this man was allegedly lurking on the side of a busy road, poking his nose through a particularly visible stretch of fence and carrying a pair of binoculars and some pliers. He was, essentially, wearing a generic up-to-no-good fancy dress costume. It is akin to a would-be burglar approaching a target house in broad daylight sporting a balaclava and hefting over one shoulder a large sack labelled \u201cswag\u201d. Something here does not ring true. Bielsa, after all, is a man labelled \u201ca genius\u201d by Fernando Llorente and a man declared \u201cthe best coach in the world\u201d by Pep Guardiola. If he wanted to surreptitiously learn the finer details of a rival side\u2019s tactical approach, he would find a method of doing so so devious and shrewd nobody could possibly discover it. However, if he wanted to disrupt their training, confuse their coaches and distract their attention from the match they were supposed to be preparing for, perhaps things could hardly have gone any better. Well played, Se\u00f1or Bielsa, you win again (TBC). LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Niall McVeigh from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Nasty Leeds 2-2 FLDC. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt\u2019s like climbing a mountain with butter on your hands: one day you think you are almost there and then you slide back down\u201d \u2013 Neil Warnock reveals he is struggling to get signings over the line at Cardiff. SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cDismal away experiences (Fiver letters passim)? I grew up watching Northampton play at the County Ground, a pretty dismal experience for fans and players. Despite taking us to the old First Division for one wonderful season, Dave Bowen used to make a point of meeting new players at a service station on the M1 so he could get them to sign a contract before they saw the ground we shared with the cricket club, which also meant the first and last games of the season were always away. But my heart will always be at The Hotel End\u201d \u2013 Pop Spencer. \u201cEnough ribaldry at the expense of Liverpudlian dynamo Xherdan Shaqiri (Fiver passim). If you were to investigate the geometry of Mr Shaqiri\u2019s frame, you would certainly find him to be orthorhombic, just like the rest of us. Cuboid, indeed! I always knew that Crystallography 101 would be useful one day\u201d \u2013 Tony Thulborn. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel the marketing people have missed a huge opportunity with regards to Telford (yesterday\u2019s last line). OK, so maybe he might not have taken a look at it, but surely Telly Does Telford was begging to be made\u201d \u2013 Matt Atkinson. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Pop Spencer. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Campaigners for stronger government regulation of gambling have called for it to be classed as a public health concern. Arsenal and Manchester United\u2019s FA Cup fourth round tie will take place on Friday 25 January because Modern Football. Aitor Karanka, after weeks of speculation suggesting Nottingham Forest\u2019s board were planning to shove him through the door marked Do One, has apparently sauntered through the door marked Do One of his own volition. OK. Dejan Lovren has been suspended for one international match after posting a video on Instachat in which he talked about elbowing Sergio Ramos and made insulting comments about the Spain team. Lovren fell foul of the Uefa rule that punishes players \u201cwhose conduct is insulting or otherwise violates the basic rules of decent conduct\u201d. Liverpool have also been boosted for Saturday\u2019s trip to Brighton after Lovren was diagnosed with hamstring-knack. Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri is feeling funky at Bayern Munich\u2019s pursuit of Callum Hudson-Odoi. \u201cI think that it\u2019s not professional, because they are talking about a player under contract with Chelsea,\u201d he fumed. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t respect our club.\u201d And Australia are back in flamin\u2019 Asian Cup business after sticking it to Palestine 3-0.

King\u2019s words are a reminder that while Murray does not deserve to endure such a cruel ending, another story could be about to begin. The world needs more men like the shy boy from Dunblane.",

      "bodyText": "We should all be truly thankful for the existence of The Masked Singer. Not because it\u2019s enjoyable or fun or even particularly good, but because it very clearly signals the logical endpoint of the televised singing competition. Of course it does. Once you\u2019ve stuffed Tommy Chong into a pineapple costume and forced him to sing I Will Survive for the entertainment of a prominent anti-vaxxer, where else can you go? Nowhere, that\u2019s where. We\u2019re witnessing an entire genre collapse into electron-degenerate matter, and it\u2019s all thanks to The Masked Singer. The premise of The Masked Singer, for those unfortunate enough to have missed it, is this. People in costumes perform songs. Behind those costumes are well-known celebrities. Half the fun is trying to guess who the celebrities are, and the other half comes from how the show makes you feel like you just ate a bucket of bad seafood. After Pop Idol (where you saw the singers) and The Voice (where you saw the singers but the judges didn\u2019t), The Masked Singer (where nobody knows who any of the singers are, despite already knowing them) seems like the obvious next step.

But also look at what he\u2019s achieved, not just the wins but the way he goes about it, his humour, his support for equality, the way he shot down reporters for their comments.\u201d</p> \n<p>Murray\u2019s sense of humour, most vivid in his Instagram account, is notoriously dry and, at times, has been so understated as to be missed by commentators unfamiliar with this peculiarly Scottish seam of wit. But Murray\u2019s trademark understatement is also what endears him, especially so in Dunblane, a town too familiar with extremes. Both Murray brothers were pupils at Dunblane primary school and in class the day that Thomas Hamilton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/mar/14/dunblane-massacre-scotland-killing\">shot dead 16 children and one teacher</a> on 13 March 1996.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1eb4d414c271cb929e49b0ffefb4c1a7bedc2e4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1eb4d414c271cb929e49b0ffefb4c1a7bedc2e4/0_256_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gold postbox in Andy Murray\u2019s home town of Dunblane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gold postbox in Dunblane that commemorates Murray\u2019s London 2012 Olympic victory</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Likewise, in a town that has come to expect some degree of misrepresentation, locals appreciate his authenticity: Murray\u2019s passion on the court is real, as are his tears and his mammoth sulks.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idol,\u201d says Thomson. \u201cHe\u2019s left an amazing legacy and he\u2019s done everything he can to help younger players.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nicola Wishart is playing practice doubles under Josh\u2019s instruction.

      "bodyText": "The Friday morning coaching sessions are in full swing at Dunblane Tennis Club, where Andy Murray and his elder brother, Jamie, began their sporting careers nearly three decades ago. Josh Thomson, 20, is punting a bucket of balls to his adult learners\u2019 class under a leaden sky, while the news of Andy Murray\u2019s emotional overnight announcement, that he plans to retire from tennis after Wimbledon, settles on the club and the town. Thomson, who started playing tennis at the age of six, just as the gangly teenager from Dunblane began to raise interest on the international tennis circuit, puts it simply: \u201cHe represented Scotland the way we want to be represented.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s devastating news that this has happened in what should have been his peak years,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up, Andy Murray was the player I wanted to be. But also look at what he\u2019s achieved, not just the wins but the way he goes about it, his humour, his support for equality, the way he shot down reporters for their comments.\u201d Murray\u2019s sense of humour, most vivid in his Instagram account, is notoriously dry and, at times, has been so understated as to be missed by commentators unfamiliar with this peculiarly Scottish seam of wit. But Murray\u2019s trademark understatement is also what endears him, especially so in Dunblane, a town too familiar with extremes. Both Murray brothers were pupils at Dunblane primary school and in class the day that Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 children and one teacher on 13 March 1996. Likewise, in a town that has come to expect some degree of misrepresentation, locals appreciate his authenticity: Murray\u2019s passion on the court is real, as are his tears and his mammoth sulks. \u201cHe\u2019s an idol,\u201d says Thomson. \u201cHe\u2019s left an amazing legacy and he\u2019s done everything he can to help younger players.\u201d Nicola Wishart is playing practice doubles under Josh\u2019s instruction. Her two children, who attend Dunblane primary, also play at the club. \u201cThey found out this morning and they were really upset. It\u2019s so sad to see him having to stop before he wants to.\u201d For Wishart, Murray\u2019s impact on the next generation is inestimable: \u201cThere\u2019s a really strong coaching programme at the club here and the kids all love it. But across the country now there\u2019s a whole generation thinking they can be great sportspeople, watching Andy and Jamie and feeling that anything is possible.\u201d As the morning coaching sessions draw to a close, Brian Melville, a semi-professional coach who first encountered Murray as a four-year-old, describes the boy he trained regularly at the club from the age of seven: \u201cHe was just a winner. He didn\u2019t want to be second, he wanted to win, even at that age. I called it grit and determination.\u201d Murray\u2019s legacy is this: \u201cWhen you think about Dunblane, you think about Andy Murray.\u201d What is unsaid is the particular resonance of this achievement for a town that was previously synonymous with tragedy. Along Dunblane high street, which curves down the hill from the golden postbox that commemorates Murray\u2019s London 2012 Olympic victory, the affection and appreciation for Murray the man \u2013 as much as the player \u2013 is evident. \u201cHe\u2019s got to look after his health,\u201d says Mairi Ross, serving behind the counter at Fresh As A Daisy laundry. \u201cHe\u2019s got to do it for himself and his family.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll have other opportunities,\u201d says her colleague Lizanne Richards. \u201cHe can go into commentating, and there are all these other things he can do.

      "bodyText": "Before we close for the day, here\u2019s a quick summary of the main events: The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to November, which was the weakest in six months. Growth was held back by a shrinking British manufacturing sector, with car production bearing the brunt of the slump. Flybe has urged its shareholders to accept a cut-price \u00a32.2m takeover offer from a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic. If the offer of 1p per share is accepted, Virgin and co will inject \u00a3100m into the struggling airline. Economists said Italy could be in a technical recession, predicting a 0.1% contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018, following a 0.1% fall in the third. The pound rose after a report in the Evening Standard which quoted unnamed cabinet sources saying Brexit could be delayed. However, a spokesman for Theresa May said she had ruled out an extension to Article 50. The pound is now up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2783, and down 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1467. Annual inflation in the US fell to 1.9% in the year to December from 2.2% in November, as a drop in petrol prices offset a rise in the cost of food. Markets across Europe opened higher but momentum faded and all major indices are down. Having briefly broken through the 7,000 mark for the first time in 2019, the FTSE 100 is down 33 points at 6,909. Wall Street is also down, with the Dow off 151 points at 23,850. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again on Monday. US markets fell after the opening bell, as Donald Trump edges closer to declaring a national emergency to fund his long-promised border wall with Mexico and end the political impasse that has led to the partial shutdown of the government. Dow Jones: -110 points or -0.5% at 23,892 S&amp;P 500: -12 points or -0.5% at 2,584 Nasdaq: -41 points or -0.6% at 6,945 Over in Greece, the German chancellor Angela Merkel is continuing to win over Greek hearts as she pledged \u201cheart felt support\u201d for the country almost 10 years after its debt crisis began. Helena Smith explains: The 64-year-old leader, whose two-day official visit ends this afternoon, has staged what is widely being seen as a victory tour of the eurozone\u2019s weakest member state, five months after it exited its third EU-sponsored bailout and almost four years after coming close to crashing out of the single currency bloc. The unexpected love-in between the leader, once deplored as the mother of austerity and Greece\u2019s political elite, continued today with Merkel dispensing with her famous frostiness to unexpectedly announce that it is a \u201cmatter of the heart to support Greece\u201d even on the question of reparations for Nazi war crimes. Greek-German relations had now entered \u201ca new phase,\u201d she said, with Berlin being Athens\u2019 \u201cmost significant trade partner\u201d and Greek exports, last year alone, increasing by 18%. After holding talks with Merkel, Greece\u2019s leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted that while much divided them ideologically they had overcome differences by building up \u201ca relationship of trust\u201d that had, he said, played a major role in preventing Grexit. The fall in US inflation reduces the urgency for further interest rate hikes by the Fed, according to Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics. With real economic growth solid and the stock market continuing to rebound, we suspect that it\u2019s still too soon to assume that the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle is over. But the continued stability of core inflation could give the Fed more room to pause, as officials assess the impact of the slowdown in global growth and tightening in financial conditions on the domestic economy. Regardless, we continue to expect that an economic slowdown later this year will force the Fed to start cutting rates again in 2020. Annual inflation in the US fell to 1.9% in December from 2.2% in November, the Labor Department said. A 2.1% drop in petrol prices over the 12 months offset a 1.6% rise in food prices, itself driven by an increase in the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables. Core inflation \u2013 which strips out food and energy prices \u2013 was 2.2% in the year to December, unchanged from November. Read our full story on this morning\u2019s GDP figures here: Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool says today\u2019s GDP data won\u2019t deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates this year: Although today\u2019s economic data confirms that our economy is slowing down, the slump is fully in line with Bank of England\u2019s most recent predictions. With this in mind, we are still on target for the Bank of England policy rate rate to rise to 1% by the end of 2019 [from 0.75% now]. Unless, of course, Mrs May\u2019s Brexit deal is rejected during next week\u2019s Parliamentary vote which risks opening Pandora\u2019s (economic) box and bring into the picture interest rate cuts instead. Having briefly flirted above 7,000, the FTSE 100 is now back in the red as the earlier merriment appears to have evaporated. The FTSE is down 19 points or 0.3% at 6,923.91. Here\u2019s how it looks elsewhere: Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 10,873.44 France\u2019s CAC: -0.4% at 4,784.62 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 19,239.44 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 8,893.60 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: flat at 348.88 Away from the UK, Italy could be heading into recession according to economists at the Dutch bank ING. They say that poor industrial production data for November, combined with soft confidence numbers, significantly increase the chances of Italy entering a technical recession in the fourth quarter. The Italian economy is expected to shrink by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018, following a 0.1% contraction in the third quarter. With similar fears for Germany, it\u2019s not looking so rosy for the eurozone\u2019s major powers. Paolo Pizzoli, senior economist at ING, says: Industrial production data, just published by Istat, showed that the Italian economy shared the same difficulties as Germany and France in November. Although a public holiday at the start of the month might have contributed to the worsening picture, we believe the impact is probably only minor. The pound has been boosted this morning by mounting speculation that Brexit could be delayed (or cancelled altogether). According to a report in the Evening Standard, unnamed \u201ccabinet ministers\u201d said a Brexit date of 29 March was looking increasingly unachievable. Here is an extract from the London paper: A backlog of at least six essential Bills that must be passed before Britain leaves the European Union has left ministers convinced the timetable will be extended. They include the much-delayed Immigration Bill. Even asking MPs to sit at weekends and cancel their half-term holiday in February may not provide enough time to avoid asking for a delay, several sources have disclosed. A senior minister said: \u201cThe legislative timetable is now very very tight indeed.\u201d The pound rose by a cent to a high of $1.285, but the gains narrowed when a spokeswoman for Theresa May said she had ruled out an extension to Article 50. The pound is now up 0.4% or half a cent at $1.280. It is up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1526. Labour has responded to the latest growth figures, blaming a slowdown on the government\u2019s \u201cbotched handling\u201d of Brexit. Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, says: It\u2019s clear from these figures that the government\u2019s botched handling of Brexit is continuing to damage our economy. The ONS has reported that manufacturing had suffered their longest period of monthly falls in output since the financial crisis. Slowing growth and more disappointing manufacturing figures are another sign of the failures of the Tories on Brexit negotiations and economic policy in general. Only an election and change of government can turn this disastrous situation around.\u201d Manufacturing was a clear weak spot in the UK economy in the three months to November, shrinking 0.8% compared with the previous three months. As we saw yesterday when Jaguar Land Rover and Ford announced thousands of job cuts, the car industry in particularly has been hit hard and production was down 2.4% over the three-month period. A number of factors are weighing on the auto industry, including: a sharp fall in demand for diesel vehicles; tougher emissions tests which are causing delays; weaker demand in China; and Brexit uncertainty. Francesco Arcangeli, economist at the manufacturers\u2019 trade body, EEF, said: While the service sector has performed better than expected the same cannot be said for manufacturing with production falling again and ten out of thirteen sub-sectors reporting a contraction in the three months to November. Most significantly, manufacturing output has now fallen for the fifth consecutive month, the first time this has happened since the financial crisis. In particular, coming on the back of yesterday\u2019s announcements there was yet more bad news for motor vehicles which contracted by 2.4% in the three-months to November. The sector, which is crucial for several manufacturing sub-sectors in the country, appears to be in a very weak spot and it would appear the knock-on effects are now having significant consequences for the supply chain. Pablo Shah, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says UK growth is likely to remain weak in the coming months: Today\u2019s figures show that the UK economy has now entered what is likely to be a prolonged spell of weak growth. Cebr forecasts that the UK economy will expand by 1.1% in 2019, which would make it the weakest year since the 2009 recession, as economic uncertainty continues to cripple sentiment among firms and households alike. Economic growth slowed to 0.3% in the three months to November, from 0.4% in the three months to October. A breakdown shows that once again growth in the three months to November was reliant on the services sector, which accounts for roughly 80% of the economy. Construction output rose (thanks to housebuilding), and production fell. Services sector grew by 0.3% Construction output rose by 2.1% Industrial production (including manufacturing output) fell 0.8% The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to November, down from 0.4% in the three months to October and the weakest in six months. Growth was driven by the services sector, while manufacturing output fell, led a by a slump in car production. On a monthly basis, GDP rose by 0.2% in November, which was an improvement on October\u2019s 0.1% growth. Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS, said: Growth in the UK economy continued to slow in the three months to November 2018 after performing more strongly through the middle of the year. Accountancy and housebuilding again grew but a number of other areas were sluggish. Manufacturing saw a steep decline, with car production and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry both performing poorly. Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, says the FTSE\u2019s break through the 7,000 mark is significant: FTSE 100 is testing 7,000 again, showing a firm bounce from the key test at 6,700 which it has survived. The area around 7,000 is the 38% retracement of the rally from the 2016 lows to the 2018 highs. It\u2019s also an area where we saw a lot of choppiness last November and is likely to form a key resistance point. The indicators appear quite bullish with the index breaking free from downtrend resistance and through its 50-day moving average on the close yesterday, which has proved a very sticky area of resistance throughout the recent downtrend. European investors have started the day with moderate cheer, with all major indices edging higher in early trading. The FTSE is back above the 7,000 mark for the first time in 2019, up 57 points or 0.8%. It follows a turnaround on Wall Street on Thursday, with the Dow down sharply after a gloomy update from the department store Macy\u2019s, which had disappointing sales over Christmas and lowered its earnings guidance for 2018. The Dow then recovered after comments by Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, who signalled the central bank might be prepared to hit the pause button on further US rate hikes. Here\u2019s how its looking across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.8% at 7,000.29 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 10,949.72 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 4,818.01 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 19,354.55 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 8,890.90 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 350 Struggling airline Flybe has recommended to shareholders a \u00a32.2m takeover offer from a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, which is part-owned by the billionaire Sir Richard Branson. The consortium, which also includes infrastructure firm Stobart Group and investment house Cyrus, are offering just 1p per share. That\u2019s a hefty discount compared with Flybe\u2019s closing price of 16.38p, and shares have plunged 90% this morning to 1.7p. Flybe put itself up for sale in November after a profits warning that outlined the extent of its woes, as it struggled to cope with rising fuel costs, currency volatility and political uncertainty. If the deal goes ahead, Virgin and co will inject \u00a3100m into Flybe, broken down into a \u00a320 working capital loan and \u00a380m to invest. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting the ONS figures later this morning to show Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector grew by 0.3% in November. But as we saw yesterday with Jaguar Land Rover and Ford axing thousands of jobs, car manufacturers in particular are struggling. Michael Hewson , chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says the figures could well come in below expectations, following in the footsteps of Germany and France: Concerns about a slowdown in the UK economy will focus on a different sector today with the release of the latest manufacturing and industrial production numbers for November. We\u2019ve already seen some ugly numbers out from Germany and France this week raising concerns that Germany could fall into recession in Q4. If the weak economic environment in Europe is any guide the UK could well cop some of the fallout from that, with the sharp decline in oil prices also weighing on the UK oil and gas sector. UK industrial production is expected to rise 0.3%, while manufacturing production is expected to rise 0.4% after some sharp declines in October. It should be remembered that similar positive projections were expected for this week\u2019s German and French numbers so a sharp miss to the downside can\u2019t be ruled out. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK growth figures at 9.30am will provide the latest insight into how the economy is faring as Brexit looms. It\u2019s not expected to be pretty, with City economists pencilling in growth of just 0.1% in November. If economists are correct, the quarterly rate of growth will slow to 0.3% from 0.4%. The Office for National Statistics will also publish growth estimates for the major output sectors of the economy (services, manufacturing and construction), which will provide further clues on how sections of the economy are performing. We already know that November was a terrible month for retailers (the worst on record according to Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley), but how is the rest of the economy holding up?

The problem is less the speed of things than the narrowness of our focus on the present: \u201cAnything that happened more than a week or so ago is consigned to the dustbin of history,\u201d writes Jacobs, who suspects our temporal bandwidth has worn unprecedentedly, perhaps dangerously, thin.</p> <p>Yet the received wisdom of pop psychology, as you know, is that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200811/the-art-now-six-steps-living-in-the-moment\">living in the moment</a>\u201d is an excellent thing; mentally dwelling in the future or past is to be avoided, since that just means unnecessary anxiety or regret.

      "body": "<p><strong>I have been married to my husband for seven years and we have been together for </strong><strong>10. In the beginning, the sex was amazing. </strong><strong>But after </strong><strong>he joined the military, his sex drive went </strong><strong>down and he </strong><strong>became depress</strong><strong>ed whenever we were separated for long periods</strong><strong>. There was some infidelity</strong><strong> between the two of us, </strong><strong>which we managed to overcome </strong><strong>through marriage counselling. We learned how to better communicate and support each other.</strong></p> <p><strong>My husband has since left the military, and that has brought us closer together</strong><strong>, but </strong><strong>our sex life has been lacklustre for the past three years</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>We have tried talking about it, but</strong><strong> my husband has not given me a proper orgasm </strong><strong>in that time, and I don\u2019t know how to change that. I\u2019ve told him what I like in the bedroom, and</strong><strong> he\u2019s made some effort</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>But he hates giving me oral sex </strong><strong>\u2013 </strong><strong>and it\u2019s the main way </strong><strong>I can have an orgasm.</strong></p> <p><strong>Also, </strong><strong>his overall stamina </strong><strong>has dropped dramatically. </strong><strong>Every time we have sex, it\u2019s rushed; I don\u2019t feel satisfied. </strong><strong>I don\u2019t know how to convey my concerns without </strong><strong>emasculating him. How can I tell him that he is not fulfilling my needs, without hurting his feelings? I feel </strong><strong>our marriage hangs in the balance of trying to reconnect emotionally and physically</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p>What happened three years ago? I feel that is something worth exploring. Also, quite a lot seems to have been connected to him joining and leaving the military \u2013 what happened? Did he suffer trauma? Has his depression been addressed?</p> <p>Despite the counselling (well done for that), there still seems a lot that has been left unsaid between the two of you. Communication in a relationship is something that needs regular maintenance, not something you attend to once and then never again. Were you able to properly communicate via counselling? If so, that bodes well, as some couples can\u2019t. But, you might need to look at counselling again with a trained sexual counsellor. Has the hurt from both your affairs been healed?</p> <p>There was a sterility to your letter \u2013 it all seemed quite businesslike. Is that how you see your relationship \u2013 as a series of transactions? What would you say to your husband if he wrote this letter?</p> <p>I consulted Cate Mackenzie, a sexual and relationship counsellor (<a href=\"https://www.cosrt.org.uk/\" title=\"\">cosrt.org.uk</a>). \u201cNo one,\u201d Mackenzie said, \u201c\u2018gives\u2019 you an orgasm [when in a couple situation]. It\u2019s co-created. Are you orgasming on your own? What is your relationship with your own erotic self like?\u201d If you orgasm by yourself (ie without oral sex), is this something you could translate into doing with your husband?</p> <p>Mackenzie thought that in order to start communicating \u2013 and really listening to one another \u2013 you need to meet in a neutral place, where there are no expectations of either of you. She also felt you could put intercourse aside for now and think about \u201csensuality without a goal\u201d. She recommended True Pleasures: A Memoir Of Women In Paris by Lucinda Holdforth, a book about eroticism, and also suggested \u201cengaging yourself in something pleasurable every day for 30 days, from a self-massage to a cup of tea in a sumptuous cafe\u201d. She also said, \u201cI wondered how you are both feeding this relationship, or if you understand each other\u2019s own arousal.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/23/people-keep-asking-why-i-dont-have-children-i-dont-know-what-to-say\">People keep asking why I don\u2019t have children. I don\u2019t know what to say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy to boil a relationship down to sex. But what else is there to yours? \u201cThere is a feeling that you are treating each other a little like objects, as if you are using each other to get off rather than connecting.

      "bodyText": "I have been married to my husband for seven years and we have been together for 10. In the beginning, the sex was amazing. But after he joined the military, his sex drive went down and he became depressed whenever we were separated for long periods. There was some infidelity between the two of us, which we managed to overcome through marriage counselling. We learned how to better communicate and support each other. My husband has since left the military, and that has brought us closer together, but our sex life has been lacklustre for the past three years. We have tried talking about it, but my husband has not given me a proper orgasm in that time, and I don\u2019t know how to change that. I\u2019ve told him what I like in the bedroom, and he\u2019s made some effort. But he hates giving me oral sex \u2013 and it\u2019s the main way I can have an orgasm. Also, his overall stamina has dropped dramatically. Every time we have sex, it\u2019s rushed; I don\u2019t feel satisfied. I don\u2019t know how to convey my concerns without emasculating him. How can I tell him that he is not fulfilling my needs, without hurting his feelings? I feel our marriage hangs in the balance of trying to reconnect emotionally and physically. What happened three years ago? I feel that is something worth exploring. Also, quite a lot seems to have been connected to him joining and leaving the military \u2013 what happened? Did he suffer trauma? Has his depression been addressed? Despite the counselling (well done for that), there still seems a lot that has been left unsaid between the two of you. Communication in a relationship is something that needs regular maintenance, not something you attend to once and then never again. Were you able to properly communicate via counselling? If so, that bodes well, as some couples can\u2019t. But, you might need to look at counselling again with a trained sexual counsellor. Has the hurt from both your affairs been healed? There was a sterility to your letter \u2013 it all seemed quite businesslike. Is that how you see your relationship \u2013 as a series of transactions? What would you say to your husband if he wrote this letter? I consulted Cate Mackenzie, a sexual and relationship counsellor (cosrt.org.uk). \u201cNo one,\u201d Mackenzie said, \u201c\u2018gives\u2019 you an orgasm [when in a couple situation]. It\u2019s co-created. Are you orgasming on your own? What is your relationship with your own erotic self like?\u201d If you orgasm by yourself (ie without oral sex), is this something you could translate into doing with your husband? Mackenzie thought that in order to start communicating \u2013 and really listening to one another \u2013 you need to meet in a neutral place, where there are no expectations of either of you. She also felt you could put intercourse aside for now and think about \u201csensuality without a goal\u201d. She recommended True Pleasures: A Memoir Of Women In Paris by Lucinda Holdforth, a book about eroticism, and also suggested \u201cengaging yourself in something pleasurable every day for 30 days, from a self-massage to a cup of tea in a sumptuous cafe\u201d. She also said, \u201cI wondered how you are both feeding this relationship, or if you understand each other\u2019s own arousal.\u201d It\u2019s easy to boil a relationship down to sex. But what else is there to yours? \u201cThere is a feeling that you are treating each other a little like objects, as if you are using each other to get off rather than connecting. Sex is arousing when you find out what turns you both on.\u201d Do you both feel safe with each other? Do you trust each other with your feelings? Mackenzie suggested an effective way to communicate is to always start with \u201cI\u201d statements. Look up The Daily Temperature Reading by Virginia Satir, which suggests starting conversations with either, 1) An appreciation: \u201cI love it when you do X\u201d; 2) A puzzle: \u201cI wonder if we could?\u201d; 3) A request: \u201cCan we talk about/explore/try?\u201d The key is to \u201cexpress longing, without making your husband feel in the wrong.

The Indian army was called in to quell the unrest, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/fears-unrest-indian-guru-convicted-rape-ram-rahim-singh-panchkula\">left at least 30 people dead</a> and more than 250 injured.</p> <p>The rape investigation arose when a woman wrote an anonymous letter to the Indian prime minister in 2002 claiming she had been raped by Singh. News of the letter was published by Chhatrapati in his newspaper, Poora Sach.</p> <p>India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation alleged that Singh, 51, and his associates believed Chhatrapati was responsible for the circulation of the letter. He was shot five times at point-blank range by two assailants outside his home about five months later.</p> <p>The gunmen and the owner of the weapon were named in the first charge sheet, but the journalist\u2019s son had to fight for years to have the case transferred from the local police to federal authorities, who found evidence of Singh\u2019s involvement.</p> <p>The court in Haryana said on Friday that Singh had ordered the hit. Curfews were imposed in the surrounding town after the conviction and security was increased but there were no reports of violence.</p> <p>The headquarters of Dera Sacha Sauda, Singh\u2019s sect, has largely been deserted since his conviction for the rapes in 2017, according to <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dera-sacha-sauda-dies-a-slow-death/story-w5msdlIcy68QaAZvbu8MjM.html\">Indian media reports</a>. It is unclear who now leads the organisation or how many supporters remain.</p> <p>The guru achieved mainstream popularity in 2014 when he appeared in the first of two films about his life, in which he was credited for 30 roles, including director, producer and choreographer. Its ticket sales flagged after <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/world/mass-castrations-officers-crack-code-of-silence-of-followers-of-indian-guru-ram-rahim-20150224-13o0z8\">Indian police went public</a> with accusations that Singh had been organising \u201cmass castrations\u201d of his followers, a charge he denied.</p> <p>Singh is serving a 20-year jail sentence for the rapes. He will be sentenced for the murder on 17 January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A flamboyant Indian \u201cgod man\u201d has been convicted of killing a journalist who was investigating two rapes committed by the influential spiritual leader. Ram Rahim Singh was convicted on Friday along with three others of killing Ram Chander Chhatrapati, 51, in 2002. Singh, once known as the \u201cguru of bling\u201d, was a cult leader who claimed to have 60 million followers worldwide, played himself in hagiographic biopics and courted India\u2019s most powerful politicians. He lived with tens of thousands of his followers on a sprawling 400-hectare ashram in Haryana state with its own hotel, factories, cinemas, schools and cricket stadium. His rule came to a violent end in August 2017 when he was convicted of raping two female followers and 150,000 of his supporters ran amok across two Indian states. The Indian army was called in to quell the unrest, which left at least 30 people dead and more than 250 injured. The rape investigation arose when a woman wrote an anonymous letter to the Indian prime minister in 2002 claiming she had been raped by Singh. News of the letter was published by Chhatrapati in his newspaper, Poora Sach. India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation alleged that Singh, 51, and his associates believed Chhatrapati was responsible for the circulation of the letter. He was shot five times at point-blank range by two assailants outside his home about five months later. The gunmen and the owner of the weapon were named in the first charge sheet, but the journalist\u2019s son had to fight for years to have the case transferred from the local police to federal authorities, who found evidence of Singh\u2019s involvement. The court in Haryana said on Friday that Singh had ordered the hit. Curfews were imposed in the surrounding town after the conviction and security was increased but there were no reports of violence. The headquarters of Dera Sacha Sauda, Singh\u2019s sect, has largely been deserted since his conviction for the rapes in 2017, according to Indian media reports. It is unclear who now leads the organisation or how many supporters remain. The guru achieved mainstream popularity in 2014 when he appeared in the first of two films about his life, in which he was credited for 30 roles, including director, producer and choreographer. Its ticket sales flagged after Indian police went public with accusations that Singh had been organising \u201cmass castrations\u201d of his followers, a charge he denied. Singh is serving a 20-year jail sentence for the rapes. He will be sentenced for the murder on 17 January.",

      "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau was in campaign mode this week, striding around a school gymnasium, shirtsleeves rolled up and brow suitably furrowed as he addressed voters\u2019 concerns at one of his annual town hall-style meetings. A day earlier and nearly 800km away, another face of the federal government was on display as dozens of police \u2013 some heavily armed \u2013 stormed a makeshift barricade, arresting 14 indigenous protesters and prompting others to flee for safety on snowmobiles. The protesters in northern British Columbia had camped out for days amid bitter cold and deep snow, manning a checkpoint to prevent construction vehicles from entering the territory of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation. Their demonstrations, part of a fight against a multibillion-dollar natural gas pipeline, galvanized supporters across the country, and at his town hall meeting, the prime minister was forced to contend with a barrage of angry questions. The standoff ended on Wednesday night, in a temporary truce between leadership and police. But the dramatic scenes highlighted a broader issue for Canada in 2019: swaths of territory \u2013 never signed away by treaty or seized in war \u2013 still belong to indigenous nations who are fighting back against resource projects they say they never consented to. Unlike the rest of the country \u2013 where relationships between indigenous groups and the state are governed by treaties \u2013 few indigenous nations in British Columbia ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands, said Gordon Christie, a scholar of indigenous law at the University of British Columbia \u201cWhat I see is a long history of the Canadian government doing its best to avoid acknowledging the existence of other systems of government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Crown has itself acknowledged that the way it gets authority over territory is through the making of a treaty,\u201d said Christie. \u201cSo this is their problem.\u201d In recent months, tensions with indigenous peoples have flared across Canada as energy companies seek to construct projects on and through indigenous lands. Both TransCanada, which is attempting to build the Coastal GasLink pipeline and Kinder Morgan, which was pushing the TransMountain pipeline, have faced fierce opposition from indigenous groups. Much of the current uncertainty surrounds who companies should consult with when they begin to plans projects which would enter indigenous lands. While elected indigenous officials from communities along the route of the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline have signed benefit agreements with TransCanada, five Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs oppose the plan. The chiefs, who are unelected, argue they retain authority over the sprawling 22,000 sq km of the band\u2019s traditional territory.

Our people owned these territories since time immemorial,\u201d she said. Trudeau pledged to overhaul the framework guiding relations with indigenous communities nearly a year ago. But in areas where no treaties were signed, the courts have often become the arbiter of land claims. In 2014, the Tsilhqot\u2019in people in British Columbia won a longstanding battle over title rights at the country\u2019s highest court \u2013 but at a cost of more than $10m. Both Huson and Wickham believe Canadian law is inadequately equipped to handle land claims fights with the government. In 1997 the supreme court put an end to one of the longest-running legal battles in Canadian history, ruling that the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en had effectively demonstrated clear title to their land. The plaintiffs exhausted more than an estimated $25m on legal fees \u2013 only to have a retrial called, leaving uncertainty around their claim. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which route we take. We took this to the highest court in the Canada and it was ruled in our favour,\u201d said Wickham. \u201cEven when we follow their western law, it doesn\u2019t do us any good.\u201d Both the federal government and British Columbia have pledged to implement the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (UNdrip).

She seems to deliberately create enigma and ambiguity. Wearing traditional Spanish dress, she gazes out of the painting as if at someone she knows. Her black headdress and shawl and white gloves set off a face that is acutely real, mottled with complex emotion. Vel\u00e1zquez uses the two sides of his painterly genius \u2013 his unrivalled sensual understanding of colour and texture, and capacity for rough, almost lumpen naturalism \u2013 to create a truly magical effect. She is ordinary yet glamorous, and has an elusive, paradoxical beauty. No wonder the theories about her identity range from her having been Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s wife, to a courtesan, to an exiled French aristocrat. She will always keep her secrets, because the artist planned it that way.

Masterpiece of the week The Lady With a Fan, circa 1640, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez Who is the mysterious lady with a fan? She seems to deliberately create enigma and ambiguity. Wearing traditional Spanish dress, she gazes out of the painting as if at someone she knows. Her black headdress and shawl and white gloves set off a face that is acutely real, mottled with complex emotion. Vel\u00e1zquez uses the two sides of his painterly genius \u2013 his unrivalled sensual understanding of colour and texture, and capacity for rough, almost lumpen naturalism \u2013 to create a truly magical effect. She is ordinary yet glamorous, and has an elusive, paradoxical beauty. No wonder the theories about her identity range from her having been Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s wife, to a courtesan, to an exiled French aristocrat. She will always keep her secrets, because the artist planned it that way. She is the Spanish Mona Lisa. \u2022 Wallace Collection, London.

      "body": "<p>A year after her short story Cat Person was debated and picked apart by millions of readers around the world, the author Kristen Roupenian has recalled what it was like dealing with the scrutiny that came with her sudden prominence.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-it-felt-like-when-cat-person-went-viral\">Writing in the New Yorker</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/cat-person\">first published Cat Person in December 2017</a>, the American writer explains she had only been published in small journals before she debuted in the magazine with her story about Margot and Robert, framed around a single bad date.</p> <p>In her essay looking back, Roupenian revealed that it took three days for her to realise the story was being widely discussed online, calling it both a dream and a nightmare to receive so much feedback, with women in particular identifying with some of Margot\u2019s internalised attitudes to dating, consent and sex.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the emails coming and coming \u2013 first, fan letters from people who\u2019d discovered my story and liked it, then anti-fan letters, from people who\u2019d discovered my story and didn\u2019t. I received many in-depth descriptions, from men, of sexual encounters they\u2019d had, because they thought I\u2019d \u2018just like to know\u2019,\u201d she revealed.</p> <p>In particular, the conflation of Margot\u2019s experience in the story \u2013 a 20-year old single woman who begins dating a man \u2013 and her own, as a 36-year-old who had begun her first relationship with a woman, was troubling: \u201cI felt intensely protective of Margot, and of the readers who identified with her and, at the same time, I felt like an impostor. I felt as though if I were truthful about who I was, I would let everyone down.\u201d</p> <p>As thinkpieces, tweets and reviews began pulling the story and its surprise success apart, Roupenian was left dealing with \u201ca torrent of unvarnished, unpolished opinion \u2026 delivered directly to my eyes and my brain\u201d. Receiving such overwhelming volumes of feedback \u2013 good and bad \u2013 \u201cknowing, in that immediate and unmediated way, what people thought about my writing felt \u2026 the word I keep reaching for, even though it seems melodramatic, is <em>annihilating</em>. To be faced with all those people thinking and talking about me was like standing alone, at the centre of a stadium, while thousands of people screamed at me at the top of their lungs. Not <em>for</em> me, <em>at</em> me. I guess some people might find this exhilarating. I did not.\u201d</p> <p>Roupenian\u2019s debut book, a short-story collection called You Know You Want This, was published in the US this week and is due out in the UK in February. US critics have been divided about the collection\u2019s success, with <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/01/kristen-roupenian-book-cat-person-review.html\">Slate calling it</a> \u201cweird and pervy\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2019/01/09/loved-cat-person-story-here-more-and-delicious/nTwaa9RU1k0GoWcKWchHKJ/story.html\">Boston Globe praising it</a> as \u201cscintillating\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d, and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/books/review-you-know-you-want-this-cat-person-kristen-roupenian.html\">New York Times deeming it </a>\u201ca dull, needy book\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A year after her short story Cat Person was debated and picked apart by millions of readers around the world, the author Kristen Roupenian has recalled what it was like dealing with the scrutiny that came with her sudden prominence. Writing in the New Yorker, which first published Cat Person in December 2017, the American writer explains she had only been published in small journals before she debuted in the magazine with her story about Margot and Robert, framed around a single bad date. In her essay looking back, Roupenian revealed that it took three days for her to realise the story was being widely discussed online, calling it both a dream and a nightmare to receive so much feedback, with women in particular identifying with some of Margot\u2019s internalised attitudes to dating, consent and sex. \u201cI remember the emails coming and coming \u2013 first, fan letters from people who\u2019d discovered my story and liked it, then anti-fan letters, from people who\u2019d discovered my story and didn\u2019t. I received many in-depth descriptions, from men, of sexual encounters they\u2019d had, because they thought I\u2019d \u2018just like to know\u2019,\u201d she revealed. In particular, the conflation of Margot\u2019s experience in the story \u2013 a 20-year old single woman who begins dating a man \u2013 and her own, as a 36-year-old who had begun her first relationship with a woman, was troubling: \u201cI felt intensely protective of Margot, and of the readers who identified with her and, at the same time, I felt like an impostor. I felt as though if I were truthful about who I was, I would let everyone down.\u201d As thinkpieces, tweets and reviews began pulling the story and its surprise success apart, Roupenian was left dealing with \u201ca torrent of unvarnished, unpolished opinion \u2026 delivered directly to my eyes and my brain\u201d. Receiving such overwhelming volumes of feedback \u2013 good and bad \u2013 \u201cknowing, in that immediate and unmediated way, what people thought about my writing felt \u2026 the word I keep reaching for, even though it seems melodramatic, is annihilating. To be faced with all those people thinking and talking about me was like standing alone, at the centre of a stadium, while thousands of people screamed at me at the top of their lungs. Not for me, at me. I guess some people might find this exhilarating. I did not.\u201d Roupenian\u2019s debut book, a short-story collection called You Know You Want This, was published in the US this week and is due out in the UK in February. US critics have been divided about the collection\u2019s success, with Slate calling it \u201cweird and pervy\u201d, the Boston Globe praising it as \u201cscintillating\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d, and the New York Times deeming it \u201ca dull, needy book\u201d.",

It has swept awards shows and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/15/hamilton-musical-opens-washington-dc-lin-manuel-miranda\">conquered cities across the US</a> as well as London, but its arrival in the American commonwealth of Puerto Rico was always going to be special because of its composer, lyricist and star.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/lin-manuel-miranda\">Lin-Manuel Miranda</a>, born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, spent his childhood summers on the island. For the two-week San Juan run, which is raising money for arts communities on the island, the 38-year-old dynamo will reprise the title role for the first time since Broadway in July 2016. It will be a joyful and poignant homecoming; a moment to savour Miranda\u2019s global success, and a symbol of the island\u2019s slow return to normality after the September 2017 hurricane that killed nearly 3,000 people and caused what is thought to be <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/americas-biggest-blackout-2\">the biggest blackout in US history</a>.</p> <p>And yet, this being Puerto Rico, it is also complicated, multi-layered and politically charged. There has been controversy over a last-minute change of performance venue. Some are also reluctant to regard Miranda, born and raised in New York, as one of their own. They are unhappy about his association with Barack Obama and a debt restructuring plan that imposed harsh austerity measures on the territory of 3.3 million people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"225685927a4f8224c4f6c8540844f8f297e05e1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225685927a4f8224c4f6c8540844f8f297e05e1c/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aryam Camacho, 24, is Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s cousin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aryam Camacho, 24, is Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s cousin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika P Rodriguez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About 20 miles (32km) west of San Juan, traces of Miranda are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/theater/hamilton-puerto-rico-lin-manuel-miranda.html\">inescapable in Vega Alta</a>, an unglamorous town of 39,000 people where his extended family still lives. Its theatre was torn down in the 1970s to make way for a car park, but a small new plaza built by his father includes a bakery, bar, cafe, souvenir shop \u2013 hats, mugs, T-shirts, postcards, lifesize cardboard cutouts of Miranda \u2013 and a small museum showing off artwork, awards, cast recordings, family photos and theatre programmes. On the walls there are colourful tile mosaics that include Miranda\u2019s face, the Hamilton logo and the Puerto Rican flag. Salsa music plays as tourists snap photos.</p> <p>A short walk away, on a cul-de-sac of single-storey houses where the quiet is punctuated by squawks from tropical birds, is the home where the young Miranda and his sister would while away summers with their grandparents. He would often run over to see his neighbour Margo Rodriguez and enjoy her <a href=\"https://www.finedininglovers.com/blog/food-drinks/puerto-rican-limber/\">homemade limbers</a> \u2013 a local treat that resembles a popsicle frozen in a plastic cup. \u201cHe spent a lot of time with me here, singing, drawing and making jokes,\u201d says Rodriguez, now 85. \u201cI would pretend to play guitar with a broomstick and he would sing.

Elliot Knight Nater, a music director, says: \u201cThis town loves him.

His great-uncle, Gilberto Concepci\u00f3n de Gracia, was the founder of the Puerto Rican Independence party. His father, <a href=\"http://www.mirramgroup.com/luis-miranda-jr/\">Luis Miranda,</a> is a Democratic party consultant who left the island at 18 to chase the American dream and, despite speaking little English, found that New York \u201cfit like a glove\u201d. He settled in a Latino neighbourhood in Washington Heights \u2013 the inspiration for Miranda\u2019s breakthrough musical In the Heights, which he brought to Puerto Rico in 2010. Luis Miranda was a special adviser to the New York mayor Ed Koch in the 1980s and helped manage Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s successful campaigns for the US Senate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bde1d27506b1a87fb3a2894fa618a7b2d0227886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde1d27506b1a87fb3a2894fa618a7b2d0227886/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Miranda Jr, father of Lin-Manuel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Miranda Jr, father of Lin-Manuel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika P Rodriguez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His son has taken on the baton. Accepting a Tony award in 2008 for In the Heights, he waved a small Puerto Rican flag. Hamilton, which celebrates diversity by casting people of colour as the founding fathers of the US, was hailed by New Yorker magazine as \u201cthe Obama-era musical\u201d. Its cast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/21/hamilton-actor-defends-speech-mike-pence-donald-trump\">delivered a pointed statement</a> to the vice-president, Mike Pence, after one performance, while Miranda has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/914102927744217088\">tweeted</a> that Donald Trump will go to hell for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/donald-trump-attacks-puerto-rico-mayor-carmen-yulin-cruz\">criticising the mayor of San Juan</a> after the hurricane. He has also gone to Washington to plead with Congress to help Puerto Rico with its economic crisis and appeared on the comedian John Oliver\u2019s HBO show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt-mpuR_QHQ\">to rap</a>: \u201cPaul Ryan, I\u2019ll come sing Hamilton at your house. / I\u2019ll do-si-do with Pelosi, I\u2019ll wear my Hamilton blouse. / Your citizens are suffering, stop the bleeding, stop the loss. / Help Puerto Rico, it\u2019s just a hundred miles across.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f13d8b59ec7f71adf7da29fd4900f49e06db7789\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f13d8b59ec7f71adf7da29fd4900f49e06db7789/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk in Old San Juan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk in Old San Juan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika P Rodriguez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid the Spanish colonial buildings, cobbled streets and ornate balconies of old San Juan, where tourists disgorged by giant cruise ships wander among cats and pigeons, many are expressing their gratitude before opening night.

Hamilton was due to be performed at the University of Puerto Rico, where its producers spent $1m upgrading the theatre. Then, late last month, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-hamilton-in-puerto-rico-changed-venues-weeks-before-opening-night/\">the show was abruptly switched</a> to the Luis A Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center because of concerns about student protests over budget cuts enforced by Washington. The Hamilton set was taken down, shuttled across town and hastily rebuilt.</p> <p>Luis, 64, a former student at the university, was disappointed by the move but endorsed it. \u201cThere\u2019s many things that you could compromise but security is not one of them,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is a minimum possibility that anything can happen, that should be enough for the production to move.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4031aa4c14e9fa7b09dd470cda979e203b47393d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4031aa4c14e9fa7b09dd470cda979e203b47393d/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nelson Rivera, a retired arts professor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nelson Rivera, a retired arts professor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika P Rodriguez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But <a href=\"http://www.80grados.net/author/nelson-rivera/\">Nelson Rivera</a>, a retired art history professor at the university, accuses the producers of losing their nerve. \u201cI think the government threw shade at the students: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re a bunch of terrorists, get out of there.\u2019 They fell for it. They should have won over the community, the university, and nothing would have happened. We\u2019re very nice people.\u201d</p> <p>Rivera, 65, is sharply critical of Obama\u2019s solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s $70bn (\u00a355bn) public debt load, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/here-s-how-promesa-aims-tackle-puerto-rico-s-debt-n601741\">a law known as Promesa</a> that established a non-elected financial oversight and management board \u2013 supported at the time by Miranda but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/30/a-controversial-oversight-board-could-take-over-puerto-ricos-hurricane-rebuilding-effort/?utm_term=.d55dbecdc81e\">disparaged by many as \u201cla junta\u201d</a>. He says: \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a government of our own; we\u2019re governed by this junta and they\u2019re basically dismantling the country. One of the first things that they started to do was eliminate public education. A lot of public schools have been closed and the university has been really hit hard.</p> <p>\u201cSo Hamilton has been used to strengthen the idea that the university is a difficult place that has to be eliminated or at least toned down. That\u2019s exactly what they did when they moved the play instead of keeping it at the university. What is interesting about Hamilton is the way it\u2019s been used for politics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bca5ee30c80297e56c320e3cc51d461180f15a64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca5ee30c80297e56c320e3cc51d461180f15a64/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banners promoting the original dates of Hamilton can still be found at the university.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banners promoting the original dates of Hamilton can still be found at the university.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika P Rodriguez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rivera, a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, continues: \u201cThey call it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/19/hamilton-musical-donald-trump-immigration-barack-obama\">the Obama-era musical</a>. Give me a break. If Hamilton is anti-Trump, we\u2019re also anti-Obama. For Puerto Ricans, there\u2019s no difference at all between Obama and Trump. So I understand that Obama looks nicer and speaks better but his policies were as terrible to Puerto Rico as Trump\u2019s are. Obama gave us the junta and Trump sent us paper towels. What is the difference?\u201d</p> <p>Ten thousand tickets are being sold for $10 each to residents of Puerto Rico via lottery but Rivera has no intention of trying to see the musical. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mixed feelings for us. For artists, we have a strong theatre tradition here in Puerto Rico and American musicals are not really our thing. The subtitle of Hamilton is \u2018An American musical\u2019 and that\u2019s as American as you can get. So for us, this is not a play that\u2019s meaningful in terms of our culture. It really has nothing to do with us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"753e515c99e0b1a06a303ac0b529fd3452de1f0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/753e515c99e0b1a06a303ac0b529fd3452de1f0a/0_0_2500_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A family portrait of the Mirandas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A family portrait of the Mirandas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika P Rodriguez/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLin-Manuel was raised in the United States.

He has said many times that he is using the megaphone and the spotlight that he has gotten thanks to Hamilton to push forward things like the recovery of Puerto Rico.\u201d</p> <p>Luis Miranda also appears to embrace the complexities of his son\u2019s forays into politics, having fought many such battles himself. \u201cI hate Trump and anything I could do to defeat Republicans, even now my friends who are Republicans, I would do because they have allowed the party to be hijacked by this orange nut. When you do that, you know people are going to be with you and people are going to be against you. It\u2019s no different in Puerto Rico, but the important part that I hope I taught my kids is that you make decisions and you take stands and some will applaud you and some will criticise you, but you take the stand you believe is right.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Javier Ortiz likes to look on the bright side in San Juan, the pretty and gritty capital of Puerto Rico. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the owner of a bookstore, so I have to be.\u201d Ortiz has survived not only the onslaught of Amazon but also Hurricane Maria, which forced him to close for 10 days then manage the store without electricity \u2013 running a cash machine off a battery \u2013 for two months. Now, as the debt-ridden island finally gets an event to celebrate, the 50-year-old has one of the golden tickets. The mega-hit musical Hamilton opens in San Juan on Friday night. Ortiz\u2019s wife, Huarali, queued for 10 hours to get $150 tickets for them and their Hamilton-mad sons: Alejandro, 12, and nine-year-old Nicolas. \u201cIt is expensive: we\u2019re having to make a sacrifice,\u201d says Ortiz. \u201cWe will keep working hard and make a better island and better country. Hamilton\u2019s a good sign but the hard work we will have to do ourselves.\u201d With a score mixing hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&amp;B and Broadway, the show dramatises the life of Alexander Hamilton, a Caribbean immigrant who becomes an American founding father and the first treasury secretary, only to be wounded by scandal and die in a duel. It has swept awards shows and conquered cities across the US as well as London, but its arrival in the American commonwealth of Puerto Rico was always going to be special because of its composer, lyricist and star. Lin-Manuel Miranda, born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, spent his childhood summers on the island. For the two-week San Juan run, which is raising money for arts communities on the island, the 38-year-old dynamo will reprise the title role for the first time since Broadway in July 2016. It will be a joyful and poignant homecoming; a moment to savour Miranda\u2019s global success, and a symbol of the island\u2019s slow return to normality after the September 2017 hurricane that killed nearly 3,000 people and caused what is thought to be the biggest blackout in US history. And yet, this being Puerto Rico, it is also complicated, multi-layered and politically charged. There has been controversy over a last-minute change of performance venue. Some are also reluctant to regard Miranda, born and raised in New York, as one of their own. They are unhappy about his association with Barack Obama and a debt restructuring plan that imposed harsh austerity measures on the territory of 3.3 million people. About 20 miles (32km) west of San Juan, traces of Miranda are inescapable in Vega Alta, an unglamorous town of 39,000 people where his extended family still lives. Its theatre was torn down in the 1970s to make way for a car park, but a small new plaza built by his father includes a bakery, bar, cafe, souvenir shop \u2013 hats, mugs, T-shirts, postcards, lifesize cardboard cutouts of Miranda \u2013 and a small museum showing off artwork, awards, cast recordings, family photos and theatre programmes. On the walls there are colourful tile mosaics that include Miranda\u2019s face, the Hamilton logo and the Puerto Rican flag. Salsa music plays as tourists snap photos. A short walk away, on a cul-de-sac of single-storey houses where the quiet is punctuated by squawks from tropical birds, is the home where the young Miranda and his sister would while away summers with their grandparents. He would often run over to see his neighbour Margo Rodriguez and enjoy her homemade limbers \u2013 a local treat that resembles a popsicle frozen in a plastic cup. \u201cHe spent a lot of time with me here, singing, drawing and making jokes,\u201d says Rodriguez, now 85. \u201cI would pretend to play guitar with a broomstick and he would sing. He was a good kid. He was priceless.\u201d She is not alone in her pride. Elliot Knight Nater, a music director, says: \u201cThis town loves him. When they know he\u2019s coming here, you can see 200 to 300 people waiting: people who used to see him as a kid running in the streets.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope he never gets into politics because people change as soon as they get in that position.\u201d And yet Miranda\u2019s family is steeped in politics. His great-uncle, Gilberto Concepci\u00f3n de Gracia, was the founder of the Puerto Rican Independence party. His father, Luis Miranda, is a Democratic party consultant who left the island at 18 to chase the American dream and, despite speaking little English, found that New York \u201cfit like a glove\u201d. He settled in a Latino neighbourhood in Washington Heights \u2013 the inspiration for Miranda\u2019s breakthrough musical In the Heights, which he brought to Puerto Rico in 2010. Luis Miranda was a special adviser to the New York mayor Ed Koch in the 1980s and helped manage Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s successful campaigns for the US Senate. His son has taken on the baton. Accepting a Tony award in 2008 for In the Heights, he waved a small Puerto Rican flag. Hamilton, which celebrates diversity by casting people of colour as the founding fathers of the US, was hailed by New Yorker magazine as \u201cthe Obama-era musical\u201d. Its cast delivered a pointed statement to the vice-president, Mike Pence, after one performance, while Miranda has tweeted that Donald Trump will go to hell for criticising the mayor of San Juan after the hurricane. He has also gone to Washington to plead with Congress to help Puerto Rico with its economic crisis and appeared on the comedian John Oliver\u2019s HBO show to rap: \u201cPaul Ryan, I\u2019ll come sing Hamilton at your house. / I\u2019ll do-si-do with Pelosi, I\u2019ll wear my Hamilton blouse. / Your citizens are suffering, stop the bleeding, stop the loss. / Help Puerto Rico, it\u2019s just a hundred miles across.\u201d Amid the Spanish colonial buildings, cobbled streets and ornate balconies of old San Juan, where tourists disgorged by giant cruise ships wander among cats and pigeons, many are expressing their gratitude before opening night. Javier Santiago, 59, the director of the National Foundation for Popular Culture, has a small shrine to Miranda, including the red shirt he wore for the Broadway run of In the Heights, and invites young visitors to try on Miranda\u2019s cap. Some burst into tears. \u201cThat\u2019s something they will never forget,\u201d he says. \u201cWe feel very proud of the work he did in In the Heights. He showed the soul of our community: the getting together, the importance of family. This is a side that West Side Story never showed. Hamilton coming here is symbolic of the Puerto Rican soul that will never die. He\u2019s in the diaspora that left Puerto Rico to go to the United States; his parents brought him back every year and he never lost contact with his roots. The idiosyncrasy, the Latin way of being, is in him, pumping in his heart.\u201d But in Puerto Rico, neither a nation nor a state, where people can vote in US primaries but not in presidential elections, nothing is simple or straightforward. Hamilton was due to be performed at the University of Puerto Rico, where its producers spent $1m upgrading the theatre. Then, late last month, the show was abruptly switched to the Luis A Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center because of concerns about student protests over budget cuts enforced by Washington. The Hamilton set was taken down, shuttled across town and hastily rebuilt. Luis, 64, a former student at the university, was disappointed by the move but endorsed it. \u201cThere\u2019s many things that you could compromise but security is not one of them,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is a minimum possibility that anything can happen, that should be enough for the production to move.\u201d But Nelson Rivera, a retired art history professor at the university, accuses the producers of losing their nerve. \u201cI think the government threw shade at the students: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re a bunch of terrorists, get out of there.\u2019 They fell for it. They should have won over the community, the university, and nothing would have happened. We\u2019re very nice people.\u201d Rivera, 65, is sharply critical of Obama\u2019s solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s $70bn (\u00a355bn) public debt load, a law known as Promesa that established a non-elected financial oversight and management board \u2013 supported at the time by Miranda but disparaged by many as \u201cla junta\u201d. He says: \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a government of our own; we\u2019re governed by this junta and they\u2019re basically dismantling the country. One of the first things that they started to do was eliminate public education. A lot of public schools have been closed and the university has been really hit hard. \u201cSo Hamilton has been used to strengthen the idea that the university is a difficult place that has to be eliminated or at least toned down. That\u2019s exactly what they did when they moved the play instead of keeping it at the university. What is interesting about Hamilton is the way it\u2019s been used for politics.\u201d Rivera, a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, continues: \u201cThey call it the Obama-era musical. Give me a break. If Hamilton is anti-Trump, we\u2019re also anti-Obama. For Puerto Ricans, there\u2019s no difference at all between Obama and Trump. So I understand that Obama looks nicer and speaks better but his policies were as terrible to Puerto Rico as Trump\u2019s are. Obama gave us the junta and Trump sent us paper towels. What is the difference?\u201d Ten thousand tickets are being sold for $10 each to residents of Puerto Rico via lottery but Rivera has no intention of trying to see the musical. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mixed feelings for us. For artists, we have a strong theatre tradition here in Puerto Rico and American musicals are not really our thing. The subtitle of Hamilton is \u2018An American musical\u2019 and that\u2019s as American as you can get. So for us, this is not a play that\u2019s meaningful in terms of our culture. It really has nothing to do with us. \u201cLin-Manuel was raised in the United States. He identifies as an American and when he chooses to do a play it\u2019s about the American experience, not about the Puerto Rican experience. We work with Puerto Rican history and issues and things that Lin-Manuel cannot really know about because he does not live here, he was not raised here nor educated here, so I don\u2019t see how you can talk about something that you don\u2019t really know.\u201d Miranda\u2019s father is aware of the identity politics and does not shy away from them. \u201cThe forever debate is who is Puerto Rican,\u201d Luis Miranda says in an interview with the Guardian in the theatre foyer, hours before the first dress rehearsal. \u201cYou hear the debate among normal people: \u2018But he\u2019s not Puerto Rican, he\u2019s from New York, he\u2019s from Puerto Rican parents.\u2019 But what we do know is that there is enormous pride in him, particularly since he\u2019s so proud of being Puerto Rican. He has said many times that he is using the megaphone and the spotlight that he has gotten thanks to Hamilton to push forward things like the recovery of Puerto Rico.\u201d Luis Miranda also appears to embrace the complexities of his son\u2019s forays into politics, having fought many such battles himself. \u201cI hate Trump and anything I could do to defeat Republicans, even now my friends who are Republicans, I would do because they have allowed the party to be hijacked by this orange nut. When you do that, you know people are going to be with you and people are going to be against you. It\u2019s no different in Puerto Rico, but the important part that I hope I taught my kids is that you make decisions and you take stands and some will applaud you and some will criticise you, but you take the stand you believe is right.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a lot of noise right now about vegan wines, as if they\u2019re some huge new trend. In fact, these days a great many wines are already made in a way that makes them suitable, and have been for some time. The key requirement is that no animal-derived products are used in their production, ruling out isinglass (fish bladder), egg whites and milk protein during fining, a clarifying process.</p> <p>But how can you tell? Well, almost all supermarket own-label wines make it clear, plus an increasing number of producers put the information on their labels, and organic sites such as <a href=\"https://www.vintageroots.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Vintage Roots</a> list wines that are vegan. Yet this doesn\u2019t guarantee that vegans will regard them favourably. Just as food can contain plenty of E numbers, it\u2019s perfectly possible for a commercial wine that\u2019s made in huge quantities to use additives in the winemaking process. If that concerns you, look out for natural or organic wines that are not fined or filtered.</p> <p>My latest find, discovered in the last days of 2018 and definitely one of my wines of the year, is a glorious Australian cabernet franc called \u2013 would you believe \u2013 <strong>Gertie</strong>, which is made in the Clare Valley and named after the winemaker Ben Marx\u2019s great-aunt. It\u2019s the antithesis of how most people view Australian wine: unfined, unfiltered, with vibrantly fresh, scrunchy fruit, made with natural yeasts and the minimum of sulphur. Just lovely.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the question of the style of wine you might be looking for.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a lot of noise right now about vegan wines, as if they\u2019re some huge new trend. In fact, these days a great many wines are already made in a way that makes them suitable, and have been for some time. The key requirement is that no animal-derived products are used in their production, ruling out isinglass (fish bladder), egg whites and milk protein during fining, a clarifying process. But how can you tell? Well, almost all supermarket own-label wines make it clear, plus an increasing number of producers put the information on their labels, and organic sites such as Vintage Roots list wines that are vegan. Yet this doesn\u2019t guarantee that vegans will regard them favourably. Just as food can contain plenty of E numbers, it\u2019s perfectly possible for a commercial wine that\u2019s made in huge quantities to use additives in the winemaking process. If that concerns you, look out for natural or organic wines that are not fined or filtered. My latest find, discovered in the last days of 2018 and definitely one of my wines of the year, is a glorious Australian cabernet franc called \u2013 would you believe \u2013 Gertie, which is made in the Clare Valley and named after the winemaker Ben Marx\u2019s great-aunt. It\u2019s the antithesis of how most people view Australian wine: unfined, unfiltered, with vibrantly fresh, scrunchy fruit, made with natural yeasts and the minimum of sulphur. Just lovely. There\u2019s also the question of the style of wine you might be looking for. If you\u2019re eating a plant-based diet without vast hunks of protein, you don\u2019t actually need a blockbuster red to set it off. Obviously, many vegan dishes have big flavours, but they don\u2019t tend to have the effect that rare meat or dairy products, such as cream and cheese, have in taming tannin; though pulses such as lentils and beans will, to an extent, round off rough edges.

Light red wines such as the Sicilian frappato, which is stocked by Ocado, and the same outlet\u2019s Forte Alto Pinot Grigio Vigneti delle Dolomiti 2014, which is \u00a39.79 and a modest 12% (it\u2019s also stocked at the same price by Waitrose), would both make a refreshing counterpoint to healthy new year food. Four vegan-friendly bottles Co-op Raw Really Awesome Wine \u00a38, 13%. The name exaggerates, but this organic and vegan wine is a perfectly nice, fresh, Spanish white that would be great with raw veg and dips. Caf\u00e9 Terrasse Vaucluse 2017 \u00a35.99, Lidl, 13.5%. Incredibly well-priced, fragrant Rh\u00f4ne white made from muscat, but dry rather than sweet. Good aperitif.

Gertie Cabernet Franc Clare Valley 2017 \u00a322, Oddbins, 13.5%.

      "body": "<p>A nationwide teachers\u2019 revolt that last year saw walkouts in West Virginia, Oklahoma and other largely Republican-run states has now spread to California, where teachers and support staff in the vast, sprawling, predominantly low-income Los Angeles Unified School District are on the verge of striking.</p> <p>About 31,000 members of the local teachers\u2019 union are threatening to walk off the job on Monday to demand better pay, lower class sizes and improved student access to nurses, psychological counselors and other key services.</p> <p>Their union, United Teachers Los Angeles, has been fighting with the school district \u2013 America\u2019s second largest \u2013 for more than a year. Both sides agree that schools are underfunded and teachers underpaid, but that has not prevented trust between the two sides from eroding to a vanishing point.</p> <p>In contrast to the disputes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/07/teachers-oklahoma-activism-us-politics-strike-walkout\">Oklahoma</a> and other red states, where the fight has been seen as one pitting teachers and administrators against tight-fisted conservative legislators, the fight in Los Angeles is, essentially, a bitter family squabble over dizzying challenges and dismally inadequate resources.</p> <p>The district has proposed a 6% pay rise over the first two years of a new three-year contract. The union wants a 6.5% raise right away as well as a flurry of new hiring and other school resources.</p> <p>\u201cWe are at a watershed moment in defending public education in Los Angeles,\u201d the union <a href=\"https://www.utla.net/news/utla-leadership-january-10-strike-date\">told</a> its members late last month, describing the moment as one of existential crisis.</p> <p>The difference between the two sides, which shows no sign of being resolved, is likely to lead to major disruptions across the city if the threatened strike becomes a reality. The district wants students to come to school even if teachers are not there, but has hired just 400 extra support staff to take the place of 31,000 unionized workers. Nobody knows what largely unsupervised schools are going to look like, especially if the walkout stretches out over days or weeks.</p> <p>Some parents have said they will keep their children home in solidarity with the striking teachers, but many others have to work and cannot afford extra childcare. More than 80% of district students are poor enough to qualify for free breakfast and lunch. If they don\u2019t come to school for those meals, it\u2019s unclear if they can afford to eat at all.</p> <p>The crisis is piling pressure on the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, who has no direct control over the school district but knows the optics are bad for a possible presidential bid. He has offered to act as a mediator, but the union has <a href=\"https://www.lataco.com/where-is-eric-garcetti-la-mayor-ignored-by-teachers-union/\">rebuffed</a> his offer.</p> <p>It is piling pressure, too, on California\u2019s newly inaugurated governor, Gavin Newsom, who has ambitious plans to expand access to early-childhood education and community college but has not so far proposed a significant increase in school funding.</p> <p>The district claims its hands are tied in the contract negotiations because it relies on the state for funding and revenues have been dropping over the past decade. That\u2019s partly because of the 2008 recession but also because funding depends on enrollment and parents have been shifting their children out of struggling district schools in growing numbers.</p> <p>The union, for its part, points to a $1.8bn reserve fund \u2013 a fund the district says it needs to meet a growing shortfall in pension and health benefit obligations \u2013 and fears that the district is more interested in promoting charter schools and dismembering public education than it is in making sure teachers have what they need to excel in the classroom.</p> <p>One lightning rod of criticism is the district\u2019s relatively new superintendent, Austin Beutner, a former Wall Street investment banker who has proposed breaking up the district into 32 mini-fiefdoms. UTLA describes Beutner as an \u201cout-of-touch billionaire\u201d and a \u201ccorporate downsizer\u201d at odds with the core mission of public schools.</p> <p>Another lightning rod is the school board, which over the past couple of election cycles has filled with ever more champions of charter schools, which now educate almost one-third of Los Angeles schoolchildren district and in some cases share space with the public schools whose students they are luring away.</p> <p>All the bad blood has a long history, however, stemming in particular back to a watershed referendum in 1978 that capped California\u2019s property taxes and slowly turned one of America\u2019s best-funded state education systems into one of its worst. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a national momentum in favor of teachers \u2026 and California has a historically underfunded system,\u201d said Robin Lake of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a research organization based in Washington state.</p> <p>In Los Angeles, the problems have only been magnified because of the city\u2019s size and because of the large number of lower-income children who fail to graduate high school at a shocking 50% clip. Lake argued that while the district\u2019s financial struggles are genuine, it has also managed to alienate students and parents by expanding the size of its central office and making ever more demands of its employees without providing extra resources.</p> <p>\u201cTeachers have a general sense that they are not being respected,\u201d Lake added. \u201cA lot of them see the push for education reform as a bit of a slap in the face.\u201d</p> <p>Most observers agree the best solution would lie in all the parties \u2013 locally and in state government \u2013 coming together and figuring out a common approach.

      "bodyText": "A nationwide teachers\u2019 revolt that last year saw walkouts in West Virginia, Oklahoma and other largely Republican-run states has now spread to California, where teachers and support staff in the vast, sprawling, predominantly low-income Los Angeles Unified School District are on the verge of striking. About 31,000 members of the local teachers\u2019 union are threatening to walk off the job on Monday to demand better pay, lower class sizes and improved student access to nurses, psychological counselors and other key services. Their union, United Teachers Los Angeles, has been fighting with the school district \u2013 America\u2019s second largest \u2013 for more than a year. Both sides agree that schools are underfunded and teachers underpaid, but that has not prevented trust between the two sides from eroding to a vanishing point. In contrast to the disputes in Oklahoma and other red states, where the fight has been seen as one pitting teachers and administrators against tight-fisted conservative legislators, the fight in Los Angeles is, essentially, a bitter family squabble over dizzying challenges and dismally inadequate resources. The district has proposed a 6% pay rise over the first two years of a new three-year contract. The union wants a 6.5% raise right away as well as a flurry of new hiring and other school resources. \u201cWe are at a watershed moment in defending public education in Los Angeles,\u201d the union told its members late last month, describing the moment as one of existential crisis. The difference between the two sides, which shows no sign of being resolved, is likely to lead to major disruptions across the city if the threatened strike becomes a reality. The district wants students to come to school even if teachers are not there, but has hired just 400 extra support staff to take the place of 31,000 unionized workers. Nobody knows what largely unsupervised schools are going to look like, especially if the walkout stretches out over days or weeks. Some parents have said they will keep their children home in solidarity with the striking teachers, but many others have to work and cannot afford extra childcare. More than 80% of district students are poor enough to qualify for free breakfast and lunch. If they don\u2019t come to school for those meals, it\u2019s unclear if they can afford to eat at all. The crisis is piling pressure on the Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, who has no direct control over the school district but knows the optics are bad for a possible presidential bid. He has offered to act as a mediator, but the union has rebuffed his offer. It is piling pressure, too, on California\u2019s newly inaugurated governor, Gavin Newsom, who has ambitious plans to expand access to early-childhood education and community college but has not so far proposed a significant increase in school funding. The district claims its hands are tied in the contract negotiations because it relies on the state for funding and revenues have been dropping over the past decade. That\u2019s partly because of the 2008 recession but also because funding depends on enrollment and parents have been shifting their children out of struggling district schools in growing numbers. The union, for its part, points to a $1.8bn reserve fund \u2013 a fund the district says it needs to meet a growing shortfall in pension and health benefit obligations \u2013 and fears that the district is more interested in promoting charter schools and dismembering public education than it is in making sure teachers have what they need to excel in the classroom. One lightning rod of criticism is the district\u2019s relatively new superintendent, Austin Beutner, a former Wall Street investment banker who has proposed breaking up the district into 32 mini-fiefdoms. UTLA describes Beutner as an \u201cout-of-touch billionaire\u201d and a \u201ccorporate downsizer\u201d at odds with the core mission of public schools. Another lightning rod is the school board, which over the past couple of election cycles has filled with ever more champions of charter schools, which now educate almost one-third of Los Angeles schoolchildren district and in some cases share space with the public schools whose students they are luring away. All the bad blood has a long history, however, stemming in particular back to a watershed referendum in 1978 that capped California\u2019s property taxes and slowly turned one of America\u2019s best-funded state education systems into one of its worst. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a national momentum in favor of teachers \u2026 and California has a historically underfunded system,\u201d said Robin Lake of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a research organization based in Washington state. In Los Angeles, the problems have only been magnified because of the city\u2019s size and because of the large number of lower-income children who fail to graduate high school at a shocking 50% clip. Lake argued that while the district\u2019s financial struggles are genuine, it has also managed to alienate students and parents by expanding the size of its central office and making ever more demands of its employees without providing extra resources. \u201cTeachers have a general sense that they are not being respected,\u201d Lake added. \u201cA lot of them see the push for education reform as a bit of a slap in the face.\u201d Most observers agree the best solution would lie in all the parties \u2013 locally and in state government \u2013 coming together and figuring out a common approach. Instead, however, Beutner\u2019s office and UTLA are exchanging daily stink bombs in the form of press releases, public statements and \u2013 increasingly, as the prospect of a strike has drawn nearer \u2013 in dueling filings in court. The strike was, in fact, due to start on Thursday, but the district sued for a delay on a procedural technicality and won. Both sides met again for negotiations on Friday afternoon. The union rejected a new offer by the district later that day, calling it \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Japanese conglomerate Hitachi looks certain to cancel its plans for a \u00a316bn nuclear power station in Wales, leaving Britain\u2019s ambitions for a nuclear renaissance in tatters. An impasse in months-long talks between the company, London and Toyko on financing is expected to result in the flagship project being axed at a Hitachi board meeting next week, according to the Nikkei newspaper. The company has spent nearly \u00a32bn on the planned Wylfa power station on Anglesey, which would have powered around 5m homes. Another Japanese giant, Toshiba, scrapped a nuclear plant in Cumbria just two months ago after failing to find a buyer for the ailing project. Withdrawal by Hitachi would be a major blow to the UK\u2019s plans to replace dirty coal and ageing reactors with new nuclear power plants, and heap pressure on ministers to consider other large-scale alternatives such as offshore windfarms. It would also mark an end to Japan\u2019s hopes of exporting its nuclear technology around the world. Hitachi and the UK and Japanese governments have been negotiating over a guaranteed price of power from Wylfa and a potentially \u00a35bn-plus UK public stake in the scheme. Talks have proved \u201ctricky to find a solution that works for all parties\u201d, industry sources said. Unions said the prospect of Wylfa being cancelled was extremely worrying and losing two projects in such a short period \u201cshould set alarm bells ringing\u201d about the government\u2019s commitment to nuclear. Hitachi said it had made no final decision. \u201cNo formal decision has been made in this regard currently, while Hitachi has been assessing the Horizon Project including its potential suspension and related financial impacts in terms of economic rationality as a private company,\u201d it said. The reference to a \u201cpotential suspension\u201d, however, was the first official public confirmation that a withdrawal was being considered. Horizon Nuclear Power, the UK subsidiary behind the scheme, said it \u201cwon\u2019t be commenting on rumours or speculation\u201d. However, an insider said: \u201cThere has been a serious rift in Hitachi, and the group that said this is too large and risky an investment of Japanese capital have won out.

The Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, insisted that the fate of the nuclear plant had not been discussed during his talks with Theresa May on Thursday, even though they spent more than three hours together in two separate sessions. Hitachi would face a significant but not fatal financial hit from writing off the Wylfa scheme. It has spent nearly \u00a32bn on the power station, including \u00a3700m on buying the project from the German utilities E.ON and RWE in 2012. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said the prospect of Wylfa being cancelled was very worrying for the economy and jobs in north Wales and could have \u201ca significant negative impact on the UK\u2019s energy security, particularly after the collapse of the Moorside power station plans in 2018.\u201d She added: \u201cThe prime minister must tell the public if she discussed Hitachi\u2019s plans for Wylfa with Shinz\u014d Abe during his visit this week.\u201d Sue Ferns, the Prospect union\u2019s senior deputy general secretary, said: \u201cNew nuclear is of significant strategic importance for the country. The government must not sleepwalk into an energy security crisis by allowing these projects to fail one by one.\u201d The Welsh government said it was pressing Whitehall to make the project work. \u201cThis is a major project with potentially significant economic benefits to Anglesey, north Wales and Wales,\u201d a spokesperson said. Nuclear critics said a collapse of the scheme was not a disaster but an opportunity for a policy shift. Doug Parr, the chief scientist of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cWe could have locked ourselves into reliance on an obsolete, unaffordable technology, but we\u2019ve been given the chance to think again and make a better decision.\u201d Sara Medi Jones, the acting secretary general of CND, said: \u201cWith offshore wind now cheaper than nuclear it\u2019s clear there is a clean and workable alternative. We just need the political will to make it happen.\u201d Just one new nuclear power station, EDF Energy\u2019s Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been given the green light and begun construction. The French company and Chinese firm CGN both want to build more.",

      "body": "<p>The 2018 festive shopping season in the UK got under way with low expectations for the retail sector. Investors were braced for bad news after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/10/uk-high-streets-face-quietest-christmas-since-credit-crunch\">a string of warnings</a> in the run-up to Christmas, including a declaration from Mike Ashley, the chief executive of Sports Direct, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/13/mike-ashley-launches-debenhams-broadside-sports-direct\">November was the worst on record</a> for retailers. Against a backdrop of rising rents, business rates, a shift to online shopping and diminishing consumer confidence, retailers had to battle to win customers over the crucial trading period. Here are the winners and losers so far.</p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>Tesco</strong></p> <p>Britain\u2019s largest retailer was a clear winner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/tesco-beats-christmas-retail-blues-with-strong-sales-rise\">enjoying its best Christmas in nearly a decade</a>. Like-for-like sales, stripping out shops open for less than a year, grew by 2.2% in the six weeks to 5 January, boosted by higher demand for its cheapest range, Exclusively at Tesco, while its more upmarket \u201cFinest\u201d range also fared well. Sales of the supermarket\u2019s \u201cFree from\u201d range of gluten-free and wheat-free products \u2013 the largest in the UK \u2013 rose by 11%.</p> <p><strong>Next</strong></p> <p>One of the best-known names on the high street enjoyed a better-than-expected Christmas after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/03/next-christmas-saved-by-late-splurge-from-shoppers\">a late surge in online sales</a>. The retailer, considered a bellwether for the whole sector, reported overall sales growth of 1.5% for the last two months of 2018. As one of only a few retailers to resist pre-Christmas discounting, Next was expected to struggle as its rivals slashed prices to entice shoppers suffering Brexit jitters. As it turned out, it was saved by online sales, which rose 15.2% over the period. Sales in its shops, however, were down 9.2%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d5fca50d9a2ed6d9fbc2e6798dbc0cc28ecef3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40d5fca50d9a2ed6d9fbc2e6798dbc0cc28ecef3/0_179_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers walk past John Lewis on Oxford Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sales at John Lewis rose 4.5% in the week to 29 December compared with the same period last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Morrisons</strong></p> <p>The UK\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket chain just about beat expectations after achieving growth in like-for-like sales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/08/uk-aldi-lidl-christmas-supermarkets-brexit\">for a fourth consecutive Christmas</a>. Sales across its core supermarket business rose 0.6% in the nine weeks to 9 January, slightly above analysts\u2019 expectations of a 0.5% increase. Morrisons said customers were \u201cincreasingly savvy\u201d and that it had benefited from being competitive on price, with a basket of Christmas goods unchanged from last year. </p> <p><strong>Lidl/Aldi</strong></p> <p>The German discounters secured their biggest ever slice of the Christmas food spend in 2018 as two-thirds of UK households headed to their shops for festive fare. Sales at Lidl rose 8% in the six weeks to 30 December with demand for the premium Deluxe range up by a third. Aldi has only disclosed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/aldi-uk-reports-record-christmas-week-amid-rising-premium-sales\">record sales</a> in the week before Christmas, up 10% on 2017. Aldi also trumpeted strong demand for premium products, such as beef chateaubriand and 32-year-old French brandy. New store openings were also a major factor behind Aldi\u2019s near \u00a31bn sales\u2019 haul in December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/high_street_xmas_sales/giv-3902Z5cyDTnNvBTI/\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/high_street_xmas_sales/giv-3902Z5cyDTnNvBTI/\">chart</a> </figure>  <p><strong>JD Sports</strong></p> <p>The UK\u2019s biggest sports retailer had plenty to celebrate over Christmas as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/14/jd-sports-sales-finish-line-us\">booming sales of \u201cathleisure\u201d</a> \u2013 sportswear designed to be worn outside the gym \u2013 made it a firm winner. Total sales (including newly opened shops) surged 15% in the 48 weeks to 5 January. Like-for-like sales rose 5% and were consistently positive over the Black Friday and festive period, according to the Manchester-based retailer. The chain also credited its decision not to follow rivals into big price cuts, which kept gross profit margins at the previous year\u2019s levels. JD Sports has raised its profit guidance.</p> <p><strong>Boohoo</strong></p> <p>The online fashion retailer aimed at the under-30s upgraded its full-year profit guidance after strong Christmas sales. Revenue rose 44% in the four months to 31 December, thanks to a 33% rise in UK sales and a 78% rise in the US. A strong performance from the retailer, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, also eased fears that the struggles facing high street retailers were spreading online, after rival web-only retailer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/17/asos-issues-shock-profit-warning-as-november-downturn-takes-hold-fashion-retailer\"> Asos issued a profits warning</a> in December.</p> <p><strong>Greggs</strong></p> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest bakery chain had a stronger-than-expected finish to 2018, thanks to bumper sales in December of its festive bakes, mince pies, hot drinks and breakfast ranges. Trading was so strong that it prompted Gregg to raise its 2018 profits guidance for the second time in two months. In the fourth quarter overall, like-for-like sales were up 5.2%. The food retailer said trading in 2019 had got off to a strong start, with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/09/greggs-unveils-extra-profit-vegan-sausage-roll\">new vegan sausage roll</a> \u201cflying off the shelves\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Ted Baker</strong></p> <p>In festive trading terms at least, Ted Baker emerged unscathed by recent allegations of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/02/ted-baker-staff-complain-forced-hugs-company-founder-ray-kelvin\">culture of \u201cforced hugs\u201d</a> under its founder, Ray Kelvin. Retail sales increased 12.2% in the five weeks to 5 January, boosted by more selling space and strong growth online. The fashion brand said men\u2019s and women\u2019s coats, jackets and knitwear were among the best sellers as the colder weather kicked in.</p> <p><strong>Dunelm</strong></p> <p>Demand for unicorn-themed goods and a slicker online operation helped Dunelm to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/dunelm-sales-unicorn-home-furnishings\">better-than-expected sales growth</a> over Christmas. Sales in its core Dunelm brand increased by nearly 10% to \u00a3304m in the 13 weeks to 29 December, prompting the home furnishings group to upgrade its full-year profit expectations. Unicorn bedding and rocking horses were among the bestsellers, as were sheepskin rugs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/09/greggs-unveils-extra-profit-vegan-sausage-roll\">Greggs struggles to keep up with demand for vegan sausage rolls</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Joules</strong></p> <p>A strong online performance drove bumper sales at Joules in the seven weeks to 6 January. The clothing retailer, known for its bright floral prints and pink wellies, said sales increased by 11.7% over the period, with growth across all of its product ranges. Bestsellers included accessories such as purses, handbags and watches as well as knitwear and footwear. Orders placed online \u2013 both on its own website and through concession partners\u2019 websites \u2013 accounted for almost half of its sales.</p> <p><strong>AO World</strong></p> <p>The white goods retailer was pleased with its performance during the Black Friday deals window, with less lumpy sales and improved profit margins contributing to its highest November sales ever. UK revenues rose by 4.4% year-on-year in the last quarter, while its European expansion continued, with revenues up by 31.3%. Steve Caunce, chief executive, said the company was \u201con track\u201d, despite the \u201cchallenging backdrop\u201d in retail.</p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong></p> <p>Christmas wasn\u2019t very merry at one of Britain\u2019s best-known retailers, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/john-lewis-may-axe-staff-bonus-as-retail-slump-bites\">sales down </a>across its food, clothing and homewares divisions. Chief executive Steve Rowe said a combination of mild weather, Black Friday, weaker consumer confidence and widespread discounting by competitors had weighed on sales, which were down 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell by 2.1% and clothing and home sales fell by 2.4%.</p> <p><strong>John Lewis Partnership</strong></p> <p>John Lewis Partnership is a mixed bag. Sales across the group rose by 1.4% in the seven weeks to 5 January, including a like-for-like rise of 1% at the John Lewis department stores and a 0.3% rise at Waitrose. However, a weaker consumer backdrop and heavy discounting among rivals \u2013 which it is forced to match under its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d policy \u2013 weighed on margins. As a result, the Partnership warned profits will be \u201csubstantially lower this year\u201d. In what would be a major blow to its workers, chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield also warned the retailer may be forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/john-lewis-may-axe-staff-bonus-as-retail-slump-bites\">suspend its staff bonus this year</a> for the first time since the economic downturn of 1953.</p> <p><strong>Debenhams</strong></p> <p>There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/john-lewis-may-axe-staff-bonus-as-retail-slump-bites\">no improvement in fortunes</a> at Debenhams, with the struggling department store chain\u2019s difficulties deepening after its trading update as major shareholder Mike Ashley dramatically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/debenhams-chairman-ousted-by-mike-ashley\">ousted both its chairman and the chief executive</a> from the board. Like-for-like sales fell 6.2% in the 18 weeks to 5 January, with Debenhams emphasising a \u201cvolatile\u201d trading backdrop and customers seeking out promotions. The company said it still expected to meet profit targets but only after \u00a330m of additional cost savings, including a hiring freeze at its head office and the earlier-than-planned closure of its Lodge Farm distribution centre in Northamptonshire.</p> <p><strong>Sainsbury\u2019s</strong></p> <p>Sales at the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain fell more than expected over the festive period, which the retailer blamed on consumer caution and fewer Black Friday discounts at its Argos chain. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 1.1%, dragged down by falling sales of toys, clothing, homewares and large electrical goods. Grocery sales actually rose over the period, by 0.4%. The chief executive, Mike Coupe, said competition in non-food was heightened this year: \u201cThere were a lot of retailers in distress and a lot of discounted stock out there.\u201d</p> <p><strong>HMV</strong></p> <p>A clear loser was HMV, which announced on 28 December it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/28/hmv-on-brink-second-collapse-administration\">calling in administrators</a> for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. The music and film retailer said firms across the sector were facing \u201ca tsunami of challenges\u201d and that festive trading at HMV had been \u201cextremely weak\u201d. The 97-year-old company has also lost out during a period of rapid change for the entertainment industry, with consumers increasingly ditching CDs and DVDs in favour of streaming sites such as Spotify and Netflix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8414f82e0d4e19292a27280e48cbefc5c26a405d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8414f82e0d4e19292a27280e48cbefc5c26a405d/22_309_4322_2593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HMV Oxford Street, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HMV has been left behind in the rapidly changing entertainment industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Quiz</strong></p> <p>The problems for the womenswear retailer were clear well before Christmas, but poor holiday trading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/11/quiz-issues-profit-warning-after-weak-christmas-sales\">prompted the second profit warning</a> in just over three months. Its profit outlook for the year ending in March was cut by almost 30% to \u00a38.2m, and shares suffered a similar fall after its announcement. Heavy discounting amid intense competition was a key reason for disappointing revenue. Analysts at City investment house Brewin Dolphin noted that higher costs will prompt doubts about its ability to generate enough cash.</p> <p><strong>Footasylum</strong></p> <p>The struggling footwear and hoodie chain said tough trading conditions continued through Christmas, prompting it to slash prices more than expected. Revenues rose 14% over the 18 weeks to 29 December but Footasylum warned its decision to cut prices had hit margins, and full-year earnings are likely to be at the lower end of analysts\u2019 forecasts. Its shares, the worst performers in the retail sector last year when they plunged by 90%, slithered to a new all-time low after the warning.</p> <p><strong>Mothercare</strong></p> <p>Mothercare\u2019s problems continued over the key festive trading period as the retailer blamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/09/mothercare-woes-deepen-after-christmas-sales-plunge#img-1\">a sharp fall in sales</a> on a tough consumer backdrop and its decision to offer fewer discounts than a year earlier. The baby and maternity chain said sales at UK stores open for more than a year fell by 11.4% in the 13 weeks to 5 January, while online sales tumbled by 16.3%. The retailer is in the middle of a store closure plan, with with another 36 shops to close over the next three months. By the end of March, Mothercare will have only 79 shops in the UK, down from 137 in May last year.</p> <p><strong>Halfords</strong></p> <p>Halfords blamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/10/halfords-blames-mild-weather-and-weak-demand-for-profit-slip\">a slump in sales</a> on the mild weather and dwindling consumer confidence. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 2.2% in the 14 weeks to 4 January, mainly driven by a drop in sales of car accessories and maintenance products, which it blamed on the mild weather, meaning that drivers did not need de-icer or new windscreen wipers. But the weather couldn\u2019t be blamed for a 0.3% dip in cycle sales, with growth in children\u2019s bikes offset by a fall in more expensive adult bicycles.</p> <p><strong>Asos</strong></p> <p>The online clothing retailer sent alarm bells ringing across the City in mid-December when it was forced to issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/17/asos-issues-shock-profit-warning-as-november-downturn-takes-hold-fashion-retailer\">a profits warning</a> after poor trading in November. The gloomy update surprised and alarmed investors, demonstrating that despite its online-only offering, Asos was not immune to the high street struggle. Asos blamed weak consumer confidence, increased discounting and unusually mild weather for a \u201csignificant deterioration\u201d in November trading, which it said would weigh on its full-year sales growth. Shares fell 38%.</p> <p><strong>Bonmarch\u00e9</strong></p> <p>The value womenswear chain was another retailer forced into a profits warning in December, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/13/bonmarche-warns-of-worse-high-street-trade-than-2008-recession\">\u201cunprecedented\u201d trading conditions</a> on the high street, worse than the 2008-09 recession. Shares plunged 40% as the chain aimed at women over 50 said \u201cextremely poor\u201d Black Friday sales and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on consumer demand had wiped out any hopes of a profit in the full year to the end of March 2019.</p> <p><strong>Moss Bros</strong></p> <p>Suit retailer Moss Bros is expected to post a loss for the financial year, posting a like-for-like sales decline of 1% for the 23 weeks to 5 January. Physical stores suffered from lower footfall, with the company noting that its highest-profile locations fared worst. Margins were also eaten away as its resistance to heavy discounting eventually broke, although online sales rose by a more than quarter year-on-year, offering a bright spot. Brian Brick, the Moss Bros boss, warned 2019 will likely have more pain in store amid weak demand, rising costs and Brexit uncertainty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 2018 festive shopping season in the UK got under way with low expectations for the retail sector. Investors were braced for bad news after a string of warnings in the run-up to Christmas, including a declaration from Mike Ashley, the chief executive of Sports Direct, that November was the worst on record for retailers. Against a backdrop of rising rents, business rates, a shift to online shopping and diminishing consumer confidence, retailers had to battle to win customers over the crucial trading period. Here are the winners and losers so far. Winners Tesco Britain\u2019s largest retailer was a clear winner, enjoying its best Christmas in nearly a decade. Like-for-like sales, stripping out shops open for less than a year, grew by 2.2% in the six weeks to 5 January, boosted by higher demand for its cheapest range, Exclusively at Tesco, while its more upmarket \u201cFinest\u201d range also fared well. Sales of the supermarket\u2019s \u201cFree from\u201d range of gluten-free and wheat-free products \u2013 the largest in the UK \u2013 rose by 11%. Next One of the best-known names on the high street enjoyed a better-than-expected Christmas after a late surge in online sales. The retailer, considered a bellwether for the whole sector, reported overall sales growth of 1.5% for the last two months of 2018. As one of only a few retailers to resist pre-Christmas discounting, Next was expected to struggle as its rivals slashed prices to entice shoppers suffering Brexit jitters. As it turned out, it was saved by online sales, which rose 15.2% over the period. Sales in its shops, however, were down 9.2%. Morrisons The UK\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket chain just about beat expectations after achieving growth in like-for-like sales for a fourth consecutive Christmas. Sales across its core supermarket business rose 0.6% in the nine weeks to 9 January, slightly above analysts\u2019 expectations of a 0.5% increase. Morrisons said customers were \u201cincreasingly savvy\u201d and that it had benefited from being competitive on price, with a basket of Christmas goods unchanged from last year. Lidl/Aldi The German discounters secured their biggest ever slice of the Christmas food spend in 2018 as two-thirds of UK households headed to their shops for festive fare. Sales at Lidl rose 8% in the six weeks to 30 December with demand for the premium Deluxe range up by a third. Aldi has only disclosed record sales in the week before Christmas, up 10% on 2017. Aldi also trumpeted strong demand for premium products, such as beef chateaubriand and 32-year-old French brandy. New store openings were also a major factor behind Aldi\u2019s near \u00a31bn sales\u2019 haul in December. JD Sports The UK\u2019s biggest sports retailer had plenty to celebrate over Christmas as booming sales of \u201cathleisure\u201d \u2013 sportswear designed to be worn outside the gym \u2013 made it a firm winner. Total sales (including newly opened shops) surged 15% in the 48 weeks to 5 January. Like-for-like sales rose 5% and were consistently positive over the Black Friday and festive period, according to the Manchester-based retailer. The chain also credited its decision not to follow rivals into big price cuts, which kept gross profit margins at the previous year\u2019s levels. JD Sports has raised its profit guidance. Boohoo The online fashion retailer aimed at the under-30s upgraded its full-year profit guidance after strong Christmas sales. Revenue rose 44% in the four months to 31 December, thanks to a 33% rise in UK sales and a 78% rise in the US. A strong performance from the retailer, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, also eased fears that the struggles facing high street retailers were spreading online, after rival web-only retailer Asos issued a profits warning in December. Greggs Britain\u2019s biggest bakery chain had a stronger-than-expected finish to 2018, thanks to bumper sales in December of its festive bakes, mince pies, hot drinks and breakfast ranges. Trading was so strong that it prompted Gregg to raise its 2018 profits guidance for the second time in two months. In the fourth quarter overall, like-for-like sales were up 5.2%. The food retailer said trading in 2019 had got off to a strong start, with its new vegan sausage roll \u201cflying off the shelves\u201d. Ted Baker In festive trading terms at least, Ted Baker emerged unscathed by recent allegations of a culture of \u201cforced hugs\u201d under its founder, Ray Kelvin. Retail sales increased 12.2% in the five weeks to 5 January, boosted by more selling space and strong growth online. The fashion brand said men\u2019s and women\u2019s coats, jackets and knitwear were among the best sellers as the colder weather kicked in. Dunelm Demand for unicorn-themed goods and a slicker online operation helped Dunelm to better-than-expected sales growth over Christmas. Sales in its core Dunelm brand increased by nearly 10% to \u00a3304m in the 13 weeks to 29 December, prompting the home furnishings group to upgrade its full-year profit expectations. Unicorn bedding and rocking horses were among the bestsellers, as were sheepskin rugs. Joules A strong online performance drove bumper sales at Joules in the seven weeks to 6 January. The clothing retailer, known for its bright floral prints and pink wellies, said sales increased by 11.7% over the period, with growth across all of its product ranges. Bestsellers included accessories such as purses, handbags and watches as well as knitwear and footwear. Orders placed online \u2013 both on its own website and through concession partners\u2019 websites \u2013 accounted for almost half of its sales. AO World The white goods retailer was pleased with its performance during the Black Friday deals window, with less lumpy sales and improved profit margins contributing to its highest November sales ever. UK revenues rose by 4.4% year-on-year in the last quarter, while its European expansion continued, with revenues up by 31.3%. Steve Caunce, chief executive, said the company was \u201con track\u201d, despite the \u201cchallenging backdrop\u201d in retail. Losers Marks &amp; Spencer Christmas wasn\u2019t very merry at one of Britain\u2019s best-known retailers, with sales down across its food, clothing and homewares divisions. Chief executive Steve Rowe said a combination of mild weather, Black Friday, weaker consumer confidence and widespread discounting by competitors had weighed on sales, which were down 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell by 2.1% and clothing and home sales fell by 2.4%. John Lewis Partnership John Lewis Partnership is a mixed bag. Sales across the group rose by 1.4% in the seven weeks to 5 January, including a like-for-like rise of 1% at the John Lewis department stores and a 0.3% rise at Waitrose. However, a weaker consumer backdrop and heavy discounting among rivals \u2013 which it is forced to match under its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d policy \u2013 weighed on margins. As a result, the Partnership warned profits will be \u201csubstantially lower this year\u201d. In what would be a major blow to its workers, chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield also warned the retailer may be forced to suspend its staff bonus this year for the first time since the economic downturn of 1953. Debenhams There was no improvement in fortunes at Debenhams, with the struggling department store chain\u2019s difficulties deepening after its trading update as major shareholder Mike Ashley dramatically ousted both its chairman and the chief executive from the board. Like-for-like sales fell 6.2% in the 18 weeks to 5 January, with Debenhams emphasising a \u201cvolatile\u201d trading backdrop and customers seeking out promotions. The company said it still expected to meet profit targets but only after \u00a330m of additional cost savings, including a hiring freeze at its head office and the earlier-than-planned closure of its Lodge Farm distribution centre in Northamptonshire. Sainsbury\u2019s Sales at the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain fell more than expected over the festive period, which the retailer blamed on consumer caution and fewer Black Friday discounts at its Argos chain. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 1.1%, dragged down by falling sales of toys, clothing, homewares and large electrical goods. Grocery sales actually rose over the period, by 0.4%. The chief executive, Mike Coupe, said competition in non-food was heightened this year: \u201cThere were a lot of retailers in distress and a lot of discounted stock out there.\u201d HMV A clear loser was HMV, which announced on 28 December it was calling in administrators for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. The music and film retailer said firms across the sector were facing \u201ca tsunami of challenges\u201d and that festive trading at HMV had been \u201cextremely weak\u201d. The 97-year-old company has also lost out during a period of rapid change for the entertainment industry, with consumers increasingly ditching CDs and DVDs in favour of streaming sites such as Spotify and Netflix. Quiz The problems for the womenswear retailer were clear well before Christmas, but poor holiday trading prompted the second profit warning in just over three months. Its profit outlook for the year ending in March was cut by almost 30% to \u00a38.2m, and shares suffered a similar fall after its announcement. Heavy discounting amid intense competition was a key reason for disappointing revenue. Analysts at City investment house Brewin Dolphin noted that higher costs will prompt doubts about its ability to generate enough cash. Footasylum The struggling footwear and hoodie chain said tough trading conditions continued through Christmas, prompting it to slash prices more than expected. Revenues rose 14% over the 18 weeks to 29 December but Footasylum warned its decision to cut prices had hit margins, and full-year earnings are likely to be at the lower end of analysts\u2019 forecasts. Its shares, the worst performers in the retail sector last year when they plunged by 90%, slithered to a new all-time low after the warning. Mothercare Mothercare\u2019s problems continued over the key festive trading period as the retailer blamed a sharp fall in sales on a tough consumer backdrop and its decision to offer fewer discounts than a year earlier. The baby and maternity chain said sales at UK stores open for more than a year fell by 11.4% in the 13 weeks to 5 January, while online sales tumbled by 16.3%. The retailer is in the middle of a store closure plan, with with another 36 shops to close over the next three months. By the end of March, Mothercare will have only 79 shops in the UK, down from 137 in May last year. Halfords Halfords blamed a slump in sales on the mild weather and dwindling consumer confidence. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 2.2% in the 14 weeks to 4 January, mainly driven by a drop in sales of car accessories and maintenance products, which it blamed on the mild weather, meaning that drivers did not need de-icer or new windscreen wipers. But the weather couldn\u2019t be blamed for a 0.3% dip in cycle sales, with growth in children\u2019s bikes offset by a fall in more expensive adult bicycles. Asos The online clothing retailer sent alarm bells ringing across the City in mid-December when it was forced to issue a profits warning after poor trading in November. The gloomy update surprised and alarmed investors, demonstrating that despite its online-only offering, Asos was not immune to the high street struggle. Asos blamed weak consumer confidence, increased discounting and unusually mild weather for a \u201csignificant deterioration\u201d in November trading, which it said would weigh on its full-year sales growth. Shares fell 38%. Bonmarch\u00e9 The value womenswear chain was another retailer forced into a profits warning in December, citing \u201cunprecedented\u201d trading conditions on the high street, worse than the 2008-09 recession. Shares plunged 40% as the chain aimed at women over 50 said \u201cextremely poor\u201d Black Friday sales and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on consumer demand had wiped out any hopes of a profit in the full year to the end of March 2019. Moss Bros Suit retailer Moss Bros is expected to post a loss for the financial year, posting a like-for-like sales decline of 1% for the 23 weeks to 5 January. Physical stores suffered from lower footfall, with the company noting that its highest-profile locations fared worst. Margins were also eaten away as its resistance to heavy discounting eventually broke, although online sales rose by a more than quarter year-on-year, offering a bright spot. Brian Brick, the Moss Bros boss, warned 2019 will likely have more pain in store amid weak demand, rising costs and Brexit uncertainty.",

      "bodyText": "Bahrain has been found guilty by a UN body of arbitrarily detaining three relatives of a British-based human rights activist as a reprisal for his protest in London against the visit of the country\u2019s king in 2017. In a judgment published on Thursday, the UN called for all three to be released from detention and suggested evidence showed they had been victims of torture and false confessions. The case raises questions about the extent to which the Foreign Office is willing to protect the right of exiles to protest in the UK, especially against Gulf States with which Britain has close links. The ruling came from the UN\u2019s working group on arbitrary detention, a subsidiary of the human rights council. It said the trio were arrested without legal basis and arbitrarily detained without the use of an arrest warrant or legal representation. The judgment also found Bahrain did not undertake any credible investigation into allegations of torture of the detainees. All three detained by the Bahrain government are related by birth or marriage to Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, a Bahraini activist. Alwadaei was given asylum in the UK in 2012 after being sentenced to six months by the Bahrain government for his role in protests against the royal family\u2019s rule at the time of the Arab spring. He has continued to demonstrate against British support for Bahrain\u2019s rulers, including by protesting against the visit of the king to Downing Street in 2016. The relatives were his brother-in-law Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, his wife\u2019s cousin Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor and his mother-in-law, Hajar Mansoor Hassan. In the finding, the working group said it was \u201cpersuaded that Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Mansoor and Hassan were deprived of their liberty, interrogated and prosecuted for their family ties with Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, and that these were acts of reprisals. This is the only plausible explanation for the subversion of the equal protection of the law they have experienced.\u201d The judgment added that \u201cno one should be detained for the crimes that may or may not [have been] committed by a family member\u201d. All three claim they were maltreated after their arrests. They were subsequently charged with terrorism-related offences, including planting or helping to plant fake explosives in January 2017, and sentenced to three years in prison. They allege, according to the UN report, that they were interrogated as much about Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei\u2019s movements in London as the crimes for which they had been charged. They also claim that no arrest warrants were provided and, on arrest, they were tortured. Maya Foa, the director of the human rights organisation Reprieve, said: \u201cAs the world rightly condemns Bahrain for punishing family members of human rights activists, and British MPs stand up in parliament to demand action from the government, the Foreign Office continues to offer only vague, mealy mouthed expressions of concern. \u201cBritain has provided the Bahraini regime with millions of pounds in security assistance. The least the government can do is demand the end of the arbitrary detention of, and torture of, peaceful dissenters.\u201d Bahrain remains a pillar of the British and US alliance in the Gulf.",

      "bodyText": "While tougher challenges lie ahead, the Socceroos answered some of the questions being posed of their quality as they produced a scintillating performance to beat Palestine 3-0 in front of 11,915 fans in Dubai. A first-half one-two punch from the Australians did the bulk of the damage. The opener came in the 18th minute as a delightfully weighted cross from Chris Ikonomidis found Jamie Maclaren in between two defenders. Maclaren glanced a header into the far corner to score his first goal for his country. Two minutes later, the two youngest players on the field combined as a sumptuous cross from Ikonomidis found an onrushing Awer Mabil at the back post, who dutifully side-footed into the net from point-blank range. A 90th minute goal from substitute Apostolos Giannou capped off a well-rounded performance from Australia. Graham Arnold spoke glowingly of the young attacking players that helped to propel his team to victory. He highlighted in particular their \u201cenergy\u201d, reserving special praise for the defensive pressing qualities of Maclaren. Arnold also elaborated on how happy he is for the striker to have broken his goal-scoring duck at international level. \u201cI love Jamie as a player,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cHis movement in the box is always good. He\u2019s just needed a bit of belief and confidence.\u201d With a two-goal cushion midway through the first half, the feeling of relaxation was evident as the Socceroos began knocking the ball around comfortably and searching for more avenues towards goal.

The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. With a huge influx due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, in September 2020 there were 5.6 million people claiming UC.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How long has it been around?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/19/universal-credit-failings-pac-accuses-dwp\">management failures</a>, expensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/universal-credit-iain-duncan-smith\">IT blunders and design faults</a>&nbsp;mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and full rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the biggest problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The original design set out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/jun/09/debt-and-food-banks-the-legacy-of-universal-credits-long-hello\">minimum 42-day wait for a first payment</a>&nbsp;to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite\">rent arrears and eviction</a>s, hunger (food banks in UC areas report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/25/food-banks-report-record-demand-amid-universal-credit-chaos\">notable increases in referrals</a>), use of expensive credit and mental distress.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Ministers have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Are there other problems?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plenty.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/03/universal-credit-cost-cutting-treasury-benefit-reform-resolution\">Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances</a>&nbsp;imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than \u00a31,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. <br></p>\n    <p>Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. <br></p>\n    <p>And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/15/universal-credit-savaged-by-public-spending-watchdog-nao\">critical study</a> found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe will tread cautiously,\u201d on the change, pledged Rudd, who took the work and pensions job when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/amber-rudd-appointed-work-and-pensions-secretary\">Esther McVey quit</a> in November.</p> \n<p>Rudd also confirmed the partial scrapping of the controversial two-child limit on universal credit payments, but only for this benefit and for children born after April 2017, when the wider limit was first introduced.</p> \n<p>She defended the cap, and the \u201crape clause\u201d, under which women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/16/esther-mcvey-child-tax-credit-clause-is-opportunity-for-victims\">can claim exemption</a> from the policy if they can show they had conceived a third child via domestic abuse or rape.

Rudd, who also said she wanted the long freeze on working-age benefit levels to end next year, used a speech at a jobcentre in south London to further emphasise what she said is a more caring and thoughtful approach to the welfare system. A key element to this is the news that the planned mass \u201cmigration\u201d of claimants on existing benefits to universal credit, which replaces a series of payments, would instead be paused so a trial of 10,000 people could be held. \u201cWe will tread cautiously,\u201d on the change, pledged Rudd, who took the work and pensions job when Esther McVey quit in November. Rudd also confirmed the partial scrapping of the controversial two-child limit on universal credit payments, but only for this benefit and for children born after April 2017, when the wider limit was first introduced. She defended the cap, and the \u201crape clause\u201d, under which women can claim exemption from the policy if they can show they had conceived a third child via domestic abuse or rape. The charity Women\u2019s Aid called the policy \u201cobjectionable\u201d and likely to hamper some women trying to flee domestic abuse. In the speech, Rudd said she wanted universal credit to particularly help women, and she understood the criticism over the way the benefit was paid into a single bank account, which could be a problem for some couples or families. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m committed to ensuring that household payments go directly to the main carer, which is usually but not always the woman,\u201d she said.

He announced his resignation from the party in an email sent to the leadership earlier this week.</p> <p>In the email he criticised the AfD for worrying too much about the possibility of being put under surveillance by German intelligence. Separately he told Welt newspaper that he was opposed to a \u201cshift to the left\u201d in the AfD, which has spent the last months ridding itself of extreme elements in an attempt to appear more moderate.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, the developments inside the AfD in the last weeks and months has shown that it isn\u2019t really my political home any longer,\u201d Poggenburg wrote in the email.</p> <p>His new party <em>Aufbruch der Deutschen Patrioten </em>(Awakening of German Patriots) will use a German flag against the background of a cornflower. The small blue flower was used as a secret symbol by the then-banned National Socialists in 1930s Austria before the Anschluss of 1938 brought the Nazis to power in the country.</p> <p>Poggenburg, who has repeatedly come under fire for his use of Nazi-era vocabulary, will bring at least two AfD allies, Egbert Ermer and Benjamin Przybylla, into his fledgling party. The party is said to be planning an electoral debut at regional elections in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg this autumn.</p> <p>Poggenburg told Welt that he does not want the party to compete with the AfD, and that he proposes \u201cto stay with the successful [political] positioning of the AfD of around two years ago and not go along with the noticeable shift to the left\u201d.</p> <p>The development will overshadow the AfD\u2019s annual conference in the Saxon town of Riesa, which opened on Friday. Delegates will finalise the party\u2019s programme for upcoming European elections and are expected to reject a proposal supporting \u201cDeuxit\u201d \u2013 Germany exiting the EU.</p> <p>Further distraction came after police released footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/08/german-far-right-mp-frank-magnitz-injured-in-politically-motivated-attack\">Monday\u2019s violent attack on AfD politician Frank Magnitz</a>.

Magnitz falls to the floor and the man flees, followed by two accomplices.</p> <p>Police had earlier said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/09/german-police-cast-doubt-on-details-of-attack-on-rightwing-politician-frank-magnitz\">footage cast doubt on the AfD\u2019s account</a>, in which the party claimed unknown assailants knocked Magnitz to the ground with a wooden instrument before beating him around the head.

Andr\u00e9 Poggenburg resigned from his post as the AfD\u2019s regional leader in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state last year after labelling Turks as \u201ccamel drivers\u201d and immigrants with dual nationality a \u201chomeless mob we no longer want\u201d. He announced his resignation from the party in an email sent to the leadership earlier this week. In the email he criticised the AfD for worrying too much about the possibility of being put under surveillance by German intelligence. Separately he told Welt newspaper that he was opposed to a \u201cshift to the left\u201d in the AfD, which has spent the last months ridding itself of extreme elements in an attempt to appear more moderate. \u201cUnfortunately, the developments inside the AfD in the last weeks and months has shown that it isn\u2019t really my political home any longer,\u201d Poggenburg wrote in the email. His new party Aufbruch der Deutschen Patrioten (Awakening of German Patriots) will use a German flag against the background of a cornflower. The small blue flower was used as a secret symbol by the then-banned National Socialists in 1930s Austria before the Anschluss of 1938 brought the Nazis to power in the country. Poggenburg, who has repeatedly come under fire for his use of Nazi-era vocabulary, will bring at least two AfD allies, Egbert Ermer and Benjamin Przybylla, into his fledgling party. The party is said to be planning an electoral debut at regional elections in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg this autumn. Poggenburg told Welt that he does not want the party to compete with the AfD, and that he proposes \u201cto stay with the successful [political] positioning of the AfD of around two years ago and not go along with the noticeable shift to the left\u201d. The development will overshadow the AfD\u2019s annual conference in the Saxon town of Riesa, which opened on Friday. Delegates will finalise the party\u2019s programme for upcoming European elections and are expected to reject a proposal supporting \u201cDeuxit\u201d \u2013 Germany exiting the EU. Further distraction came after police released footage of Monday\u2019s violent attack on AfD politician Frank Magnitz. The 66-second CCTV clip appears to show a man striking Magnitz in the head from behind with his bare hand. Magnitz falls to the floor and the man flees, followed by two accomplices. Police had earlier said the footage cast doubt on the AfD\u2019s account, in which the party claimed unknown assailants knocked Magnitz to the ground with a wooden instrument before beating him around the head. Magnitz, who heads the AfD\u2019s chapter in the city state of Bremen, spent three days in hospital after the attack. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 January 2019 to clarify the description of the logo.",

The performance was much better than against Jordan in Australia\u2019s tournament opener but it still wasn\u2019t much to get excited about against far weaker opposition. </p> <p>Arnold\u2019s selection changes worked. Chris Ikonomidis was outstanding in place of Robbie Kruse while Jackson Irvine did what was asked of him in midfield after being selected ahead of Massimo Luongo. The decision to retain the under fire Jamie Maclaren also worked, the striker repaying his coach\u2019s faith with a well-taken first-half goal, though he was largely anonymous thereafter. </p> <p>Mark Milligan ran the game from the base of midfield and his long diagonal passes offered a more effective mode of attack than anything Australia produced against Jordan. Both Aziz Behich and Rhyan Grant benefited from the service, as did the lively Awer Mabil. </p> <p>The one negative from the showing was a second yellow card of the tournament for Trent Sainsbury, ruling him out of the crucial final group match with Syria. It remains to be seen if Arnold goes for a like-for-like replacement or shuffles his pack and returns Milligan to defence.</p> <p>That is a question for another day, one that can be approached in high spirits after the defending champions opened their account at Asian Cup 2019.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for now, see you back here for the Syria game on Wednesday night. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fc6c98276b2d0de134246d57722171839e55b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc6c98276b2d0de134246d57722171839e55b9e/0_0_3108_2071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson Irvine performed well for Australia against Palestine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackson Irvine performed well for Australia against Palestine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Nel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3890dee4b0cebe761844bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T12:50:49.920Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Palestine 0-3 Australia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A much better day at the office for the defending champions. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98687008fe5359089106c862832e9c2e42296d6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98687008fe5359089106c862832e9c2e42296d6a/0_0_1918_1279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australia\u2019s players celebrate after scoring during the AFC Asian Cup group B soccer match between Australia and Palestine at Rashid Stadium in Dubai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s players celebrate after scoring during the AFC Asian Cup group B soccer match between Australia and Palestine at Rashid Stadium in Dubai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nariman El-Mofty/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c389012e4b072dc52e6ccf8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-11T12:47:09.442Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GOAL!

      "bodyText": "Graham Arnold finally has something to build on after watching his Socceroos overcome a spirited but limited Palestine in Dubai. The performance was much better than against Jordan in Australia\u2019s tournament opener but it still wasn\u2019t much to get excited about against far weaker opposition. Arnold\u2019s selection changes worked. Chris Ikonomidis was outstanding in place of Robbie Kruse while Jackson Irvine did what was asked of him in midfield after being selected ahead of Massimo Luongo. The decision to retain the under fire Jamie Maclaren also worked, the striker repaying his coach\u2019s faith with a well-taken first-half goal, though he was largely anonymous thereafter. Mark Milligan ran the game from the base of midfield and his long diagonal passes offered a more effective mode of attack than anything Australia produced against Jordan. Both Aziz Behich and Rhyan Grant benefited from the service, as did the lively Awer Mabil. The one negative from the showing was a second yellow card of the tournament for Trent Sainsbury, ruling him out of the crucial final group match with Syria. It remains to be seen if Arnold goes for a like-for-like replacement or shuffles his pack and returns Milligan to defence. That is a question for another day, one that can be approached in high spirits after the defending champions opened their account at Asian Cup 2019. That\u2019s all from me for now, see you back here for the Syria game on Wednesday night. A much better day at the office for the defending champions. From the resulting corner the short one-two ends with Ikonomidis chipping over to the far post for Giannou to nod home unmarked after timing his run to perfection. Cherry, meet cake. 89 mins: The sting is out of this game now, Australia confidently circulating possession and running down the clock. Eventually they decide to attack and some neat play from Kruse, Grant and latterly Ikonomidis almost ends in a Palestinian own goal. 87 mins: That\u2019s the last we\u2019ll see of Mabil today, replaced by Kruse for the final few minutes. Not sure what anybody gains out of that sub, but there we go. 86 mins: Two more times Mabil runs at Palestine\u2019s defence, the second of those he cuts inside and shoots with his left foot but it\u2019s straight at Rami Hamada. 85 mins: With players tired and Palestine chasing a result the game is becoming stretched. Mabil almost takes advantage of the increasing space by sending over a teasing cross but Giannou can\u2019t win the contested header. 83 mins: Cheap yellow card for Sainsbury for time-wasting. That he means he misses the Syria game. 81 mins: Credit to Maclaren for executing a one-man press late in the game, hassling Palestine\u2019s back four to maintain a territorial advantage. His reward is to be hooked by Graham Arnold, replaced by Apostolos Giannou. 79 mins: Australia look in control now, dominating territory and applying two midfield screeners to snuff out any hint of Palestine counter-attacking. Mabil\u2019s quick feet earn a corner but for the second game running Australia\u2019s set-pieces have been poor. Mabil the culprit against Jordan, Ikonomidis tonight. Aaron Mooy is sorely missed. 77 mins: Wadi can\u2019t overcome his bout of cramp and Palestine\u2019s most dangerous player is replaced by Khaled Salem. No more subs left for the side chasing the game. 76 mins: After a moment of reflection I can say with confidence this has been a scrappy second half. 75 mins: First change for Australia and it sees Tom Rogic rested for the final 15 minutes with Massimo Luongo taking his place. 73 mins: More danger from Palestine and again its Wadi, this time rising well at the far post to win a deep cross but there\u2019s nobody in red in the danger zone to pick up the scraps. The big No 19 lands and immediately doubles over with cramp which provokes liberal application of the magic spray. 71 mins: The Socceroos respond positively, again down the right, and again through the overlapping Grant but his latest teasing cross fails to find a gold shirt in the box. Nathmi Albadawi replaced by Mohammed Rashid in Palestine\u2019s second substitution. 70 mins: First moment of real quality going forward for Palestine. Mahmoud Wadi tricked his way into the box down the right but a lack of support limits his options at the death and Australia smuggle the ball clear. 69 mins: Irvine\u2019s been a smart introduction this game. He\u2019s done the simple things in midfield, looked a threat in the air, and put his foot in when it\u2019s been required. His physicality has matches Palestine\u2019s aggressive intent. 66 mins: Watching Ikonomidis show his control and strength on the left and cut inside on his right before spreading an intelligent pass with his right foot gives cause for great optimism. The pass to Grant ended in a wasted opportunity but the glimpses of Ikonomidis\u2019 class suggest Robbie Kruse may struggle to return to first XI for some time. 64 mins: Someone on TV just mentioned Jamie Maclaren\u2019s name. I confess I forgot he was playing. He took his goal well, missed a sitter, but otherwise hasn\u2019t done a great deal. 61 mins: Ikonomidis shoots weakly from range, but he\u2019s forgiven after fashioning the chance himself with a Zidane-like first-touch and spin near halfway. The Glory forward landed awkwardly after he shot though and is visited by the physio. Fortunately he\u2019s well enough to jog off and receive a jocular bum tap from the gaffer. 60 mins: Two goals up, one of those spells of slow possession in front of the Palestinian defence suddenly looks like skilful game management, instead of the maddening waste of time it appeared against Jordan. 59 mins: Palestine are giving it their all trying to work a way back into this contest but there is little quality in the middle or final third. 57 mins: First Palestinian change of the night sees Zorrilla replaced by Dabbagh. 55 mins: If Australia targeted the left in the first half it\u2019s been all down the right in the second. Grant has seen plenty of the ball in attacking areas and his latest cross is deflected onto his own crossbar by Abdallah Jaber. The Socceroos keep up the pressure and from a resulting corner Irvine wins another header that just creeps over the bar. Australia are dominant in these early stages of the half but that still doesn\u2019t stop Rogic from earning a yellow card for lazily encroaching at an innocuous free-kick. 52 mins: Some of Palestine\u2019s defending has been borderline, either full-blooded in midfield or last ditch closer to goal. I would not be surprised to see a penalty before the 90 minutes is up. Before that, Rogic has a free-kick opportunity from the edge of the D, earned after skipping over one of those last ditch challenges, but it\u2019s a tame set-piece into the wall and cleared. 50 mins: Ikonomidis has been excellent for Australia. Always looking for possession, working hard to create space for teammates, and getting his head up when he has the ball. Ideally suited to this three-pronged forward line. 49 mins: Decent work by Australia down both flanks but first Mabil then Irvine can\u2019t capitalise. That second effort was again the result of the referee finding something wrong with the Hull City man\u2019s jumping technique. 48 mins: With the sun setting across the Rashid Stadium Mat Ryan has come out with a cap in this second half and it is a very village AFC number. One must presume he either forgot to bring one of his own or it wasn\u2019t approved for some reason. 46 mins: The second half is underway with a couple of themes from the first: a long diagonal from Milligan towards Irvine who\u2019s penalised for an illegal jump. Although I wonder if for most of those late arrivals there\u2019s a touch of the Burton Albion fans stuck on the M6 while their boys were being shellacked by Man City. \u201cMaybe this game is all about the win and to build confidence, given the disruptions with injury, as hopefully we progress into the tournament?\u201d asks Marzi De Santi. Indeed, and picking a couple of in-form players like Ikonomidis and Irvine has certainly made that job a lot easier. Hopefully Maclaren\u2019s goal will mean he can finally show the form that earned him an opportunity at this level. \u201cAbsolutely superb\u201d says Mark Bosnich. Not sure I\u2019d go that far but definitely an improvement. Seems that sell-out might be on after all but for whatever reason it\u2019s taken an age for fans to filter from the concourse into the stadium. Australia head to the break a comfortable two goals to the good. Far from vintage from the Socceroos but better than Palestine, so far. 45 mins: Mark Milligan is receiving plenty of praise on social media and on TV. He has been responsible for providing a more direct approach from the base of midfield, getting the ball forward earlier than against Jordan, allowing the likes of Ikonomidis and Rogic more opportunities to attack without being outnumbered. 43 mins: This has not been the kind of performance to strike fear into the hearts of Japan or South Korea, but it offers Graham Arnold something to build on. 41 mins: After a few quiet minutes going forward Australia should be three up. Maclaren gets lucky in the box but keeps his composure to feed Mabil but he fires over from the edge of the six-yard box on a narrow angle. 39 mins: Couple of openings for Palestine but long balls into Australia\u2019s box are repelled. An attack with the ball at the feet of Nathmi Albadawi looks even more promising but a questionable challenge near the D goes unpunished. 36 mins: Ah, that yellow card was for Zorilla pushing the referee after failing to see punishment meted out to Behich for the stray elbow. 35 mins: Aziz Behich has been involved in a few push and shoves this half and in the latest he catches Jonathan Zorrilla with a stray elbow. Not a lot in it but you\u2019ve seen incidents like that land players in hot water. There\u2019s a suggestion the Palestinian received a yellow card for his part in that delay but I can\u2019t confirm, nor understand why he might have bene cautioned. 33 mins: Another Irvine header from a set-piece almost ends in a goal. From a deep central position Milligan floated the ball towards the penalty spot and the onrushing Irvine made it his in the manner of peak Tim Cahill but he couldn\u2019t direct his effort on target. Irvine had no right to win that header but did so powerfully. 30 mins: Some of the referee\u2019s decisions are a bit hard to fathom. At times he lets the game flow a la an Old Firm derby in the mid-80s, at others finding fouls where none appeared to exist. Palestine are certainly giving everything in the contest, making a host of sliding challenges and escaping without any bookings so far. 27 mins: Australia are still far from fluent in possession and far from secure without the ball but Palestine have not displayed the same level as Jordan, yet. The ability of Ikonomidis and Mabil to find space between the lines alongside Rogic has been much more noticeable. That in turn has created more room for the full-backs. This. 25 mins: \u201cMcLaren has copped a lot of stick playing for the Socceroos,\u201d emails Marzi De Santi. \u201cBrilliant that he has got the monkey off his back!\u201d. Some of that stick has been from me Marzi, some of it around the three-minute mark of today\u2019s game, but he has answered his critics with a lovely header. 23 mins: Almost a third but Irvine\u2019s towering header from a loopy corner ricochets off an unwitting Palestinian defender. Crisis? What crisis? Australia make it two in the blink of an eye. Again some good work down the left between Behich and Ikonomidis ends with the latter placing an inch perfect cross into the run of Mabil, steaming in at the far post to sidefoot home. Out of nothing, Australia are ahead. Slow, patient possession near halfway looks like it\u2019s going nowhere until the ball finds Rogic on the right. The Celtic star shows great feet to beat his man, cut inside and then fire over a vicious inswinging cross with his left foot that Jamie Maclaren flicks on unerringly into the bottom corner. Graham Arnold breathes a Big. Sigh. Of. Relief. 15 mins: First glimpse of Mabil\u2019s trickery in the box but his shot from 15 yards is charged down. Slight delay while the referee explains to Irvine that what\u2019s acceptable in the air in East Yorkshire is not in Dubai. The Hull City utility looks frustrated for being repeatedly penalised for contesting headers in midfield. 13 mins: After Australia show their vulnerabilities against set pieces they break dangerously, once again Behich the target of a deep diagonal. He wins a corner but it carries little threat. 11 mins: Australia look to have settled into their rhythm now, recycling possession from one side to the other, waiting for the opening. The latest arrives from the right and the overlapping Grant and he whips over a super cross that three gold shirts dive towards but none can connect with. 9 mins: A feature of Australia\u2019s play early on are the medium to long range diagonals from Mark Milligan. They come with an obvious turnover risk though with Palestine winning the initial aerial battle a couple of times and then breaking at speed. 7 mins: The first sloppy turnover in midfield for Australia leads to a speculative strike from range that almost skews into a handy throughball. From the resulting throw-in the Socceroos are almost caught napping but a late challenge blocks the shooting opportunity from a narrow angle. Palestine are up for this. 5 mins: \u201cThere\u2019s no way to dress that up, it\u2019s a horrible miss,\u201d says Andy Harper on TV about Maclaren\u2019s miscue. It only gets worse with every replay. The chance reflects how much joy Australia are having down the left hand side, Behich playing near enough as a winger in these early exchanges. 3 mins: First spell of attacking play is down Australia\u2019s left with Behich to the fore and Ikonomidis lively. That pair combine again a few seconds later with the Glory man centring perfectly to tee up Maclaren on the penalty spot but the Hibernian striker takes an ugly air swing with his left foot when a goal was at his mercy. That chance was better than any Australia created against Jordan and Maclaren butchered it. 1 min: First thing to note is there is plenty of noise in Dubai and it\u2019s mostly behind the side in red. Second thing to note, if this is a sell-out, I am a billionaire. Swathes of empty seats around this open arena. We\u2019re underway at the Rashid Stadium! Your referee tonight is Valentin Kovalenko from Uzbekistan. It\u2019s anthem time in Dubai. Australia have arrived bedecked in gold, Palestine in red. If this all gets a bit too stressful, have a laugh along with David Squires. There\u2019s been no shortage of upsets already in the UAE. Arnold will be keen to avoid another banana skin tonight. Here\u2019s a bit more on Tom Rogic\u2019s diagnosis, a rare skerrick of good news in amongst Australia\u2019s injury crisis. There\u2019s plenty going on around the UAE at the moment with a few big names fighting to restore their reputations. Scott McIntyre broke down Australia\u2019s opening defeat and set the scene for a testing second encounter. A Palestinian side with plenty to play for and comprised of players from a diaspora that stretches from Argentina and Chile, to Slovenia and North Carolina are sure to provide just as stern a test as Jordan did. Arnold hasn\u2019t completely torn up Plan A - and nor should he have after overseeing such an encouraging run of performances pre-tournament. The dropping of Kruse comes as little surprise following a tough run for the national side and the in-form Ikonomidis\u2019 promising burst off the bench against Jordan. It is perhaps a surprise Jamie Maclaren gets another start in the No 9 jersey after failing to impress so far at the highest level. Further back Irvine is rewarded for his energetic cameo in the opening game, but Luongo can count himself unfortunate to miss out. The QPR man didn\u2019t have his finest night against Jordan but appears an easier player to drop than others. An option at Arnold\u2019s disposal that could also have been taken, for example, would have been to return Mark Milligan to centre-back and bench Trent Sainsbury who has underwhelmed for an extended period in gold. Three changes for Australia with Robbie Kruse and Massimo Luongo making way for Chris Ikonomidis and Jackson Irvine in tactical switches while Rhyan Grant deputises for the injured Josh Risdon. It\u2019s a mixed bag injury-wise for Graham Arnold. Tom Rogic has been passed fit despite breaking his hand against Jordan while Andrew Nabbout is now fit enough to make the bench. Risdon has been ruled out though after leaving the opening match at half-time. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a great reaction from the players and the boys,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe go into this game with a lot of confidence and a lot of belief and expectation to win.\u201d Hello and welcome to matchday seven of Asian Cup 2019, and it\u2019s a vital one for Australia as they take on Palestine in Dubai. Kick-off at the Rashid Stadium is 10pm AEDT (3pm local time). After losing their opening match to Jordan, and performing poorly in the process, the pressure is on Graham Arnold and his Socceroos. Allowances can be made for a host of injuries but there are question marks over selection, individual form and collective strategy that need to be answered tonight. \u201cStraight away the focus has turned to how we\u2019re going to right those wrongs and rectify where we went wrong and improve the areas we could have done better,\u201d Mat Ryan said during the week. \u201cI have no doubt we are going to come back in this next game and make the country proud again with our performance and the result.\u201d Jordan\u2019s victory over Syria means top spot in Group B is all but assured. Tonight\u2019s match is therefore pivotal for Australia to remain in control of the second automatic qualification spot into the knockout phase. Unlike Australia\u2019s opening match, tonight\u2019s contest is an 18,000 sell out. Plenty of those tickets have gone to Palestine supporters buoyed by their team\u2019s opening round draw with Syria and sensing an upset after Jordan provided a template for how to neutralise and then punish the defending champions.",

Am I doing it at the moment? Everyone is, I think. The players and staff would be lying if they said that they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Vestergaard, who joined Southampton from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach last July for \u00a318m, speaks in flawless English \u2013 his third language, behind Danish and German \u2013 and has a perspective and conviction that belie his 26 years. Like every football fan in Denmark, Vestergaard grew up watching the Premier League and he dreamed of playing in it. The reality has been bracing. Vestergaard now has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/06/ralph-hasenhuttl-southampton-premier-league-rb-leipzig\" title=\"\">new manager in Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl</a> and 17 games to haul Southampton on to the right side of the relegation cut-off. The mission resumes at Leicester on Saturday.</p> <p>By Vestergaard\u2019s own admission, he has yet to show his best form.

The referee gave the goal only for his assistant to then disallow it for offside.</p> <p>D\u00fcsseldorf lost at Hannover and Hoffenheim advanced to the play-off where they would beat Kaiserslautern, with Vestergaard heading the clinching goal in the second leg. Three seasons later, he was involved in another last-day showdown, when his Bremen team had to beat Eintracht Frankfurt to stay up. Draw and they would have entered the play-off; lose and they might have gone down.

You will always be someone that impacted the sport in so many different ways, I know this was never the way you wanted to go out, but hey it was a heck of a ride. You took me under your wing as soon as I got on tour, and to this day you have been someone I literally just look forward to seeing. You are one crazy tennis player, miles better than me, but I just want you to know that today isn\u2019t only a sad day for you and your team, it\u2019s a sad day for the sport and for everyone you\u2019ve had an impact on. Which leaves me big fella.. these are a couple photos, that should make you smile and think, I was actually a little bit of a younger brother to you. Anyways, I just want you to know, and I\u2019m sure you already do, everyone wants you to keep fighting and to keep being you. Goodluck at the Australian Open muzz, I\u2019ll be behind you. #onelastdance \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/k1ngkyrg1os/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_medium=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Kygs</a> (@k1ngkyrg1os) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-01-11T06:46:08+00:00&quot;>Jan 10, 2019 at 10:46pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>Justin Rose, Olympic golf champion</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinRose99/status/1083640137672810496\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What a career <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andy_murray?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andy_murray</a> keep it going as everybody wants to watch you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wimbledon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Wimbledon</a> in July mate. #\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7GOAT <br><br>\u2013\u2013 3x Grand Slams<br>\u2013\u2013 2x Olympic gold medals<br>\u2013\u2013 ATP Finals<br>\u2013\u2013 2016 world No.1 <br>\u2013\u2013 14x Masters 1000 titles<br>\u2013\u2013 8x Grand Slam finals<br>\u2013\u2013 45 total ATP titles <br><br>Legend \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 <a href=\"https://t.co/CYphhRvUcC\">pic.twitter.com/CYphhRvUcC</a></p>\u2014 Justin Rose (@JustinRose99) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinRose99/status/1083640137672810496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 11, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<h2>Neil Lennon, Hibernian manager</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HibernianFC/status/1083634966792146945\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udc9a| \u201cAndy Murray is an inspiration and a role model.

Speaking in the build-up to his first-round match at the Australian Open, Murray said: \u201cIn December I spoke to my team and I told them: \u2018I cannot keep doing this. Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon. That\u2019s where I would like to stop playing.\u2019 But I am not certain I am able to do that.\u201d No one would begrudge Murray one last appearance at Wimbledon in July but, if his body does not allow him to make it that far, at least he will leave the sport knowing he is respected, admired and loved by his fellow pros.

      "body": "<p>Whatever else happens with Brexit, no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable. The pressure of the article 50 clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs. She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs, hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jan/09/brexit-latest-news-debate-pmqs-may-corbyn-grieve-mps-launch-bid-to-ensure-they-vote-on-plan-b-within-three-days-if-mays-deal-defeated-politics-live\" title=\"\">in an act of parliamentary jujitsu</a>, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/04/what-does-dominic-grieves-amendment-mean-for-brexit\" title=\"\">turned the timetable weapon back on May</a>, securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/11/labour-peoples-vote-second-referendum-blindfold-brexit\" title=\"\">Running down the clock</a> should eliminate options and force decisions. So far that hasn\u2019t worked. Instead, the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space, which, in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics, raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexit law has now been amended and re-amended so many ways that power lies neither with the government nor with MPs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>May has been holding the lid, keeping the pressure on. It is her deal that MPs will almost certainly reject, and hers alone. Brexit itself does not depend on this particular prime minister. It is easy to forget that, when the whole business has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/10/james-graham-drama-brexit-the-uncivil-war\" title=\"\">felt like a Shakespearean tragedy</a> with May at its centre: the hostage to pitiless circumstance undone by her own flaws, consumed by a megalomaniacal sense of duty \u2013 a monstrous hybrid of piety and arrogance.</p> <p>But next week begins the great disentanglement, when threads of what parliament might endorse will be separated and sorted, regardless of what May wants. Brexit law has now been amended and re-amended so many ways that power lies neither with the government nor with MPs. Parliament gets to say what it thinks should happen \u2013 the prime minister isn\u2019t bound by law to do it, but would surely not survive long in office if she flatly refused.</p> <p>And so the race is on to form some cross-party coalition that can agree on some kind of plan: any plan that is not May\u2019s one, and doesn\u2019t involve flying off the no-deal cliff edge. As one cabinet minister put it to me recently: once that coalition is found, \u201cit is then effectively the government\u201d. It is premature to say that discussions are under way to form some national unity administration, but the idea is being seriously kicked around among pro-European Tories who imagine that disaffected moderate Labour MPs, worn down by dissidence in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s regime, can be recruited to a temporary arrangement that gets the country safely through the next few months.</p> <p>In my experience, remain-leaning Conservatives underestimate the gravitational force of Labour tribalism, regardless of who is leader, but it is certainly true that dismay over Brexit has created some surprising friendships that cross partisan lines.</p> <p>The two main propositions competing to prove their viability are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/01/brexit-rocky-road-to-second-eu-referendum-peoples-vote\" title=\"\">second referendum</a> (under the banner of a <a href=\"https://www.peoples-vote.uk/\" title=\"\">people\u2019s vote</a>), and a Brexit model that keeps the UK inside the single market and the customs union, once characterised as Norway plus and now rebranded <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Common-Market-2.0.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Neither camp can yet muster a majority. The \u201cNorwegians\u201d say their numbers are artificially low because many Tories who support them, including cabinet ministers, have to pretend to back May\u2019s deal right up until the moment it fails. But Tory people\u2019s vote supporters also claim to have sleeper cells of ministerial endorsement. Labour MPs on both sides argue that their leader will eventually come to see the logic of their preferred option.</p> <p>It is a peculiar rivalry between factions who agree with each other about most of what is wrong with Brexit. They would almost certainly back each other\u2019s proposal if their own were eliminated. The people\u2019s vote side would prefer common market 2.0 to May\u2019s deal. Many of the common market 2.0 brigade would go for a referendum if they were more confident that public opinion had shifted so far that the result would be a slam dunk for remain. Meanwhile, each side has to manage the awkward geometry of coalition-building across the floor of the Commons. When a Tory declares for a people\u2019s vote, it makes it harder for the left to sign up. When former remainers back common market 2.0, it is harder to sell it to leavers as a bona fide Brexit. It is the classic Rubik\u2019s Cube conundrum \u2013 lining up the colours on one face ruins another one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/11/uk-faces-prospect-of-no-brexit-if-may-deal-rejected-says-hunt\">UK faces prospect of no Brexit if May's deal rejected, says Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one thing all can agree on \u2013 the only proposition for which a Commons majority has already been demonstrated this year \u2013 is that Britain should not crash out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/08/theresa-may-suffers-commons-defeat-over-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">EU without a deal</a>. The problem is that no deal is the scenario that requires the least action. It is what happens if everyone just carries on being pretty much as they have done, failing to organise around any one goal. MPs can rail against the idea of no deal, but that doesn\u2019t prove it can\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Many things were unthinkable before they started to look feasible, then suddenly became inevitable. Brexit was one. A second referendum might be another. May somehow bulldozing her deal through parliament cannot be ruled out completely.</p> <p>She has said many times that the UK leaves the EU on 29 March \u2013 but many officials believe that an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/theresa-may-extend-article-50\" title=\"\">extension to the article 50</a> period is inevitable. Even if parliament approves a deal, there isn\u2019t much time to pass the subsequent enabling legislation. We are at the stage of the Brexit drama where every possible outcome has been ruled out at some point. The final act has to involve some shift in perceptions of what is possible. <a href=\"https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/birnam-wood\" title=\"\">Birnam Wood</a> is on its way to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsinane_Hill\" title=\"\">Dunsinane</a>. The Brexit tragedy that was all about Theresa May\u2019s ambition and misjudgments is coming to an end.</p> <p>The sequel is a story of rebel bands in parliament competing for power as it flies from the prime minister\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Whatever else happens with Brexit, no one in British politics will ever again underestimate the power of a timetable. The pressure of the article 50 clock ticking down forced Theresa May into the compromises that make her deal unpalatable to MPs. She has tried to pass the pain on to MPs, hoping that the grim consequences of missing the deadline would force them to settle for her plan. Earlier this week, in an act of parliamentary jujitsu, the former attorney general Dominic Grieve turned the timetable weapon back on May, securing an amendment that sets a limit of three days for the prime minister to say what comes next if her deal collapses. Running down the clock should eliminate options and force decisions. So far that hasn\u2019t worked. Instead, the same volume of Brexit bluster has been compressed into an ever tighter space, which, in accordance with the laws of political thermodynamics, raises the temperature and increases the danger of something blowing up. May has been holding the lid, keeping the pressure on. It is her deal that MPs will almost certainly reject, and hers alone. Brexit itself does not depend on this particular prime minister. It is easy to forget that, when the whole business has felt like a Shakespearean tragedy with May at its centre: the hostage to pitiless circumstance undone by her own flaws, consumed by a megalomaniacal sense of duty \u2013 a monstrous hybrid of piety and arrogance. But next week begins the great disentanglement, when threads of what parliament might endorse will be separated and sorted, regardless of what May wants. Brexit law has now been amended and re-amended so many ways that power lies neither with the government nor with MPs. Parliament gets to say what it thinks should happen \u2013 the prime minister isn\u2019t bound by law to do it, but would surely not survive long in office if she flatly refused. And so the race is on to form some cross-party coalition that can agree on some kind of plan: any plan that is not May\u2019s one, and doesn\u2019t involve flying off the no-deal cliff edge. As one cabinet minister put it to me recently: once that coalition is found, \u201cit is then effectively the government\u201d. It is premature to say that discussions are under way to form some national unity administration, but the idea is being seriously kicked around among pro-European Tories who imagine that disaffected moderate Labour MPs, worn down by dissidence in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s regime, can be recruited to a temporary arrangement that gets the country safely through the next few months. In my experience, remain-leaning Conservatives underestimate the gravitational force of Labour tribalism, regardless of who is leader, but it is certainly true that dismay over Brexit has created some surprising friendships that cross partisan lines. The two main propositions competing to prove their viability are the second referendum (under the banner of a people\u2019s vote), and a Brexit model that keeps the UK inside the single market and the customs union, once characterised as Norway plus and now rebranded \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d. Neither camp can yet muster a majority. The \u201cNorwegians\u201d say their numbers are artificially low because many Tories who support them, including cabinet ministers, have to pretend to back May\u2019s deal right up until the moment it fails. But Tory people\u2019s vote supporters also claim to have sleeper cells of ministerial endorsement. Labour MPs on both sides argue that their leader will eventually come to see the logic of their preferred option. It is a peculiar rivalry between factions who agree with each other about most of what is wrong with Brexit. They would almost certainly back each other\u2019s proposal if their own were eliminated. The people\u2019s vote side would prefer common market 2.0 to May\u2019s deal. Many of the common market 2.0 brigade would go for a referendum if they were more confident that public opinion had shifted so far that the result would be a slam dunk for remain. Meanwhile, each side has to manage the awkward geometry of coalition-building across the floor of the Commons. When a Tory declares for a people\u2019s vote, it makes it harder for the left to sign up. When former remainers back common market 2.0, it is harder to sell it to leavers as a bona fide Brexit. It is the classic Rubik\u2019s Cube conundrum \u2013 lining up the colours on one face ruins another one. The one thing all can agree on \u2013 the only proposition for which a Commons majority has already been demonstrated this year \u2013 is that Britain should not crash out of the EU without a deal. The problem is that no deal is the scenario that requires the least action. It is what happens if everyone just carries on being pretty much as they have done, failing to organise around any one goal. MPs can rail against the idea of no deal, but that doesn\u2019t prove it can\u2019t happen. Many things were unthinkable before they started to look feasible, then suddenly became inevitable. Brexit was one. A second referendum might be another. May somehow bulldozing her deal through parliament cannot be ruled out completely. She has said many times that the UK leaves the EU on 29 March \u2013 but many officials believe that an extension to the article 50 period is inevitable. Even if parliament approves a deal, there isn\u2019t much time to pass the subsequent enabling legislation. We are at the stage of the Brexit drama where every possible outcome has been ruled out at some point. The final act has to involve some shift in perceptions of what is possible. Birnam Wood is on its way to Dunsinane. The Brexit tragedy that was all about Theresa May\u2019s ambition and misjudgments is coming to an end. The sequel is a story of rebel bands in parliament competing for power as it flies from the prime minister\u2019s hands. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

The answer is, a great deal. It has been shown that people are remarkably honest when they search for information online. Their Google searches and queries reveal interests, prejudices and hatreds that they might otherwise keep hidden from friends, family members, neighbours, surveys and even themselves. These searches have been shown to share their health secrets, sexual preferences, and hostility towards other groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/11/uk-thousands-antisemitic-google-searches-per-year-research\">Britons make 170,000 antisemitic Google searches a year, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of my work with the <a href=\"https://www.antisemitism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Antisemitism Policy Trust</a> and the <a href=\"https://cst.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Security Trust</a>, I put this to the test to see what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/11/uk-thousands-antisemitic-google-searches-per-year-research\" title=\"\">Google searches made by people in the UK</a> could tell us about attitudes towards Jewish people. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, we found that, every year, people in the UK express antisemitic thoughts through their internet searches.</p> <p>People do some Google searches that are disturbing, such as \u201cI hate Jews\u201d and \u201cwhy are Jews evil?\u201d, along with other searches expressing violent intentions towards Jews. The most common negative stereotypes that appeared were that Jews were \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d, and the total number of antisemitic Google searches and queries made from the UK is about 170,000 per year.</p> <p>One of the most common manifestations of antisemitism online is through conspiracy theories. The mythological wealth and power of the Rothschild banking family remains one of the top conspiracy theories in the UK. It is a tale that has long been used by antisemites to stir up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/antisemitism-open-your-eyes-jeremy-corbyn-labour\" title=\"\">images of Jewish bankers</a> using their wealth to influence and subvert governments.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Searches related to Zionism are 29% higher in the UK than in the US</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the antisemitic propaganda of Nazi Germany to today\u2019s Facebook memes and YouTube videos, this conspiracy theory persists. In the UK, since 2004, there have been consistently more Google searches for the Rothschild banking family than for Jewish celebrities such as David Baddiel or Tracy Ann Oberman, and the number of searches for this conspiracy theory has increased by 39% in the past three years.</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, considering there are fewer than 300,000 Jews in Britain, Zionism is a popular search term in this country. In fact, the UK ranks third in the world for searches for Zionism \u2013 behind only Israel and Lebanon.</p> <p>Remarkably, searches related to Zionism are 29% higher in the UK than in the US. Most of these searches express curiosity about Zionism \u2013 the top searches include \u201cZionism definition\u201d and \u201cwhat is Zionism?\u201d But the fourth most popular search relates to a conspiracy theory: \u201cHitler Zionism\u201d.</p> <p>These searches shot up in April 2016 after the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\" title=\"\">suspended by the Labour party</a> for saying that Hitler supported Zionism. Searches relating to Zionism rose 25-fold in April 2016, shortly after Livingstone\u2019s remarks; 14% of all searches related to Zionism during that month were looking for information on Hitler\u2019s views about Zionism.</p> <p>That this particularly niche issue has become such a matter of public interest may be something that should concern public figures seeking to ensure well-informed debate about the topic. There is most certainly a role for technology companies in this regard.</p> <p>Our data suggests that Google\u2019s autocomplete function can influence these searches. For example, in December 2016 the Observer reported that one of the top autocompletes to the question \u201care Jews \u2026\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/05/google-alters-search-autocomplete-remove-are-jews-evil-suggestion\" title=\"\">was \u201care Jews evil?\u201d</a> Following the report, Google removed this offensive suggestion from its autocomplete function.</p> <p>So, by removing this suggested search, did fewer people make this search on Google? Indeed they did. In the 12 months following this policy change, approximately 10% fewer questions about Jews asked whether they were evil, compared with the 12 months before the policy.</p> <p>In other words, by including the offensive autocomplete \u201cAre Jews evil?\u201d, Google led approximately 10% more people who began their search with \u201care Jews \u2026\u201d to click on the search \u201care Jews evil?\u201d, than would have been the case if that particular search had not been suggested.</p> <p>This shows that Google, by prompting searches to users with its autocomplete function, can have a direct influence on the number of antisemitic searches on its platform. What else might Google therefore be prompting users to search? We know that Google-owned YouTube can direct people from conspiracy theories to hardcore Nazi content.</p> <p>Individuals are being radicalised online \u2013 in some cases, perhaps unintentionally, assisted by algorithms.

      "bodyText": "Beyond a quick read of a Wikipedia page, what can the internet really tell us about antisemitism in the United Kingdom? The answer is, a great deal. It has been shown that people are remarkably honest when they search for information online. Their Google searches and queries reveal interests, prejudices and hatreds that they might otherwise keep hidden from friends, family members, neighbours, surveys and even themselves. These searches have been shown to share their health secrets, sexual preferences, and hostility towards other groups. As part of my work with the Antisemitism Policy Trust and the Community Security Trust, I put this to the test to see what Google searches made by people in the UK could tell us about attitudes towards Jewish people. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, we found that, every year, people in the UK express antisemitic thoughts through their internet searches. People do some Google searches that are disturbing, such as \u201cI hate Jews\u201d and \u201cwhy are Jews evil?\u201d, along with other searches expressing violent intentions towards Jews. The most common negative stereotypes that appeared were that Jews were \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d, and the total number of antisemitic Google searches and queries made from the UK is about 170,000 per year. One of the most common manifestations of antisemitism online is through conspiracy theories. The mythological wealth and power of the Rothschild banking family remains one of the top conspiracy theories in the UK. It is a tale that has long been used by antisemites to stir up images of Jewish bankers using their wealth to influence and subvert governments. From the antisemitic propaganda of Nazi Germany to today\u2019s Facebook memes and YouTube videos, this conspiracy theory persists. In the UK, since 2004, there have been consistently more Google searches for the Rothschild banking family than for Jewish celebrities such as David Baddiel or Tracy Ann Oberman, and the number of searches for this conspiracy theory has increased by 39% in the past three years. Perhaps surprisingly, considering there are fewer than 300,000 Jews in Britain, Zionism is a popular search term in this country. In fact, the UK ranks third in the world for searches for Zionism \u2013 behind only Israel and Lebanon. Remarkably, searches related to Zionism are 29% higher in the UK than in the US. Most of these searches express curiosity about Zionism \u2013 the top searches include \u201cZionism definition\u201d and \u201cwhat is Zionism?\u201d But the fourth most popular search relates to a conspiracy theory: \u201cHitler Zionism\u201d. These searches shot up in April 2016 after the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was suspended by the Labour party for saying that Hitler supported Zionism. Searches relating to Zionism rose 25-fold in April 2016, shortly after Livingstone\u2019s remarks; 14% of all searches related to Zionism during that month were looking for information on Hitler\u2019s views about Zionism. That this particularly niche issue has become such a matter of public interest may be something that should concern public figures seeking to ensure well-informed debate about the topic. There is most certainly a role for technology companies in this regard. Our data suggests that Google\u2019s autocomplete function can influence these searches. For example, in December 2016 the Observer reported that one of the top autocompletes to the question \u201care Jews \u2026\u201d was \u201care Jews evil?\u201d Following the report, Google removed this offensive suggestion from its autocomplete function. So, by removing this suggested search, did fewer people make this search on Google? Indeed they did. In the 12 months following this policy change, approximately 10% fewer questions about Jews asked whether they were evil, compared with the 12 months before the policy. In other words, by including the offensive autocomplete \u201cAre Jews evil?\u201d, Google led approximately 10% more people who began their search with \u201care Jews \u2026\u201d to click on the search \u201care Jews evil?\u201d, than would have been the case if that particular search had not been suggested. This shows that Google, by prompting searches to users with its autocomplete function, can have a direct influence on the number of antisemitic searches on its platform. What else might Google therefore be prompting users to search? We know that Google-owned YouTube can direct people from conspiracy theories to hardcore Nazi content. Individuals are being radicalised online \u2013 in some cases, perhaps unintentionally, assisted by algorithms. This is just one example of why technology companies need to get their heads around this problem, and quickly, as the future health of our societies depends on it. \u2022 Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is a data scientist and writer",

In this I have an ideal role model: Chris Grayling, our transport secretary, whose life goal appears to be to embrace his inner uselessness. </p> <p>It is one thing to first waste \u00a350,000 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/07/no-deal-brexit-rehearsal-tests-traffic-congestion-in-kent\">failing to organise a lorry jam in Kent on a Monday morning</a> and then another \u00a313.8m by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/30/no-deal-brexit-ferry-company-owns-no-ships-and-has-never-run-ferry-service\">awarding a ferry contract to a company that has no ferries</a>, the mission statement of a pizza delivery company and directors whose main talent is corporate insolvency. </p> <p>But it takes a really special type of politician to make a virtue of all these failings in his responses to an urgent question in the House of Commons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/02/grayling-no-deal-brexit-ferry-contract-company-seaborne-freight-no-ships\">Grayling\u2019s main line of defence</a> was that no money had actually been wasted in proving to the EU we weren\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit because none of the \u00a313.8m would be spent if no ferries ran. He appeared to have no idea that the whole purpose of a contingency plan was for there to be a contingency. I\u2019m going to miss him when he\u2019s gone.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s 20 years ago today that my father died. He was 77 years old. Scarcely a day goes by when I don\u2019t think of him. I miss his kindness, his humility, his gentleness and his love and my lasting regret is that he died younger than we would all have liked and that he never got to see my children grow up. He would have been so proud of the adults they have become. His death took us all by surprise \u2013 he went in to hospital for a heart bypass operation and never regained consciousness \u2013 though not perhaps him.</p> <p>I think he knew he was a lot more ill than he had let on and I vividly remember watching him at the last Christmas dinner we shared as a family 10 days or so before he went into hospital. He seemed to be both there and not there at the same time. Not so much because he was withdrawing from us all but more as if he wanted time and space for himself to take in every detail. An eternity of memories. </p> <p>I also wonder if I had some second sense he might not survive the operation. A month earlier I had driven down to see him and set the final record straight. Our relationship hadn\u2019t always been the easiest when I was growing up. He could be distant \u2013 the war had a lasting effect on him \u2013 and I was a difficult, disappointing and troubled child.</p> <p>But over the previous five or six years, we had learned to forgive each other and come to respect and love each other deeply. In that conversation, we told each other that whatever differences we had in the past had long since been settled and all that remained was love. It\u2019s still the most important conversation I have ever had.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Thrilling news for space geeks like myself. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/09/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-from-deep-space-could-be-aliens\">Astronomers have detected Fast Radio Bursts</a> (FRBs) of energy from deep space. While some have gone for the more prosaic explanation that the FRBs emanate from natural phenomena such as black holes or super-dense neutron stars, I\u2019d much rather believe scientists, such as Prof Avi Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian centre for astrophysics, who reckon they could be evidence of advanced alien technology. </p> <p>Imagine the excitement of discovering the existence of extraterrestrial life. Help might be at hand for Earth after all. My one misgiving is that I only wish the aliens had chosen a better time. Checking in with us in 2019 and finding a British government and opposition lurching from crisis to crisis as they fail to come up with a Brexit solution, and a United States that is in shutdown over the president\u2019s absurd plan to build a $5bn shower door along the Mexican border, might make any even vaguely intelligent forms of extraterrestrial life have second thoughts about making further contacts. </p> <p>If only they could have come seven years earlier during the London Olympics, when Great Britain was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/london-2012-britain-super-saturday\">winning three track and field gold medals in an hour</a> and the crowds were booing George Osborne for his austerity economics.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>Talk about wishful thinking. Despite losing two votes in as many days and being totally clueless about how to resolve the immediate Brexit crisis, the government has come up with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/06/the-nhs-10-year-plan-what-we-already-know\">10-year plan for the NHS</a>.</p> <p>Predictably, its reception has been lukewarm as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/nhs-to-outline-plan-to-save-half-a-million-lives-over-next-decade\">most health professionals have reservations</a> about its funding and cost-saving models. What alarms me most is the move towards doctors having more interactions with their patients over Skype, as it seems to me there can only be two outcomes to these consultations that don\u2019t involve a face-to-face meeting. Either the doctor decides there is nothing wrong with you based on how you appear \u2013 unlikely in most cases, as Skype has the unfortunate effect of making most people look ill \u2013 or she tells you there is nothing more she can do for you and that you are best off getting your affairs in order. </p> <p>I\u2019m also less than convinced by the government\u2019s commitment to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/04/may-to-offer-increase-in-nhs-mental-health-support-for-under-18s\">improving mental health services</a>, which seem to mainly involve the establishment of a call centre.

It is from Tottenham Hotspur informing me that there have been further delays and that the earliest the football club will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/09/tottenham-new-stadium-mid-march-earliest-delay-football\">moving in to the new stadium will be the middle of March</a>. The reaction of every fan I know has been: \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when it happens.\u201d </p> <p>I\u2019m no expert on large building projects, other than that they invariably seem to overrun, but I\u2019d put money on the PR for the Spurs stadium delays winning an award for the worst campaign of the year. Almost every announcement the club has made has been both late and invariably couched in half-truths. </p> <p>Given that the stadium is now running eight months \u2013 and counting \u2013 late, you\u2019d have thought that Spurs would have had some inkling that they weren\u2019t going to be moving back to their north London home long before the season began in August. But the first supporters got to hear of any delay was about a month before the first home game was due to be played. </p> <p>Then we were told we would be definitely moving by the middle of September.

      "bodyText": "Monday I\u2019ve long since given up making any New Year resolutions. Partly because I\u2019ve already given up more things than it seems reasonable to ask of any person and my exercise habit has already resulted in one total knee replacement, but mainly because I can\u2019t bear the sense of inevitable despair that comes from having broken most of the promises I made to myself by the middle of January. Perhaps the best I can manage is an acceptance that I\u2019m never really going to be the person I would like to be. In this I have an ideal role model: Chris Grayling, our transport secretary, whose life goal appears to be to embrace his inner uselessness. It is one thing to first waste \u00a350,000 on failing to organise a lorry jam in Kent on a Monday morning and then another \u00a313.8m by awarding a ferry contract to a company that has no ferries, the mission statement of a pizza delivery company and directors whose main talent is corporate insolvency. But it takes a really special type of politician to make a virtue of all these failings in his responses to an urgent question in the House of Commons. Grayling\u2019s main line of defence was that no money had actually been wasted in proving to the EU we weren\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit because none of the \u00a313.8m would be spent if no ferries ran. He appeared to have no idea that the whole purpose of a contingency plan was for there to be a contingency. I\u2019m going to miss him when he\u2019s gone. Tuesday It\u2019s 20 years ago today that my father died. He was 77 years old. Scarcely a day goes by when I don\u2019t think of him. I miss his kindness, his humility, his gentleness and his love and my lasting regret is that he died younger than we would all have liked and that he never got to see my children grow up. He would have been so proud of the adults they have become. His death took us all by surprise \u2013 he went in to hospital for a heart bypass operation and never regained consciousness \u2013 though not perhaps him. I think he knew he was a lot more ill than he had let on and I vividly remember watching him at the last Christmas dinner we shared as a family 10 days or so before he went into hospital. He seemed to be both there and not there at the same time. Not so much because he was withdrawing from us all but more as if he wanted time and space for himself to take in every detail. An eternity of memories. I also wonder if I had some second sense he might not survive the operation. A month earlier I had driven down to see him and set the final record straight. Our relationship hadn\u2019t always been the easiest when I was growing up. He could be distant \u2013 the war had a lasting effect on him \u2013 and I was a difficult, disappointing and troubled child. But over the previous five or six years, we had learned to forgive each other and come to respect and love each other deeply. In that conversation, we told each other that whatever differences we had in the past had long since been settled and all that remained was love. It\u2019s still the most important conversation I have ever had. Wednesday Thrilling news for space geeks like myself. Astronomers have detected Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) of energy from deep space. While some have gone for the more prosaic explanation that the FRBs emanate from natural phenomena such as black holes or super-dense neutron stars, I\u2019d much rather believe scientists, such as Prof Avi Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian centre for astrophysics, who reckon they could be evidence of advanced alien technology. Imagine the excitement of discovering the existence of extraterrestrial life. Help might be at hand for Earth after all. My one misgiving is that I only wish the aliens had chosen a better time. Checking in with us in 2019 and finding a British government and opposition lurching from crisis to crisis as they fail to come up with a Brexit solution, and a United States that is in shutdown over the president\u2019s absurd plan to build a $5bn shower door along the Mexican border, might make any even vaguely intelligent forms of extraterrestrial life have second thoughts about making further contacts. If only they could have come seven years earlier during the London Olympics, when Great Britain was winning three track and field gold medals in an hour and the crowds were booing George Osborne for his austerity economics. Thursday Talk about wishful thinking. Despite losing two votes in as many days and being totally clueless about how to resolve the immediate Brexit crisis, the government has come up with a 10-year plan for the NHS. Predictably, its reception has been lukewarm as most health professionals have reservations about its funding and cost-saving models. What alarms me most is the move towards doctors having more interactions with their patients over Skype, as it seems to me there can only be two outcomes to these consultations that don\u2019t involve a face-to-face meeting. Either the doctor decides there is nothing wrong with you based on how you appear \u2013 unlikely in most cases, as Skype has the unfortunate effect of making most people look ill \u2013 or she tells you there is nothing more she can do for you and that you are best off getting your affairs in order. I\u2019m also less than convinced by the government\u2019s commitment to improving mental health services, which seem to mainly involve the establishment of a call centre. Press 1 if you are feeling suicidal. Press 2 if you think you are psychotic. Press 3 if you suffer from bipolar disorders. Press 4 if you are Chris Grayling. For all other mental health enquiries please Press 5 so you can be held in a queue for 45 minutes before someone gets round to answering your call. Friday One of the least unexpected emails of the new year arrives. It is from Tottenham Hotspur informing me that there have been further delays and that the earliest the football club will be moving in to the new stadium will be the middle of March. The reaction of every fan I know has been: \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when it happens.\u201d I\u2019m no expert on large building projects, other than that they invariably seem to overrun, but I\u2019d put money on the PR for the Spurs stadium delays winning an award for the worst campaign of the year. Almost every announcement the club has made has been both late and invariably couched in half-truths. Given that the stadium is now running eight months \u2013 and counting \u2013 late, you\u2019d have thought that Spurs would have had some inkling that they weren\u2019t going to be moving back to their north London home long before the season began in August. But the first supporters got to hear of any delay was about a month before the first home game was due to be played. Then we were told we would be definitely moving by the middle of September. Since then, several other promised deadlines have come and gone and now most fans don\u2019t expect to be in the ground before the start of the next season. Had we been told the truth right from the off many fans would have been more accepting of the situation, but the drip-drip of misinformation is taking its toll. Although the team has been performing well on the field, many season ticket holders have voted with their feet and stayed away. Part of the pleasure of going to home games is seeing familiar faces and having a collective moan about life. This year, I have felt like a stranger in my own seat. The atmosphere at the ground has often been terrible, as Tottenham at Wembley has become a tourist destination for people hoping to catch a Premier League game. I feel alienated and dissociated.

      "bodyText": "The Luopu County No 1 Vocational Skills Training Centre is hard to miss. It emerges suddenly, a huge campus towering over hectares of farmland. Outside the compound, surrounded by tall white concrete walls lined with barbed wire and surveillance cameras, a police car patrols while several guards carrying long batons stand watch. The centre, which straddles a highway, is bigger than most of the surrounding villages \u2013 about 170,000sq metres. A banner on one building says: \u201cSafeguard ethnic unity.\u201d Half a dozen people stand on the roadside, staring at the buildings. No one is willing to say exactly what this prison-like facility is or why they are waiting on its perimeter. \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d says an older woman. Another woman has come to see her brother but declines to say more. A young girl with her two brothers announces they have come to see their father. Her mother quickly hushes her. They are reluctant to talk because the building is not a formal prison or university, but an internment camp where Muslim minorities, mainly Uighurs, are sent against their will and without trial for months or even years. Researchers and residents say southern Xinjiang, where the Luopu County No 1 Vocational Skills Training Centre is located, has borne the brunt of the government\u2019s crackdown on Muslims because of its density of Uighurs and distance from major cities. \u201cWe have a saying in Hotan: If you go into a concentration camp in Luopu, you never come out,\u201d said Adil Awut*, from Hotan City, who is now living overseas. In December, the United Nations asked for direct access to the camps after a panel said it had received \u201ccredible reports\u201d that 1.1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs, Hui and other ethnic minorities had been detained. Beijing has aggressively defended its policies and sought to portray the camps as benign and Xinjiang, where outbursts of violence occurred in the 1990s and 2000s, as peaceful thanks to government efforts. A starkly different reality emerges in Luopu, also known as Lop county, where Guardian interviews with current and former residents and analysis of public documents reveal new details about the government\u2019s continuing campaign in one of the worst-affected areas of Xinjiang. Local authorities are expanding detention camps, increasing surveillance and policing, and co-opting residents through intimidation, force and financial incentives. The cost of \u2018stability control\u2019 In the past year, at least 10 buildings have been added to the No 1 Vocational Skills Training Centre, according to satellite imagery. Construction work on the camp, identified through company records found by the University of British Columbia student Shawn Zhang, was still being carried out when the Guardian visited in mid-December. Luopu, a sparsely populated rural county of about 280,000 that is almost entirely Uighur, is home to eight internment camps officially labelled \u201cvocational training centres\u201d, according to public budget documents seen by the Guardian. In 2018, officials expected to accommodate 12,000 \u201cstudents\u201d as well as another 2,100 inmates at another detention centre \u2013 a total of about 7% of the county\u2019s adult population, or 11% of the entire male population. Luopu county also planned to spend almost 300m yuan ($44m) on \u201cstability control\u201d, including almost $300,000 on a surveillance system to cover all mosques, and funding for almost 6,000 police officers to work in \u201cconvenient police stations\u201d and security checkpoints, as well as to patrol residential areas. The security measures and staggering costs underline China\u2019s commitment to its controversial policies in Xinjiang despite growing criticism. Across the province, domestic security expenses doubled in 2017 as the security campaign got under way, with spending on detention centres in counties with large concentrations of ethnic minorities quadrupling, according to Adrian Zenz, a researcher focused on China\u2019s ethnic policies. Budget overruns were common. Luopu county exceeded its budget by almost 300% in 2017, the highest increase in spending in all of Hotan prefecture. Yet, the buildup continues.

      "bodyText": "One of Japan\u2019s largest banks has blamed Brexit for its decision to move part of its business to Amsterdam, 24 hours after Theresa May sought to enlist the Japanese prime minister in the fight to save her deal with the EU. Norinchukin bank announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the Dutch capital, a move that critics of the prime minister\u2019s deal cited as evidence that both a no-deal Brexit and her deal were likely to damage the UK economy. The bank said in its statement on Friday morning that the decision had been made \u201cin response to the planned withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and other changes to the economic environment in Europe\u201d. It added that \u201cthe purpose of this establishment is to strengthen \u2026 business in Europe\u201d, a sign that the initial move is likely to be followed by a commensurate downgrading of its presence in London. Founded in 1923, Norinchukin is one of the 40 largest banks in the world, with a balance sheet total of \u20ac804bn. It manages about \u20ac400bn in investments for Japanese clients. Its business in London mainly works as an asset manager investing in bonds, securities, private equity and real estate. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration on the future relationship, firms in the City of London will lose their \u201cpassporting rights\u201d, which allow them to offer services across the EU from London, The Dutch newspaper the FD reported the news by claiming that \u201cAmsterdam will soon be a bank richer again\u201d. The chairman of the bank\u2019s board, Kazuto Oku, had previously suggested he wanted to diversify the range of Norinchukin\u2019s activities in Europe, and that the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU stood in the way of London benefiting. In response, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency hailed the \u201cgood news that Norinchukin has chosen to continue to focus on the European financial market from the Netherlands\u201d. \u201cThe choice for our country confirms our status as a business centre in Europe,\u201d the agency added. The UK has traditionally been seen as the gateway to Europe for major Japanese firms but last February, following a meeting with May in Downing Street, the country\u2019s ambassador, Koji Tsuruoka, was frank that a hit to the British economy and fresh barriers to trade would push his compatriots out of the country. Japan\u2019s biggest bank, the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) filed a licence to set up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam in 2017, citing the need to continue to serve customers in the EU after Brexit, having already shifted its main EU HQ for corporate and retail banking to the Dutch capital. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, backed May by stating that it was \u201cthe wish of the whole world\u201d to see Britain secure an agreement with the EU. Speaking in Downing Street, Abe said Japan offered total support to May and that Japanese companies employing 150,000 people in the UK would value the stability. The withdrawal agreement provides for a 21-month transition period with a possible two-year extension, during which the UK will stay in the single market and customs union but without a say in any of the EU\u2019s decision-making institutions. \u201cJapan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and prime minister May, which provides for transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country,\u201d Abe said. The Japanese leader\u2019s comments appeared to be an attempt at damage limitation rather than an endorsement of the UK\u2019s position outside the EU after 29 March. During the referendum campaign, Abe said a vote for leave would make the UK a less attractive country in which to invest.",

      "bodyText": "Earlier this week, astronomers announced that they had observed repeated bursts of radio waves coming from deep space, with some experts suggesting this could be evidence of alien life. Is this it? Could extraterrestrials finally be trying to contact us? I hope not. Let me provide an analogy, and I think you\u2019ll see what I mean. A few years ago I was celebrating landing a new job. After a long string of terrible events, this was to be a glorious new chapter in my life. I rang my girlfriend and told her I had a surprise for her when she got home. I started to cook a celebratory curry. At some point I forgot that I had just been chopping chillies and went to the toilet without washing my hands first. This involved the transfer of chilli to what a medical professional would later describe as the remains of my genitals. Drunk on success and alcohol, I\u2019d made a poor decision, and now my penis and balls were on fire. The next bad decision came moments later, when I remembered that yoghurt helps cool down your mouth when you\u2019ve been eating hot food. I was urgently easing the affected area into a family-sized tub of natural yoghurt when my girlfriend and several of her colleagues walked in. This was supposed to be my night of triumph, and now here was my girlfriend giving me that withering \u201cI left you alone for 10 minutes, why are your balls in the Yeo Valley\u201d look. Reader, that is what it would be like for humanity if aliens, thus far the aloof bastards of the universe, chose the current moment to get \u201cchatty\u201d. There\u2019s Brexit, there\u2019s Trump, there\u2019s Ed Sheeran. Couldn\u2019t they have shown up during the 2012 Olympics or when Britpop was at its height? Better yet, when Shrek 2 was first released. Apparently not. They want a chinwag with humanity right when we\u2019ve collectively decided to dip our testicles in the M\u00fcller Light. Humanity is at its lowest, most embarrassing ebb. Sure, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got a brilliant track record. War. Pollution. Finding a new species of exotic animal and twatting it to death on the offchance that it\u2019s tasty. But right now we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019ve reviewed all those past mistakes, learned from them, and decided to do a live-action remake of every last pratfall on humanity\u2019s blooper reel. We\u2019re a species that has realised we\u2019re going to die of global warming \u2013 and have decided to burn the old fossil fuels more than ever. Radio waves take time to travel through space, I understand. Who knows, maybe watchful aliens did see us turn a corner during the 1950s and decided to send out a message of friendship, not realising that the message would be answered 70 years later by President Trump: a man we can\u2019t trust not to try and phone-bang the aliens during first contact. Here\u2019s hoping those mysterious bursts are just noise. Even so, we need to figure a way out of our various messes pronto, before aliens do contact us for real.

      "body": "<p>It has been an improbable pipe dream for the people of Thailand in recent years but finally, it seems, the country is set to go to the polls. </p> <p>In just under two months, according to the country\u2019s election commission, Thais will be given the chance to exercise their democratic right for the first time since elections in 2014 were invalidated. The scheduled vote on 24 February follows four years of oppressive and undemocratic rule by a military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), which took power in a bloodless coup in 2014.</p> <p>Many Thais remain sceptical that the long-awaited election \u2013 pushed back multiple times by the military junta on the dubious pretext that the country was not ready \u2013 will even happen, let alone do much to change the political structure of the country. Thailand\u2019s notoriously heavy-handed laws around freedom of speech will also still be in place.</p> <p>But most are in agreement that any legitimacy the junta once claimed to rule Thailand without a democratic mandate has long since run out.</p> <p>\u201cThis will not be a fair election,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cBut it is a necessary first step for Thailand to regain some balance. There is a long way to go yet.\u201d</p> <p>Due to a rewriting of the whole Thai political system since the last valid election in 2011, determining how the election will play out is not easy but one thing is for certain: this will not be a vote that releases Thailand from the clutches of military rule. Since 1932, Thailand has endured 13 successful military coups as well as seven attempted coups, more than any other country in the world.</p> <p>Indeed, many fear that the election system will be so manipulated by the junta that 24 February will simply see the military returned to power through proxy political parties such as the Palang Pracharat party, recently formed by NCPO members, or will end up with Prayuth Chan-ocha, the incumbent prime minister under the military regime, selected to the role again.</p> <p>\u201cThe military are just making this election up as they go along,\u201d said Duncan McCargo, a political science professor at the University of Leeds specialising in south-east Asia. \u201cBut this time round the presence of an explicitly pro-military party, which we did not see in the last election, the long gap since the last competitive election, the continued restrictions on political activity and campaigning, and all kinds of built-in advantages to the junta all come together to make this election much harder to predict, and much less openly competitive than the last election.\u201d</p> <p>As McCargo put it, \u201cthe rules of the game have been rigged\u201d, and certainly there are several factors skewing the whole electoral process in favour of the military. Over the past four years under its rule, all political campaigning, demonstrations and political parties have been suppressed \u2013 parties were only allowed to re-register in May. This has crippled the main opposition anti-military party, Pheu Thai, and prevented the emergence of other grassroots parties since 2014.</p> <p>Even more crucially, there is the new constitution, drawn up by the NCPO and passed by referendum in 2017, which locks in military power and was written with the specific intention of making it very difficult for an opposition party such as Pheu Thai to form a majority government again. According to the constitution, all 250 seats in the Thai senate are either directly selected by the military or chosen by a committee appointed by the military, and so it is only the lower parliamentary house, with 500 MPs, that is democratically elected. But even that has its problems.</p> <p>\u201cI see the constitution as the biggest source of political ailments and social grievances in Thailand,\u201d said Thitinan. \u201cIt is totally crooked and it was written to perpetuate military power in politics. The senate is a junta chamber and in the lower house they have obliterated the party system to make it entirely rigged for the military.\u201d</p> <p>The new rules would make it very possible for Prayuth to be brought back in as prime minister, even if the military political parties do not win a majority. According to the constitution, the prime minister is to be selected from a list after the election by a \u201cjoint session\u201d of both senate and the lower house MPs.

      "bodyText": "It has been an improbable pipe dream for the people of Thailand in recent years but finally, it seems, the country is set to go to the polls. In just under two months, according to the country\u2019s election commission, Thais will be given the chance to exercise their democratic right for the first time since elections in 2014 were invalidated. The scheduled vote on 24 February follows four years of oppressive and undemocratic rule by a military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), which took power in a bloodless coup in 2014. Many Thais remain sceptical that the long-awaited election \u2013 pushed back multiple times by the military junta on the dubious pretext that the country was not ready \u2013 will even happen, let alone do much to change the political structure of the country. Thailand\u2019s notoriously heavy-handed laws around freedom of speech will also still be in place. But most are in agreement that any legitimacy the junta once claimed to rule Thailand without a democratic mandate has long since run out. \u201cThis will not be a fair election,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cBut it is a necessary first step for Thailand to regain some balance. There is a long way to go yet.\u201d Due to a rewriting of the whole Thai political system since the last valid election in 2011, determining how the election will play out is not easy but one thing is for certain: this will not be a vote that releases Thailand from the clutches of military rule. Since 1932, Thailand has endured 13 successful military coups as well as seven attempted coups, more than any other country in the world. Indeed, many fear that the election system will be so manipulated by the junta that 24 February will simply see the military returned to power through proxy political parties such as the Palang Pracharat party, recently formed by NCPO members, or will end up with Prayuth Chan-ocha, the incumbent prime minister under the military regime, selected to the role again. \u201cThe military are just making this election up as they go along,\u201d said Duncan McCargo, a political science professor at the University of Leeds specialising in south-east Asia. \u201cBut this time round the presence of an explicitly pro-military party, which we did not see in the last election, the long gap since the last competitive election, the continued restrictions on political activity and campaigning, and all kinds of built-in advantages to the junta all come together to make this election much harder to predict, and much less openly competitive than the last election.\u201d As McCargo put it, \u201cthe rules of the game have been rigged\u201d, and certainly there are several factors skewing the whole electoral process in favour of the military. Over the past four years under its rule, all political campaigning, demonstrations and political parties have been suppressed \u2013 parties were only allowed to re-register in May. This has crippled the main opposition anti-military party, Pheu Thai, and prevented the emergence of other grassroots parties since 2014. Even more crucially, there is the new constitution, drawn up by the NCPO and passed by referendum in 2017, which locks in military power and was written with the specific intention of making it very difficult for an opposition party such as Pheu Thai to form a majority government again. According to the constitution, all 250 seats in the Thai senate are either directly selected by the military or chosen by a committee appointed by the military, and so it is only the lower parliamentary house, with 500 MPs, that is democratically elected. But even that has its problems. \u201cI see the constitution as the biggest source of political ailments and social grievances in Thailand,\u201d said Thitinan. \u201cIt is totally crooked and it was written to perpetuate military power in politics. The senate is a junta chamber and in the lower house they have obliterated the party system to make it entirely rigged for the military.\u201d The new rules would make it very possible for Prayuth to be brought back in as prime minister, even if the military political parties do not win a majority. According to the constitution, the prime minister is to be selected from a list after the election by a \u201cjoint session\u201d of both senate and the lower house MPs. With all the senate already pro-military, he would need to club together 126 MPs in the lower house to win \u2013 just a quarter of the seats. Nonetheless, it still unclear whether the most conservative and pro-royalist party, the Democrat party \u2013 who have not won an election in decades but back in 2014 helped usher in the military coup \u2013 will remain loyal to the junta. For observers, the scenario of Prayuth leading a minority coalition government could be highly problematic, not only because it would perpetuate the legacy of junta rule. \u201cLegislation would be in gridlock and the government would be highly unstable,\u201d said Thitinan. The biggest competitor to the military remains the Pheu Thai party, which was created by the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Despite being ousted in a military coup in 2006 and forced into exile, Thaksin still looms large over Thai politics, and to this day Thailand is sharply divided down pro-Thaksin and anti-Thaksin lines. Polling by Pheu Thai and the military\u2019s intelligence wing reportedly suggests Pheu Thai still has the most support across Thailand, one of the many reasons cited for the military postponing the election for so long. However, Pheu Thai has failed to find a leader who can unite the party and draw the same loyalty as Thaksin. From January, parties will finally be allowed to campaign, though questions remain over the extent to which the junta will allow the opposition to freely spread its message. One party with a more progressive agenda is the Commoner party, led by the civil rights and environmental activist Lertsak Kamkongsak, which is still waiting to hear whether the military will allow it to register. Lertsak was pessimistic about the election but said it was important to participate. \u201cThe whole system is messed up and totally against parties,\u201d he said. \u201cPrayuth will be the next prime minister for sure and this election will lead to the military government, but it won\u2019t be completely under their control. I think they will last one to two years, and then there will be another election again.\u201d He added: \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s going to be chaos.

      "body": "<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\">Bake Off</a>, aquafaba has<strong> </strong>hit the mainstream.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s an ingredient I rely on when baking for vegans. Aquafaba (Italian for \u201cbean water\u201d) is the liquid left over from cooking legumes and pulses, most often chickpeas. When whipped, it magically transforms into a meringue-like consistency. It can be used in place of eggs for anything from a scone to a Victoria sponge. It also makes logic-defying meringues and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/17/vegan-aquafaba-recipe-bean-water-recipe-food-waste-tom-hunt\">amazing mayonnaise</a>.</p> <h2>Aquafaba meringues with caramel and citrus (pictured above)</h2> <p>These are a revelation: egg-free meringues that have a perfect texture and chew. Ideally this would be done in a stand mixer (because they\u2019re the most powerful), but an electric hand whisk will do. This recipe will work with any fruit and dairy-free cream, yoghurt or creme fraiche.</p> <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Cool <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Makes <strong>10\u201312 large meringues</strong></p> <p><strong>Flavourless oil</strong> (such as groundnut)<br><strong>1 x 400g tin chickpeas</strong><br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>150g golden caster sugar</strong><br><strong>1 \u00bd t</strong><strong>sp cream of tartar</strong><br><strong>Seeds from 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla paste</strong></p> <p>For the caramel and citrus<br><strong>2 tangerines, mandarins or satsumas</strong><br><strong>1 yellow grapefruit</strong><br><strong>100g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>Whipped coconut cream mixed with vanilla paste</strong>, to serve</p> <p>Heat the oven to 110C (90C fan)/230F/gas \u00bc. Line two baking trays with nonstick baking paper and rub with a tiny drop of oil. Drain the chickpeas and measure out 150ml of chickpea water (aquafaba). Put the chickpeas in the fridge or freezer to use later. Pour the aquafaba into the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl), add a pinch of salt and whisk on a high speed until white and very stiff.</p> <p>In a bowl, combine the sugar and cream of tartar. Turn down the mixer speed a little, then add the sugar to the aquafaba one tablespoon at a time, making sure that each has dissolved before you add the next (you can check this by rubbing a little of the mixture between your fingers \u2013 if it\u2019s grainy, keep going). Add the vanilla, then whisk on high for another couple of minutes. The meringue should now be looking very thick and glossy.</p> <p>Spoon 10\u201312 piles of the meringue mixture on to the baking trays, making sure they have a little space to spread. Bake for two hours until crisp on the outside, turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside to cool completely \u2013 do not open the door while the meringues are cooking or cooling. The meringues will keep for two to three days in a sealed container.</p> <p>Cut the citrus into segments or slices using a serrated knife. Catch any juice in a bowl and reserve. To make the caramel, heat the sugar in a heavy-based pan over a medium flame. Shake the pan so the sugar levels out. Allow the heat to melt the sugar and, gently swirling it (don\u2019t stir), turn up the heat and cook until the sugar turns a deep golden. Remove from the heat and add a little tangerine zest.</p> <p>Serve the meringues with the whipped cream, drizzle with the caramel, and top with the citrus pieces and a dash of the reserved juice.</p> <h2>How to use aquafaba in baking</h2> <p>Make sure it\u2019s thick enough. If you\u2019re using tinned chickpeas, the chances are it will be, but it can vary from brand to brand. If you\u2019re cooking your pulses from scratch, make sure you discard the soaking water and always cook your beans in fresh water. Cook and cool the beans, then drain, reserving the precious liquid. If the liquid isn\u2019t gloopy, reduce it by about a quarter. Make sure your aquafaba is well sieved; you don\u2019t want to end up with pieces of chickpea in your meringue.</p> <p>Rules of thumb are: one tablespoon aquafaba = one yolk; two tablespoons = one white; three tablespoons = a whole egg.</p> <p>So, in a cake that calls for three eggs, you would use nine tablespoons (or 135ml) of aquafaba. One 400g tin of beans will yield around 150ml of aquafaba.</p> <p>Aquafaba always needs to be whisked before being added to cakes. Ideally use a stand mixer or electric whisk. Put in a scrupulously clean bowl, and whisk, just as you would with egg white to make meringue. The aquafaba is ready to use when it\u2019s holding its own and forming soft peaks with the whisk.</p> <h2>Aquafaba pancakes with roast squash, pickled onions, chilli and thyme oil</h2> <p>This base can be used for sweet or savoury pancakes. They are a great basic pancake for vegans \u2013 or anyone with a can of chickpeas. I\u2019ve gone with a savoury squash and herb oil topping here, turning them into a proper dinner. You could even roast the leftover chickpeas with the squash if you\u2019d like to include them in the recipe. To take them down a sweet route, stew some apple or pear, and serve with coconut yoghurt, maple syrup and toasted nuts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d241aeadf91921d48a99e5201d712086ad5d8534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d241aeadf91921d48a99e5201d712086ad5d8534/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Jones' aquafaba pancakes with roast squash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puffed and golden: Anna Jones\u2019 aquafaba pancakes with roast squash</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian.

      "body": "<p>Desperate refugees risking their lives crossing the Channel in small boats in the dead of night; extreme temperatures forcing people to flee their homes; politicians inciting a fear of others, and railing against traitors who \u201cwant us to be overrun, to be washed away\u201d. These are not recent news stories, but a glimpse of a possible era after climate catastrophe, or the \u201cChange\u201d as it is known in one of the first big novels of the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/jan/29/observer-profile-john-lanchester\" title=\"\">John Lanchester</a>\u2019s <em>The Wall</em>. Lanchester imagines a moment in the future when rising sea levels mean there isn\u2019t a single beach left on the planet, those countries that remain habitable have become fortresses and the young feel bitterly betrayed by the previous generation because of the destroyed world they have inherited. We are barely into 2019 and the future already seems terrifyingly bleak.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t crack my knuckles and sit down to write a novel about now. I was halfway through another novel. I still am,\u201d Lanchester explains, almost apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s not the future, but it\u2019s a version of a future, and it feels a lot like a version of the future that we are heading for.\u201d</p> <p>With the emphasis on borders, fear of invasion and lines such as: \u201cThis country is the best in the world\u201d, and, of course, the wall itself \u2013 \u201ca long, low concrete monster\u201d \u2013 it is hard not to read the novel as a riff on Brexit and the US under Trump, as well as a chilling ecological dystopia. Post-2016, a wall is surely shorthand for ugly political and ideological division (as with the grisly punishment wall in Margaret Atwood\u2019s <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em><em>, </em>written in Berlin in 1984). \u201cOne of the things about the wall in the book is that it is not a metaphor for anything else,\u201d the author insists. \u201cWe had this period when walls were coming down around the world and now, just as an empirical fact, they are springing up all over the place.\u201d And he hasn\u2019t been following Brexit obsessively \u2013 \u201ca gigantic waste of emotional energy. Danny Dyer seems like a deathless genius of political science for asking: \u2018What is it?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The book came more quickly than others. It was more than a metaphor. It was an image, a country with a wall round it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lanchester is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated essayists, with a canny journalistic instinct as a novelist, from his award-winning 1996 debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/john-banville-john-lanchester-the-debt-to-pleasure\" title=\"\">The Debt to Pleasure</a></em>, a balsamic-black foodie satire written at a moment of peak gastro-porn during a stint as the Observer\u2019s restaurant critic, to his last novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/24/capital-john-lanchester-review\" title=\"\">Capital</a></em>, a Dickensian saga of the London property bubble, published in 2012. He distinguishes his non-fiction and fiction in terms of subjects that interest him, \u201cthings happening in the world\u201d and \u201cthe things that won\u2019t leave you alone\u201d. For novels, he says: \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of psychic charge, there\u2019s something unresolved, that\u2019s why the images keep coming back.\u201d And for this, his fifth, the image was of a person standing guard on a wall. It initially came to him in the form of a recurring dream. The author tells himself \u201csort of half-conscious\u201d stories to help get to sleep: \u201cIt works, by the way, I sleep really well.\u201d The dream first began in 2016 \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t quite go away. Then I started thinking about who the person was and what the world was. It didn\u2019t exactly write itself but it came much more quickly than my other books,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was much more than a metaphor. It was an image, a country with a wall round it.\u201d</p> <p>The son of a South African-born banker and an Irish mother (the troubling story of his parents\u2019 marriage is affectingly recounted in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\" title=\"\">Family Romance</a></em>, 2007), Lanchester describes himself as \u201ca well-disguised semi-immigrant\u201d; he was born in Germany in 1962; had lived in seven different countries by the time he was four; and spent much of his childhood in Hong Kong (the inspiration for his 2002 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/29/fiction.featuresreviews\" title=\"\">Fragrant Harbour</a></em>). For him, the image of the wall is a \u201ccomforting\u201d rather than a disturbing one. Growing up, he was very aware that \u201cHong Kong was safe and that just over the border there was a place where people were desperate to escape from, and that people died trying to get over the border, people drowned swimming. There was a street called Boundary Street, and if you got to Boundary Street you could stay, you weren\u2019t repatriated. For a child\u2019s imagination there was something very vivid about that, and the thing which stuck with me is that you are in the place that is safe.\u201d For this reason, he struggles to understand fears over immigration, of \u201cbeing swamped or overrun or threatened in some way. If people want to get to the place where you are, that means you are in a safe place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85b9220bbd1cae3934e991fc9406e2315d850aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85b9220bbd1cae3934e991fc9406e2315d850aec/0_54_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Jones Rachael Stirling 2015 BBC  Capital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life in the bubble \u2026 Toby Jones and Rachael Stirling in the 2015 BBC adaptation of <em>Capital.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Kudos/Hal Shinnie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Witty and softly spoken, he has been described as resembling \u201can off-duty bank manager\u201d, partly because he is unafraid of nerdy subjects (only Lanchester could make the Vix Index of market volatility interesting, as he did in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/14/how-to-speak-money-review-john-lanchester-language-of-lucre-financial-jargon\" title=\"\">How to Speak Money</a></em>) so that there are few genres he hasn\u2019t tackled. \u201cYou make me sound like Meryl Streep: \u2018She does Polish, she does Jewish, she does Wasp, she does funny!\u2019\u201d he grumbles.</p> <p>Although he seems too rooted in the here and now, too interested in the intricacies of systems from the London tube to the FTSE, to contemplate science fiction, it should be no surprise that he has now taken on the most urgent issue of our times in this slim yet devastating work of speculative fiction. He chafes slightly at the label, recalling JG Ballard asking him not to mention SF in an interview he was writing, \u201cbecause he felt you automatically lose half the readers\u201d. While that has undoubtedly changed, he argues that, as a subject, global warming is already scientific fact. If any novelist is going to make real the nightmare scenarios we are storing up, it is Lanchester. He began <em>Capital</em> in 2006, after all. \u201cAny fool could see that there was a crash coming,\u201d he says now. Is there going to be another recession? \u201cYes, I\u2019d have thought so, but heaven only knows what form it will take.\u201d</p> <p>Quoting the German economist Rudi Dornbusch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/21/john-lanchester-capital-satire-london-boom-years-adapted-tv\" title=\"\">a Guardian piece</a> on the TV adaptation of <em>Capital</em> in 2015, Lanchester wrote: \u201cIn economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.\u201d Substitute the environment for economics and the consequences are catastrophic.</p> <p>\u201cI think, unfortunately, that is the way that change happens,\u201d Lanchester says. \u201cThere\u2019s a bitter truth in Hemingway\u2019s <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. \u2018How did you go broke?\u2019 \u2018Two ways. Gradually then suddenly.\u2019 Lots of things happen like that.\u201d</p> <p>He is deliberately opaque about the timeframe in which <em>The Wall</em> is set: \u201cThere are all sorts of feedback effects of climate, which means we don\u2019t know how fast it is going to happen.\u201d Researching an essay for the London Review of Books back in 2007 (which begins by anticipating the radical civil disobedience of groups such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/10/extinction-rebellion-goes-global-international-civil-disobedience-climate-talks-poland\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>), he was haunted by the idea of \u201cclimate departure\u201d\u2013 a point in the future when the coldest average day \u201cis warmer than the warmest average day in the past\u201d, he summarises. As he says, it\u2019s best not to think about it too hard. But the powerful \u201cpsychological resistance\u201d and \u201cdenial\u201d that he identified as characterising our response to climate change are an indulgence no longer available to us, as the extreme weather, not to mention the dire warnings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">IPCC report</a>, last year made clear.</p> <p>He has two children, now 20 and 16, with his wife the writer Miranda Carter, and is acutely aware of the legacy we are leaving behind. \u201cIt will be wonderful for it not to be the thing that fundamentally alters the texture of human existence, but the evidence doesn\u2019t suggest that,\u201d he says. \u201cJust ask a gardener. I was talking to a wine person about English grapes. Part of the reason we have all this sparkling wine now is that 30 years ago they were harvesting champagne in mid-to-late October, now it\u2019s in August. That\u2019s not a metaphor for anything.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>People have always been frightened about\u00a0the end of\u00a0the world \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of who we are</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a commonplace that all dystopias are versions of the present, and Lanchester quotes William Gibson\u2019s famous line: \u201cThe future is already here \u2013 it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u201d In the novel, a young \u201cDefender\u201d reflects on the old world: \u201cThe produce you could get before the Change,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything, all the time. Tomatoes and fruits, hams from you name it, meat whenever you liked it, all of it all the year around \u2026 it\u2019s like science fiction, where they have a machine that just makes stuff \u2026 Where does it all end? I mean, the idea is amazing ... and yet it\u2019s weird and it\u2019s wrong too.\u201d</p> <p>Lanchester came of age in the early 1980s, when \u201cthings were pretty grim\u201d. \u201cPeople have always been frightened about the end of the world \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of who we are,\u201d he says, recalling how as a teenager the threat of nuclear war created similar feelings of individual impotence and impending doom. But what makes the current moment \u201cparticularly desperate\u201d, he believes, \u201cis the absence of a will to do anything about it \u2026 Trump gives a sort of autonomy for the forces that are actively lying.\u201d</p> <p>Along with our capacity for \u201cselective amnesia\u201d, as a species \u201cwe have an amazing talent for being oblivious, we are really, really good at it,\u201d he marvels. \u201cMaybe \u2026 how unbearable it is if you are not. Because the alternative is back on the smartphones and the constant firehose of bad news. I\u2019m not sure we innately have the tools to deal with that. We haven\u2019t worked out what to do about these,\u201d he says picking up my mobile as if it had just dropped from space.</p> <p>The novel\u2019s blockbuster ending is appropriately uncertain. Is there any room for hope? As he says, climate change is a story in which we deeply don\u2019t want to believe. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he replies, rather crushingly. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a Live Aid style reunification concert five years later.\u201d</p> <p>How do you follow a novel about the destruction of the planet as we know it? \u201cIf history shows us anything, it\u2019s a school for wizards, or a novel about bunny rabbits or something.\u201d</p> <p>While a Hogwarts for rabbits seems unlikely, his next novel is bound to be something completely different. He likes to use a metaphor of a hall with a series of rooms off it to describe the writing process: \u201cYou know there\u2019s something in that room, you are attracted by it but frightened at the same time. You stay in the room for as long as it takes to write it, it\u2019s a day-in, day-out thing. And then at the end of it, that door\u2019s opened out. Why would you go back?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/09/the-wall-is-coming-how-donald-trump-became-the-worlds-worst-game-of-thrones-fan\">The wall is coming: Trump becomes world's worst Game of Thrones fan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has a strict word count per day: 500 for fiction, 1,000 for non-fiction and 1,500 for journalism. And he never fails to hit it. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he quavers in his best Alan Bennett impression, \u201cyou feel ill if you don\u2019t!\u201d (as Bennett once told him when asked how he did it). \u201cIt\u2019s true. Then what are you for? That\u2019s your job.\u201d (Although, reassuringly, he \u201cnot infrequently\u201d goes back to bed of a morning, following Hilary Mantel\u2019s advice that it\u2019s crucial to get enough sleep before writing. \u201cIf I start the day too early, I can\u2019t.\u201d) And when he finally clocks off, he\u2019s a big fan of the TV box set: writers can only hope their novels are \u201cas well written as very good telly\u201d, he says.</p> <p>He plans to return to the novel abandoned before <em>The Wall</em>, \u201cbut it\u2019s been putting up quite a good fight\u201d. He also wants to complete a collection of short stories, having recently had one, the first he has written,<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/signal-john-lanchester\" title=\"\"> published in the New Yorker</a>. \u201cSeriously! I don\u2019t want to boast but I was very proud of that,\u201d he admits endearingly. \u201cThere are not many things that happen in your mid 50s that give you a genuine rush.\u201d</p> <p>For the immediate future, he hopes 2019 \u201cis easier on all of us than the last couple of years\u201d. And in the long term? \u201cMy main ambition, my main hope for the book, is that I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Wall is published by Faber on 17 January.

Lanchester imagines a moment in the future when rising sea levels mean there isn\u2019t a single beach left on the planet, those countries that remain habitable have become fortresses and the young feel bitterly betrayed by the previous generation because of the destroyed world they have inherited. We are barely into 2019 and the future already seems terrifyingly bleak. \u201cI didn\u2019t crack my knuckles and sit down to write a novel about now. I was halfway through another novel. I still am,\u201d Lanchester explains, almost apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s not the future, but it\u2019s a version of a future, and it feels a lot like a version of the future that we are heading for.\u201d With the emphasis on borders, fear of invasion and lines such as: \u201cThis country is the best in the world\u201d, and, of course, the wall itself \u2013 \u201ca long, low concrete monster\u201d \u2013 it is hard not to read the novel as a riff on Brexit and the US under Trump, as well as a chilling ecological dystopia. Post-2016, a wall is surely shorthand for ugly political and ideological division (as with the grisly punishment wall in Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, written in Berlin in 1984). \u201cOne of the things about the wall in the book is that it is not a metaphor for anything else,\u201d the author insists. \u201cWe had this period when walls were coming down around the world and now, just as an empirical fact, they are springing up all over the place.\u201d And he hasn\u2019t been following Brexit obsessively \u2013 \u201ca gigantic waste of emotional energy. Danny Dyer seems like a deathless genius of political science for asking: \u2018What is it?\u2019\u201d Lanchester is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated essayists, with a canny journalistic instinct as a novelist, from his award-winning 1996 debut The Debt to Pleasure, a balsamic-black foodie satire written at a moment of peak gastro-porn during a stint as the Observer\u2019s restaurant critic, to his last novel Capital, a Dickensian saga of the London property bubble, published in 2012. He distinguishes his non-fiction and fiction in terms of subjects that interest him, \u201cthings happening in the world\u201d and \u201cthe things that won\u2019t leave you alone\u201d. For novels, he says: \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of psychic charge, there\u2019s something unresolved, that\u2019s why the images keep coming back.\u201d And for this, his fifth, the image was of a person standing guard on a wall. It initially came to him in the form of a recurring dream. The author tells himself \u201csort of half-conscious\u201d stories to help get to sleep: \u201cIt works, by the way, I sleep really well.\u201d The dream first began in 2016 \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t quite go away. Then I started thinking about who the person was and what the world was. It didn\u2019t exactly write itself but it came much more quickly than my other books,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was much more than a metaphor. It was an image, a country with a wall round it.\u201d The son of a South African-born banker and an Irish mother (the troubling story of his parents\u2019 marriage is affectingly recounted in Family Romance, 2007), Lanchester describes himself as \u201ca well-disguised semi-immigrant\u201d; he was born in Germany in 1962; had lived in seven different countries by the time he was four; and spent much of his childhood in Hong Kong (the inspiration for his 2002 novel Fragrant Harbour). For him, the image of the wall is a \u201ccomforting\u201d rather than a disturbing one. Growing up, he was very aware that \u201cHong Kong was safe and that just over the border there was a place where people were desperate to escape from, and that people died trying to get over the border, people drowned swimming. There was a street called Boundary Street, and if you got to Boundary Street you could stay, you weren\u2019t repatriated. For a child\u2019s imagination there was something very vivid about that, and the thing which stuck with me is that you are in the place that is safe.\u201d For this reason, he struggles to understand fears over immigration, of \u201cbeing swamped or overrun or threatened in some way. If people want to get to the place where you are, that means you are in a safe place.\u201d Witty and softly spoken, he has been described as resembling \u201can off-duty bank manager\u201d, partly because he is unafraid of nerdy subjects (only Lanchester could make the Vix Index of market volatility interesting, as he did in How to Speak Money) so that there are few genres he hasn\u2019t tackled. \u201cYou make me sound like Meryl Streep: \u2018She does Polish, she does Jewish, she does Wasp, she does funny!\u2019\u201d he grumbles. Although he seems too rooted in the here and now, too interested in the intricacies of systems from the London tube to the FTSE, to contemplate science fiction, it should be no surprise that he has now taken on the most urgent issue of our times in this slim yet devastating work of speculative fiction. He chafes slightly at the label, recalling JG Ballard asking him not to mention SF in an interview he was writing, \u201cbecause he felt you automatically lose half the readers\u201d. While that has undoubtedly changed, he argues that, as a subject, global warming is already scientific fact. If any novelist is going to make real the nightmare scenarios we are storing up, it is Lanchester. He began Capital in 2006, after all. \u201cAny fool could see that there was a crash coming,\u201d he says now. Is there going to be another recession? \u201cYes, I\u2019d have thought so, but heaven only knows what form it will take.\u201d Quoting the German economist Rudi Dornbusch in a Guardian piece on the TV adaptation of Capital in 2015, Lanchester wrote: \u201cIn economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.\u201d Substitute the environment for economics and the consequences are catastrophic. \u201cI think, unfortunately, that is the way that change happens,\u201d Lanchester says. \u201cThere\u2019s a bitter truth in Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises. \u2018How did you go broke?\u2019 \u2018Two ways. Gradually then suddenly.\u2019 Lots of things happen like that.\u201d He is deliberately opaque about the timeframe in which The Wall is set: \u201cThere are all sorts of feedback effects of climate, which means we don\u2019t know how fast it is going to happen.\u201d Researching an essay for the London Review of Books back in 2007 (which begins by anticipating the radical civil disobedience of groups such as Extinction Rebellion), he was haunted by the idea of \u201cclimate departure\u201d\u2013 a point in the future when the coldest average day \u201cis warmer than the warmest average day in the past\u201d, he summarises. As he says, it\u2019s best not to think about it too hard. But the powerful \u201cpsychological resistance\u201d and \u201cdenial\u201d that he identified as characterising our response to climate change are an indulgence no longer available to us, as the extreme weather, not to mention the dire warnings of the IPCC report, last year made clear. He has two children, now 20 and 16, with his wife the writer Miranda Carter, and is acutely aware of the legacy we are leaving behind. \u201cIt will be wonderful for it not to be the thing that fundamentally alters the texture of human existence, but the evidence doesn\u2019t suggest that,\u201d he says. \u201cJust ask a gardener. I was talking to a wine person about English grapes. Part of the reason we have all this sparkling wine now is that 30 years ago they were harvesting champagne in mid-to-late October, now it\u2019s in August. That\u2019s not a metaphor for anything.\u201d It is a commonplace that all dystopias are versions of the present, and Lanchester quotes William Gibson\u2019s famous line: \u201cThe future is already here \u2013 it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u201d In the novel, a young \u201cDefender\u201d reflects on the old world: \u201cThe produce you could get before the Change,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything, all the time. Tomatoes and fruits, hams from you name it, meat whenever you liked it, all of it all the year around \u2026 it\u2019s like science fiction, where they have a machine that just makes stuff \u2026 Where does it all end? I mean, the idea is amazing ... and yet it\u2019s weird and it\u2019s wrong too.\u201d Lanchester came of age in the early 1980s, when \u201cthings were pretty grim\u201d. \u201cPeople have always been frightened about the end of the world \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of who we are,\u201d he says, recalling how as a teenager the threat of nuclear war created similar feelings of individual impotence and impending doom. But what makes the current moment \u201cparticularly desperate\u201d, he believes, \u201cis the absence of a will to do anything about it \u2026 Trump gives a sort of autonomy for the forces that are actively lying.\u201d Along with our capacity for \u201cselective amnesia\u201d, as a species \u201cwe have an amazing talent for being oblivious, we are really, really good at it,\u201d he marvels. \u201cMaybe \u2026 how unbearable it is if you are not. Because the alternative is back on the smartphones and the constant firehose of bad news. I\u2019m not sure we innately have the tools to deal with that. We haven\u2019t worked out what to do about these,\u201d he says picking up my mobile as if it had just dropped from space. The novel\u2019s blockbuster ending is appropriately uncertain. Is there any room for hope? As he says, climate change is a story in which we deeply don\u2019t want to believe. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he replies, rather crushingly. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a Live Aid style reunification concert five years later.\u201d How do you follow a novel about the destruction of the planet as we know it? \u201cIf history shows us anything, it\u2019s a school for wizards, or a novel about bunny rabbits or something.\u201d While a Hogwarts for rabbits seems unlikely, his next novel is bound to be something completely different. He likes to use a metaphor of a hall with a series of rooms off it to describe the writing process: \u201cYou know there\u2019s something in that room, you are attracted by it but frightened at the same time. You stay in the room for as long as it takes to write it, it\u2019s a day-in, day-out thing. And then at the end of it, that door\u2019s opened out. Why would you go back?\u201d He has a strict word count per day: 500 for fiction, 1,000 for non-fiction and 1,500 for journalism. And he never fails to hit it. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he quavers in his best Alan Bennett impression, \u201cyou feel ill if you don\u2019t!\u201d (as Bennett once told him when asked how he did it). \u201cIt\u2019s true. Then what are you for? That\u2019s your job.\u201d (Although, reassuringly, he \u201cnot infrequently\u201d goes back to bed of a morning, following Hilary Mantel\u2019s advice that it\u2019s crucial to get enough sleep before writing. \u201cIf I start the day too early, I can\u2019t.\u201d) And when he finally clocks off, he\u2019s a big fan of the TV box set: writers can only hope their novels are \u201cas well written as very good telly\u201d, he says. He plans to return to the novel abandoned before The Wall, \u201cbut it\u2019s been putting up quite a good fight\u201d. He also wants to complete a collection of short stories, having recently had one, the first he has written, published in the New Yorker. \u201cSeriously! I don\u2019t want to boast but I was very proud of that,\u201d he admits endearingly. \u201cThere are not many things that happen in your mid 50s that give you a genuine rush.\u201d For the immediate future, he hopes 2019 \u201cis easier on all of us than the last couple of years\u201d. And in the long term? \u201cMy main ambition, my main hope for the book, is that I\u2019m wrong.\u201d \u2022 The Wall is published by Faber on 17 January.

Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 The value of all goods and services produced \u2013 known as the output or production measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of the income generated from company profits and wages \u2013 known as the income measure.<br>\u2022&nbsp;The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas \u2013 known as the expenditure measure.</p>\n    <p>Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation.</p>\n    <p>Britain's government statistics body, the&nbsp;Office for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year; for the three months to March, June, September and December.</p>\n    <p>The figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>The ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here.

Lu is set to become the first female leader of the Empire of the Flame, but her hopes are cruelly overturned when the dying emperor names her cousin as his next in line, and demands that Lu marry him. After an attempt is made on her life, she sets out on a tortuous journey to petition the aid of magicians and shapeshifters and raise an opposition to the emperor\u2019s rule, in a bid to reclaim her birthright. The story shuttles between Lu\u2019s picaresque adventures with her friend Nokhai, a young man with a troubled history that has left him morphing into the form of a wolf, and Lu\u2019s submissive sister Min, left behind at the court to work on her own plans to become empress.

In the ancient city of Guerdon, a cross between Victorian London and Gormenghast, three thieves are tasked with pilfering arcane documents from the House of Law, little realising that they\u2019re being used by their wily Thief Master. When they learn of the betrayal, the trio vow to exact revenge on their leader. In the course of the labyrinthine plot, dark gods are awakened and the thieves find they\u2019ve taken on more than they bargained for, suffering terrifying hallucinations, out-of-body experiences and a plague that turns victims to stone. A wonderfully bizarre vision, The Gutter Prayer reads like a collaboration between Hunter S Thompson and HP Lovecraft. Asian fantasy has been a welcome addition to the genre in recent years, and the latest to hit the bookshops is The Girl King by Mimi Yu (Gollancz), a beautifully written epic replete with magic, shapeshifting characters, complex political intrigue and the obligatory battles between good and evil. Lu is set to become the first female leader of the Empire of the Flame, but her hopes are cruelly overturned when the dying emperor names her cousin as his next in line, and demands that Lu marry him. After an attempt is made on her life, she sets out on a tortuous journey to petition the aid of magicians and shapeshifters and raise an opposition to the emperor\u2019s rule, in a bid to reclaim her birthright. The story shuttles between Lu\u2019s picaresque adventures with her friend Nokhai, a young man with a troubled history that has left him morphing into the form of a wolf, and Lu\u2019s submissive sister Min, left behind at the court to work on her own plans to become empress. Strong female characters and a helter-skelter plot make for a compelling read. African SF has been making great strides recently, with such writers as Nnedi Okorafor, Lauren Beukes and Tade Thompson leading the way. AfroSFv3 (StoryTime), edited by Ivor W Hartmann, is the third in the pan-African anthology series to be published in six years. The 12 stories are a bit of a mixed bag: pick of the bunch is South African Cristy Zinn\u2019s excellent \u201cThe Girl Who Stared at Mars\u201d, a first-person account of a mission to Mars, detailing how the narrator\u2019s position aboard the flight, and her sanity, are compromised by a crime committed by her father. Also seek out \u201cThe Luminal Frontier\u201d by Gambian Biram Mboob, set in a brilliantly imagined future; it starts as a gripping space opera in which the crew of a starship is faced with a moral dilemma, but soon develops into something much more complicated. Teenager Kat Waldgrave, protagonist of David Owen\u2019s compulsively readable third novel All the Lonely People (Atom), is a typical child of our time, immersed in social media. But when Kat becomes the subject of vicious bullying by \u201calt right\u201d trolls, she does the previously unimaginable and deletes her online presence. Then, in a series of poignantly described scenes, she begins to disappear in real life, fading away and effectively becoming a non-person \u2013 until she meets a girl in a similar situation and starts to fight back against her persecutors. Alternating with Kat\u2019s narrative is that of her bully, Wesley, and as their stories intermesh we come to understand his vulnerability and motivations. All the Lonely People is an adroit, fast-paced YA page-turner that movingly explores themes of isolation, disaffection and our overwhelming need to be connected. \u2022 Eric Brown\u2019s latest novel is Murder Served Cold (Severn House).",

      "bodyText": "The mother of a schoolgirl who died of an asthma attack linked to air pollution has won the right to seek a new inquest at the high court. The attorney general moved on Friday to quash the inquest into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah at the age of nine, after new evidence linked it to air pollution spikes from traffic near her home in south London. After a long fight by her mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, Geoffrey Cox granted her the right to go to the high court for a new inquest. Kissi-Debrah said: \u201cWords cannot express how happy I am that the attorney general has taken this decision, and I would like to thank him for reaching his conclusion. \u201cNothing will bring my beautiful, bright, bubbly child back, but now at least I may get answers about how she died and whether it was air pollution which snatched her away from us. \u201cNow I hope a new inquest will make those in power realise that our children are dying as a result of the air that they breathe. This cannot go on. \u201cWhy is this not being taken more seriously by the government? What do we need to do to make them prioritise our children\u2019s lives over convenience and the rights of people to pollute?\u201d Ella lived 25 metres (82ft) from the heavily polluted South Circular Road in Lewisham. She died in February 2013 after three years of seizures and 27 visits to hospital for asthma attacks. An expert last year linked her death to the dangerously high levels of pollution from diesel traffic that breached legal limits. Jocelyn Cockburn, a partner at the law firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, who represents Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, said the decision was a major step towards justice for the family. \u201cAn inquest will provide a better understanding of why she died and whether her death was avoidable. It will force the government and other bodies to account for their actions and, in many regards, their inaction on air pollution over this period,\u201d she said. \u201cAir pollution is costing people\u2019s lives and those most vulnerable are children. There is a need for more urgency into how air pollution is dealt with in urban areas to bring it within lawful limits as soon as possible.\u201d Kissi-Debrah believes the government\u2019s failure to act to reduce air pollution from diesel traffic was a breach of her daughter\u2019s human rights. The government has repeatedly failed to bring nitrogen dioxide pollution levels to within legal limits. Until the end of 2010, Ella had been extremely active and in good health. But following a chest infection in October 2010, she had respiratory issues for the remainder of her short life, and was treated in five London hospitals for severe unstable asthma, with 27 separate hospital admissions over a three-year period. An inquest into Ella\u2019s death at Southwark coroner\u2019s court in 2014 concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. Prof Stephen Holgate, an expert on asthma and air pollution, was instructed to carry out a report on her death and said there was a \u201cstriking association\u201d between the times she was admitted to hospital and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants, near her home. His report said there was a \u201creal prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died\u201d. Holgate also considered the death certificate should be amended to reflect the fact that air pollution was a contributory factor in her death. Kissi-Debrah has launched a fundraising campaign to help pay for representation at the high court hearing. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 January 2019 because an earlier version referred to \u201cSir Geoffrey Cox\u201d, however he has not been knighted.

In mid-campaign, he <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/doug-ford-to-slash-toronto-council-seats-cancel-regional-chair-elections-report-1.4030128\">cancelled some regional chair elections</a> that left his political rival and former Conservative leader, Patrick Brown, three months and thousands of dollars into an election campaign that no longer existed. Ford also changed Toronto\u2019s city council election from a race for 47 seats to a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-election-timeline-1.4824060\">race for 25</a>, a move that allowed him to exact revenge against some of the progressive councillors who, eight years ago, had stripped his brother, then mayor Rob Ford, of his powers when Rob\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/rob-ford-crack-video-release\">addiction to crack cocaine</a> became public.</p> <p>But Ford went further than just cancelling elections and changing rules mid-campaign.

      "bodyText": "At least 170,000 antisemitic Google searches are made in the UK every year, with 10% of them involving violent phrases such as \u201cJews must die\u201d or \u201ckill Jews\u201d, research has revealed. The analysis for the Community Security Trust (CST) showed that while most of the searches are for jokes mocking Jewish people, the most common negative stereotypes claim Jews are \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d. In the 12 months after Google amended its autocomplete function to stop the word \u201cevil\u201d appearing after someone typed \u201care Jews\u201d, there was a 10% decline in the number of these searches, the research found. The findings cover a 14-year period starting in 2004 and are based on analysis of Google data, as well as material from the archive of the far-right website Stormfront, one of the oldest and largest neo-Nazi websites. The study, commissioned jointly by the CST and the Antisemitism Policy Trust, set out the most common abusive searches, where they are most popular and at what time of the day, and how trends have changed over time. The report found: 17,000 antisemitic searches on Google every year have violent connotations. These searches tend to spike between 2am and 3am. Antisemitic searches are higher in Wales than in any other part of the UK by proportion of the population, and lowest in Scotland. Antisemitic searches are just as high in cities that mostly vote Labour as they are in cities that mostly vote Conservative. Someone searching for jokes about Jews is 100 times more likely to search for jokes about black people, using the N-word. The number of antisemitic searches rose sharply in the days following Israel\u2019s Eurovision song contest victory last year, and went up 79% in April 2018, when Labour was embroiled in a row over antisemitism. The research also pointed to an enduring fascination with conspiracy theories about the role of the Rothschild banking family in \u201crunning the world\u201d. The report said there are more Google searches in the UK every year related to the Rothschilds than for Jewish celebrities such David Baddiel or Tracy Ann Oberman. Searches related to the Rothschilds have risen by 39% in the past three years, the research showed. Though the report acknowledged \u201cit is impossible to know for sure that any given search is made by a person with antisemitic attitudes\u201d, it said people tend to be far more open when they search for something online, revealing prejudices, hatreds and interests they might otherwise have kept hidden. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, the author of the report \u2013 titled Hidden hate: what Google searches tell us about antisemitism today \u2013 said: \u201cWe have found that searches looking for information on the Holocaust being a hoax rise about 30% every year on Holocaust Memorial Day. \u201cWe learned that Jewish women in public life or positions of power are the subject of more antisemitism searches than Jewish men in similar positions. \u201cWe found evidence of the rise in popularity of antisemitic conspiracy theories \u2026 and we found that sometimes heightened media focus on Jews or Israel, even if it is positive, can still lead to an increase in online searches for antisemitic content.\u201d Though the report welcomed Google\u2019s change in 2016 to the autocomplete formula, it said prior to doing so, the search engine was effectively \u201cdirecting people to make antisemitic searches who might otherwise not have done so\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: President in Texas as shutdown nears fourth week Donald Trump has restated his threat to declare a national emergency if Democrats refuse to cave to his demand for $5.7bn in funding for a border wall, as the partial government shutdown enters a record-equalling 21st day with no end in sight. \u201cI have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,\u201d the president insisted during a publicity tour of the Mexican border in Texas on Thursday, contrary to the warnings of legal scholars who have questioned his right to take such action. Who will pay? In today\u2019s podcast, Lauren Gambino and Bryan Mealer report on how Trump\u2019s core campaign pledge to build a border wall has led to this moment of political paralysis. Emergency procedure. Adam Gabbatt explains how a national emergency would work, and whether Trump is really in a position to declare one over the wall. How the shutdown could affect your health Public health is being put at risk by the government shutdown, say experts, as the ongoing uncertainty affects FDA food inspections and assessments of toxic chemicals by the Agency for Toxic Substances. Food stamps are funded through February, but the subsidy programme\u2019s future is unclear if the shutdown continues beyond that. Meanwhile, reports Jamiles Lartey from New Orleans, the shutdown is biting for the black workers who make up more than 18% of the federal workforce. Record breaking. As the current impasse approaches a record fourth week, Kate Lyons looks back at the five worst US government shutdowns to date, including the infamous 21-day battle between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. New California budget is a rebuke to Trump\u2019s national agenda The first budget proposals by the new Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, include six months of paid parental leave, two years of free community college and greater healthcare access for undocumented immigrants, in what observers have identified as a clear, progressive riposte to Trump administration policies. As he unveiled his budget on Thursday, Newsom described its contents as \u201ca reflection of our values\u201d and vowed to \u201cmake the California dream available to all\u201d. Moving left. It has been speculated that Newsom could be the most progressive governor in Golden State history, but one expert told the Guardian the governor\u2019s leftward tilt reflects a shift to more \u201cmuscular liberalism\u201d across the Democratic party. Florida governor to consider pardons for Groveland Four The new Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, will on Friday discuss granting pardons for the Groveland Four, a group of young black men who were murdered or wrongly imprisoned for the 1949 rape of a white teenager in what is considered one of the worst miscarriages of justice of the state\u2019s Jim Crow era. Many believe the alleged rape never even took place, yet DeSantis\u2019s predecessor Rick Scott declined to initiate the pardon process despite the pleas of the men\u2019s families and others including Senator Marco Rubio.

The last survivor, Charles Greenlee, was released in 1962 and died in 2012. Crib sheet A 13-year-old girl from Wisconsin has been found alive three months after her parents were murdered. Police said Jayme Closs looked malnourished and dirty after appearing to have fled her captor in a remote community. Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen says he will testify publicly to Congress next month, before beginning a three-year prison sentence for fraud and campaign finance violations in March. The board of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, approved outsize severance packages for executives accused of sexual harassment to cover up a culture of misconduct at the firm, a new lawsuit has alleged. Eating more fibre in \u201cgood\u201d carbohydrates such as wholegrain cereals, pasta and bread can prolong life and cut the chance of heart disease, according to a major new study commissioned by the World Health Organization.

More than 25 years after he was found dead from an overdose, Hadley Freeman talks to Belushi\u2019s colleagues and loved ones about his legacy and what he left undone.

It\u2019s a creatively disrupted society undergoing rapid evolution.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/ireland-votes-by-landslide-to-legalise-abortion\">referendum last May</a> two thirds of voters opted to lift a near-total constitutional ban on abortion, a landmark victory for women\u2019s rights. The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act was signed into law just before Christmas.</p> <p>Under the new system GPs provide abortions to women up to nine weeks pregnant and hospitals perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks, after which abortions are allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The GPs hope to end a three-day \u201ccooling off\u201d period for women seeking abortions, calling it a restriction without medical reason.</p> <p>The service is largely free, with the state paying GPs approximately \u20ac400 (\u00a3358) per patient.

      "bodyText": "Ireland voted by a landslide to legalise abortion \u2013 but turning that social revolution into medical reality has fallen largely on the shoulders of just 200 GPs. That is the approximate number, representing 5% of all general practitioners, that have signed up to perform the service which started rolling out on 1 January. Ethical qualms, doubts about clinical readiness and fear of protests have deterred the rest, leaving the abortion providers to face potential isolation, stigma and harassment from the remnants of Catholic Ireland. So far that has not happened. There has been minimal backlash. \u201cWe\u2019re going around wondering, \u2018are they planning something we\u2019ve missed?\u2019\u201d said Mary Favier, a prominent pro-choice campaigner and GP who provides abortion services in Cork. \u201cBut we can\u2019t see what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d Besides a fleeting protest in Galway \u2013 half a dozen people with placards picketed a surgery for a few hours \u2013 abortion has become available in 22 of Ireland\u2019s 26 counties with barely any fuss. \u201cPeople have been pragmatic and got on with it,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Dowd, who has a surgery in west Dublin. \u201cUS-style picketing doesn\u2019t seem to work here.\u201d While speaking to the Guardian in his county Kildare surgery this week Brendan O\u2019Shea\u2019s phone rang: it was a fellow GP from a neighbouring county seeking misoprostol, an abortion pill, for a patient. O\u2019Shea obliged. A scene not long ago unimaginable is now becoming commonplace. \u201cIrish history is moving rapidly at the moment,\u201d said O\u2019Shea, who at 57 can recall a colleague who was prosecuted in the 1970s for supplying condoms in breach of a contraception ban. \u201cIt\u2019s not Catholic Ireland any more. It\u2019s a creatively disrupted society undergoing rapid evolution.\u201d In a referendum last May two thirds of voters opted to lift a near-total constitutional ban on abortion, a landmark victory for women\u2019s rights. The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act was signed into law just before Christmas. Under the new system GPs provide abortions to women up to nine weeks pregnant and hospitals perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks, after which abortions are allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The GPs hope to end a three-day \u201ccooling off\u201d period for women seeking abortions, calling it a restriction without medical reason. The service is largely free, with the state paying GPs approximately \u20ac400 (\u00a3358) per patient. Previously an average of about 3,000 Irish women travelled to England each year for abortions. Women from Northern Ireland, where abortion remains banned, can access the Republic\u2019s new service but must pay. In addition to the Galway GP office, some anti-abortion activists briefly picketed a hospital in Drogheda. Others set up potentially misleading websites that mimic the state\u2019s unplanned pregnancy support service. Such tactics appear to have fizzled out even among people who voted against legalising abortion. The archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, urged protesters to be cautious, saying the church should focus on educating people and helping women in crisis. \u201cSome of the GPs in small towns are finding it difficult because the clergy have been looking for them, wanting a word in their ear, but they\u2019re not egging on protests,\u201d said O\u2019Dowd. A bigger challenge has been the speed of rollout, which has left many GPs lacking proper information, guidance and training. \u201cWe have no experience either through undergraduate or postgraduate training,\u201d said Sarah Fitzgibbon, a Cork-based GP who will not sign up until she feels better prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole new medical process that we\u2019ve never really got our heads around.\u201d Abortion care providers find solidarity in groups like Doctors for Choice and the Southern Taskgroup on Abortion and Reproductive Topics (Start). They share tips through WhatsApp. \u201cWe have set up buddy systems so we can all talk to each other. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions,\u201d said Favier.

      "bodyText": "Olivier de Sagazan\u2019s Transfiguration, a performance first created 20 years ago, has to be one of the most original, incredible things you\u2019re likely to see. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll like it. The French painter, sculptor and performer takes his audience on a terrifying journey into a tortured artist\u2019s psyche. It\u2019s a shriek-out-loud horror show, the antichrist\u2019s claymation. He\u2019s up to some freaky voodoo, kneeling centre stage, stoking the sparks and smoke of a fire and chanting, ready to summon spirits. But De Sagazan himself is to metamorphose into those spirits, a succession of creatures, demons and bogeymen. Smearing clay over his face, the sculptor is now the sculpture. He dots two blank, black pupils on his closed eyelids, a stroke of red for a mouth. As more layers are added, the distortion grows, the weirdness escalates. De Sagazan transforms into birds and beasts. He is a face-melted monster, a cadaverous grotesque, a peat bog man come back to life. It\u2019s truly visceral, as the artist tears open his own muddy flesh. He completely erases himself, applying thick daubs of clay until he has smoothed his head into a blank orb. It\u2019s suffocating to watch him obliterate his airways, only to violently stab at his eyes and his gash of a mouth. In this world the body is an ugly, troublesome place. Each new mask is a desperate attempt at creation, yet already in decay. A man may try to remake himself, but he cannot escape himself. It feels like watching De Sagazan struggling with his very existence, heading towards a breakdown \u2013 not necessarily an enjoyable experience. It\u2019s indulgent, alienating and pretty hideous at times, but a genuinely startling spectacle. At Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 11 January.

It\u2019s a huge release, one of the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/11/amazons-best-selling-games-of-2018\">bestselling</a> video games of 2018 and one that sits at or near the top of many of the internet\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/29/17386324/best-games-2018-ps4-pc-xbox-one\">best of 2018</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/dec/30/simon-parkin-best-video-games-2018\">video game</a> <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-video-games-2018\">lists</a>. It\u2019s also unique in that the natural world \u2013 or, at least, a romanticized and heightened version of it \u2013 is one of the main characters.</p> <p>You play as the outlaw Arthur Morgan and can choose to spend your time marauding across the landscape, holding up wagons and evading lawmen \u2013 or you can play a gentler way, as a birder. Of sorts. Birding as a hobby was just getting under way in the late 1800s, and much of the population, especially those living off the land as Arthur Morgan does, still primarily viewed birds as resources for food, materials and hunting sport. The <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/news/migratory-bird-treaty-act\">nation\u2019s landmark law protecting migratory birds</a> was still two decades away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d15228389c367d098b55f403ade2ac7ebb2f24d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d15228389c367d098b55f403ade2ac7ebb2f24d3/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Morgan, birder.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arthur Morgan, birder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Rockstar Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gigantic RDR2 playable map is brimming with life. Hawks perch on exposed branches and ducks flush from riverbanks. Wolves chase deer through the woods, and vultures descend to feed on the carcasses. There are alligators, turtles, snakes, frogs, toads, bats and dozens of species of fish. In all there are about 200 distinct, interactive species of animals in RDR2, and more than 40 plant species.</p> <p>I spent most of my time finding birds, and was impressed with the breadth and relative accuracy of the species represented. Birds change with habitat: roseate spoonbills and great egrets feed in the bayous of Saint Denis. Laughing gulls and red-footed boobies roost along the coast, while eagles and condors soar over mountain peaks. Each of these are crafted with accurate field marks and habits. There are dozens of species I couldn\u2019t even find, including Carolina parakeets, ferruginous hawks, and pileated woodpeckers. As in real-life birding, you\u2019re never guaranteed to see anything.</p> <p>The sound design, too, is impressive. The landscape is alive with birdsong, including many species not actually in the game, such as the northern flicker and ruby-crowned kinglet. I was riding through a wooded area one time as dusk turned to night, and whippoorwills began singing out all around me.</p> <p>Those kinds of natural surprises are what I love most about the game, and they happen frequently. One time I shot a mallard and left its body on the lakeshore after taking its feathers and meat. I was nearby about 10 minutes later and noticed a red fox emerging from the grass and walking down towards the duck carcass, still on the shore. A pair of turkey vultures descended and the trio fed on the duck. I watched from afar through my binoculars (in-game binoculars!) and felt incredibly lucky to have caught such a spontaneous and real-feeling episode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"202ae2ab014b6484c5f2619bf35821cbc74195c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/202ae2ab014b6484c5f2619bf35821cbc74195c6/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Herring Gull through Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s in-game binoculars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Herring Gull through Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s in-game binoculars</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rockstar Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are some minor errors I noticed, however, that as a birder and critic of these things I feel obligated to point out. In addition to the snowy egret, there are quite a few little egrets in Saint Denis, <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/little-egret\">which would have been</a> a truly rare North America sighting. What\u2019s called a California quail is actually a northern bobwhite. Tanagers are, for some reason, referred to as scarlet tanager songbird and western tanager songbird. But that\u2019s all. Overall, RDR2 is absolutely the best and boldest representation of American birdlife in any video game. The competition is not even close.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game for birders. This game exists in a time when humans mainly viewed birds \u2013 and all of the natural world \u2013 as ripe for exploitation rather than appreciation. All animals in the game can be hunted and either eaten or crafted into clothing or materials. Feathers are used to craft arrows that fly straighter. Special feathers, like those from hawks and eagles, are used to make clothing. All of these parts can be traded or sold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/nov/22/how-rockstar-red-dead-redemption-2-horses-made\">All the pretty horses: how Red Dead Redemption 2\u2019s majestic steeds were made</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, unregulated hunting was a very real threat to birds at the time.

I pause to watch the flock fly off towards the distant, snow-capped peaks, trailed by their echoing croaks, when a man riding by on horseback bumps into me. Irritated, I shoot the man dead, and take his hat. So it goes in Red Dead Redemption 2. Available since October, the video game is set in an imagined version of the American west in the year 1899. It\u2019s a huge release, one of the bestselling video games of 2018 and one that sits at or near the top of many of the internet\u2019s best of 2018 video game lists. It\u2019s also unique in that the natural world \u2013 or, at least, a romanticized and heightened version of it \u2013 is one of the main characters. You play as the outlaw Arthur Morgan and can choose to spend your time marauding across the landscape, holding up wagons and evading lawmen \u2013 or you can play a gentler way, as a birder. Of sorts. Birding as a hobby was just getting under way in the late 1800s, and much of the population, especially those living off the land as Arthur Morgan does, still primarily viewed birds as resources for food, materials and hunting sport. The nation\u2019s landmark law protecting migratory birds was still two decades away. The gigantic RDR2 playable map is brimming with life. Hawks perch on exposed branches and ducks flush from riverbanks. Wolves chase deer through the woods, and vultures descend to feed on the carcasses. There are alligators, turtles, snakes, frogs, toads, bats and dozens of species of fish. In all there are about 200 distinct, interactive species of animals in RDR2, and more than 40 plant species. I spent most of my time finding birds, and was impressed with the breadth and relative accuracy of the species represented. Birds change with habitat: roseate spoonbills and great egrets feed in the bayous of Saint Denis. Laughing gulls and red-footed boobies roost along the coast, while eagles and condors soar over mountain peaks. Each of these are crafted with accurate field marks and habits. There are dozens of species I couldn\u2019t even find, including Carolina parakeets, ferruginous hawks, and pileated woodpeckers. As in real-life birding, you\u2019re never guaranteed to see anything. The sound design, too, is impressive. The landscape is alive with birdsong, including many species not actually in the game, such as the northern flicker and ruby-crowned kinglet. I was riding through a wooded area one time as dusk turned to night, and whippoorwills began singing out all around me. Those kinds of natural surprises are what I love most about the game, and they happen frequently. One time I shot a mallard and left its body on the lakeshore after taking its feathers and meat. I was nearby about 10 minutes later and noticed a red fox emerging from the grass and walking down towards the duck carcass, still on the shore. A pair of turkey vultures descended and the trio fed on the duck. I watched from afar through my binoculars (in-game binoculars!) and felt incredibly lucky to have caught such a spontaneous and real-feeling episode. There are some minor errors I noticed, however, that as a birder and critic of these things I feel obligated to point out. In addition to the snowy egret, there are quite a few little egrets in Saint Denis, which would have been a truly rare North America sighting. What\u2019s called a California quail is actually a northern bobwhite. Tanagers are, for some reason, referred to as scarlet tanager songbird and western tanager songbird. But that\u2019s all. Overall, RDR2 is absolutely the best and boldest representation of American birdlife in any video game. The competition is not even close. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game for birders. This game exists in a time when humans mainly viewed birds \u2013 and all of the natural world \u2013 as ripe for exploitation rather than appreciation. All animals in the game can be hunted and either eaten or crafted into clothing or materials. Feathers are used to craft arrows that fly straighter. Special feathers, like those from hawks and eagles, are used to make clothing. All of these parts can be traded or sold. Of course, unregulated hunting was a very real threat to birds at the time. The demand for egret plumes for fancy hats was driving several species toward extinction. (Snowy egret plumes can be sold in-game for $2.50 apiece.) Habitat loss and overhunting contributed to the extinction of the Carolina parakeet soon after the game\u2019s timeframe, in the early 20th century. (Carolina parakeet flight feathers can be used to make far-flying arrows in the game.) The type of wanton destruction encouraged in Red Dead Redemption 2 is what led the National Audubon Society to lobby for, and Congress to pass, the real Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918, and other environmental legislation in the following decades. But in the game, the player must kill to progress. Thankfully, the game does not shy away from the realities of these interactions. An imprecise shot will wound an animal, leaving it to yelp and squirm before you finish your job. In order to receive meat or parts, you need to skin or pluck the animal, a process that, though superficial, is clearly and gruesomely animated. Nor does RDR2 spare you the experience of the human impact on the land. In fact, the disastrous intersection between humans and the environment is the game\u2019s major theme. A sense of foreboding followed me around the lush world, knowledge that humans were at work destroying it all. Much of that destruction is represented in-game, from the factory smokestacks of Saint Denis to the Owanjila dam, but I could also feel it extending into real life. I couldn\u2019t help but envision the dirt paths becoming busy highways, and each green meadow converted into a housing development. RDR2 presents an idealized version of the natural world, but the loss feels very real. The trouble is, as a birder, it\u2019s not a lesson I needed to learn. I know full well about the continued decline of bird populations, habitat loss and environmental degradation. That the game could elicit such deep feelings of sadness and regret is to its credit, but I was often left feeling hopeless and wanting to get outside to enjoy real nature while I still could. My mom always used to tell me to stop playing video games and go outside, but this is the first game that made me want to.

But now she has thrown her hat into the ring, commentators are lining up to remind us how uncomfortable they are with powerful women, and also how uncomfortable they are with admitting it \u2013 since their doubts are invariably couched in terms such as \u201cthere have been questions about \u2026\u201d In other words: \u201cMany people say \u2026\u201d</p> <p>It got me wondering about what makes a character in the movies likable or unlikable. After all, an entire screenwriting manual, Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, is named after \u201cthe scene where we meet the hero and the hero does something \u2013 like saving a cat \u2013 that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him\u201d. And no, I don\u2019t think Lt Ellen Ripley would be nearly as popular a character if she had left Jones behind in the Nostromo to get blown up. But on <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/50-most-likeable-movie-characters/\" title=\"\">GamesRadar\u2019s list of 50 Most Likable Movie Characters</a>, only seven are women, and of those seven, only Fargo\u2019s Marge Gunderson strikes me as a genuinely likable person, as opposed to irritant, doormat or nanny. Yes, Mary Poppins has many fine qualities, but being likable isn\u2019t one of them.</p> <p>Recently, we have been seeing a new wave of unlikable female protagonists. It kicked off with 2016\u2019s highly divisive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/02/nocturnal-animals-review-tom-ford-returns-with-wildly-gripping-revenge-tale\" title=\"\">Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams</a> as a character who was \u201cnot easily likable\u201d, in the words of film critic Barry Wurst.

Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone in The Favourite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FILM4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet I would contend that The Favourite\u2019s three leading characters <em>are</em> likable \u2013 in small and volatile doses. None of them saves a cat, but we start off by automatically siding with Abigail (Emma Stone) because she is an underdog, and, from Oliver Twist to The Karate Kid to Harry Potter, we have learned to root for underdogs. Abigail\u2019s likability is only confirmed when palace servants (with whom she is billeted) play a vile trick on her \u2013 we\u2019re used to sympathising with victims. We are on safe ground here: Abigail is shaping up to be a traditional heroine. And we like her even more as she finds cunning ways to insinuate herself into the queen\u2019s favours, because, from Elizabeth Bennett to Jo March to Hermione Granger, we are accustomed to siding with heroines who are clever.</p> <p>Yet that cleverness eventually curdles, until we are faced with the possibility that Abigail may not be so likable after all. Similarly, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) veers between likability (she seems genuinely fond of the Queen) and steely-eyed ambition \u2013 a quality perceived as anything but likable in a woman, as Clinton and Warren have discovered.</p> <p>Even Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), initially depicted as capricious, self-absorbed and ridiculous, is shown to have suffered devastating heartbreak \u2013 and just like that, we find ourselves liking her more. In the end, much of The Favourite\u2019s deliciousness as an entertainment stems from our emotional allegiances being tugged this way and that by women who are not simply good or evil but flawed, multifaceted human beings. Just like real people.</p> <p>If you think Abigail, Anne and Sarah are unlikable, get a load of Erin Bell in Karyn Kusama\u2019s Destroyer. Our first view of Bell is pink-rimmed bloodshot eyes squinting out of sun-damaged skin. She is a Los Angeles detective ravaged by alcohol, cigarettes and traumatic memories of an undercover assignment gone horribly wrong, and Nicole Kidman plays her with the sort of fearlessness (and help from makeup designer Bill Corso) that makes her Oscar-winning fake nose for The Hours look like a party trick. The days of Jane Fonda being able to pass as an alcoholic in The Morning After (1986) just by mussing her hair are long gone. \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d says a colleague of Erin\u2019s, and so she does. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/04/nicole-kidman-destroyer-transformation\" title=\"\">Kidman\u2019s transformation is more than just grandstanding</a> \u2013 her ruined face reflects her character\u2019s story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fa5dacb861acccd0fafa72e9bcc39d96a302498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fa5dacb861acccd0fafa72e9bcc39d96a302498/0_124_4572_2743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No attempt to make us like her \u2026 Nicole Kidman in Destroyer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No attempt to make us like her \u2026 Nicole Kidman in Destroyer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Destroyer, Kidman sacrifices one of the strongest weapons in a film star\u2019s arsenal \u2013 her good looks (deemed more essential for actresses than actors), and with it a shortcut to securing our sympathies. According to innumerable studies, including this <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025656#s1\" title=\"\">2011 Harvard-related one</a>, we are conditioned to see beautiful people as more likable and for every Hunchback of Notre Dame or Small Soldiers (1998), making your good guys ugly still amounts to a subversive act. Still, we think, Bell may look like a wreck, but surely she will win us over with her caustic wit, or by saving a cat? Nope.

      "bodyText": "The L word is in the news again, this time because of Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s decision to run for the US presidency. \u201cA common observation of Warren is that she\u2019s simply not likable enough to win the presidency,\u201d said the Daily Beast. \u201cThere have been questions about whether Ms Warren is \u2018likable\u2019, a word that tends to be used in regard to female candidates rather than men,\u201d said the Finacial Times. And Politico tweeted: \u201cHow does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux \u2013 written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?\u201d And so on. Ironically, in 2016, Warren was perceived as \u201cinfinitely more likable than Hillary\u201d. But now she has thrown her hat into the ring, commentators are lining up to remind us how uncomfortable they are with powerful women, and also how uncomfortable they are with admitting it \u2013 since their doubts are invariably couched in terms such as \u201cthere have been questions about \u2026\u201d In other words: \u201cMany people say \u2026\u201d It got me wondering about what makes a character in the movies likable or unlikable. After all, an entire screenwriting manual, Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, is named after \u201cthe scene where we meet the hero and the hero does something \u2013 like saving a cat \u2013 that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him\u201d. And no, I don\u2019t think Lt Ellen Ripley would be nearly as popular a character if she had left Jones behind in the Nostromo to get blown up. But on GamesRadar\u2019s list of 50 Most Likable Movie Characters, only seven are women, and of those seven, only Fargo\u2019s Marge Gunderson strikes me as a genuinely likable person, as opposed to irritant, doormat or nanny. Yes, Mary Poppins has many fine qualities, but being likable isn\u2019t one of them. Recently, we have been seeing a new wave of unlikable female protagonists. It kicked off with 2016\u2019s highly divisive Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams as a character who was \u201cnot easily likable\u201d, in the words of film critic Barry Wurst. And not everyone, it turns out, is a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Favourite. Sure enough, reasons given include (and I didn\u2019t have to dig deep for these examples) \u201cNot liking any of the characters\u201d; \u201cwholly unlikable female characters\u201d; and \u201ceveryone in this film is a varying shade of unlikable\u201d. Yet I would contend that The Favourite\u2019s three leading characters are likable \u2013 in small and volatile doses. None of them saves a cat, but we start off by automatically siding with Abigail (Emma Stone) because she is an underdog, and, from Oliver Twist to The Karate Kid to Harry Potter, we have learned to root for underdogs. Abigail\u2019s likability is only confirmed when palace servants (with whom she is billeted) play a vile trick on her \u2013 we\u2019re used to sympathising with victims. We are on safe ground here: Abigail is shaping up to be a traditional heroine. And we like her even more as she finds cunning ways to insinuate herself into the queen\u2019s favours, because, from Elizabeth Bennett to Jo March to Hermione Granger, we are accustomed to siding with heroines who are clever. Yet that cleverness eventually curdles, until we are faced with the possibility that Abigail may not be so likable after all. Similarly, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) veers between likability (she seems genuinely fond of the Queen) and steely-eyed ambition \u2013 a quality perceived as anything but likable in a woman, as Clinton and Warren have discovered. Even Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), initially depicted as capricious, self-absorbed and ridiculous, is shown to have suffered devastating heartbreak \u2013 and just like that, we find ourselves liking her more. In the end, much of The Favourite\u2019s deliciousness as an entertainment stems from our emotional allegiances being tugged this way and that by women who are not simply good or evil but flawed, multifaceted human beings. Just like real people. If you think Abigail, Anne and Sarah are unlikable, get a load of Erin Bell in Karyn Kusama\u2019s Destroyer. Our first view of Bell is pink-rimmed bloodshot eyes squinting out of sun-damaged skin. She is a Los Angeles detective ravaged by alcohol, cigarettes and traumatic memories of an undercover assignment gone horribly wrong, and Nicole Kidman plays her with the sort of fearlessness (and help from makeup designer Bill Corso) that makes her Oscar-winning fake nose for The Hours look like a party trick. The days of Jane Fonda being able to pass as an alcoholic in The Morning After (1986) just by mussing her hair are long gone. \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d says a colleague of Erin\u2019s, and so she does. And Kidman\u2019s transformation is more than just grandstanding \u2013 her ruined face reflects her character\u2019s story. In Destroyer, Kidman sacrifices one of the strongest weapons in a film star\u2019s arsenal \u2013 her good looks (deemed more essential for actresses than actors), and with it a shortcut to securing our sympathies. According to innumerable studies, including this 2011 Harvard-related one, we are conditioned to see beautiful people as more likable and for every Hunchback of Notre Dame or Small Soldiers (1998), making your good guys ugly still amounts to a subversive act. Still, we think, Bell may look like a wreck, but surely she will win us over with her caustic wit, or by saving a cat? Nope. The kindest thing she does is give a handjob to a terminally ill man, and even then it is not an act of charity but a peculiarly sordid way of wringing a name out of him. While Melissa McCarthy isn\u2019t as conventionally glam as Kidman, she brushes up nicely for chatshows and red carpets. So it is a little disconcerting to see her in a dowdy wig and unflattering specs in Can You Ever Forgive Me? She plays the real-life writer Lee Israel, whose career had slumped so much by 1992 that she began to support herself by forging literary letters and selling them to dealers. Even before the opening credits are over, this prickly, self-pitying alcoholic has already told a work colleague to \u201cfuck off\u201d, and stolen an overcoat and two rolls of toilet paper at her agent\u2019s party. While Israel doesn\u2019t save a cat, she does share her apartment with one; her criminal career is launched when the animal gets sick and she needs money to pay the vet.

McCarthy makes us feel for her without softening her anti-social abrasiveness, but likable? Hell, no. Like Destroyer, Can You Ever Forgive Me? was directed by a woman \u2013 Marielle Heller. \u201cLee was flawed and complicated and fascinating,\u201d Heller told Variety. \u201cIf she were a male character, nobody would bat an eye, but because she\u2019s female, it feels radical.\u201d The screenplay was co-written by Nicole Holofcener, while The Favourite was co-written by Deborah Davis.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday\u2019s dramatic showdown between Donald Trump and Democratic leaders and the president\u2019s defiant PR trip to the border the following day seemed to confirm observers\u2019 fears: a breakthrough in negotiations to end one of the longest shutdowns in US history is far from imminent. As key government operations remained shuttered for a 21st day and roughly 800,000 federal workers remained without pay, both the president and the Democrats have retreated into their own corners. As far as Trump is concerned, any deal must fulfill his longstanding vow to build a wall across the southern border. The president has threatened to declare a national emergency over the situation at the border \u2013 a move he believes would allow him to circumvent Congress and begin the construction of a wall on his own \u2013 if lawmakers refuse to fund the project. The president\u2019s position is a non-starter with Democrats, freshly in the House majority after the 2018 midterms. They have called for a government funding bill that essentially maintains spending at current levels, rebuffing Trump\u2019s insistence on $5.7bn for a border wall. Three weeks into the crisis, most Americans appear to be blaming Trump for the shutdown \u2013 further isolating the president with only his ardent supporters in favor of the White House strategy. But there are few options that remain left at the president\u2019s disposal, in part because the only true crisis was one of Trump\u2019s own making. Michael Steel, a former aide to ex-House speaker John Boehner, said Trump had backed himself and Republicans into a corner by insisting on a wall despite a bipartisan agreement in the Senate last month that would have punted a debate over immigration and border security until after a shutdown was first averted. \u201cSomeone talks the president into an appallingly poor strategy based on a deeply flawed analysis that he would somehow have greater leverage in this debate if it were held in the context of a full or partial shutdown now,\u201d Steel said. Steel added that Trump\u2019s public appeals this week, which the president himself was reluctant to give, were not going to earn Democratic votes \u201cin any way, shape or form\u201d. Republicans in Congress have largely stood behind the president, although some cracks have emerged this week as lawmakers feel pressure from constituents back home to end the impasse. A handful of moderate Senate Republicans \u2013 including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2013 have publicly broken with Trump and expressed support for a clean government funding bill. On Wednesday, eight House Republicans also bucked the president and joined with Democrats in voting for bills that would reopen the government without financing the wall. \u201cI continue to stress that there is no good reason for a shutdown,\u201d Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe reality is thousands of federal employees and contractors have no paycheck in sight, small businesses that rely on them are suffering and there\u2019s no reason they should be held hostage to a political dispute.\u201d Murkowski personally raised the issue with Trump on Tuesday when he attended a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, telling the president constituents were feeling the \u201cconsequences\u201d of the shutdown. Trump nonetheless dug in, urging unity from Republicans in response. While the concept of a border wall is broadly popular with the president\u2019s base, the proposal does not have the same traction with a majority of the American public. Even so, Trump struck a defiant tone during his visit to the border town of McAllen, Texas, on Thursday. The president again suggested criminals and terrorists are flowing freely across the border, ignoring that the rate of illegal immigration has fallen dramatically over the past decade, that the undocumented population in the US hit a 12-year low last year, and studies have shown that illegal immigration does not increase violent crime. Trump said Thursday he was \u201cdefinitely\u201d prepared to declare a national emergency, despite warnings, even from conservatives, that such a move would amount to presidential overreach. A national emergency, however, might be Trump\u2019s only way to emerge from the fight without having thrown in the towel, suggested Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist who served as an aide to the former House majority leader Eric Cantor. \u201cHe gets the longest shutdown in history, which is a very Trump-like thing to want,\u201d said Cooper, while adding: \u201cI think the president looks at the base and says he fought harder than anyone, announces a national emergency, reopens the government and lets the courts deal with it,\u201d he added. \u201cHe just needs an out.\u201d",

She was 51 and was last on air in mid-December.</p> \n<p>Colleagues only found out in the new year that she was ill and said they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d to hear of her death.</p> \n<p>Sunderland-born Oxberry joined North West Tonight in 1994 after a stint on Radio 1 as Simon Mayo\u2019s sidekick and quickly became a favourite for regional viewers. She had originally moved back to her native north to present Saturday morning children\u2019s TV show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhf3xD-33l8\">The 8:15 From Manchester</a>, alongside Ross King.</p> \n<p>As well as presenting the weather she went on to front Inside Out North West, the BBC\u2019s regional current affairs programme. She also presented programmes on BBC Radio Manchester including the Breakfast Show.</p> \n<p>Oxberry had two children with her husband Ian Hindle, a camera operator.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cDianne was an amazing wife and mother who embraced life to the full. She was an inspiration to all who knew and loved her but also to the people who watched and welcomed her into their homes each night as if she were part of their family too.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe will leave a massive void in our lives but, because of the remarkable person she was, she will forever live on in our hearts. The children and I will miss her more than anyone can imagine.\u201d</p> \n<p>Roger Johnson, North West Tonight presenter, said: \u201cWe are heartbroken by Dianne\u2019s death. It is almost impossible to comprehend. Dianne was North West Tonight. It\u2019s hard to imagine the programme without her.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur thoughts are with Ian and all of Dianne\u2019s family. We hope they will find some comfort in the knowledge so many people loved Dianne and will miss her terribly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fdaf9de4-c56b-4c57-a4c4-b7462fd0a115\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fOeKuah_fqU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Annabel Tiffin, Johnson\u2019s co-presenter, said: \u201cDi was so talented, so beautiful, so funny and so full of life. On screen she was a star, radiating warmth and good humour. Off screen, she was a wonderful colleague, a loyal friend and I will miss her terribly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aziz Rashid, the head of BBC North West, said: \u201cFor more than 20 years, viewers invited Dianne into their homes every night. She was a part of their lives. Just last November during our Plod for Pudsey challenge for Children in Need, Di was out meeting viewers around the region. I saw for myself the incredible reaction she got from the public, which showed how much people cared for her.\u201d</p> \n<p>Helen Thomas, the director of BBC England, said: \u201cDianne had a remarkable career. For more than two decades, she was a key part of one of the most watched regional news programmes in the country. Prior to that, she\u2019d had a successful stint working on air at Radio 1.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe was a brilliant weather presenter, showed she could do serious journalism with Inside Out and could do the lighter end of broadcasting brilliantly whenever it was needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cAbove all she was a lovely woman whose sudden and shocking death has robbed the BBC of one of our brightest stars. I\u2019m thinking of all her family and friends at this awful time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the BBC\u2019s longest-serving weather presenters has died suddenly after a short illness. Dianne Oxberry, who had presented the weather on BBC North West Tonight for 24 years, died on Thursday in the Christie, Manchester\u2019s cancer hospital, the broadcaster said. She was 51 and was last on air in mid-December. Colleagues only found out in the new year that she was ill and said they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d to hear of her death. Sunderland-born Oxberry joined North West Tonight in 1994 after a stint on Radio 1 as Simon Mayo\u2019s sidekick and quickly became a favourite for regional viewers. She had originally moved back to her native north to present Saturday morning children\u2019s TV show The 8:15 From Manchester, alongside Ross King. As well as presenting the weather she went on to front Inside Out North West, the BBC\u2019s regional current affairs programme. She also presented programmes on BBC Radio Manchester including the Breakfast Show. Oxberry had two children with her husband Ian Hindle, a camera operator. He said: \u201cDianne was an amazing wife and mother who embraced life to the full. She was an inspiration to all who knew and loved her but also to the people who watched and welcomed her into their homes each night as if she were part of their family too. \u201cShe will leave a massive void in our lives but, because of the remarkable person she was, she will forever live on in our hearts. The children and I will miss her more than anyone can imagine.\u201d Roger Johnson, North West Tonight presenter, said: \u201cWe are heartbroken by Dianne\u2019s death. It is almost impossible to comprehend. Dianne was North West Tonight. It\u2019s hard to imagine the programme without her. \u201cOur thoughts are with Ian and all of Dianne\u2019s family. We hope they will find some comfort in the knowledge so many people loved Dianne and will miss her terribly.\u201d Annabel Tiffin, Johnson\u2019s co-presenter, said: \u201cDi was so talented, so beautiful, so funny and so full of life. On screen she was a star, radiating warmth and good humour. Off screen, she was a wonderful colleague, a loyal friend and I will miss her terribly.\u201d Aziz Rashid, the head of BBC North West, said: \u201cFor more than 20 years, viewers invited Dianne into their homes every night. She was a part of their lives. Just last November during our Plod for Pudsey challenge for Children in Need, Di was out meeting viewers around the region. I saw for myself the incredible reaction she got from the public, which showed how much people cared for her.\u201d Helen Thomas, the director of BBC England, said: \u201cDianne had a remarkable career. For more than two decades, she was a key part of one of the most watched regional news programmes in the country. Prior to that, she\u2019d had a successful stint working on air at Radio 1. \u201cShe was a brilliant weather presenter, showed she could do serious journalism with Inside Out and could do the lighter end of broadcasting brilliantly whenever it was needed. \u201cAbove all she was a lovely woman whose sudden and shocking death has robbed the BBC of one of our brightest stars. I\u2019m thinking of all her family and friends at this awful time.\u201d",

Virgin, part-owned by the billionaire Sir Richard Branson, has banded together for the deal with the infrastructure firm Stobart Group and the investment house Cyrus to form a joint venture, Connect Airways. The 1p per share offer represented a big discount to the 16.38p closing price of Flybe shares on Thursday. The shares fell by 90% to 1.6p as trading opened on Friday. The consortium would also inject \u00a3100m into the struggling airline, in the form of a \u00a320m working capital loan and \u00a380m to invest. Flybe\u2019s bosses publicly put the company up for sale in November after a profit warning in October prompted plans to cut costs and reduce its flights. Flybe, which has 78 planes, received interest from multiple parties for all or part of the business.

The fall of 18 percentage points between 2017 and 2018 is attributed to the last year\u2019s scandals over clerical sexual abuse. Fewer than half of the Catholics surveyed by Gallup said they had confidence in organised religion, a drop of eight percentage points over the period. The poll was conducted four months after the publication of a scathing grand jury report into sexual abuse and its cover-up by Catholic priests and bishops in Pennsylvania. An investigation found that at least 300 priests had abused about 1,000 children and vulnerable adults over 70 years, and that their superiors had either stood by or in some cases actively covered up criminal acts. Since the publication of the Pennsylvania report, at least 13 US states have opened formal investigations and some senior Catholics, including the archbishop of Washington, have resigned. Positive views about the honest and ethical standards of clergy have almost halved in a decade, from 61% to 31%, but the most recent figures show the largest annual fall. Confidence in the institutions of the church fell to 44% last year compared with 52% in 2017, although the figure was above a low of 39% in 2007.

      "bodyText": "Netflix has announced that Martin Scorsese will direct a documentary about Bob Dylan\u2019s Rolling Thunder Revue tour. Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story will feature new on-camera interviews with the legendary songwriter. The streaming platform says the film \u201ccaptures the troubled spirit of America in 1975 and the joyous music that Dylan performed during the fall of that year.\u201d It is due later this year. Variety reports that the film will be less straightforward than Scorsese\u2019s 2005 Dylan documentary, No Direction Home, which focused on the songwriter\u2019s rise to fame, his move to New York and temporary retirement following a motorcycle accident in July 1966. \u201cScorsese provides the master vision,\u201d wrote critic Roger Ebert on that film\u2019s release, \u201cand his factual footage unfolds with the narrative power of fiction.\u201d The Rolling Thunder Revue was a freewheeling multi-artist caravan that began in October 1975 and concluded in May 1976. Artists including Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Mick Ronson, Bette Midler, Roger McGuinn, Emmylou Harris and Allen Ginsberg joined Dylan on the autumn leg of the tour, which is said to be the focus of Scorsese\u2019s film. Dylan\u2019s mother also appeared. Dylan frequently performed in white face paint. It is one of the most noteworthy tours in rock history: \u201cThe Rolling Thunder Revue shows remain some of the finest music Dylan ever made with a live band,\u201d wrote critic Clinton Heylin in his 1991 Dylan biography Behind the Shades. In 2002, an official recording of the tour was released in Dylan\u2019s Bootleg Series. Dylan engaged Sam Shepard as a screenwriter for a film about the tour, although the result was largely improvised. Released in 1978, Renaldo and Clara featured live footage, interviews and dramatised fictional portions about Dylan\u2019s life. He was billed as Renaldo and his first wife, Sara Dylan, as Clara. It clocked in at almost four hours and was panned by critics. Scorsese\u2019s film is not the only Dylan feature in the works. Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino has said he is directing a film based on Dylan\u2019s 1975 album Blood on the Tracks, to be written by The Fisher King and The Bridges of Madison County screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Dylan will perform a rare UK concert this summer, sharing the bill with Neil Young at London\u2019s Hyde Park on 12 July. Scorsese\u2019s next slated feature film is another Netflix production, The Irishman, about the mafia-union wars of the 70s.",

      "body": "<p>Until 2016, I ran an advertising agency in London. At our peak, we were highly successful; I had a team of 35 people, a \u00a33m turnover and a Covent Garden office. When the agency folded, I decided to invest in bitcoin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/29/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-blockchain-what-they-really-mean-for-our-future\" title=\"\">Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency</a>, a type of electronic cash that allows people to spend or trade via a peer-to-peer network without the involvement of banks or other intermediaries. It is a cheap, efficient way of transferring funds or holding value, which can be converted back into sterling at any time. I had used it before to buy treatment online for my mother after she was diagnosed with cancer. I had also dabbled with investing in it in 2013, and made and lost some money: bitcoin is prone to sudden fluctuations in value. But the market seemed to have moved on, and I decided it could be a good way to make some profit on my savings.</p> <p>At first I deposited \u00a35,000; at the time, January 2017, bitcoins were about $600, so I bought seven or eight and spent the rest on other cryptocurrencies. But over the next few weeks I became hooked and ploughed in a large chunk of money \u2013 \u00a323,000 in all. I remember telling people, \u201cI really think the value of bitcoin could rise to $2,000 this year.\u201d I could never have predicted it would peak at 10 times that. By the middle of spring 2017, my investment had risen to about $300,000, and by the summer it was at half a million. Media interest in bitcoin was growing and friends kept asking how they could get into it, so I started a Facebook group, then a website and finally a podcast devoted to the subject. As excitement built, more and more people got involved, forming the conditions for a bubble; but many of us were too caught up in the hype to exercise caution.</p> <p>At the end of 2017, bitcoin had reached almost $20,000 and my portfolio had ballooned to about $1.2m. That is when I got a little out of control. I have always been an entrepreneur, and since I was a kid I had dreamed of buying my local football club, Bedford Town, becoming chairman and getting them into the league. I thought the project might cost \u00a35m, so that was the figure I decided to aim for. I estimated I could get there within six months.</p> <p>By this time I was travelling the world doing interviews for my podcast, taking friends out to expensive restaurants and buying extravagant gifts for my family. I am not the kind of person who puts everything away for the future, and though I donated \u00a36,000 to my local hospital, much of my spending was quite frivolous. It might have been more sensible to buy a couple of houses, but I became overambitious. This felt like my one shot at achieving that childhood dream.</p> <p>At the end of January 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/bitcoin-biggest-bubble-in-history-says-economist-who-predicted-2008-crash\" title=\"\">the bubble burst</a> and bitcoin\u2019s value suddenly fell. There had been a few drops during 2017 but it had bounced back, so I was not too worried. But over the rest of the year, I watched it sink lower and lower, along with the other cryptocurrencies I had invested in, all the time thinking, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no point selling now\u2026\u201d That was my attitude throughout last year, as bitcoin\u2019s value continued to fall. Pretty much everything I had built up was wiped out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/30/i-won-a-pub-tv-reality-show\">Experience: I won a pub on TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are many who invested a lot more than I did and ended up with far greater losses. I wish I had taken everything out before the bubble burst, but I do not waste too much time on regret. I have earned money in the past through hard work and enjoyed it more. At the moment, I am enjoying making my podcast, which provides more than enough money to live on. I have sold most of my bitcoin, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/20/bitcoin-price-plunges-2018-low-cryptocurrency-value\" title=\"\">currently worth about $4,000 apiece</a>, to give me a cushion in case the business has a bad month. But if I had to choose between the $1.2m and the podcast, I would let the money go again \u2013 I love what I do now.</p> <p>I still believe that bitcoin is a force for good.

      "bodyText": "Until 2016, I ran an advertising agency in London. At our peak, we were highly successful; I had a team of 35 people, a \u00a33m turnover and a Covent Garden office. When the agency folded, I decided to invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a type of electronic cash that allows people to spend or trade via a peer-to-peer network without the involvement of banks or other intermediaries. It is a cheap, efficient way of transferring funds or holding value, which can be converted back into sterling at any time. I had used it before to buy treatment online for my mother after she was diagnosed with cancer. I had also dabbled with investing in it in 2013, and made and lost some money: bitcoin is prone to sudden fluctuations in value. But the market seemed to have moved on, and I decided it could be a good way to make some profit on my savings. At first I deposited \u00a35,000; at the time, January 2017, bitcoins were about $600, so I bought seven or eight and spent the rest on other cryptocurrencies. But over the next few weeks I became hooked and ploughed in a large chunk of money \u2013 \u00a323,000 in all. I remember telling people, \u201cI really think the value of bitcoin could rise to $2,000 this year.\u201d I could never have predicted it would peak at 10 times that. By the middle of spring 2017, my investment had risen to about $300,000, and by the summer it was at half a million. Media interest in bitcoin was growing and friends kept asking how they could get into it, so I started a Facebook group, then a website and finally a podcast devoted to the subject. As excitement built, more and more people got involved, forming the conditions for a bubble; but many of us were too caught up in the hype to exercise caution. At the end of 2017, bitcoin had reached almost $20,000 and my portfolio had ballooned to about $1.2m. That is when I got a little out of control. I have always been an entrepreneur, and since I was a kid I had dreamed of buying my local football club, Bedford Town, becoming chairman and getting them into the league. I thought the project might cost \u00a35m, so that was the figure I decided to aim for. I estimated I could get there within six months. By this time I was travelling the world doing interviews for my podcast, taking friends out to expensive restaurants and buying extravagant gifts for my family. I am not the kind of person who puts everything away for the future, and though I donated \u00a36,000 to my local hospital, much of my spending was quite frivolous. It might have been more sensible to buy a couple of houses, but I became overambitious. This felt like my one shot at achieving that childhood dream. At the end of January 2018 the bubble burst and bitcoin\u2019s value suddenly fell. There had been a few drops during 2017 but it had bounced back, so I was not too worried. But over the rest of the year, I watched it sink lower and lower, along with the other cryptocurrencies I had invested in, all the time thinking, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no point selling now\u2026\u201d That was my attitude throughout last year, as bitcoin\u2019s value continued to fall. Pretty much everything I had built up was wiped out. There are many who invested a lot more than I did and ended up with far greater losses. I wish I had taken everything out before the bubble burst, but I do not waste too much time on regret. I have earned money in the past through hard work and enjoyed it more. At the moment, I am enjoying making my podcast, which provides more than enough money to live on. I have sold most of my bitcoin, which is currently worth about $4,000 apiece, to give me a cushion in case the business has a bad month. But if I had to choose between the $1.2m and the podcast, I would let the money go again \u2013 I love what I do now. I still believe that bitcoin is a force for good. I recently interviewed Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, who was explaining how it helps people living in authoritarian regimes to prosper \u2013 for example, women in Afghanistan who are not allowed to open bank accounts can still work and get paid in bitcoin. It is a step in the right direction. My main focus now is exploring how bitcoin could help stabilise an increasingly volatile world.

      "bodyText": "More than 80,000 police officers are mobilising across France for the ninth weekend of gilets jaunes anti-government protests as Emmanuel Macron prepares to launch a three-month public debate process that he had hoped would channel protesters\u2019 anger away from the streets. Demonstrators were expected in Paris on Saturday where the government fears a repeat of last weekend\u2019s violent skirmishes with police. More than 5,000 police will be stationed in the capital and all local officers have been called back from leave. There could also be large protests in the small town of Bourges in central France after gilets jaunes groups online suggested its central location made it easy to reach and that it had less of a police presence. The town of 66,000 people \u2013 fearing clashes and violence \u2013 has closed museums, cleared building sites, removed parking meters and covered up electronic signs at bus stops. The local police chief on Friday banned any demonstration in Bourges historic centre, meaning protestors would have to keep to boulevards on the edge of the town. Many shop owners in the town said they could not afford to shut their businesses on the first Saturday of the January sales and would stay open until the last minute, closing only if there was a security risk \u2013 but fearing the majority of customers would stay away. Gilets jaunes demonstrators have continued to barricade roundabouts across France. The government said about 60% of speed cameras across France had been damaged or destroyed since the start of the protest movement in November. Officials said the speed cameras that do remain in use had shown more drivers breaking speed limits, presumably thinking they would not be caught. Although the gilets jaunes protests \u2013 named after the yellow hi-vis jackets worn by demonstrators \u2013 began in November as a revolt against fuel tax, local politicians said fury over this summer\u2019s move to cut speeds to 80km per hour (50mph) on many secondary roads had played an important roll in mobilising protests in the countryside. \u201cPeople are still complaining about it in the regions,\u201d Christophe Jerretie, an MP for Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche party in Corr\u00e8ze, said of the speed limits. Some protesters want the speed limit changes scrapped but the government believes the measure, which will be evaluated fully next year, has already saved hundreds of lives. The nationwide \u201cgreat national debate\u201d, which the president suggested in December as a solution to gilets jaunes\u2019 complaints that citizens do not have enough say in policy, will launch on Tuesday. But it would be an unprecedented exercise that has proved complex to organise. The head of France\u2019s national debates commission, Chantal Jouanno, withdrew her participation in Macron\u2019s debate this week amid outrage over her \u20ac14,666 monthly salary, leaving the government scrabbling to reorganise proceedings. Questions remained over whether the debate process would be focused on town-hall meetings and whether the government would take into account what was said. The topics to be discussed included the tax system, reform of state institutions as well as democracy and citizenship. Fears have been raised that groups such as the powerful lobby against same-sex marriage would use the debate to reopen discussion on society issues. But the government said topics such as same-sex marriage, which came into force in France in 2013 amid massive street protests, would not be up for discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the question to roll back on abortion, the death penalty or equal marriage,\u201d the government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said. Macron and his party want to hark back to the big door-to-door consultation on the nation\u2019s problems that he set up before his presidential bid in 2017. But an Odoxa poll found seven out of 10 French people did not think the debate, which begins next week, would be useful for the country. In the meantime, the government has focused on law and order measures in response to violence at gilets jaunes protests as a way to try to win back support for the centrist, pro-business Macron, particularly among voters on the centre-right. The prime minister has promised new laws, including setting up a register of rioters, similar to that used to deter football hooligans, to force them to report to police and prevent them from joining demonstrations. Human rights lawyers have said some of the proposals could go against the French constitutional right to protest. But the government has been convinced that showing \u201cauthority\u201d was crucial to win support back to Macron before European elections. Two recent polls have shown approval ratings for Macron and the prime minister rising again after a period of decline \u2013 although approval ratings for the president remained beneath the symbolically low level of 30%. A counter protest against the gilets jaunes demonstrators has been scheduled for 27 January in Paris. Annual Cevipof polling released in Le Figaro on Friday showed what the political scientist Bruno Cautr\u00e8s called the highest level of \u201cmistrust and anger\u201d at French politicians and state institutions in 10 years of polling.",

Back to Watford, meanwhile, as Roberto Pereyra\u2019s agent claims that Chelsea are interested in snapping up the Watford wide man, though they face competition from Torino. \u201cMazzarri likes him,\u201d he said, referring to the Torino manager, \u201cbut so does Sarri.\u201d Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham are all keen on Chelsea\u2019s Michy Batshuayi, whose season-long loan to Valencia has been cut short because he\u2019s not very good. All three clubs would hope to sign him on a similarly temporary arrangement, and the Mail adds West Ham and Galatasaray to the mix for good measure. Leicester have rejected an offer from Huddersfield for Shinji Okazaki. QPR want \u00a310m for the midfielder Eberechi Eze, with Bournemouth, Brighton and Crystal Palace interested. Everton are preparing a \u00a315m bid for Southampton\u2019s Portuguese full-back Cedric. Josh Bohui, a 19-year-old forward who has shown such promise in the Manchester United youth system that, according to the Mirror, he \u201chas been dubbed the new Andy Cole\u201d, might leave when his contract expires in the summer, with Barcelona and Monaco showing interest.",

Great. Well, in 2014 Howard\u2019s face appeared on the Totnes \u00a310 note, an honour bestowed on the West Country\u2019s most famous residents. Some more facts?

Poetry, feminism and community are underlying themes. The exhibition is called Crone Music, awakening memories of persecuted witches and putting her art in the big picture of feminist history. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.camdenartscentre.org/whats-on/view/gibson\">Camden Arts Centre, NW3, Friday 18 January to 31 March</a></em></p> <h2>Bridget Riley</h2> <p>It is a big year for Bridget Riley, with a major retrospective in October at the Hayward Gallery. She starts with a new abstract painting, Messengers, at the National Gallery and this intelligent artist is bound to strike up subtle relationships with the collection. Her work investigates the nature of perception and is one of the glories of British modern art. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/messengers-by-bridget-riley-a-new-work-at-the-national-gallery\">The National Gallery, WC2, from Thursday 17 January</a></em></p> <h2>Rachel Kneebone</h2> <p>A column of flesh flows in the middle of the V&amp;A\u2019s courtyard of Renaissance sculpture. Except it is not flesh, it\u2019s porcelain. Kneebone has modelled hosts of nudes in white-glazed hardened clay in a cascade of eroticism and suffering that recalls Rodin\u2019s sculptural ensemble The Gates of Hell. Kneebone shows her seductive inferno among the sensual statues of Giambologna and Vincenzo de Rossi. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/about-the-rachel-kneebone-display\">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 14 January 2021</a></em></p> <h2>Klimt/Schiele</h2> <p>An exhibition of sumptuously carnal drawings. Gustav Klimt created fantastic dream images in Freud\u2019s Vienna at the start of the 20th century.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best ... films Colette (15) (Wash Westmoreland, 2018, UK) 112 mins Intelligent, committed biopic of the French writer, AKA Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, portrayed by Keira Knightley as a sharp-witted country girl who is forced to fight for her rights in the sleazy atmosphere of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris. Dominic West is on typically exuberant form as her husband, man about town Willy, who takes credit for her writing in an early exercise in literary branding. The Favourite (15) (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2018, Ire/UK/US) 119 mins Entertainingly bonkers account of royal power struggles in the early 18th century, with Golden Globe winning Olivia Colman on rip-roaring form as the needy, petulant Queen Anne, and Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone as, respectively, power broker Sarah Churchill and wannabe newbie Abigail Hill. Deserves every award it is bound to get. The Front Runner (15) (Jason Reitman, 2018, US) 113 mins Understated political drama about a presidential candidate under siege by the press: the candidate is Gary Hart, who was on course to challenge George HW Bush in 1988 before allegations of an affair emerged. Hart is played by that old smoothie Hugh Jackman, and director Jason Reitman resists the temptation to tell a grandstanding story, preferring to concentrate on what the public expects from its politicians, and vice versa. Stan &amp; Ollie (PG) (Jon S Baird, 2018, UK/Can/US) 98 mins A convincing approximation of the celebrated double act, with Steve Coogan as Laurel and John C Reilly as Hardy. This catches them in the early 1950s, on a music hall tour of the UK, a melancholic vision of legends in decline \u2013 not dissimilar to the 2017 Gloria Grahame biopic Film Stars Don\u2019t Die in Liverpool. A wistful treatment with low-key charm, evoking a vanished era. Mary Poppins Returns (U) (Rob Marshall, 2018, US) 130 mins Disney\u2019s sequel to its celebrated family hit plays more like a remake: it\u2019s tonally identical to its predecessor, with no discernible difference to the action being set a generation later. The VFX are ritzier, to be sure, and Emily Blunt makes a sterner Poppins than Julie Andrews. Other than that, you basically get what you got in 1964. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Five Day Forecast Now in its fifth year, the Five Day Forecast festival \u2013 curated by website The Line of Best Fit \u2013 has championed the likes of Pale Waves and Grace Carter. This year, its impressive lineup of new talent includes electropop practitioner Emily Burns, PC Music maverick Felicita and Gently Tender, a supergroup of sorts made up of members of Palma Violets and the Big Moon. The Lexington, N1, Monday 14 to Friday 18 January The Wave Pictures Leicestershire\u2019s finest indie ramblers, now celebrating their 20th year, head out on tour in support of last year\u2019s 18th album, Look Inside Your Heart. If you\u2019re questioning their old-school indie credentials then you\u2019ll be happy to hear that 2016\u2019s vinyl-only A Season in Hull was recorded live using just one mic. Summerhall, Edinburgh, Friday 18 January; touring to 21 February Ben Howard Do you want to hear a fun fact about the otherwise not obviously very fun singer-songwriter Ben Howard? Great. Well, in 2014 Howard\u2019s face appeared on the Totnes \u00a310 note, an honour bestowed on the West Country\u2019s most famous residents. Some more facts? Well, Howard has released three albums, won two Brit awards and has a famous fan in the shape of Noah Cyrus. That\u2019s it. O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Wednesday 16 to 19; touring to 25 January Youngr Asked recently who he\u2019d most like to collaborate with, the YouTube-dominating one-man band and son of Kid Creole, Dario Darnell AKA Youngr, said, erm, Simply Red. Fingers crossed he\u2019ll ditch any planned cover of Something Got Me Started in favour of his usual crowd-pleaser: a joyous live remix of the Temper Trap\u2019s Sweet Disposition. The Deaf Institute, Manchester, Thursday 17; Village Underground, EC2, Friday 18 January MC Jorge Rossy Vibes Quintet Like pianist Brad Mehldau, with whom he played drums for more than a decade, Barcelona-born multi-instrumentalist Jorge Rossy likes reflective jazz with a sting in its tail. Rossy\u2019s vibraphone skills steer this fine Cool School-influenced quintet \u2013 deviously serpentine saxist Mark Turner and former Miles Davis drummer Al Foster feature in a classy lineup. PizzaExpress Jazz Club, N1, Tuesday 15 &amp; Wednesday 16 January JF Four of the best ... classical concerts SoundState The Southbank Centre\u2019s latest new-music venture involves three of its resident orchestras as well as the superb Ensemble Modern. Flautist Claire Chase and composers Du Yun and Rebecca Saunders are the featured artists, while other premieres include Louis Andriessen, Helen Grime, James Dillon and Dai Fujikura. Southbank Centre, SE1, Wednesday 16 to 20 January Queen of Spades Stefan Herheim\u2019s Tchaikovsky staging, first seen in Amsterdam in 2016, is perhaps the most eagerly anticipated new show in the Royal Opera\u2019s current season. Aleksandrs Antonenko is Gherman, with Antonio Pappano conducting. Royal Opera House, WC2, Sunday 13 January to 1 February Mahler and Brahms Mark Elder is taking his time over his Brahms cycle with the Britten Sinfonia. After conducting the First Symphony 14 months ago, he now moves on to the Second. They are being played alongside Mahler song cycles and 20th-century British music; in this concert the Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen and Britten\u2019s Suite on English Folk Tunes. London, Thursday 17; Saffron Walden, Friday 18; Norwich, 19 January BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra Thomas Dausgaard conducts the latest free concert for Radio 3\u2019s Hear and Now. As well as the first performance of David Fennessy\u2019s BBC commission The Ground, it includes the local premieres of Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd\u2019s magnificent Seventh Symphony and Simon Steen-Andersen\u2019s Piano Concerto, with Nicolas Hodges. City Halls, Glasgow, Saturday 12 January AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Beatrice Gibson Trump\u2019s inauguration and a 1929 film script by avant-garde icon Gertrude Stein feature in two new free-wheeling, collaborative films by Beatrice Gibson. Poetry, feminism and community are underlying themes. The exhibition is called Crone Music, awakening memories of persecuted witches and putting her art in the big picture of feminist history. Camden Arts Centre, NW3, Friday 18 January to 31 March Bridget Riley It is a big year for Bridget Riley, with a major retrospective in October at the Hayward Gallery. She starts with a new abstract painting, Messengers, at the National Gallery and this intelligent artist is bound to strike up subtle relationships with the collection. Her work investigates the nature of perception and is one of the glories of British modern art. The National Gallery, WC2, from Thursday 17 January Rachel Kneebone A column of flesh flows in the middle of the V&amp;A\u2019s courtyard of Renaissance sculpture. Except it is not flesh, it\u2019s porcelain. Kneebone has modelled hosts of nudes in white-glazed hardened clay in a cascade of eroticism and suffering that recalls Rodin\u2019s sculptural ensemble The Gates of Hell. Kneebone shows her seductive inferno among the sensual statues of Giambologna and Vincenzo de Rossi. Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, SW7, to 14 January 2021 Klimt/Schiele An exhibition of sumptuously carnal drawings. Gustav Klimt created fantastic dream images in Freud\u2019s Vienna at the start of the 20th century. His sketches and designs for these works are masterpieces in themselves with a curvaceous, loving line that makes the women he portrays powerful and charismatic. His younger friend Schiele takes that same eroticism into an expressionist arena of isolation, anxiety and desperate intimacy. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, to 3 February Robert Mapplethorpe This Artist Rooms exhibition offers a raw and provocative encounter with Mapplethorpe\u2019s dark beauty. This Caravaggio-esque photographer of flesh and flowers changed the very idea of the camera as an artistic tool in 1980s New York when Cindy Sherman and Andres Serrano were also pushing its boundaries. For him, photography is not a factual record but a means of self-expression. Desire and feeling blaze in his images.

Before long, in this fond account, he is spotting the playwright Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco (with his \u201cpale, clown-like face\u201d), and dining next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/26/marlene-dietrich-androgyny-sexuality-exhibitions\" title=\"\">Marlene Dietrich</a>, who keeps complaining that her husband \u201chad never allowed her to eat hot dogs\u201d.</p> <p>The author is soon running the arts pages of Le Monde\u2019s English edition, which in this golden age funds a beautiful flat in the Marais district. There follows a succession of flings with women \u2013 his ardent reminiscences of them are very much, to put it as charitably as possible, of their time \u2013 and much more name-dropping.

Stricter editing wouldn\u2019t have hurt \u2013 and, existential or not, an Englishman ought to know that Cambridge does not have quadrangles (they are courts). Peppiatt left Paris for London in 1994, and the book ends with him returning in 2014, only to think the place now \u201clacking in identity and purpose\u201d. As a one-time cultural migrant to the city myself, I\u2019d suggest he needn\u2019t worry: the Marais is now so expensive that the real Paris has simply moved elsewhere.</p> <p><em> \u2022 Existential Englishman by Michael Peppiatt (Bloomsbury Publishing, \u00a325).

Before long, in this fond account, he is spotting the playwright Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco (with his \u201cpale, clown-like face\u201d), and dining next to Marlene Dietrich, who keeps complaining that her husband \u201chad never allowed her to eat hot dogs\u201d. The author is soon running the arts pages of Le Monde\u2019s English edition, which in this golden age funds a beautiful flat in the Marais district. There follows a succession of flings with women \u2013 his ardent reminiscences of them are very much, to put it as charitably as possible, of their time \u2013 and much more name-dropping. Sonia Orwell, a quondam lover, pops up now again; there is an inscrutable appearance by John Cage. Peppiatt goes wine-tasting with Graham Greene, and once finds himself sitting next to Samuel Beckett on a cafe terrace. (Nothing, fittingly, is said.) First among these luminaries is Francis Bacon, already the author\u2019s friend before Paris, and with whom many spectacularly boozy meals are shared. \u201cI have to be conscious of Picasso the whole time, you see,\u201d Bacon mutters. \u201cThere\u2019s no way round it.\u201d Perhaps the most vivid character, however, is the chain-smoking French doctor who, when Peppiatt comes to see him complaining that he is tired, retorts: \u201cTired? Tired? You don\u2019t think I\u2019m tired seeing sick people for ten hours every day?\u201d As the decades roll on in a buzz of embassy invitations, freelance art writing and luxurious apartments, the book passes by easily in the manner of quaffable gossip. Stricter editing wouldn\u2019t have hurt \u2013 and, existential or not, an Englishman ought to know that Cambridge does not have quadrangles (they are courts). Peppiatt left Paris for London in 1994, and the book ends with him returning in 2014, only to think the place now \u201clacking in identity and purpose\u201d. As a one-time cultural migrant to the city myself, I\u2019d suggest he needn\u2019t worry: the Marais is now so expensive that the real Paris has simply moved elsewhere. \u2022 Existential Englishman by Michael Peppiatt (Bloomsbury Publishing, \u00a325).

      "bodyText": "Residents of Sydney\u2019s Opal Tower will be allowed to return home this weekend but the building\u2019s own strata committee is warning them not to. The stoush between the tower\u2019s builder and its strata committee has emerged as residents wait on the result of a New South Wales government report that hasn\u2019t yet been released. The builder, Icon, has given \u201cthe overwhelming majority of residents\u201d the all-clear to move back, if they wish, starting on Friday evening. But they are being directly opposed by the strata committee, who told residents not to return until more safety reviews were completed, and criticised the builder for \u201cplacing pressure on residents to return\u201d. Two reports, commissioned by Icon, have declared the building safe. But a report by the NSW government and one commissioned by the body corporate itself remained either secret or incomplete on Friday. On 4 January, the planning minister, Anthony Roberts, told media he believed \u201creoccupying the building should wait for the independent investigation\u2019s initial report\u201d, and hoped it would be released this week. On Friday, that report had still not been released. A spokesman for Roberts said the minister would receive an \u201cinterim report\u201d on Friday afternoon, and would make it public \u201cwithin days\u201d. The NSW government\u2019s report is being prepared by two professors of engineering, and the body corporate report is being conducted by engineering firm Cardno. The two already-completed reports were prepared by engineering firms WSP and Rincovitch Partners. On Friday, an email from the strata committee, obtained by Guardian Australia, told residents to wait for all four reports to be completed. \u201cThe strata committee has requested the builder not to place any pressure on the residents to return,\u201d it said. \u201cYour safety is our utmost priority. As such we urge residents NOT to agree to reoccupy the building until the [four reports] are satisfied. \u201cResidents should err on the side of caution. It is important to ensure that residents do not take any unnecessary risks.\u201d But a spokeswoman for Icon defended the decision to let residents back in. \u201cWe\u2019d had two engineering firms declare that the building is safe for reoccupation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know there are a number of residents who are desperate to get home and we want to facilitate that as quickly as possible. It is entirely up to the residents whether they want to move in or not. Our view and the view of the engineers is that the building is safe to occupy.\u201d Roberts has previously said any decision to move back was ultimately one for the builder and residents. The state government has no power to stop residents moving back in. A spokesman for Cardno said the firm could not comment on when its report would be released. But Icon said residents could reoccupy the building, even without the government report. \u201cWe currently have confirmation from the design engineer, WSP, and third-party engineer, Rincovitch Partners, that the building is safe to occupy following completion of the stabilisation works, which are due for completion Friday evening,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWhile we would welcome the department\u2019s [report], the confirmation regarding the suitability of the structure lives with the engineers engaged to undertake that work.\u201d Opal Tower in Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park developed a dramatic crack on Christmas Eve, and was then evacuated a second time on 27 December, to allow repair works to be conducted. While many residents will be allowed in this weekend, 50 of the building\u2019s 390 apartments will remain unfit for habitation for up to six weeks.",

Ramos\u2019s dual role as John Laurens/Philip Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s all-conquering musical has catapulted him into a career that\u2019s so impossibly busy, you can forgive him for losing track a little.

There\u2019s more to come, including a sort-of reunion with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/01/lin-manuel-miranda-trump-musical-dont-know-how-score\">Miranda</a> (more of which later), <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3741700/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">the next Godzilla instalment</a>, and the crime thriller he\u2019s currently shooting in Massachusetts with Liam Neeson, titled <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1838556/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Honest Thief</a>.

It is set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/03/last-battle-brooklyn-new-york-americas-most-unaffordable-place-buy-home\">neighbourhood of Brooklyn</a>; a stone\u2019s throw from his native Bushwick. His own life could have turned out much like that of his character Manny\u2019s, he says. Of Puerto Rican descent, Ramos grew up in the projects, one of three children, regularly facing eviction and seeing his mother struggle to put food on the table. Manny also lives in the projects with his mother, his pregnant girlfriend and his young daughter. He\u2019s just got a job, but is presented with a dilemma when he films police shooting a black neighbour outside a convenience store on his phone. The moment consciously recalls a real-life incident in nearby Staten Island in 2014, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a> died after police used a chokehold to subdue him: the struggle was filmed by a friend of Garner\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cThe world you see in the film \u2013 that was pretty much the world I grew up in,\u201d says Ramos. \u201cIt was hard, man. It was hard knowing that you walk into a store sometimes and you\u2019re wearing a baseball cap and a hoodie and some baggy jeans, or your skin is a little darker, and the clerk is just staring at you a little bit harder. The cops treat you a little differently.\u201d He has friends in jail, neighbours who died. \u201cNow people in America are starting to feel what people in the hood have felt for years because now you can see it on a video, but we\u2019ve already been seeing this shit for years.\u201d</p> <p>Ramos\u2019s ticket out of that life came almost accidentally. He casually auditioned for a school play only to find himself cast in a major role. \u201cI was like, \u2018Read a script? I don\u2019t even do my homework. What makes you think I\u2019m gonna learn all these lines?\u2019\u201d But his drama teacher persisted. Two years later, after he failed to apply for college, she helped him win a scholarship to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d104cd6e668cdb1775d0373591eeacbaeb1af29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d104cd6e668cdb1775d0373591eeacbaeb1af29/0_164_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramos with Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramos with Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But opportunities for an aspiring Hispanic actor were so thin on the ground, that he thought about quitting. So, about five years ago, when he found himself auditioning for an in-development musical called Hamilton, performing the character Hamilton\u2019s song My Shot (the one he was rapping down the phone to me) to Miranda and his team, it really was his shot. \u201cI was just pouring it out, bro. I was singing those words as the character, but I was really singing those words as myself, cos I was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m not throwing away my shot for nothing. I\u2019m about to give you every ounce I got in my body and soul and mind and my spirit.\u2019 That was kind of how it popped off.\u201d</p> <p>It was the second time Ramos had auditioned in front of Miranda. The first was four years earlier, for a national tour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/01/usa.theatre\">In the Heights</a>, Miranda\u2019s previous musical, set among the Hispanic community in Washington Heights, Manhattan. He came close but didn\u2019t get the part. Everyone came to see Hamilton, though. Ramos performed in front of the Obamas, and Mike Pence, on the eve Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 the night a fellow cast member made <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/mike-pence-hamilton.html\">a gracious plea to the vice-president for tolerance</a>. \u201cThe most important thing for me about that night, more than the speech, is that Mike Pence saw that story unfold in front of him. He will never be able to unsee it,\u201d says Ramos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5af41c9f54bd043c41c77ca5e9db0e44d5d96222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5af41c9f54bd043c41c77ca5e9db0e44d5d96222/0_0_6000_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ramos, left, in Monsters and Men.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ramos, left, in Monsters and Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Neon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spike Lee also came along and cast Ramos in She\u2019s Gotta Have It \u2013 a series based on <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091939/\">his feature debut</a>, with Ramos in the role Lee originally played himself. For A Star Is Born, he had to go the conventional audition route and was one of the final pieces of the puzzle, he says, but was \u201csuper-honoured\u201d to be part of it. \u201cThat movie was special from the moment we were all on set,\u201d he says. He had a blast, popping champagne on private jets with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a> (in character, of course), and watching her singing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper\">Bradley Cooper</a> in the parking lot scene: \u201cShe was just freestyling, coming up with lyrics on the spot.\u201d <br><br>Today, Ramos considers Miranda a mentor. \u201cLin has taught me a lot. In conversations we\u2019ve had but also just in the way he goes about his business. I was speaking to him one time, I cracked a joke and said: \u2018Oh man, I gotta stop talking hood.\u2019 And Lin said, \u2018You don\u2019t ever have to change the way you speak; you just have to make sure people understand you.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Damn! Punch to the gut!\u2019\u201d Now it has come full circle. Ramos\u2019s next gig is <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321510/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">the movie version of In the Heights</a>. He is playing the lead, Usnavi \u2013 the role Miranda himself played in the original stage version.</p> <p>For the first time, Ramos is thinking past tomorrow, you could say, but not <em>too</em> hard. \u201cI\u2019m being more selective about what I do, but really it\u2019s just, if I love it, I\u2019ma do it. It\u2019s that simple. I could be paid $100 or a million. The goal for me right now is just to do stuff that feeds me, that fuels me to be the best person I can be and put out the best stuff I can put out.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Monsters and Men is released on 18 January.</p> <p>\u2022This article was amended on 11 January 2019 to correct the sentence that said Ramos sang My Shot in the Broadway production of Hamilton. In fact it was sung by Lin-Miranda Manuel; Ramos performed the song in his audition.</p>",

It was hard knowing that you walk into a store sometimes and you\u2019re wearing a baseball cap and a hoodie and some baggy jeans, or your skin is a little darker, and the clerk is just staring at you a little bit harder. The cops treat you a little differently.\u201d He has friends in jail, neighbours who died. \u201cNow people in America are starting to feel what people in the hood have felt for years because now you can see it on a video, but we\u2019ve already been seeing this shit for years.\u201d Ramos\u2019s ticket out of that life came almost accidentally. He casually auditioned for a school play only to find himself cast in a major role. \u201cI was like, \u2018Read a script? I don\u2019t even do my homework. What makes you think I\u2019m gonna learn all these lines?\u2019\u201d But his drama teacher persisted. Two years later, after he failed to apply for college, she helped him win a scholarship to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. But opportunities for an aspiring Hispanic actor were so thin on the ground, that he thought about quitting. So, about five years ago, when he found himself auditioning for an in-development musical called Hamilton, performing the character Hamilton\u2019s song My Shot (the one he was rapping down the phone to me) to Miranda and his team, it really was his shot. \u201cI was just pouring it out, bro. I was singing those words as the character, but I was really singing those words as myself, cos I was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m not throwing away my shot for nothing. I\u2019m about to give you every ounce I got in my body and soul and mind and my spirit.\u2019 That was kind of how it popped off.\u201d It was the second time Ramos had auditioned in front of Miranda. The first was four years earlier, for a national tour of In the Heights, Miranda\u2019s previous musical, set among the Hispanic community in Washington Heights, Manhattan. He came close but didn\u2019t get the part. Everyone came to see Hamilton, though. Ramos performed in front of the Obamas, and Mike Pence, on the eve Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 the night a fellow cast member made a gracious plea to the vice-president for tolerance. \u201cThe most important thing for me about that night, more than the speech, is that Mike Pence saw that story unfold in front of him. He will never be able to unsee it,\u201d says Ramos. Spike Lee also came along and cast Ramos in She\u2019s Gotta Have It \u2013 a series based on his feature debut, with Ramos in the role Lee originally played himself. For A Star Is Born, he had to go the conventional audition route and was one of the final pieces of the puzzle, he says, but was \u201csuper-honoured\u201d to be part of it. \u201cThat movie was special from the moment we were all on set,\u201d he says. He had a blast, popping champagne on private jets with Lady Gaga (in character, of course), and watching her singing to Bradley Cooper in the parking lot scene: \u201cShe was just freestyling, coming up with lyrics on the spot.\u201d Today, Ramos considers Miranda a mentor. \u201cLin has taught me a lot. In conversations we\u2019ve had but also just in the way he goes about his business. I was speaking to him one time, I cracked a joke and said: \u2018Oh man, I gotta stop talking hood.\u2019 And Lin said, \u2018You don\u2019t ever have to change the way you speak; you just have to make sure people understand you.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Damn! Punch to the gut!\u2019\u201d Now it has come full circle. Ramos\u2019s next gig is the movie version of In the Heights. He is playing the lead, Usnavi \u2013 the role Miranda himself played in the original stage version. For the first time, Ramos is thinking past tomorrow, you could say, but not too hard. \u201cI\u2019m being more selective about what I do, but really it\u2019s just, if I love it, I\u2019ma do it. It\u2019s that simple. I could be paid $100 or a million. The goal for me right now is just to do stuff that feeds me, that fuels me to be the best person I can be and put out the best stuff I can put out.\u201d \u2022 Monsters and Men is released on 18 January. \u2022This article was amended on 11 January 2019 to correct the sentence that said Ramos sang My Shot in the Broadway production of Hamilton. In fact it was sung by Lin-Miranda Manuel; Ramos performed the song in his audition.",

And there\u2019s a flourishing movement to get our homes as dirt-free, as sparkly and as fragrant as humanly possible.</p> <p>While the country is falling apart around us, with Brexit bananas, austerity anguish and climate meltdown misery, we need to turn to bleaching our toilets. This is no coincidence. Cleaning helps us find our way through a dirty world. It can heal us, soothe us, fix us. There\u2019s an almost instant gratification to cleaning. No job is too large, too daunting, too much of a brain drain.</p> <p>From dusting to vacuuming to mopping, there\u2019s a simple, ritualistic process we can follow, and which can make us feel as if we have achieved something. We have been able to make a positive impact on the negative turmoil of the world. Work is precarious and money is tight, but my sink is spotless and still smells of Festive Fireside.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a mindfulness to cleaning. Concentrating on a task \u2013 be that just wiping down your kitchen cupboards with <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/mrs-hinchs-minkeh-finally-comes-13394009\" title=\"\">your Minkeh</a> \u2013 physically and mentally allows us to escape whatever\u2019s going on around us. It lets troubled minds find a place of peacefulness. Following a process from start to finish gets us to focus on just that one job in hand, dispelling all other anxieties and worries. Cleaning soothes.</p> <p>I know this. At the end of last year, my brother died \u2013 suddenly, unexpectedly and, unfathomably, aged 64, from a heart attack. In the immediate aftermath of the news, I was at a loss as to what to do. So I got out my neglected collection of cleaning products, and for a few hours, I scrubbed my bathroom, from top to bottom, sobbing intermittently, going through memories as I tackled mould, coming to terms with death as I removed layers of dust. At the end of my weeping housework, my bathroom looked clean for the first time in a long while. But more than that: I felt satisfied, soothed, and ready to return to the world stronger.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13YTCu0WpH8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/13YTCu0WpH8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/23/christmas-father-death-grief-pavlova-mother\">The first Christmas after my father\u2019s death, I took my grief out on a pavlova | Jean Hannah Edelstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe in years gone by, when something so awful happened, we would have gone out and found resolve in a pint or three, or found happiness through a bout of retail therapy.

For those not in the know, Hinch is an Essex hairdresser catapulted to fame through her highly watchable Instagram stories showing her \u2026 cleaning. Her followers have skyrocketed over a few months to 1.4 million people. This \u201cHinch army\u201d faithfully watch her clean her immaculate house as she shares her domestic tips, which include giving names to all her products and working through a list of chores (mostly accompanied by a snatch of high-octane music) and always \u2013 always \u2013 ending the day with putting the sink to bed at night. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but trust me, it\u2019s addictive. Her meteoric rise is no flash in a pan (or Flash in a toilet pan). We\u2019re suddenly surrounded by a surge of love for keeping everything spick and span. From Facebook groups for people addicted to the disinfectant Zoflora (you\u2019d think it was the elixir of life, the way people are stockpiling it) to the festive TV adverts advocating giving a spray that prevents the smell of poo as Secret Santa presents, cleaning has been promoted to the status of a hobby. And there\u2019s a flourishing movement to get our homes as dirt-free, as sparkly and as fragrant as humanly possible. While the country is falling apart around us, with Brexit bananas, austerity anguish and climate meltdown misery, we need to turn to bleaching our toilets. This is no coincidence. Cleaning helps us find our way through a dirty world. It can heal us, soothe us, fix us. There\u2019s an almost instant gratification to cleaning. No job is too large, too daunting, too much of a brain drain. From dusting to vacuuming to mopping, there\u2019s a simple, ritualistic process we can follow, and which can make us feel as if we have achieved something. We have been able to make a positive impact on the negative turmoil of the world. Work is precarious and money is tight, but my sink is spotless and still smells of Festive Fireside. There\u2019s also a mindfulness to cleaning. Concentrating on a task \u2013 be that just wiping down your kitchen cupboards with your Minkeh \u2013 physically and mentally allows us to escape whatever\u2019s going on around us. It lets troubled minds find a place of peacefulness. Following a process from start to finish gets us to focus on just that one job in hand, dispelling all other anxieties and worries. Cleaning soothes. I know this. At the end of last year, my brother died \u2013 suddenly, unexpectedly and, unfathomably, aged 64, from a heart attack. In the immediate aftermath of the news, I was at a loss as to what to do. So I got out my neglected collection of cleaning products, and for a few hours, I scrubbed my bathroom, from top to bottom, sobbing intermittently, going through memories as I tackled mould, coming to terms with death as I removed layers of dust. At the end of my weeping housework, my bathroom looked clean for the first time in a long while. But more than that: I felt satisfied, soothed, and ready to return to the world stronger. Maybe in years gone by, when something so awful happened, we would have gone out and found resolve in a pint or three, or found happiness through a bout of retail therapy. But austerity\u2019s purse strings have made a mindless bender in the pub or the shop more hassle than helpful. Sophie Hinchcliffe herself admits cleaning helped her with worry and anxiety attacks; many of her followers feel similarly. So don\u2019t scoff at Dave and Vera, but rather try a spot of Hinching yourself. You may find that, like the Hinch army, you\u2019re not just sweeping away the day\u2019s dirt, you\u2019re sweeping away the daily grind. \u2022 Kathryn Hearn is a Guardian assistant production editor",

Where Outcaste explored the jazz- and funk-influenced fringes of the underground, Singh\u2019s Anokha was more raw, inviting punk bands to play along with his tabla sets and incorporating high-energy jungle into the mix. British Asian composer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fREI-cd1tPw\" title=\"\">Shammi Pithia</a> says this form of nightlife was transformative for the community. \u201cWhen I went to the nights, I saw Asian people in a different light,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually I would associate the community with family and being at home but there, people could do their own thing and enjoy themselves like anyone else. There was a sense that this music was for us and by us, and that was very powerful.\u201d</p> <p>So why did that power fade? Jobanputra feels that the novelty of the movement\u2019s difference wore off and the scene suffered. \u201cIt creatively ran out of steam,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to regurgitate the same ideas.\u201d Instead, he now sees British Asian success in individual acts making music, rather than a collaborative movement, having signed producer Naughty Boy in 2012 \u2013 who went on to record with Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 and developing grime act Koomz. \u201cSubcultures are needed to foster a sense of identity,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pin the Asian identity to things as easily now because the culture has moved on. The younger generation doesn\u2019t have any inhibition; they can be themselves without questioning. Whereas we needed something to rail against to bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Sawhney has more controversial opinions. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/41231/1/how-9-11-twin-towers-changed-british-asian-culture\" title=\"\">After 9/11, something shifted</a> and I didn\u2019t hear of Asian acts in the mainstream,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like a segregation took place and maybe that\u2019s because we were having a war on a country of brown people and that made the country far more intolerant of minorities.\u201d Sawhney says record label A&amp;Rs are less willing to gamble on acts now: \u201cIf I was to experiment like I was in the 90s now and tried to get signed, it would be bloody tough going.\u201d</p> <p>But if we take Jobanputra\u2019s more optimistic view, there may no longer be the need for a separate British Asian scene because integration is becoming more commonplace and acts can exist within the industry while embodying a new multiculturalism. Acts like pop-rap producer Steel Banglez references heritage in his name \u2013 the religious \u201csteel bangle\u201d, or kara, worn by Sikhs \u2013 but he makes music that is closer to grime and afrobeats than anything resembling the Asian underground.

So, I\u2019ll use my heritage if I need to, since we can\u2019t keep up a culture of exclusion \u2013 there needs to be representation across the whole of the mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Nitin Sawhney\u2019s </em><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/nitin-sawhney-brexit\" title=\"\">Brexit \u2013 A Rational Anthem for a National Tantrum</a>, is at the Barbican, on London, 23 February.</em></p>",

It made me proud to be a British Asian musician.\u201d Perhaps, then, the shedding of the \u201cunderground\u201d tag is a good thing: a symptom of acceptance. \u201cNow, British Asians aren\u2019t just underground, they\u2019re working in all fields,\u201d Pithia says. \u201cTalvin and Nitin\u2019s albums set the pathway for the music to grow far above the underground \u2013 in a sense, \u2018underground\u2019 may have been an oppressive term.\u201d Even Sawhney admits that \u201cin the 90s I was making a strong point of integrating Indian classical music into everything I did deliberately, but nowadays I\u2019m at the point where if I want to write music that has nothing to do with being Asian, I can do that also.\u201d As such, he has been commissioned to create a new version of that most British song of all: the national anthem. \u201cI\u2019m travelling around the country and creating a multicultural anthem in response to Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to see Britain as a multicultural society now more than ever. So, I\u2019ll use my heritage if I need to, since we can\u2019t keep up a culture of exclusion \u2013 there needs to be representation across the whole of the mainstream.\u201d \u2022 Nitin Sawhney\u2019s Brexit \u2013 A Rational Anthem for a National Tantrum, is at the Barbican, on London, 23 February.",

Omar Sy\u2019s Driss purloins a jade egg from his moneyed, quadriplegic employer (and soon-to-be bestie) Philippe, while Kevin Hart\u2019s Del nicks a vintage copy of Huckleberry Finn from Phillip. His passion for the musical stylings of Earth, Wind and Fire has been swapped out for a love of Aretha Franklin. That Philippe fares much better than his Stateside equivalent on his first date with his romantic pen pal counts for something, but the most meaningful alteration has to be the relocation from Paris to New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/10/upside-review-horrific-odd-couple-disability-drama-kevin-hart-bryan-cranston\">The Upside review \u2013 Bryan Cranston heads up horrific odd-couple disability drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A giggly, late-night trip to get munchies from Manhattan\u2019s storied Gray\u2019s Papaya hot dog stand constitutes the only dash of specificity in a film that has otherwise been scrubbed of its time and place. Whatever the original may have had to say about socioeconomic disparity in France has been not lost, but actively disposed of in translation by an industry that values the generic as safe. The original was widely criticized in its native France for trafficking in stereotypes, but at least its distance between the banlieue and the tonier streets of Paris was real.

      "bodyText": "For a viewer already familiar with the French film The Intouchables, watching its newly released American remake The Upside can often feel like one of those games challenging you to spot the differences between two seemingly identical photos. The core of an unlikely friendship between a wealthy white man and a black ex-con has been kept intact, and most of the elements changed stop at the superficial. Omar Sy\u2019s Driss purloins a jade egg from his moneyed, quadriplegic employer (and soon-to-be bestie) Philippe, while Kevin Hart\u2019s Del nicks a vintage copy of Huckleberry Finn from Phillip. His passion for the musical stylings of Earth, Wind and Fire has been swapped out for a love of Aretha Franklin. That Philippe fares much better than his Stateside equivalent on his first date with his romantic pen pal counts for something, but the most meaningful alteration has to be the relocation from Paris to New York. A giggly, late-night trip to get munchies from Manhattan\u2019s storied Gray\u2019s Papaya hot dog stand constitutes the only dash of specificity in a film that has otherwise been scrubbed of its time and place. Whatever the original may have had to say about socioeconomic disparity in France has been not lost, but actively disposed of in translation by an industry that values the generic as safe. The original was widely criticized in its native France for trafficking in stereotypes, but at least its distance between the banlieue and the tonier streets of Paris was real. The Upside makes a vagary of a vagary, with no sense of what the words \u201crich\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d mean in the present-day United States. Hollywood\u2019s ever-mounting need for fresh material has left its own past a graveyard of mangled intellectual property, and so The Upside arrives at the nose end of a spike in American remakes of more highly acclaimed foreign films. But the pattern of imports chosen for the dubious honor of a second life in the American entertainment industry suggests cause for concern in its emphasis on the pliable and familiar. Films once distinguished for their originality are then purchased for their potential sameness. Audiences taking in Neil Burger\u2019s fantasy of polite racial harmony will be treated to the trailer for Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke\u2019s take on the 2011 Mexican thriller Miss Bala. The true-ish story of Laura Guerrero, a beauty queen forcibly conscripted into collaboration with the La Estrella gang, was notable for its concentrations on fear and helplessness \u2013 two uncommon, unpredictable qualities in the protagonist of an action film. In the trailer for the upcoming remake, Gina Rodriguez\u2019s Gloria learns how to handle a rifle, wraps the DEA around her finger as a double agent, and unleashes hell in a few shots that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in one of the many Michael Mann knockoffs cluttering Best Buy discount bins. Those films cleanly pigeonholed into genre and boasting an easily pitched hook tend to make the trip across the Atlantic. Family comedies seem to fit the bill, even if they\u2019re coming from countries with a nastier sense of humor than would make sense to US audiences. Force Majeure hinges on cowardice, insecurity and male fragility, so who better to make all that palatable for Americans than Will Ferrell, playing opposite Julia-Louis Dreyfus? Perhaps casting Tom Hanks in the lead role of the American version of A Man Called Ove will take the edge off of all the misery and suicide attempts that precede the heartwarming togetherness of its back half. As for Toni Erdmann, slated to be reworked with Kristen Wiig, I pegged it as a more artfully shot, mean-spirited clone of Adam Sandler\u2019s That\u2019s My Boy when I first saw the film at Cannes in 2016. We\u2019ve been steadily recycling foreign horror for decades, lest we forget the J-horror boom of the early 2000s, in which Hollywood nicked the haunted-house conceit and the gaunt-faced ghost children while ditching the films\u2019 weirder curlicues. To his credit, Nicolas Pesce has made it clear that his re-remake of The Grudge will be its own creature, as if anticipating the phenomenon of international bland-ening discussed here.

Same goes for the thrillers in the vein of The Guilty, a Danish production about a cop on desk duty who solves a crime through the phone, soon to be remounted with Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead. An order for Americanization is not a death certificate for subtlety or quality, but these productions have intangible qualities \u2013 aloofness, a sadistic streak, a greater comfort with unhappy endings \u2013 unique to their homelands.

      "body": "<p>Civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan from explosive weapons rose by more than a third last year, against a downward trend globally, according to a survey seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>Most of the 4,260 civilians killed or injured in explosions in the country in 2018 \u2013 up from 3,119 in 2017 \u2013 were victims of suicide attacks, found <a href=\"https://aoav.org.uk/2019/2018-a-year-of-explosive-violence\">a report</a> by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).</p> <p>Globally, however, the picture was different. The report recorded a total of 22,335 civilian deaths and injuries from the use of explosive weapons in 2018, compared with 31,904 the previous year, suggesting civilian casualties fell by about a third. There was also a 26% decrease in attacks recorded on populated areas around the world.</p> <p>In total, 78% of civilians casualties recorded in Afghanistan were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \u2013 62% in suicide attacks, AOAV found. Civilian casualties caused by Isis explosives in Afghanistan rose by 90% compared with the year before. The number of civilian casualties from airstrikes almost doubled, from 238 in 2017 to 463 last year. The report attributed the increase \u2013 which the organisation said was probably underestimated, given that not all casualties are reported \u2013 to the US conducting a greater number of strikes aimed at the increased military presence.</p> <p>The findings follow a UN report last year that warned the killing and maiming of civilians in Afghanistan, mainly by IEDs, had reached \u201cextreme levels\u201d. In October, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d over a record number of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians by anti-government elements in the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-10T16:52:43/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Civilians killed or injured by explosive violence in Afghanistan last year\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-10T16:52:43/embed.html\">Civilians killed or injured by explosive violence in Afghanistan last year</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cDespite such positive news globally, once again, IEDs are causing more civilian casualties than any other type of explosive weapon,\u201d said Iain Overton, executive director of AOAV, a charity dedicated to reducing the impact of global armed violence.</p> <p>\u201cFor the eighth consecutive year, when explosive weapons were used in populated areas, 90% of those killed or injured were civilians.\u201d</p> <p>IEDs were responsible for 42% of civilian casualties from all explosive harm, while airstrikes caused 32% of harm. Ground-launched weapons caused 15% and attacks using multiple explosive weapons 9%.</p> <p>\u201cAgainst a fall in civilian casualties globally, we are seeing a rise in some countries, notably Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Libya,\u201d said Overton. \u201cAfghanistan has a record number of civilian deaths in 2018.\u201d</p> <p>Other countries where civilian casualties rose were Ethiopia, Gaza, Iran, the Philippines and Malaysia.</p> <p>The overall decrease in civilian casualties worldwide was largely due to the short-term defeat of Isis in Iraq and Syria, Overton said, as well as the decline of Boko Haram in Nigeria.</p> <p>Liam McDowall, a spokesperson for UNAWA, the agency in Afghanistan that provides details of civilian casualties to the security council, said its next report was due out in February. According to the latest UN figures, 8,050 civilians died or were wounded overall between January and September 2018. The use of suicide bombs and other IEDs by anti-government elements accounted for almost half the casualties. The UN expressed grave concern over the increase in direct targeting of civilians, including ethnic and religious minorities.</p> <p>McDowall, who said he could not comment on AOAV figures, confirmed that 2018 had brought a \u201crecord high\u201d in civilian casualties in Afghanistan for the past four years. Before 2014, the majority of casualties were the result of ground engagement between Afghan forces and insurgents.</p> <p>\u201cThe UN is concerned about the deliberate targeting of civilians and the use of suicide IEDs,\u201d said McDowall. \u201cOver the course of last year, because of the very high profile attacks and insurgencies, IEDs have become the largest cause of deaths.\u201d</p> <p>Civilian deaths and injuries in Yemen rose from 1,670 to 1,807 last year, a rise of just over 8%.

      "bodyText": "Civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan from explosive weapons rose by more than a third last year, against a downward trend globally, according to a survey seen by the Guardian. Most of the 4,260 civilians killed or injured in explosions in the country in 2018 \u2013 up from 3,119 in 2017 \u2013 were victims of suicide attacks, found a report by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV). Globally, however, the picture was different. The report recorded a total of 22,335 civilian deaths and injuries from the use of explosive weapons in 2018, compared with 31,904 the previous year, suggesting civilian casualties fell by about a third. There was also a 26% decrease in attacks recorded on populated areas around the world. In total, 78% of civilians casualties recorded in Afghanistan were caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) \u2013 62% in suicide attacks, AOAV found. Civilian casualties caused by Isis explosives in Afghanistan rose by 90% compared with the year before. The number of civilian casualties from airstrikes almost doubled, from 238 in 2017 to 463 last year. The report attributed the increase \u2013 which the organisation said was probably underestimated, given that not all casualties are reported \u2013 to the US conducting a greater number of strikes aimed at the increased military presence. The findings follow a UN report last year that warned the killing and maiming of civilians in Afghanistan, mainly by IEDs, had reached \u201cextreme levels\u201d. In October, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d over a record number of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians by anti-government elements in the country. \u201cDespite such positive news globally, once again, IEDs are causing more civilian casualties than any other type of explosive weapon,\u201d said Iain Overton, executive director of AOAV, a charity dedicated to reducing the impact of global armed violence. \u201cFor the eighth consecutive year, when explosive weapons were used in populated areas, 90% of those killed or injured were civilians.\u201d IEDs were responsible for 42% of civilian casualties from all explosive harm, while airstrikes caused 32% of harm. Ground-launched weapons caused 15% and attacks using multiple explosive weapons 9%. \u201cAgainst a fall in civilian casualties globally, we are seeing a rise in some countries, notably Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Libya,\u201d said Overton. \u201cAfghanistan has a record number of civilian deaths in 2018.\u201d Other countries where civilian casualties rose were Ethiopia, Gaza, Iran, the Philippines and Malaysia. The overall decrease in civilian casualties worldwide was largely due to the short-term defeat of Isis in Iraq and Syria, Overton said, as well as the decline of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Liam McDowall, a spokesperson for UNAWA, the agency in Afghanistan that provides details of civilian casualties to the security council, said its next report was due out in February. According to the latest UN figures, 8,050 civilians died or were wounded overall between January and September 2018. The use of suicide bombs and other IEDs by anti-government elements accounted for almost half the casualties. The UN expressed grave concern over the increase in direct targeting of civilians, including ethnic and religious minorities. McDowall, who said he could not comment on AOAV figures, confirmed that 2018 had brought a \u201crecord high\u201d in civilian casualties in Afghanistan for the past four years. Before 2014, the majority of casualties were the result of ground engagement between Afghan forces and insurgents. \u201cThe UN is concerned about the deliberate targeting of civilians and the use of suicide IEDs,\u201d said McDowall. \u201cOver the course of last year, because of the very high profile attacks and insurgencies, IEDs have become the largest cause of deaths.\u201d Civilian deaths and injuries in Yemen rose from 1,670 to 1,807 last year, a rise of just over 8%. India had a 21% rise, from 267 to 322, while in Libya there was a 140% increase, from 163 in 2017 to 392 in 2018, according to AOAV. In Syria, civilian casualties dropped from 8,767 to 5,061. \u201cWhile Syria remained the worst country impacted by explosive weapons last year, casualties decreased by a quarter in 2018,\u201d Overton said. \u201cThis comes despite seeing the highest levels of civilian casualties from explosive violence in February and March 2018, when Syrian and Russian forces carried out an extensive bombardment of eastern Ghouta.\u201d Despite the overall drop in civilian casualties in Syria last year, there was an \u201calarming escalation\u201d of civilians killed and injured in US-led coalition airstrikes during the final months of 2018, the report found. This increase accounted for 65% of casualties in Syria during that three-month period. Countries in which there was a significant decrease in civilian harm from explosive violence included Somalia, with a 48% fall in civilian casualties, Pakistan (48%) and Iraq (77%). The AOAV report was compiled using data from sources including Airwars, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and reliable media sources.",

Biosecurity is the only answer but it\u2019s hard and costly. The government, being such a populist one, wants to fight for the votes of farmers,\u201d he said. Environmental groups, keen to show the government that there are other voters who strongly oppose the plans, have organised a series of street demonstrations and online protests against the cull. Several thousand Poles have changed their Facebook profile picture to one of a wild boar, while an online petition to the government asking it to abandon the slaughter has received more than 300,000 signatures. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Warsaw, some dressed as wild boar, holding signs that included \u201cwild boar massacre\u201d and \u201clong live wild boars\u201d.",

In a 2015 poll, 73% of evangelical Christians said events in Israel are prophesied in the Book of Revelation. Respondents were not asked specifically whether their believed developments in Israel would actually bring forth the apocalypse. The relationship between evangelicals and the president himself is complicated. Trump himself embodies the very opposite of a pious Christian ideal. Trump is not churchgoer. He is profane, twice divorced, who has boasted of sexually assaulting women. But white evangelicals have embraced him. Eighty per cent of white evangelicals voted for him in 2016, and his popularity among them is remains in the 70s. While other white voters have flaked away in the first two years of his presidency, white evangelicals have become his last solid bastion. Some leading evangelicals see Trump as a latterday King Cyrus, the sixth-century BC Persian emperor who liberated the Jews from Babylonian captivity. The comparison is made explicitly in The Trump Prophecy, a religious film screened in 1,200 cinemas around the country in October, depicting a retired firefighter who claims to have heard God\u2019s voice, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this.\u201d Lance Wallnau, a self-proclaimed prophet who features in the film, has called Trump \u201cGod\u2019s Chaos Candidate\u201d and a \u201cmodern Cyrus\u201d. \u201cCyrus is the model for a nonbeliever appointed by God as a vessel for the purposes of the faithful,\u201d said Katherine Stewart, who writes extensively about the Christian right. She added that they welcome his readiness to break democratic norms to combat perceived threats to their values and way of life. \u201cThe Christian nationalist movement is characterized by feelings of persecution and, to some degree, paranoia \u2013 a clear example is the idea that there is somehow a \u2018war on Christmas\u2019,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cPeople in those positions will often go for authoritarian leaders who will do whatever is necessary to fight for their cause.\u201d Trump was raised as a Presbyterian, but leaned increasingly towards evangelical preachers as he began contemplating a run for the presidency. Trump\u2019s choice of Pence as a running mate was a gesture of his commitment, and four of the six preachers at his inauguration were evangelicals, including White and Franklin Graham, the eldest son of the preacher Billy Graham, who defended Trump through his many sex scandals, pointing out: \u201cWe are all sinners.\u201d Having lost control of the House of Representatives in November, and under ever closer scrutiny for his campaign\u2019s links to the Kremlin, Trump\u2019s instinct has been to cleave ever closer to his most loyal supporters. Almost alone among major demographic groups, white evangelicals are overwhelmingly in favour of Trump\u2019s border wall, which some preachers equate with fortifications in the Bible. Evangelical links have also helped shape US alliances in the Trump presidency. As secretary of state, Pompeo has been instrumental in forging link with other evangelical leaders in the hemisphere, including Guatemala\u2019s Jimmy Morales and the new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. Both have undertaken to follow the US lead in moving their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem. Trump\u2019s order to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv \u2013 over the objections of his foreign policy and national security team \u2013 is a striking example of evangelical clout. The move was also pushed by Las Vegas billionaire and Republican mega-donor, Sheldon Adelson, but the orchestration of the embassy opening ceremony last May, reflected the audience Trump was trying hardest to appease. The two pastors given the prime speaking slots were both ardent Christian Zionists: Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor on record as saying Jews, like Muslims and Mormons, are bound for hell; and John Hagee, a televangelist and founder of Christians United for Israel (Cufi), who once said that Hitler and the Holocaust were part of God\u2019s plan to get Jews back to Israel, to pave the way for the Rapture. For many evangelicals, the move cemented Trump\u2019s status as the new Cyrus, who oversaw the Jews return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple.The tightening of the evangelical grip on the administration has also been reflected in a growing hostility to the UN, often portrayed as a sinister and godless organisation. Since the US ambassador, Nikki Haley, announced her departure in October and Pompeo took more direct control, the US mission has become increasingly combative, blocking references to gender and reproductive health in UN documents. Some theologians also see an increasingly evangelical tinge to the administration\u2019s broader Middle East policies, in particular its fierce embrace of Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, the lack of balancing sympathy for the Palestinians \u2013 and the insistent demonisation of the Iranian government. Evangelicals, Chesnut said, \u201cnow see the United States locked into a holy war against the forces of evil who they see as embodied by Iran\u201d. In a speech at the end of a regional tour on Thursday, Pompeo reprised the theme, describing Iran as a \u201ccancerous influence\u201d. This zeal for a defining struggle has thus far found common cause with more secular hawks such as the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Trump\u2019s own drive to eliminate the legacy of Barack Obama, whose signature foreign policy achievement was the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, which Trump abrogated last May. In conversations with European leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May, Trump has reportedly insisted he has no intention of going to war with Iran. His desire to extricate US troops from Syria marks a break with hawks, religious and secular, who want to contain Iranian influence there. But the logic of his policy of ever-increasing pressure, coupled with unstinting support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, makes confrontation with Iran ever more likely. One of the most momentous foreign policy questions of 2019 is whether Trump can veer away from the collision course he has helped set in motion \u2013 perhaps conjuring up a last minute deal, as he did with North Korea \u2013 or instead welcome conflict as a distraction from his domestic woes, and sell it to the faithful as a crusade.",

      "bodyText": "The two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar for their reporting on the violence against the Rohingya in Rahkine state have lost their appeal, with the court upholding their guilty verdict and lengthy prison sentences. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had each been handed prison sentences of seven years in September after they were found guilty of breaching the country\u2019s Official Secrets Act after it was claimed they were in possession of classified documents. The trial of the pair was widely criticised, with human rights groups and international governments accusing the Myanmar regime of using the courts to target the two reporters for their reporting on the military-led massacre of Rohingya muslims in the village of Inn Din in Rahkine. Both Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who are both Burmese, have continued to stress their innocence, alleging they were handed classified documents, which was used as evidence they had breached secrecy laws, without their knowledge in a police set-up. The appeal against the verdict, which was filed in November, argued that \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d of the arrest being a set-up by the police, as well as violations in due process and key holes in the prosecution\u2019s case, had been ignored. However, in a further blow to freedom of expression in Myanmar, on Friday afternoon a judge at the high court in Yangon rejected the appeal and upheld their guilty verdict. The judge described the seven year jail sentence as a \u201csuitable ruling\u201d. Stephen J Adler, the editor-in-chief of Reuters, said the rejection of the appeal was \u201cyet another injustice among many inflicted upon Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo\u201d. \u201cThey remain behind bars for one reason: those in power sought to silence the truth,\u201d said Adler. \u201cReporting is not a crime, and until Myanmar rights this terrible wrong, the press in Myanmar is not free, and Myanmar\u2019s commitment to rule of law and democracy remains in doubt.\u201d A statement issued by the EU\u2019s spokesperson for foreign affairs, Maja Kocijancic, said the appeal rejection was a \u201cmissed opportunity to right a wrong\u201d adding that the ruling \u201ccasts serious doubt over the independence of Myanmar\u2019s justice system.\u201d The appeal was also condemned by Amnesty International, who said the ruling \u201cperpetuates an appalling injustice\u201d while the chief executive of PEN America, Suzanne Nossel, said that \u201cyet again Myanmar\u2019s justice system has turned its backs on the principles of rule of law and respect for rights that are the litmus test of democracy\u201d.

The news came at an anguished press conference in Melbourne, where the boy from Dunblane, who rose to become one of Britain\u2019s greatest tennis players alongside Fred Perry, was heartbreakingly candid about the hip injury that has left him with debilitating pain. \u201cI said to my team, \u2018Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon. That\u2019s where I would like to stop playing,\u2019\u201d said the former world number one, fighting back tears. \u201cBut I am not certain I am able to do that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"217f81bb-ebb6-4a19-b060-8b811df8de7e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CaJ5QFmPtKE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Murray is steeling himself for what is \u201calmost certainly\u201d one last effort, at the Australian Open on Monday against the Spaniard Bautista Agut. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain for probably about 20 months now,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better. It hasn\u2019t helped loads. I\u2019m in a better place than I was six months ago, but still in a lot of pain. It has been tough.\u201d The tributes are flowing, and Kevin Mitchell, the Guardian\u2019s tennis correspondent, has filed an appreciation of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-british-tennis-hails-arguably-nations-best-sportsman-ever\">one of our greatest ever sportsmen</a>\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Right at the time\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The benefits freeze is unlikely to be continued beyond 2020, according to Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. The Tory welfare policy introduced five years ago by George Osborne is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/11/benefits-freeze-likely-to-end-in-2020-says-amber-rudd\">estimated to cost some working families hundreds of pounds a year</a>. In 2017 the Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicted it would drive almost half a million people into poverty by the time it came up for renewal in 2020. Rudd told Sky News: \u201cIt was the right thing to do at the time \u2026 it\u2019s got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off.\u201d Reacting last night, a Labour source said the freeze had cut incomes \u201cfor those most up against it\u201d while the rich and big business got tax cuts. \u201cRudd is flat wrong when she says it was the right policy.\u201d Today, Rudd will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/10/two-child-limit-on-universal-credit-to-be-partially-rolled-back\">announce a partial rollback</a> to the two-child limit on universal credit payments.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Coming up next, the fibre diet \u2013 </strong>Eating more fibre from less processed sources such as wholegrain cereals, pasta, bread, nuts and pulses can slash people\u2019s chances of heart disease and early death, according to a landmark review for the World Health Organisation. Fashionable low-carb diets may increase people\u2019s risk of heart disease because they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/10/high-fibre-diets-cut-heart-disease-risk-landmark-study-finds\">throw out the fibre with the carbohydrates</a>, the research suggests. University of Otago\u2019s Professor Jim Mann, who led the research, said: \u201cHere we have got very strong evidence that a high-fibre diet, which for the majority of people is at least high-ish in carbohydrates, has an enormous protective effect \u2026 Fibre-rich whole foods that require chewing and retain much of their structure in the gut increase satiety and help weight control and can favourably influence lipid and glucose levels.\u201d Another of the authors, Professor John Cummings from the University of Dundee, said: \u201cThis is the end of 50 years of researching dietary fibre \u2026 We need to get this written in stone and part of people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Brexit clock ticks down \u2013 </strong>The Confederation of British Industry is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/10/no-deal-brexit-shrink-uk-gdp-risk-jobs-cbi-business-warning\">urging MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s deal</a> in next Tuesday\u2019s vote, warning that a hard Brexit would cut GDP by up to 8% and cost thousands of jobs. May has sought to win Labour support for her Brexit deal by making a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/10/theresa-may-contacts-union-leaders-for-brexit-deal-support-from-labour\">direct offer to union leaders to beef up workers\u2019 rights</a>. In his September conference speech, Jeremy Corbyn offered to support the prime minister\u2019s deal if she toughened up employment rights and environmental standards \u2013 though May has rejected his further condition of a permanent customs union. The PM has said the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, should explain to parliament why he allowed MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve\u2019s Brexit amendment. \u201cObviously the Speaker made a decision on a particular amendment; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/10/theresa-may-surprised-john-bercow-allowed-brexit-amendment\">I was surprised at that decision</a>,\u201d the PM said, repeating others\u2019 calls for Bercow to publish the advice he received from his clerks.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Big questions answered \u2013 </strong>Fiona Bruce has hosted Question Time for the first time, and Mark Lawson was watching. \u201cBruce\u2019s opening link, in which she declared \u2018it\u2019s lovely to be here!\u2019, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show,\u201d Lawson writes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2b26b83e24901c64b614e1e4ca261c2b06a94aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2b26b83e24901c64b614e1e4ca261c2b06a94aa/57_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Bruce, far right, with guests Melanie Phillips, Jo Swinson and James Cleverly.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Bruce, far right, with guests Melanie Phillips, Jo Swinson and James Cleverly.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBut her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists \u2013 James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson \u2013 were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/11/question-time-fiona-bruce-is-fresh-face-in-a-tired-format\">as brisk and persistent as David Dimbleby\u2019s</a>. The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Fatberg game-changer \u2013 </strong>\u201cThis is an important step in the battle against blockages. We\u2019ve all seen the impact of fatbergs, and we want to see fewer of them.\u201d Hear, hear Michael Roberts, chief executive of Water UK, who this morning hails the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/11/wet-wipes-fine-to-flush-label-fatbergs-water-companies\">arrival of a \u201csafe to flush\u201d label for wet wipes</a>. Many wipes are labelled as flushable when they don\u2019t break down quickly in the sewers, and clump together with fats, oils and grease on a massive scale. The results have included a 250-metre fatberg in Whitechapel in London in 2017, which weighed as much as 19 elephants, and a 64-metre fatberg discovered this week in Sidmouth, Devon.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Who\u2019s paying for Trump\u2019s wall?</h2> \n<p>With the US government in partial shutdown, the president continues to demand funding for his Mexican border wall.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb12826eda7c7c29fda0a9e11b8998ed7d22a745\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb12826eda7c7c29fda0a9e11b8998ed7d22a745/0_88_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump in the Oval Office.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leah Millis/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lauren Gambino, in Washington DC, and Bryan Mealer, in Texas, discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jan/11/who-will-pay-for-donald-trump-border-wall-podcast\">how Trump\u2019s central campaign promise has led to this point of paralysis</a>.

It has rebranded itself as the world\u2019s first ChronoCity \u2013 a place where internal time is as important as external time, and sleep is sacrosanct. In July 2013 the council contacted a chronobiologist about tweaking the lives and affairs of the town and its people to better accommodate their body clocks. Since then there have been victories with flexible working, but it is an evolving effort \u2013 the idea of abandoning daylight saving was defeated. Science journalist Linda Geddes explains an individual\u2019s \u201cchronotype\u201d is based on their sleep behaviour. It turns out there really is such a thing as a morning person or a night owl, and there is an argument for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/11/watching-the-sun-not-the-clock-sleep-body-clocks-daylight-saving-time\">employers and society to accommodate that</a>.</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p>Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer has confirmed authorities in Las Vegas have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/10/cristiano-ronaldo-rape-allegation-dna-warrant\">issued a warrant to collect DNA</a> from the football star in the wake <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/02/cristiano-ronaldo-rape-allegation-police-investigation\">of allegations he raped a woman in the city in 2009</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Champion\u2019s torment at bowing out Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray bringing you the Briefing with just four sleeps to go until the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. In emotional scenes overnight, Andy Murray has announced he will retire from tennis this season and doubts he will make it through to Wimbledon in July. The news came at an anguished press conference in Melbourne, where the boy from Dunblane, who rose to become one of Britain\u2019s greatest tennis players alongside Fred Perry, was heartbreakingly candid about the hip injury that has left him with debilitating pain. \u201cI said to my team, \u2018Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon. That\u2019s where I would like to stop playing,\u2019\u201d said the former world number one, fighting back tears. \u201cBut I am not certain I am able to do that.\u201d Murray is steeling himself for what is \u201calmost certainly\u201d one last effort, at the Australian Open on Monday against the Spaniard Bautista Agut. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain for probably about 20 months now,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better. It hasn\u2019t helped loads. I\u2019m in a better place than I was six months ago, but still in a lot of pain. It has been tough.\u201d The tributes are flowing, and Kevin Mitchell, the Guardian\u2019s tennis correspondent, has filed an appreciation of \u201cone of our greatest ever sportsmen\u201d. * * * \u2018Right at the time\u2019 \u2013 The benefits freeze is unlikely to be continued beyond 2020, according to Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. The Tory welfare policy introduced five years ago by George Osborne is estimated to cost some working families hundreds of pounds a year. In 2017 the Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicted it would drive almost half a million people into poverty by the time it came up for renewal in 2020. Rudd told Sky News: \u201cIt was the right thing to do at the time \u2026 it\u2019s got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off.\u201d Reacting last night, a Labour source said the freeze had cut incomes \u201cfor those most up against it\u201d while the rich and big business got tax cuts. \u201cRudd is flat wrong when she says it was the right policy.\u201d Today, Rudd will announce a partial rollback to the two-child limit on universal credit payments. * * * Coming up next, the fibre diet \u2013 Eating more fibre from less processed sources such as wholegrain cereals, pasta, bread, nuts and pulses can slash people\u2019s chances of heart disease and early death, according to a landmark review for the World Health Organisation. Fashionable low-carb diets may increase people\u2019s risk of heart disease because they throw out the fibre with the carbohydrates, the research suggests. University of Otago\u2019s Professor Jim Mann, who led the research, said: \u201cHere we have got very strong evidence that a high-fibre diet, which for the majority of people is at least high-ish in carbohydrates, has an enormous protective effect \u2026 Fibre-rich whole foods that require chewing and retain much of their structure in the gut increase satiety and help weight control and can favourably influence lipid and glucose levels.\u201d Another of the authors, Professor John Cummings from the University of Dundee, said: \u201cThis is the end of 50 years of researching dietary fibre \u2026 We need to get this written in stone and part of people\u2019s lives.\u201d * * * Brexit clock ticks down \u2013 The Confederation of British Industry is urging MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s deal in next Tuesday\u2019s vote, warning that a hard Brexit would cut GDP by up to 8% and cost thousands of jobs. May has sought to win Labour support for her Brexit deal by making a direct offer to union leaders to beef up workers\u2019 rights. In his September conference speech, Jeremy Corbyn offered to support the prime minister\u2019s deal if she toughened up employment rights and environmental standards \u2013 though May has rejected his further condition of a permanent customs union. The PM has said the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, should explain to parliament why he allowed MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve\u2019s Brexit amendment. \u201cObviously the Speaker made a decision on a particular amendment; I was surprised at that decision,\u201d the PM said, repeating others\u2019 calls for Bercow to publish the advice he received from his clerks. * * * Big questions answered \u2013 Fiona Bruce has hosted Question Time for the first time, and Mark Lawson was watching. \u201cBruce\u2019s opening link, in which she declared \u2018it\u2019s lovely to be here!\u2019, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show,\u201d Lawson writes. \u201cBut her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists \u2013 James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson \u2013 were as brisk and persistent as David Dimbleby\u2019s. The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.\u201d * * * Fatberg game-changer \u2013 \u201cThis is an important step in the battle against blockages. We\u2019ve all seen the impact of fatbergs, and we want to see fewer of them.\u201d Hear, hear Michael Roberts, chief executive of Water UK, who this morning hails the arrival of a \u201csafe to flush\u201d label for wet wipes. Many wipes are labelled as flushable when they don\u2019t break down quickly in the sewers, and clump together with fats, oils and grease on a massive scale. The results have included a 250-metre fatberg in Whitechapel in London in 2017, which weighed as much as 19 elephants, and a 64-metre fatberg discovered this week in Sidmouth, Devon. Today in Focus podcast: Who\u2019s paying for Trump\u2019s wall? With the US government in partial shutdown, the president continues to demand funding for his Mexican border wall. Lauren Gambino, in Washington DC, and Bryan Mealer, in Texas, discuss how Trump\u2019s central campaign promise has led to this point of paralysis. Plus, John Harris looks back to the optimism of 1989. Lunchtime read: Stop watching the clock Between daylight saving and obligatory early starts, we live at the mercy of \u201cofficial\u201d time \u2013 and many of us feel permanently out of sync. Most of us are not free to choose our work or school hours; we have little control over the lighting in our public spaces and external environment; and we are even forced to reprogram our internal clock twice a year because of daylight saving time. But the German spa town of Bad Kissingen aims to be different. It has rebranded itself as the world\u2019s first ChronoCity \u2013 a place where internal time is as important as external time, and sleep is sacrosanct. In July 2013 the council contacted a chronobiologist about tweaking the lives and affairs of the town and its people to better accommodate their body clocks. Since then there have been victories with flexible working, but it is an evolving effort \u2013 the idea of abandoning daylight saving was defeated. Science journalist Linda Geddes explains an individual\u2019s \u201cchronotype\u201d is based on their sleep behaviour. It turns out there really is such a thing as a morning person or a night owl, and there is an argument for employers and society to accommodate that. Sport Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer has confirmed authorities in Las Vegas have issued a warrant to collect DNA from the football star in the wake of allegations he raped a woman in the city in 2009. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r accepts Mauricio Pochettino \u201chas done a very good job\u201d at Tottenham and understands why he is being linked with the permanent Manchester United manager\u2019s role. The Southampton striker Charlie Austin has been handed a two-match suspension by the FA after admitting making a gesture towards Manchester City fans during the recent Premier League game at St Mary\u2019s. And Danny Cipriani has made a timely return from injury and will start at fly-half for Gloucester tonight against Munster in a must-win European Champions Cup tie at Kingsholm. Business Overnight, the car industry boss Carlos Ghosn has been indicted in Japan on fresh charges of financial misconduct. Asian stocks inched up to five-week highs after Jerome Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve will be patient about raising interest rates, while trade talks between Washington and Beijing moved to higher levels. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said China\u2019s vice-premier Liu He would \u201cmost likely\u201d visit Washington later in the month. The FTSE is set to open higher and the pound is worth $1.276 and \u20ac1.107 at time of writing. The papers The Guardian\u2019s lead story is \u201cBlow to the low-carb diet as WHO report says fibre cuts early deaths\u201d, a story that also features on the front page of the Times.

With more than 60 summits over 1,000 metres, the Lyngen Alps have a quasi-mythical status among hardcore skiers. It\u2019s a purely touring destination: there are no ski lifts, so any mountain you want to ride down you have to hike up, using \u201cskins\u201d on your skis for grip. With ski fans increasingly wanting a fitness break, rather than just boozy lunches and downhill meanders, touring is a growth area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2019-01-09T10:42:36.html\" data-alt=\"Lyngen Alps, Norway, map.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2019-01-09T10:42:36.html\">Lyngen Alps, Norway, map.</a> </figure>  <p>The Lyngen Alps is where alpine guides come on holiday once their European season finishes, and where they bring their best and favourite guests. I\u2019m here in early April but the season runs until June, when there\u2019s skiing in the midnight sun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/02/swimming-fjords-mountain-hiking-norway-scandinavia-wild-camping\">Wild swims and mountain walks in Norway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We planned our route the day before, poring over a giant map, with Mikal pointing out the many peaks at our disposal. Ri\u0161\u0161av\u00e1rri, at 1,251 metres, seems a good entry-level option. The temperature hasn\u2019t fluctuated dramatically lately and it hasn\u2019t snowed for a week so the snow pack should be stable, though as this is the high Arctic the weather can suddenly change. \u201cThis is more like a mountain expedition than you might expect,\u201d said Mikal.</p> <p>Instead of getting a resort bus or cable car to our starting point, we take a ferry across the fjord from Lyngseidet to Olderdalen. Our hike begins at sea level, rising up through a forest of elder and silver birch, the trees bowed under the weight of the snow. Mikal is on touring skis, while I\u2019m on a splitboard - a snowboard that splits in two so it can be used like touring skis. The way isn\u2019t too steep, but Mikal insists on a slow pace and makes us stop for snacks every hour to keep energy levels up. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53328b8e7ce2c1d2af2029342fee12fce6988490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53328b8e7ce2c1d2af2029342fee12fce6988490/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Haddad hiking up the Lyngen Alps in Norway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Haddad on her alpine hike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikal Nerberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coming out of the woods we see our target summit, high in the sky, and still another 1,000 metres away. The climb quickly gets steeper but at the hour-two stop I still feel OK. As we reach hour three, however, I begin to wonder if I\u2019ll ever make it to the top.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jul/22/norway-coast-fjords-road-trip-arctic-circle-holiday\">Fjord escort: a road trip to northern Norway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The silver lining is the view, which as we rise becomes an increasingly amazing distraction. For the last half-hour I really have to dig in, hypnotised by Mikal\u2019s steps ahead of me but at the top the feeling of elation is intense.</p> <p>I put my board together, while Mikal checks the snow to see which line would be our best descent. We set off, navigate some juddering wind-ruined snow then find a pocket of lovely soft pillow-like powder. Further down we ride super-fast spring slush, passing giant boulders of icy snow, and then cut into the forest we climbed through earlier, dodging the tightly packed tree trunks and stumps as if in a computer game. We emerge into a snowfield and ride down to the fjord, a complete run from summit to sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ca1ea8bd105f3ec31fb309cd104a8568365ce858\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1ea8bd105f3ec31fb309cd104a8568365ce858/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Writer Sam Haddad snowboards down the peak in the Lyngen Alps, Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam snowboards down the peak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikal Nerberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most skiers and snowboarders stay at the <a href=\"http://www.magicmountainlodge.no/\" title=\"\">Magic Mountain Lodge</a> (bunks from \u00a340pp full-board) in Lyngseidet \u2013 the main, albeit tiny town \u2013 but it\u2019s fully booked, so I stay in a private rental house in a hamlet 12 miles north (<a href=\"http://book.visit-lyngenfjord.com/en/accommodation/a1260488/take-me-away-holiday%20-house/details\" title=\"\">Take Me Away, Holiday House</a>, from \u00a3110 a night, sleeps four). Like almost every house in Lyngen it looks straight out of the Cabin Porn book: white wood with a pretty green trim and a 1960s-style kitsch interior. On my first night a white hare dances in the drive.</p> <p>On day two we drive north to the waterside hamlet of Koppangen, where the road stops abruptly and turns into mountain. From here we set off for the 950-metre summit of Goalborri. Yesterday\u2019s blue skies have switched to snowy showers. Before long it\u2019s too steep and slippery to proceed by splitboard so I strap it to my backpack, put crampons over my boots, and Mikal hands me an ice axe for stability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e0b8f143e632fc8ccf906c95da4e67046664ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e0b8f143e632fc8ccf906c95da4e67046664ed2/0_158_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view across a fjord in the Lyngen Alps, Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view across the fjord.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Haddad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This feels more aerobically tough than the day before \u2013 like climbing a snowy ladder, with the odd rock to scramble over \u2013 but we cover a lot more ground.

Lower down, we put down fresh tracks in soft spring snow, before popping out at the fjord.</p> <p>Later that night I see the wisps of the northern lights rise in the sky. It\u2019s beautiful but doesn\u2019t come close to being the highlight of my trip, nor does the snowboarding down, fun as that was.

With more than 60 summits over 1,000 metres, the Lyngen Alps have a quasi-mythical status among hardcore skiers. It\u2019s a purely touring destination: there are no ski lifts, so any mountain you want to ride down you have to hike up, using \u201cskins\u201d on your skis for grip. With ski fans increasingly wanting a fitness break, rather than just boozy lunches and downhill meanders, touring is a growth area. The Lyngen Alps is where alpine guides come on holiday once their European season finishes, and where they bring their best and favourite guests. I\u2019m here in early April but the season runs until June, when there\u2019s skiing in the midnight sun. We planned our route the day before, poring over a giant map, with Mikal pointing out the many peaks at our disposal. Ri\u0161\u0161av\u00e1rri, at 1,251 metres, seems a good entry-level option. The temperature hasn\u2019t fluctuated dramatically lately and it hasn\u2019t snowed for a week so the snow pack should be stable, though as this is the high Arctic the weather can suddenly change. \u201cThis is more like a mountain expedition than you might expect,\u201d said Mikal. Instead of getting a resort bus or cable car to our starting point, we take a ferry across the fjord from Lyngseidet to Olderdalen. Our hike begins at sea level, rising up through a forest of elder and silver birch, the trees bowed under the weight of the snow. Mikal is on touring skis, while I\u2019m on a splitboard - a snowboard that splits in two so it can be used like touring skis. The way isn\u2019t too steep, but Mikal insists on a slow pace and makes us stop for snacks every hour to keep energy levels up. Coming out of the woods we see our target summit, high in the sky, and still another 1,000 metres away. The climb quickly gets steeper but at the hour-two stop I still feel OK. As we reach hour three, however, I begin to wonder if I\u2019ll ever make it to the top. The silver lining is the view, which as we rise becomes an increasingly amazing distraction. For the last half-hour I really have to dig in, hypnotised by Mikal\u2019s steps ahead of me but at the top the feeling of elation is intense. I put my board together, while Mikal checks the snow to see which line would be our best descent. We set off, navigate some juddering wind-ruined snow then find a pocket of lovely soft pillow-like powder. Further down we ride super-fast spring slush, passing giant boulders of icy snow, and then cut into the forest we climbed through earlier, dodging the tightly packed tree trunks and stumps as if in a computer game. We emerge into a snowfield and ride down to the fjord, a complete run from summit to sea. Most skiers and snowboarders stay at the Magic Mountain Lodge (bunks from \u00a340pp full-board) in Lyngseidet \u2013 the main, albeit tiny town \u2013 but it\u2019s fully booked, so I stay in a private rental house in a hamlet 12 miles north (Take Me Away, Holiday House, from \u00a3110 a night, sleeps four). Like almost every house in Lyngen it looks straight out of the Cabin Porn book: white wood with a pretty green trim and a 1960s-style kitsch interior. On my first night a white hare dances in the drive. On day two we drive north to the waterside hamlet of Koppangen, where the road stops abruptly and turns into mountain. From here we set off for the 950-metre summit of Goalborri. Yesterday\u2019s blue skies have switched to snowy showers. Before long it\u2019s too steep and slippery to proceed by splitboard so I strap it to my backpack, put crampons over my boots, and Mikal hands me an ice axe for stability. This feels more aerobically tough than the day before \u2013 like climbing a snowy ladder, with the odd rock to scramble over \u2013 but we cover a lot more ground. After 21/2 hours we reach the top. Tiredness only hits as we start to ride the steep but reassuringly wide couloir. Lower down, we put down fresh tracks in soft spring snow, before popping out at the fjord. Later that night I see the wisps of the northern lights rise in the sky. It\u2019s beautiful but doesn\u2019t come close to being the highlight of my trip, nor does the snowboarding down, fun as that was. The bit I love best has been the hiking up, the hard work of earning those runs down in this wild, silent and most un-ski resort-like place. Which also happens to be as easily reachable from the UK as the European Alps. \u2022 The trip was provided by Visit Norway and Northern Norway. Norwegian flies from Gatwick to Troms\u00f8; Lyngseidet is about a 1hr 45 min drive from Troms\u00f8. Car rental was provided by kayak.co.uk but there\u2019s also a bus (from \u00a314). A day\u2019s guiding (in a group) with Mikal Nerberg starts at \u00a393pp, lyngenguide.no",

      "body": "<p>It is a poignant oddity that Andy Murray\u2019s tennis career is ending as it began: in pain, struggle and confusion. When the thin, hairy teenager from Dunblane joined the full Tour in 2005 as the reigning 2004 US Open boys champion, he was No 407 in the world, but spent the first three months coping with a back injury that had cut him down in South Africa because, as he described it at the time, \u201cI was growing a lot\u201d.</p> \n<p>And how he grew. On the eve of what might well be his last match, four months shy of his 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday after tumbling to 230 in the rankings, Murray can look back on a career littered with gold and cruelly bloodied by the slings and arrows of life.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2019/jan/11/andy-murray-a-career-in-pictures-tennis-retire\">Andy Murray \u2013 a career in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His right hip, never reliable, has finally given up on him. His spirit is drained too. He is tired, finally, of the struggle. He survived back surgery towards the end of 2013 but, a year on from having his aching hip patched up by a Melbourne surgeon to help him eke out a few more moments in the sun, there is nothing left to give, nowhere else to go. To see him reveal on Friday that he could barely put on his shoes and socks without wincing was to witness a warrior laying down his shield.</p> \n<p>I watched that boys\u2019 final at Flushing Meadows 15 years ago. Murray, under-powered but immensely gifted, was as passionate and determined on the court in beating the cerebral Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky as he was introverted away from it. It would be eight years before he returned to New York to win his first major, by which time he had acquired the bearing of a feared and confident champion, a fully grown man who knew his own worth.</p> \n<p>They were one and the same, of course. The essential Murray has not changed. There is a palpable decency about him, which several of his many friends mentioned when they learned of his impending farewell on Friday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/murray_career/giv-3902Wq96F7kaPo9E/\" data-alt=\"Andy Murray\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/murray_career/giv-3902Wq96F7kaPo9E/\">Andy Murray</a> \n</figure> \n<p>He was and remains the owner of a particularly Scottish sense of humour \u2013 not as theatrical as, say, Billy Connolly, nor as earthy as Rab C Nesbitt. Maybe somewhere in between. He delighted in the engineered misfortune of his team members, all of whom have remained fiercely loyal to him \u2013 and not just because he was paying the cheques. Their respect for him as an athlete was deep, as it was among his peers.</p> \n<p>Dan Evans and Murray didn\u2019t always see eye to eye but there was warmth there too, especially as Davis Cup teammates. \u201cIt\u2019s desperately sad that his career\u2019s had to end because of injury and not so much on his own terms,\u201d Evans said after qualifying for the Australian Open on Friday. \u201cBut he\u2019s had an unbelievable career, and he\u2019s probably one of the best sportsmen Britain\u2019s ever had, if not the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kyle Edmund, who first met him when he was 14 and treasured invites to Murray\u2019s Miami winter training camps, agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s been my biggest role model. He\u2019s Britain\u2019s greatest tennis player ever, and you could say maybe Britain\u2019s best sportsman ever.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b57c0a7f-6355-4cd1-9ee4-33b5d615953c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EyDXcG2MhHs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Athletes don\u2019t always enjoy talking about other athletes.

      "bodyText": "It is a poignant oddity that Andy Murray\u2019s tennis career is ending as it began: in pain, struggle and confusion. When the thin, hairy teenager from Dunblane joined the full Tour in 2005 as the reigning 2004 US Open boys champion, he was No 407 in the world, but spent the first three months coping with a back injury that had cut him down in South Africa because, as he described it at the time, \u201cI was growing a lot\u201d. And how he grew. On the eve of what might well be his last match, four months shy of his 32nd birthday after tumbling to 230 in the rankings, Murray can look back on a career littered with gold and cruelly bloodied by the slings and arrows of life. His right hip, never reliable, has finally given up on him. His spirit is drained too. He is tired, finally, of the struggle. He survived back surgery towards the end of 2013 but, a year on from having his aching hip patched up by a Melbourne surgeon to help him eke out a few more moments in the sun, there is nothing left to give, nowhere else to go. To see him reveal on Friday that he could barely put on his shoes and socks without wincing was to witness a warrior laying down his shield. I watched that boys\u2019 final at Flushing Meadows 15 years ago. Murray, under-powered but immensely gifted, was as passionate and determined on the court in beating the cerebral Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky as he was introverted away from it. It would be eight years before he returned to New York to win his first major, by which time he had acquired the bearing of a feared and confident champion, a fully grown man who knew his own worth. They were one and the same, of course. The essential Murray has not changed. There is a palpable decency about him, which several of his many friends mentioned when they learned of his impending farewell on Friday. He was and remains the owner of a particularly Scottish sense of humour \u2013 not as theatrical as, say, Billy Connolly, nor as earthy as Rab C Nesbitt. Maybe somewhere in between. He delighted in the engineered misfortune of his team members, all of whom have remained fiercely loyal to him \u2013 and not just because he was paying the cheques. Their respect for him as an athlete was deep, as it was among his peers. Dan Evans and Murray didn\u2019t always see eye to eye but there was warmth there too, especially as Davis Cup teammates. \u201cIt\u2019s desperately sad that his career\u2019s had to end because of injury and not so much on his own terms,\u201d Evans said after qualifying for the Australian Open on Friday. \u201cBut he\u2019s had an unbelievable career, and he\u2019s probably one of the best sportsmen Britain\u2019s ever had, if not the best.\u201d Kyle Edmund, who first met him when he was 14 and treasured invites to Murray\u2019s Miami winter training camps, agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s been my biggest role model. He\u2019s Britain\u2019s greatest tennis player ever, and you could say maybe Britain\u2019s best sportsman ever.\u201d Athletes don\u2019t always enjoy talking about other athletes. It can be a self-centred existence. But the compliments flowed like honey. \u201cJust to see his dreams come true and give hope to others and inspire myself as well as many others is just astonishing,\u201d Katie Boulter said. \u201cWhen I cracked the top-100 he messaged me and was very sweet and supportive. I think he\u2019s been that for a lot of people, and every single person I know appreciates that.\u201d Murray touched people in different ways. Heather Watson, who was a little miffed he chose to play Olympic mixed doubles with Laura Robson in London in 2012 rather than with her, recalls: \u201cWhen he won Wimbledon for the first time, I was watching it in San Diego. When he started crying, I just started bawling my eyes out.\u201d Johanna Konta put it succinctly: \u201cHe maximised everything that he has, to bring the best out of himself. Not many people can say that. That\u2019s something, as an athlete, to look up to. It makes me quite emotional, because that\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d It didn\u2019t always look beautiful.

      "bodyText": "Carlos Ghosn could remain in detention for several months after prosecutors indicted him on two new charges of financial misconduct, days after the former Nissan chairman insisted he had been wrongly accused. Ghosn was charged with aggravated breach of trust and for understating his pay by 4.3 billion yen for three years through March 2018, the Tokyo district court said. He had already been charged for underreporting his earnings by around 5 billion yen ($46m million) between 2010-15. The third charge, of aggravated breach of trust, relates to allegations that he transferred 1.85 billion yen in personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008. Ghosn is also alleged to have used company funds to make unnecessary payments to a Saudi businessman. Ghosn has repeatedly denied the allegations. His lawyers said they would apply for their client to be released on bail, but conceded he was likely to remain in detention. The 64-year-old, who led Nissan from near-bankruptcy two decades ago and transformed it into one of the world\u2019s most successful automakers, reportedly came down with a fever on Wednesday evening and was unable to undergo questioning, a day after he issued a public rebuttal of the allegations against him during a special court hearing. His wife, Carole Ghosn, said authorities in Japan were refusing to provide details about his condition or allow his family to talk to medical staff at a Tokyo detention centre, where he has been held for more than 50 days. \u201cI recently learned that my husband is suffering from a high fever at the detention centre in Tokyo, but my information is limited to news reports as no one in his family has been allowed to contact him since 19 November,\u201d she said in a statement from Paris. \u201cWe are fearful and very worried his recovery will be complicated while he continues to endure such harsh conditions and unfair treatment.\u201d Reports on Friday said Ghosn was recovering. He is unlikely to be released on bail as long as he continues to proclaim his innocence, meaning he could remain in detention until his trial begins. No date has been set for the trial, but his head lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, said his client could have to wait at least six months before his case is heard in court. \u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s extremely rare for a court to grant bail before a trial begins,\u201d Otsuru told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s our main concern, and I think Mr Ghosn is very troubled by this.\u201d Ghosn\u2019s arrest, along with Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive who is alleged to have helped Ghosn underreport his salary, has cast doubt on the future of Nissan\u2019s three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. Kelly, who was released on bail on Christmas Day, has been charged with helping Ghosn underreport his pay, but not with aggravated breach of trust. He is reportedly receiving medical treatment in Japan for a chronic back problem. Nissan and Mitsubishi sacked Ghosn days after his arrest, but he has been kept on as head of Renault. On Thursday, the French carmaker said it had found no evidence of illegal or fraudulent payments to Ghosn over the past two years, adding that it was continuing its audit. Ghosn\u2019s rapid fall from grace has captivated Japan, with more than 1,000 people queuing to secure one of the 14 seats in the public gallery at his special hearing on Tuesday. A gaunt-looking Ghosn, who was led into the courtroom in handcuffs and with a rope tied around his waist, spoke of his \u201cgenuine love and appreciation\u201d for Nissan and insisted that he had acted \u201chonourably, legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company\u201d. \u201cI have always acted with integrity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in my several-decade professional career,\u201d he told a packed courtroom in his first public appearance since his arrest on 19 November. \u201cI have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.\u201d The length of Ghosn\u2019s detention has prompted criticism of Japan\u2019s criminal justice system and the power of the country\u2019s public prosecutors, who can rearrest suspects several times over different allegations and question them for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present. Ghosn, who has complained about the cold and the detention centre\u2019s rice-based diet, spends his free time reading but has reportedly been denied notepaper to write letters to his family.

I\u2019ve known a lot of famous people but he was at the centre of the zeitgeist in a way that\u2019s hard to describe now. But his fame took over to a degree I\u2019d never seen before and haven\u2019t seen since.\u201d</p> <p>Belushi would have turned 70 this month, but instead he died aged 33 in 1982. Yet unlike other influential comedians of that era who died young \u2013 Doug Kenney, the founder of the comedy magazine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/08/national-lampoon-magazine-documentary-animal-house\" title=\"\">National Lampoon</a>; Belushi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\" title=\"\">Saturday Night Live</a> (SNL) co-star Gilda Radner \u2013 his legend burns bright. His face can still be seen on a million T-shirts and even more posters on the walls of those born decades after he died. In 2015, Rolling Stone <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/saturday-night-live-all-145-cast-members-ranked-146340/1-john-belushi-165691/]\" title=\"\">voted</a> him the greatest of all of SNL\u2019s 145 cast members, beating Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey and Bill Murray. The magazine cited Belushi\u2019s comedy skills and physicality \u2013 \u201ca wrestler\u2019s body with a dancer\u2019s feet, something boyishly vulnerable in his madness\u201d \u2013 as the reasons for his lasting appeal, and this is all true. But it would be naive to pretend that Belushi\u2019s premature death doesn\u2019t play a part in his enduring reputation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0cd8cbf76681b137a8c1c8d3aaa87771b248ec2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cd8cbf76681b137a8c1c8d3aaa87771b248ec2a/0_43_4968_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belushi in Animal House, 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belushi as Bluto in Animal House, 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herbert Dorfman/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since he was found dead in the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood, his heart stopped by an overdose of cocaine and heroin, Belushi has become synonymous with hedonism, appetite, excess \u2013 like his memorably greedy character Bluto in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/28/animal-house-40th-anniversary-john-belushi\" title=\"\">Animal House</a>. His consumption of narcotics, especially cocaine, has become only more infamous since he died. This is thanks in no small part to Wired, the biography published shortly after his death, written by Bob Woodward, which laid out in deadening detail how much cocaine Belushi took and when.</p> <p>Belushi\u2019s loved ones loathed Wired, and remain wary of talking to outsiders about him, resentful of how he has been reduced to his addictions. Belushi\u2019s widow, Judy Belushi Pisano, puts it this way: \u201cSeveral articles \u2013 and a rather well circulated book \u2013 have covered the drug story. It would be refreshing to have a story that actually celebrated John\u2019s beautiful life: his courage to forge the life he dreamed in an unfamiliar landscape, his dedication to his craft, his epic friendships and loving temperament.\u201d</p> <p>But the life of Belushi cannot be told without reference to his death. And as much as those close to him wish others would stop focusing on the drugs, almost all the people I speak to about him talk without prompting about the effect drugs had on the man they loved. But it is also true that while the drugs might have added to his legend, he wouldn\u2019t be a legendary comedian if he had just been an addict.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b02d6fdee46b640f304fa100292f70ee2017d6a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b02d6fdee46b640f304fa100292f70ee2017d6a4/0_367_2615_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Belushi and his wife Judy Belushi Pisano, circa 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Belushi with his wife Judy Belushi Pisano, circa 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Simon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belushi was born and raised in suburban Chicago, the oldest son of Albanian immigrants. \u201cHis parents never assimilated and I think it was hard for John, going to this all-American high school in the day and coming home to this very Albanian family in the evening. None of us in the neighbourhood even knew what Albania was,\u201d says Pisano, who started dating Belushi while they were at school together. \u201cJohn looked different from all of us \u2013 dark, and there was a joke that he was born with a beard. So he was self-conscious of his ethnicity, and he never brought people back to his home \u2013 he always went to other people\u2019s houses. Maybe that\u2019s when he got in the habit of always hanging out with people.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever insecurities Belushi felt about his background, he was a star from the get-go. At school, he was a footballer, a drummer in a band, a talent-show champion and the homecoming king. After a brief foray into college, he tried out for Second City, the Chicago improvisational comedy enterprise that has since trained Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert and Amy Poehler. He was \u2013 and remains \u2013 the only actor to be hired directly into the main troupe, as opposed to having to train with the touring company first. Belushi, by now something of a shaggy haired, dope-smoking hippy, could do extreme gross-out jokes, but also subtle physical comedy, and he stole every sketch he was in.</p> <p>\u201cThe first night I saw him improvising on stage, I thought, \u2018God, I will never take chances like that. I don\u2019t have that kind of courage.\u2019 But there was always something safer and more comfortable about being me than there was about being him,\u201d Belushi\u2019s fellow Second City performer, Harold Ramis, later recalled.</p> <p>Belushi was then hired by the National Lampoon to do its stage and radio shows, along with Christopher Guest, Chevy Chase, Radner, Bill Murray and Ramis. This was arguably the greatest generation of young American comedic talent, and Belushi was at the very centre of it. Reitman produced the off-Broadway production, the National Lampoon Show. \u201cI tried to direct them, but they all laughed that off \u2013 they directed themselves. But while they didn\u2019t listen to me, they all listened to John. He was the most remarkable performer in this remarkable group. He would just walk on stage with this Brando-like charisma,\u201d says Reitman.</p> <p>People who knew Belushi in the early years describe a warm and deeply loyal man, one who always tried to get jobs for his friends and was so gentle that if his cat fell asleep on his lap he would be late for rehearsals rather than wake up his pet. On the other hand, he could be \u201cintimidating, because he was such a force of personality. That was how you had to be to stand out and be funny in that group,\u201d says Reitman.

Belushi was close to Radner and hugely respected her as a comedian, but other women on the show weren\u2019t impressed.

People say now John was difficult to work with, but he wasn\u2019t. The only fight I had with him in all the time we worked together was about drugs, so it wasn\u2019t a temperament thing, it was a health thing.\u201d</p> <p>Belushi and Aykroyd were a hugely endearing double act, which was the secret to that film\u2019s success. But it was obvious that the energy Belushi had in Animal House was gone. In some Blues Brothers scenes, he seems barely engaged at all. \u201cIt was extremely frustrating. John was so great, but he wasn\u2019t able to give 100% in this movie. With addiction, you can\u2019t help someone unless they want it. It\u2019s like offering a drowning man your hand and they refuse it. It was terrible. He went from being this really sweet guy to someone hyper and maniacal,\u201d says Landis.</p> <p>Afterwards, Landis and his wife, the costume designer Deborah Nadoolman, would meet up with Belushi for dinner occasionally: \u201cWe\u2019d have a great time and then Deborah and I would go home. But John would go off to a punk club until 3am, and then another den of iniquity, then who knows. He was going 24 hours a day. But no matter what, he made friends everywhere \u2013 comedians, punks, whoever. Everyone loved John, because until the very end he was a warm, wonderful guy, and I\u2019m still angry about how things turned out.\u201d</p> <p>Two years after finishing The Blues Brothers, Michaels met up with Belushi one evening in New York. \u201cHollywood was a whole new pressure for him, so, although he was still hilarious and the same John, he was so frantic. He\u2019d just been in it for too long.\u201d One month later, Belushi died in a hotel room after a drug dealer shot him up with cocaine and heroin. At the time, many put Belushi\u2019s drug addiction down to his sudden, dizzying fame. But those closest to him think that is simplistic.</p> <p>\u201cJohn always had an uneasiness in himself, and he was trying to fill it with something. I was an element, but I wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d says Pisano. \u201cAnd the drugs were a part of that \u2013 a big part of that. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure one\u2019s childhood has something to do with it.\u201d What\u2019s also clear from talking to those who knew Belushi, and from reading books about that era, is that while he did take a lot of drugs, many of the people around him were taking just as much.</p> <p>\u201cJohn was one of the big boys, but he wasn\u2019t out there on his own. I think maybe people didn\u2019t really know then how dangerous it was. Then John died and then they did,\u201d says Pisano.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6baacd7b73ff6d43cc46d818831b8a72641e548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6baacd7b73ff6d43cc46d818831b8a72641e548/0_10_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Bill Murray places a flower on Belushi\u2019s coffin at his funeral in 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Bill Murray places a flower on Belushi\u2019s coffin at his funeral in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Benoit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The photos from his funeral show a generation of comedy stars in shock. One of the most touching images is a bereft Bill Murray putting a flower on Belushi\u2019s coffin. Aykroyd was working on a movie script for himself and Belushi when he got the call that his best friend had died, and that film became Ghostbusters. It is not hard to imagine Belushi in the role of Venkman, which cemented Murray\u2019s fame. \u201cIt was clear that his spirit was within Danny\u2019s script and I respected that,\u201d says Reitman, who directed Ghostbusters. \u201cWhen we started to create the character of Slimer, this rotund little ghost who eats a lot, it made me think of John. We called him Slimer, but it was really the spirit of John in all of our hearts.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Reitman about the comparisons between Murray and Belushi, and he points to the key difference between them:</p> <p>\u201cBill was always much more careful about fame,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s very careful about who he socialises with and he\u2019s very anti-Hollywood. He always wanted a much more simple life. Also, he never got into drugs, whereas John jumped in feet first.\u201d</p> <p>Landis sees another difference between them: \u201cI think John would have been a much, much bigger star than Bill Murray. Bill is always Bill Murray, whereas John was a real actor. There\u2019s very little in common between Bluto and Jake Blues.\u201d Belushi left behind a pitifully small body of enduring work that belied his potential. \u201cThere\u2019s all this mythology around John but the bottom line is he was a charming guy and a brilliant performer,\u201d says Landis. \u201cHe was strong like a tractor and smart like a bull and he really could have gone on to do anything.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/28/animal-house-40th-anniversary-john-belushi\">Animal House at 40: why the slobs v snobs comedy remains essential</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Part of the fascination with Belushi is that, in retrospect, he looks, as Pisano puts it, \u201clike a symbol of the times\u201d: the 60s dope-smoking hippy who brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to comedy in the 70s and was swallowed up by cocaine in the 80s.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat you need to understand about John Belushi,\u201d the director Ivan Reitman tells me, \u201cis he really was this extraordinary talent. I\u2019ve known a lot of famous people but he was at the centre of the zeitgeist in a way that\u2019s hard to describe now. But his fame took over to a degree I\u2019d never seen before and haven\u2019t seen since.\u201d Belushi would have turned 70 this month, but instead he died aged 33 in 1982. Yet unlike other influential comedians of that era who died young \u2013 Doug Kenney, the founder of the comedy magazine National Lampoon; Belushi\u2019s Saturday Night Live (SNL) co-star Gilda Radner \u2013 his legend burns bright. His face can still be seen on a million T-shirts and even more posters on the walls of those born decades after he died. In 2015, Rolling Stone voted him the greatest of all of SNL\u2019s 145 cast members, beating Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey and Bill Murray. The magazine cited Belushi\u2019s comedy skills and physicality \u2013 \u201ca wrestler\u2019s body with a dancer\u2019s feet, something boyishly vulnerable in his madness\u201d \u2013 as the reasons for his lasting appeal, and this is all true. But it would be naive to pretend that Belushi\u2019s premature death doesn\u2019t play a part in his enduring reputation. Ever since he was found dead in the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood, his heart stopped by an overdose of cocaine and heroin, Belushi has become synonymous with hedonism, appetite, excess \u2013 like his memorably greedy character Bluto in Animal House. His consumption of narcotics, especially cocaine, has become only more infamous since he died. This is thanks in no small part to Wired, the biography published shortly after his death, written by Bob Woodward, which laid out in deadening detail how much cocaine Belushi took and when. Belushi\u2019s loved ones loathed Wired, and remain wary of talking to outsiders about him, resentful of how he has been reduced to his addictions. Belushi\u2019s widow, Judy Belushi Pisano, puts it this way: \u201cSeveral articles \u2013 and a rather well circulated book \u2013 have covered the drug story. It would be refreshing to have a story that actually celebrated John\u2019s beautiful life: his courage to forge the life he dreamed in an unfamiliar landscape, his dedication to his craft, his epic friendships and loving temperament.\u201d But the life of Belushi cannot be told without reference to his death. And as much as those close to him wish others would stop focusing on the drugs, almost all the people I speak to about him talk without prompting about the effect drugs had on the man they loved. But it is also true that while the drugs might have added to his legend, he wouldn\u2019t be a legendary comedian if he had just been an addict. Belushi was born and raised in suburban Chicago, the oldest son of Albanian immigrants. \u201cHis parents never assimilated and I think it was hard for John, going to this all-American high school in the day and coming home to this very Albanian family in the evening. None of us in the neighbourhood even knew what Albania was,\u201d says Pisano, who started dating Belushi while they were at school together. \u201cJohn looked different from all of us \u2013 dark, and there was a joke that he was born with a beard. So he was self-conscious of his ethnicity, and he never brought people back to his home \u2013 he always went to other people\u2019s houses. Maybe that\u2019s when he got in the habit of always hanging out with people.\u201d Whatever insecurities Belushi felt about his background, he was a star from the get-go. At school, he was a footballer, a drummer in a band, a talent-show champion and the homecoming king. After a brief foray into college, he tried out for Second City, the Chicago improvisational comedy enterprise that has since trained Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert and Amy Poehler. He was \u2013 and remains \u2013 the only actor to be hired directly into the main troupe, as opposed to having to train with the touring company first. Belushi, by now something of a shaggy haired, dope-smoking hippy, could do extreme gross-out jokes, but also subtle physical comedy, and he stole every sketch he was in. \u201cThe first night I saw him improvising on stage, I thought, \u2018God, I will never take chances like that. I don\u2019t have that kind of courage.\u2019 But there was always something safer and more comfortable about being me than there was about being him,\u201d Belushi\u2019s fellow Second City performer, Harold Ramis, later recalled. Belushi was then hired by the National Lampoon to do its stage and radio shows, along with Christopher Guest, Chevy Chase, Radner, Bill Murray and Ramis. This was arguably the greatest generation of young American comedic talent, and Belushi was at the very centre of it. Reitman produced the off-Broadway production, the National Lampoon Show. \u201cI tried to direct them, but they all laughed that off \u2013 they directed themselves. But while they didn\u2019t listen to me, they all listened to John. He was the most remarkable performer in this remarkable group. He would just walk on stage with this Brando-like charisma,\u201d says Reitman. People who knew Belushi in the early years describe a warm and deeply loyal man, one who always tried to get jobs for his friends and was so gentle that if his cat fell asleep on his lap he would be late for rehearsals rather than wake up his pet. On the other hand, he could be \u201cintimidating, because he was such a force of personality. That was how you had to be to stand out and be funny in that group,\u201d says Reitman. It was at this point that Belushi was hired to be in the first season of SNL. \u201cJohn was wary of TV at first, but he knew the most essential thing: how to hold the audience in his hand. He never left the stage without connecting with the audience. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me that he took off like he did,\u201d says Lorne Michaels, SNL\u2019s creator and producer. As much as the show made Belushi\u2019s name, it was, Pisano tells me, \u201calso something of a battle for him\u201d. Belushi had struggled with Chase and Guest at National Lampoon: \u201cThey had a private school, put-down kind of humour, and John was an easy mark. He was from the midwest, he was overweight, he hadn\u2019t graduated from college, he was ethnic \u2013 no, even better, he was Albanian. This was all good fodder,\u201d she writes in Belushi, her 2005 biography of her late husband. This dynamic repeated itself on SNL, as Chase was also hired in the first season: \u201cChevy has a very quick wit and his humour could be cruel. I think they were mutually fond of each other, but they were competitive,\u201d she says. But Belushi soon found his groove and eventually became the show\u2019s star, thanks to his parody of Joe Cocker, his samurai character, his furious weather man and, eventually, the Blues Brothers with his close friend Dan Aykroyd. But there were some complaints about his behaviour. \u201cHe started to say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do the girls\u2019 scenes,\u2019\u201d says Pisano, meaning he would refuse to act in scenes written by women. Belushi was close to Radner and hugely respected her as a comedian, but other women on the show weren\u2019t impressed. Fellow SNL performer Jane Curtin has since described his behaviour as sexist. \u201cBy the second season, John was on covers of magazines and experiencing a whole new level of fame. It became overwhelming for him, and that was expressed in all the late nights, the drugs,\u201d says Michaels. In 1976, Ramis, along with the National Lampoon\u2019s Doug Kenney and Chris Miller, wrote a comedy script about a college frat house. Universal Studios told them that unless they got Belushi to play the toga-wearing, compulsively eating character Bluto they wouldn\u2019t produce the movie. \u201cSo I went to New York to persuade him,\u201d says the director John Landis. \u201cWe met in my hotel and during the meeting Belushi makes a call down to room service.

But Belushi imbued him with so much energy he is still the first thing everyone thinks of about Animal House. \u201cI ended up taking dialogue away from him because John could do so much with his face and body.

At around this time, Belushi and Aykroyd started performing as the Blues Brothers. Belushi was now in the biggest movie, the coolest TV show and in the most exciting band around. Just walking down the road to a diner would take him an hour, getting past all the fans. \u201cA lot of people who reach celebrity status shut down and don\u2019t engage, but John always wanted to engage with everyone. But you have to be very grounded to cope with all those demands,\u201d says Pisano. The most notable film he made at this point was 1941, Steven Spielberg\u2019s notorious turkey, and this became a pattern, with Belushi repeatedly making movies that failed to live up to expectations.

We called him Slimer, but it was really the spirit of John in all of our hearts.\u201d I ask Reitman about the comparisons between Murray and Belushi, and he points to the key difference between them: \u201cBill was always much more careful about fame,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s very careful about who he socialises with and he\u2019s very anti-Hollywood. He always wanted a much more simple life. Also, he never got into drugs, whereas John jumped in feet first.\u201d Landis sees another difference between them: \u201cI think John would have been a much, much bigger star than Bill Murray. Bill is always Bill Murray, whereas John was a real actor. There\u2019s very little in common between Bluto and Jake Blues.\u201d Belushi left behind a pitifully small body of enduring work that belied his potential. \u201cThere\u2019s all this mythology around John but the bottom line is he was a charming guy and a brilliant performer,\u201d says Landis. \u201cHe was strong like a tractor and smart like a bull and he really could have gone on to do anything.\u201d Part of the fascination with Belushi is that, in retrospect, he looks, as Pisano puts it, \u201clike a symbol of the times\u201d: the 60s dope-smoking hippy who brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to comedy in the 70s and was swallowed up by cocaine in the 80s. But his appeal lies in the man himself: there was nothing aloof or untouchable about him, as was the case with a lot of comedians of that era. There was something far more human, more emotional about Belushi. So while audiences admired Chase, Steve Martin and Murray, they loved Belushi. He was as open and exposed as a sunflower, and while it ultimately contributed to his undoing, it is also why so many people still feel a connection to him. \u201cOne of my favourite things in my office is a Polaroid of the two of us from 1976,\u201d says Michaels. \u201cI look at it and there was an innocence to John then, a brightness. That\u2019s what I remember about him.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an election is not a single decisive event, but just one part of a never-ending struggle to gain and keep power in which living to fight another day is as important as landing a knockout punch.</p> <p>Of the half dozen or so major players a year ago, only two or three remain standing.</p> <p>Felix Tshisekedi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/10/congo-election-felix-tshisekedi-declared-winner-in-contentious-result\">named as the surprise, provisional winner</a> of last month\u2019s much delayed presidential vote, is the 55-year-old son of the country\u2019s most respected opposition leader. However, he has never held high office or even a managerial role, and his Belgian professional qualifications have been questioned by opponents.</p> <p>Tshisekedi is the leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), DRC\u2019s oldest and largest opposition party. Critics say he is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. \u201cHis father was a man of the country. The son is very limited,\u201d Valentin Mubake, former secretary-general of Tshisekedi\u2019s party told the Guardian last month.</p> <p>In 2008, he became national secretary for external relations and was elected to the national assembly in 2011 as representative for Mbuji-Mayi, the country\u2019s third city. However, he never took up his seat as he did not formally recognise his father \u00c9tienne\u2019s 2011 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/17/congo-joseph-kabila-election-victory\">election defeat to Joseph Kabila</a>.</p> <p>He inherited the UDPS leadership when \u00c9tienne \u2013 who spent 35 years leading the opposition but never won office \u2013 died in 2017.

The conclusions of 40,000 observers deployed by the church on the day of the election are that he won.</p> <p>Fayulu, who has denounced the result as an \u201celectoral coup\u201d, is not a \u201c<em>fils de</em>\u201d (\u201cson of\u201d) like Tshisekedi and many other dynastic politicians across the continent. He is a former business executive and 30-year veteran of politics who has earned a reputation as brave, honest and effective. More importantly, perhaps, he also has the backing of political heavyweights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/08/former-congo-leader-jean-pierre-bemba-wins-war-crimes-appeal-international-criminal-court\">Jean-Pierre Bemba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/04/drc-opposition-leader-may-be-barred-from-elections-over-italian-citizenship\">Moise Katumbi</a>, both forced into effective exile overseas and unable to contend the polls.</p> <p>\u201cFayulu came very fast from more or less nowhere to become this great people\u2019s champion, but it is unclear if he has the big organisation and depth of support he needs now. We are about to find out,\u201d said Ben Shepherd, an expert in the DRC at London\u2019s Chatham House.</p> <p>The real winner may be the outgoing president. Kabila, 47, took power in 2001 on the assassination of his father Laurent, and ceded only reluctantly to regional powers\u2019 pressure to hold elections. He was banned from standing by the constitution\u2019s two-term limit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-politics/congos-outgoing-president-kabila-doesnt-rule-out-running-again-in-2023-idUSKBN1O80DV\">Kabila has made no secret of his continuing political ambitions</a>, which is one reason why so many analysts say Fayulu\u2019s claims that Tshisekedi has done a deal with the DRC\u2019s former ruler may be more than sour grapes.</p> <p>Many noted that Fayulu\u2019s campaign suffered significantly more harassment than Tshisekedi\u2019s, and that the latter\u2019s rhetoric towards erstwhile enemies underwent a dramatic change in recent days.</p> <p>Tshisekedi\u2019s camp has acknowledged contact with Kabila\u2019s representatives since the vote but denied there had been any deal and said talks were aimed at ensuring a peaceful transition</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a bad result at all for the ruling party,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolterssteph?lang=en\">Stephanie Wolters</a>, an analyst at the Institute for Security Studies, in South Africa. \u201cIt will mean a very soft landing for Kabila. With Tshisekedi, they don\u2019t have to give up anything. Kabila gets to walk away looking good and the elite gets to stick around.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an election is not a single decisive event, but just one part of a never-ending struggle to gain and keep power in which living to fight another day is as important as landing a knockout punch. Of the half dozen or so major players a year ago, only two or three remain standing. Felix Tshisekedi, named as the surprise, provisional winner of last month\u2019s much delayed presidential vote, is the 55-year-old son of the country\u2019s most respected opposition leader. However, he has never held high office or even a managerial role, and his Belgian professional qualifications have been questioned by opponents. Tshisekedi is the leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), DRC\u2019s oldest and largest opposition party. Critics say he is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. \u201cHis father was a man of the country. The son is very limited,\u201d Valentin Mubake, former secretary-general of Tshisekedi\u2019s party told the Guardian last month. In 2008, he became national secretary for external relations and was elected to the national assembly in 2011 as representative for Mbuji-Mayi, the country\u2019s third city. However, he never took up his seat as he did not formally recognise his father \u00c9tienne\u2019s 2011 election defeat to Joseph Kabila. He inherited the UDPS leadership when \u00c9tienne \u2013 who spent 35 years leading the opposition but never won office \u2013 died in 2017. Tens of thousands thronged the streets when Tshisekedi visited his political stronghold of Mbuji-Mayi, a southern city, in early elections, chanting slogans calling on the father of five to save the nation. But Tshisekedi\u2019s apparent victory is contested \u2013 not by the outgoing president, Kabila, whose own hand-picked candidate was soundly defeated, but by the opposition rival, Martin Fayulu, who came a close second. The few reliable surveys of pre-poll voting intentions make it clear that Fayulu was the favourite by a considerable margin. The conclusions of 40,000 observers deployed by the church on the day of the election are that he won. Fayulu, who has denounced the result as an \u201celectoral coup\u201d, is not a \u201cfils de\u201d (\u201cson of\u201d) like Tshisekedi and many other dynastic politicians across the continent. He is a former business executive and 30-year veteran of politics who has earned a reputation as brave, honest and effective. More importantly, perhaps, he also has the backing of political heavyweights Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi, both forced into effective exile overseas and unable to contend the polls. \u201cFayulu came very fast from more or less nowhere to become this great people\u2019s champion, but it is unclear if he has the big organisation and depth of support he needs now. We are about to find out,\u201d said Ben Shepherd, an expert in the DRC at London\u2019s Chatham House. The real winner may be the outgoing president. Kabila, 47, took power in 2001 on the assassination of his father Laurent, and ceded only reluctantly to regional powers\u2019 pressure to hold elections. He was banned from standing by the constitution\u2019s two-term limit. Kabila has made no secret of his continuing political ambitions, which is one reason why so many analysts say Fayulu\u2019s claims that Tshisekedi has done a deal with the DRC\u2019s former ruler may be more than sour grapes. Many noted that Fayulu\u2019s campaign suffered significantly more harassment than Tshisekedi\u2019s, and that the latter\u2019s rhetoric towards erstwhile enemies underwent a dramatic change in recent days. Tshisekedi\u2019s camp has acknowledged contact with Kabila\u2019s representatives since the vote but denied there had been any deal and said talks were aimed at ensuring a peaceful transition \u201cThis is not a bad result at all for the ruling party,\u201d said Stephanie Wolters, an analyst at the Institute for Security Studies, in South Africa. \u201cIt will mean a very soft landing for Kabila. With Tshisekedi, they don\u2019t have to give up anything. Kabila gets to walk away looking good and the elite gets to stick around.\u201d",

Having the operation last year was to give it the best possible chance of being better. I have been playing with hip pain for a number of years, it wasn\u2019t as if it just started at the French Open after my match against Stan [Wawrinka, in the 2017 semi-final]. </p> \n   <p>It got to a level where I didn\u2019t recover from that match, pushed it over the edge. Having the operation would hopefully make it as good as possible. It didn\u2019t help with the pain at all. There are certain things on the court I cannot really do properly now, but the pain is the driving factor. </p> \n   <p>I can play with limitations, that\u2019s not an issue, it\u2019s having the limitations and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis. I have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s just about time for me to return to other activities. Thank you for your company and be sure to check back throughout the day for more reaction to Andy Murray\u2019s retirement announcement. In the meantime, here\u2019s Sir Andrew Barron Murray OBE rapping (skip to 1.30 to minimise the pain). You\u2019re welcome. Ok, so this not a question I expect an answer to any time soon (especially not towards the ends of my stint on the blog) but where does Murray\u2019s career rank in the history of British sport? Two olympic gold medals, a Davis Cup, three slams (including two at Wimbledon) - and all achieved during a period of tennis that could not have been tougher. He has to be considered right up there with the very best. Rory McIlroy agrees. You\u2019re not going to find a more driven, more dedicated professional athlete in the world than Andy Murray. He does absolutely everything in his power to get the most out of his game. He\u2019s a Wimbledon champion, US Open champion, Olympic champion. He\u2019s one of the best British sportspeople ever in my opinion. In other tennis news, local hope Thanasi Kokkinakis has qualified for the Australian Open main draw, while Ash Barty is a set down in her Sydney International semi-final with Kiki Bertens. \u201cI\u2019m an Indian living in the U.S. and I have lived all the highs and lows of Andy\u2019s career like that of no other tennis player. I remember exactly where I was when Andy won his first Wimbledon title in 2013. In a little cafe in Istanbul (on holiday) checking the score every few seconds on my phone like a maniac and chewing my nails till there were none left! I\u2019ve been a huge tennis fan since I was a kid but haven\u2019t watched too many matches since Andy\u2019s hip injury since I can\u2019t stand to see tournaments without my favourite player. Andy - you are an absolute legend and you will always be special to all your fans all over the world!\u201d Thanks for the email Swati. We\u2019ll miss the deadpan humour, that is for sure. British tennis, once a light-entertainment punchline, reached glorious heights at Murray\u2019s peak. Perhaps the only other man on the ATP World Tour who can rival Murray for misfortune in the injury and trying-to-win-slams-against-three-legends stakes is the Tower of Tandil. The tributes from tour colleagues keep pouring in. Here\u2019s the second story posted about Murray on The Guardian online. It\u2019s from back in 2005 when Martina Navratilova delivered a column brimful of insight. He\u2019s already strapped up; he\u2019s pretty strong but he\u2019s really long and lanky and that puts real strain on the joints. Players like Pete Sampras are more compact but Andy\u2019s arms and legs are soooo long and it\u2019s this kind of body type that is more likely to have problems with the joints. He\u2019s already had ankle injuries and that\u2019s what you can\u2019t control. Back in 2016 Murray looked set for an extended spell as the king of men\u2019s tennis. Injuries were beginning to catch up with Federer and Nadal while Djokovic looked spent after an extraordinary run of form. Alas it wasn\u2019t to be. Favourite Murray memory? This would have to be up there. Just a week ago life was all park cricket and kangaroo tails. On any other day Andy Murray would be making headlines for continuing to be a thoroughly good bloke. After struggling through a hit-up with Novak Djokovic yesterday he dived into his Instagram mentions and offered tickets to his Australian Open round one match to a fan who he was concerned he had disappointed. He wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be more entertaining today - thanks for the support.\u201d Then: \u201cIf you\u2019d like to come along and watch on Monday or Tuesday I\u2019ll sort you a ticket.\u201d The full unedited press conference is gut-wrenching. You hope someone was ready to give him a big hug as soon as he walked out of the media centre. Richard Hill has contributed a terrific email. \u201cI\u2019m English but lived in Scotland for 10 years. I played tennis for Edinburgh Uni in the late 90s and early 00s when the Murray brothers were growing up and practicing on some of the same courts in Edinburgh and Stirling. I\u2019m pretty sure I practiced close by them when they were being coached by their mum. I\u2019ve lived in the US for 15 years, with comprehensive coverage of all his important matches, most of which I watched. I have friends in Stirling and Dunblane. It\u2019s an incredibly tight community. Andy rarely mentions it, but they are so proud of their own and how he represents them, given their shared horrifying memories. On a larger scale, he\u2019s come to represent so much more than one of the greatest British athletes of all time. We knew he was in pain for much of his later career, which made his resilience and brilliance so much more inspiring, especially through the year he won his second Wimbledon and retained the Olympic title. As a cancer patient myself, I appreciate his efforts to raise money and awareness of the disease through his charity work; as a British tennis player, he instilled so much pride for us on the biggest stages in the most brutal era of competition. As a human being capable of the utmost integrity and honesty, he should always be lauded as an example for every young person.\u201d Could Murray\u2019s retirement herald the beginning of the end of a golden age of men\u2019s tennis? As Kevin Mitchell wrote recently, we could be in for a few significant retirement announcements in the not too distant future. The four greatest male players in modern tennis \u2013 who between them have won more than \u00a3400m across 16 years \u2013 arrive in Melbourne aware that their days as a dominant entity are numbered, if not already history. This, for example, is beat perfect. Murray\u2019s advocacy for women\u2019s sport and women\u2019s tennis in particular is reflected in the tributes he\u2019s receiving today. Adam Hirst has shared his favourite highlight from Andy Murray\u2019s career, and you can to, via the contact details at the top of the page. \u201cFavourite Murray Moment? All of him really. Just having a top-class British tennis player to enjoy, a top-class interviewee to listen to, and a top-class sportsman and human being to admire all these years. One moment that I enjoyed was when he\u2019d defended the hell out of Tommy Robredo in the 2014 Valencia Final, and really shouldn\u2019t have won it. Robredo waited for the collapsed Murray to meet him at the net, leaning over it and gave him the double bird with a wry smile on his face. It was lovely. And the Wimbledon win, Obviously. He did the rest for himself, I just enjoyed it. He won Wimbledon for all of us.\u201d Lovely stuff Adam, this is quite superb. Thanks Mike. I won\u2019t pretend to be anything other than downbeat. Andy Murray is ace. OK, duty calls for me, so I\u2019ll hand you over to Jonathan Howcroft, who will steer through the rest of the reaction. Bye for now. If ever a single point, and a situation, were to sum up Murray as a player and a character, this is quite possibly it: Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, one of the foes Murray faced regularly over the years and who he beat in the 2016 Olympic final, refuses to believe it\u2019s over. The tributes are running thick and fast. This is particularly lovely. \u201cAndy achieved what I thought I would never see in my lifetime firstly seeing a British player win the US Open and then of course that unforgettable first Wimbledon,\u201d emails Darren Downs. \u201cI was always a big fan of his but it couldn\u2019t compare to how big a fan my mum was. She would watch every match of his whatever time it was played. I can\u2019t say she watched every minute because she would often have to disappear into another room when things got particularly tense as they so often did with him. When he won Wimbledon the pride she had was almost as if one of her own kids had done it. \u201cSadly she became seriously ill in 2015. She would still watch almost every match and as he wasn\u2019t having a great time she kept telling me he would have his day again. She was convinced of it. In 2016 she was proved right and how. Sadly her favourite armchair was empty when he won Wimbledon the 2nd time and when he finally got to number 1 but I like to think she was looking down on events from a new favourite armchair. I don\u2019t know if Andy realises just how much his achievements meant to so many of the British public but I can only thank him for the many joyful moments he gave to my mum during difficult times for her. He\u2019ll be sorely missed.\u201d After Murray called for female players to get equal billing on the show courts at Wimbledon in 2017, his words prompted the Guardian\u2019s Zoe Williams to write: [Murray] is the No 1 internal critic of the tennis patriarchy. Like a socialist needs Warren Buffett to criticise shareholders, a feminist needs Andy Murray to criticise tennis. Murray isn\u2019t just an incredible athlete. His advocacy for gender equality in sport over the course of his career, and in particular in recent years, has been unrivalled. He will be sorely missed on the men\u2019s circuit but his absence will be equally felt on the women\u2019s side of the game. \u201cA few Murray memories,\u201d writes Max Sopel on email. \u201cThe fourth round win over Gasquet at Wimbledon in 08... typical Murray rollercoaster with a magical ending. Remember being on the tube in London for the final set, desperately wanting us to get overground to check the score! Also, the gold medal against Del Potro was pretty special, both of them in tears at the end. Beating Federer for gold a few months after losing the final to him at Wimbledon! Just so happy he won some slams... after losing five or so in a row the relief when he won the US open was huge! Legend and hope he commentates in retirement.\u201d Consider those achievements listed by Niall earlier. And then consider Murray has played in an era when three of the greatest male players of all time have also been active. It\u2019s really quite remarkable. And I think it\u2019s widely accepted that if Murray had been born 10 years earlier or later, he too would have a bagful of major titles to his name. I\u2019m not crying. You\u2019re crying. Thanks Niall, and hello from Sydney. I\u2019ll take up the reins for the next half hour or so as the sad news of Murray\u2019s impending retirement begins to sink in. Feel free to send your thoughts over via email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or Twitter (@mike_hytner). I\u2019m going to hand over to Mike Hytner now, who will guide you through more reaction and Murray memories. Here are a few more quotes from Murray on the hip problems that have plagued him for the last 18 months, and why he\u2019s decided to call time on his career: I have a severely damaged right hip. Having the operation last year was to give it the best possible chance of being better. I have been playing with hip pain for a number of years, it wasn\u2019t as if it just started at the French Open after my match against Stan [Wawrinka, in the 2017 semi-final]. It got to a level where I didn\u2019t recover from that match, pushed it over the edge. Having the operation would hopefully make it as good as possible. It didn\u2019t help with the pain at all. There are certain things on the court I cannot really do properly now, but the pain is the driving factor. I can play with limitations, that\u2019s not an issue, it\u2019s having the limitations and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis. I have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately. I wish it did, because it would be feeling brilliant right now. I\u2019m not sure if anything Murray achieved was more extraordinary than winning the Davis Cup for Great Britain. It\u2019s a team event, of course, but it felt like he carried the team to the trophy by sheer force of will. He also pushed his body to the limit for the cause. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg reflecting on that victory back in 2015: Here\u2019s Holly Lane with a lovely tribute: I\u2019m absolutely devastated by this announcement, because it\u2019s clear he has so much more to give, but his hip just won\u2019t let him. I think we all hoped he would make this amazing comeback against all the odds, just because he\u2019s Andy Murray, the consummate fighter. Like so many Brits, I\u2019ve been watching him for years, and Wimbledon \u201813 was breathtaking, especially after his emotional final the year earlier. But really the highlights for me are all the little times he shows what a gent he is, both on and off court. His respect for his fellow competitors, how he mentors younger players, and the way he shuts down anyone who implies that female players aren\u2019t deserving of the same respect (and pay) as the men. Sir Andy will be sorely missed. Murray had plenty of highs to go with the lows \u2013 and it was the failures along the way as he battled into the \u2018big four\u2019, as much as his later successes, that endeared him to the British public. Today\u2019s announcement feels strange because we\u2019re so used to seeing Murray get back up when he\u2019s knocked down. Murray is known off-court for never being short of a quote or two; you can be sure the punditry offers will be pouring in once he finally bids farewell to tennis. Here are some of his most memorable lines: \u201cI don\u2019t play in any tournaments to come second best.\u201d \u201cWe Scots have a fierce pride in the things we do that others can never appreciate. I am the British No 1, but I would prefer to be the British No 1 from Scotland every time.\u201d \u201cWhen I was serving for the title [at the 2012 US Open], there was a sense of how big a moment that is in British tennis history. It\u2019s great to have finally done it.\u201d \u201cPeople think I am unemotional because my voice is flat and a bit boring. It is unfortunate but it is just the way it is. The truth is, I have lots of emotions inside.\u201d After winning his first Wimbledon title: \u201cI worked so hard in that last game. It\u2019s the hardest few points I\u2019ve had to play in my life. My head was kind of everywhere. That last game will be the toughest game I\u2019ll play in my career, ever.\u201d \u201cContrary to my image, I do have a sense of humour.\u201d It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Murray was on top of the world \u2013 finally shaking his long-time rival, Novak Djokovic, from the summit of the world rankings after a stellar 2016. Both men pushed their bodies to the limit that season and have suffered since \u2013 but while Djokovic has returned to the pinnacle of the game, Murray has been unable to do the same. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell with a nice piece from that era, which reminds us why Murray is so loved at home and around the world: Murray\u2019s career in numbers: Courtesy of PA, here are some standout figures from Murray\u2019s time in tennis: No 1 Murray became the first British singles player ever to officially be ranked world number one on November 7, 2016. 41 The number of weeks Murray spent on top of the rankings. Three grand slam titles 11 grand slam finals 45 career singles titles Two doubles titles \u2013 both with his brother, Jamie Nine singles titles in 2016, including five in a row to end the season as world number one Two Olympic singles gold medals 11 Murray won every rubber he contested to drive Great Britain to Davis Cup glory in 2015 663 Tour-level matches won $61,055,135 total career prize money Three BBC Sports Personality of the Year titles 5,573 aces served 29 combined wins against Federer, Nadal and Djokovic Andy Roddick, the three-time Wimbledon finalist, is one of the first tennis greats to pay tribute to Murray, calling him one of the game\u2019s \u201cbest tacticians in history\u201d: Murray will retire with three grand slams, two Olympic golds and a total of 45 ATP career titles. Perhaps more than anything else, he\u2019ll be remembered for doing what for so long had seemed impossible \u2013 ending Britain\u2019s long wait for a men\u2019s Wimbledon singles champion. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from that glorious day back in 2013: Get in touch We\u2019ve listed some of Murray\u2019s finest moments below \u2013 but please get in touch with your own personal favourites via via email, or tweet me \u2013 @niallmcveigh. Here\u2019s what Murray had to say at that dramatic press conference, having initially broken down when asked about his hip pain: \u201cI\u2019m not feeling good. I\u2019ve been struggling for a long time. Been in a lot of pain for 20 months now. Pretty much done everything I could to make my hip feel better. \u201cWimbledon is where I would like to stop playing but I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll be able to do that. I\u2019m not certain I can play through the pain for another four or five months.\u201d Andy Murray has shocked the tennis world by announcing that the upcoming Australian Open may be his final tournament. The former world No 1 has said he wants to bow out at Wimbledon this summer, but may not be able to continue beyond Melbourne. Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report:",

      "bodyText": "Nestled in Sydney\u2019s inner west, from the main gate on Mary Street the ground opens up below you like a volcanic crater. Flanked by the Latchem Robinson stand on one side and the Wayne Pearce hill on the other, from almost any vantage point at Leichhardt Oval you feel as though you\u2019re looming, deity-like, above the action on the field. Like Australian suburbia\u2019s answer to the coliseum. It\u2019s a place where you can still sneak a smoke on the hill, where the bar remains stubbornly cash only, and where the gorgeous old scoreboard is manually operated. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It\u2019s a ground famous for its unruly, slightly bolshie atmosphere. The legendary Queensland halfback Johnathan Thurston, who never won a game there, once called it the toughest place in the NRL to play: \u201cEven the 12-year-olds spray me there.\u201d The list of things a person can love unconditionally is necessarily short. For me it\u2019s Mum, Dad, and the Balmain Tigers. Ancillary to all three though is Leichhardt. Home more or less for the Tigers since 1934 \u2013 interrupted only by a brief period of insanity in the mid-90s \u2013 Leichhardt is to rugby league what Victoria Park or Moorabbin were to the AFL, or Fenway Park is to baseball. As a kid I remember watching the game between Dad\u2019s arms, standing on tippy toes to see over the fence, and, as the smell of coffee and Old Spice cologne wafted over me, watching the late Laurie Nicholls shadow boxing on the sideline while Eye of the Tiger played over the rattling loudspeakers and Dad shouted himself hoarse with obscenities it would take me years to fully comprehend. \u201cBurrow it up \u2018em, Tiges!\u201d was his main go-to, and probably the only one even vaguely fit to print. On most days, we left as losers. In my lifetime, Balmain \u2013 now Wests - have but for one glorious, astounding year in 2005 been perennial under-performers on the field, while lurching from one crisis to the next off it: from the humiliating to the infuriating, and, lately, the existential. The author Graham Greene once said that it\u2019s only in misery that we\u2019re truly aware of our own existence. If that\u2019s true than nothing could make you feel more alive than supporting the Tigers. One night in particular stands out. In August 1998, when I was nine years old, Paul Sironen played his last game of rugby league for Balmain at Leichhardt. A burly, headband-wearing prop whose side gig was and remains modelling for discount clothes shop Lowes, Sironen was the final member of the Tigers last quasi-glory period in the late 1980s, when they played in (and lost) two consecutive grand finals. I was there that night with Mum and Dad. We stood in our usual spot against the fence on the grandstand side looking across at the hill and watched, in what I remember to be near-monsoonal rain, as Eastern Suburbs dismantled Balmain in the same dispassionate way Javier Bardem offs his victims in No Country for Old Men. Sometime towards the end of the game the Tigers scored a consolation try to make the score 40-4, and covered in mud and dripping with rain Sironen stepped up to take the conversion kick. A sentimental touch at the end of a less-than-ideal send off. He missed, of course. I couldn\u2019t find any video of the game but my memory tells me it was by a distance. We stayed for the lap of honour, then soddenly slip-slided our way down the hill in the dark towards home. But despite the years, and years, of mediocrity, Leichhardt made us \u2013 still makes us \u2013 feel as though we had something other clubs didn\u2019t. A tribal home which had managed to outlive the game\u2019s open-armed embrace of commercialisation. In an era when rugby league is so often defined by cavernous, half-empty \u201centertainment precincts\u201d plastered in advertising and reverberating with asinine sponsor announcements, its chaotic, unreconstructed atmosphere can feel like a salve for an itch you didn\u2019t know you had. But, as a diehard supporter of any sporting team will maybe understand, loving a club or a stadium or a player is really about something less tangible. In 2013 Dad had a stroke which, five or so years later, he\u2019s never really recovered from. The booming, acerbic voice which used to make people crane their necks at the footy barely rises above a whisper. The loss of speech and mobility means he\u2019s become mostly insular, and Mum likes to make glib reference to his \u201chappy pills\u201d. In other words, his days excoriating professional athletes from the sidelines are probably over. But when I return now as an adult I am flooded with memories like that dreadful night in 1998 when I stood in the rain with my parents and watched our team get pummelled again. And it is nice to know that I will always hold that with me. Leichhardt has become such a symbol of the game\u2019s past that it\u2019s a truism to call it a throw-back rugby league experience. But history does hang around the place. The club\u2019s, and my own.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency if Congress does not meet his demand for billions of dollars to construct a wall along the US-Mexico border as part of a deal to end the partial government shutdown. The president visited the Texas border on Thursday \u2013 the 20th day of a partial government shutdown \u2013 in a publicity ploy to help make the case for funding his long-promised wall after negotiations with Democrats broke down. As he left the White House for McAllen, Texas, Trump told reporters he would prefer to work with Congress on a deal to end the shutdown, which was triggered by his insistence on funds for the wall, but he warned that he would use his emergency powers to circumvent Congress if they could not come to an agreement. \u201cI have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,\u201d Trump said, contradicting legal scholars who have questioned the president\u2019s right to take such action in this case. \u201cI haven\u2019t done it yet, I may do it. If this doesn\u2019t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely,\u201d he said. If the shutdown continues into the weekend, it will become the longest government closure in US history. As part of a series of events at the border, Trump held a roundtable discussion between his officials, border enforcement figures and local citizens, including ranchers, to discuss security. At the meeting Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that a border wall would bring crime down and listened as a sympathetic panel praised his leadership. Later, near Mission, Texas, Trump accompanied law enforcement to a rural stretch of the border where he shook hands with soldiers and border patrol agents. The visit falls at a highly awkward and politically perilous moment for Trump. His dogged refusal to reopen the government unless Democrats in control of the House sign off on $5.7bn for his border wall means that 800,000 federal employees have been sent home or are working without pay. On Thursday, the association that represents thousands of FBI agents warned that the shutdown could cause laboratory delays, reduce money for investigations and make it harder to recruit and retain agents. The FBI Agents Association sent a petition to the White House and congressional leaders encouraging them to fund the FBI immediately. Friday will be the first day that the nearly 13,000 special agents will miss their paychecks. \u201cThis is not about politics for special agents. For special agents, financial security is national security,\u201d Tom O\u2019Connor, the association\u2019s president, told reporters in a conference call. Nearly 5,000 special agents, intelligence analysts and other staff are currently furloughed. Trump\u2019s border tour came as the rift between Trump and the newly powerful Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives appeared to be expanding. On Wednesday, Trump walked out of a meeting with the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, after Pelosi repeated her refusal to fund the wall. With Trump digging himself into a hole in which he has vowed to keep the shutdown going for months or even years unless he gets his wall, an end to the impasse looks distant. His strategic priority appears to be sustaining the support of his political base of hardline supporters by fueling fears of a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d at the border. He did just that earlier this week in his first primetime address to the nation from the Oval Office. The speech warned of \u201cvast quantities of illegal drugs\u201d and criminals pouring into the US in terms that the Democrats denounced as \u201cmisinformation and even malice\u201d. On Thursday, Trump blamed the Democrats as he canceled a planned visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month amid the shutdown, signaling he was prepared for the political showdown to stretch into late January. \u201cBecause of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. Among those traveling in Texas with the president is the top White House lawyer, Pat Cipollone, prompting speculation that Trump might be preparing to declare the \u201cnational emergency\u201d in the hope of bypassing Congress to fund the wall. The 1976 National Emergencies Act grants a president powers to move unilaterally in times of crisis. But any such move in this case would almost certainly face instant challenges in the courts. The White House has nonetheless begun preparing the groundwork for Trump to issue a declaration, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. The Trump administration was reportedly looking into the possibility of reallocating unused money in the budget for the Army Corps of Engineers, a federal agency under the defense department, toward the construction of the wall. At least one prominent Republican endorsed the idea on Thursday. \u201cIt is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, in a statement. \u201cI hope it works.\u201d The last time Trump travelled to the Mexican border was in March when he made a much-vaunted inspection of eight 30ft-high prototypes of a border wall outside San Diego. Four months later, the US Government Accountability Office, which monitors federal services on behalf of Congress, issued its report on the prototypes. The GAO found that they failed to meet several basic standards, with faulty construction and inappropriate design for difficult terrain.",

It is understood it will take the well-worn Bruce highway campaign path, as Labor takes aim at nine of the Coalition\u2019s 21 Queensland seats. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The Brisbane seats of Bonner, in the eastern suburbs, Dickson in the north, Forde in the south and Brisbane itself, remain within striking distance, as do Capricornia, Leichhardt and Flynn. Petrie and Dawson still sit on the list, although Luke Howarth and George Christensen\u2019s personal popularity in those electorates are expected to be somewhat of a buffer to a anti-government swing. Labor also needs to shore up Cathy O\u2019Toole\u2019s seat of Herbert, centred on Townsville, which she won by just 37 votes in 2016. Picking up seats in Queensland is all it would take for Labor to win government since the sunshine state held the Coalition line in 2016, despite a national swing against it. Morrison\u2019s bus trip aimed to shore up support in key electorates; party polling showed he was a more attractive option to Queenslanders, particularly in must-win central and northern electorates, than Malcolm Turnbull. Labor has focused much of its effort on Queensland for the past two and a half years, launching candidates early and running the Longman byelection as a test case for the federal poll due this year. But it is not all bad news for the Coalition in Queensland. The Leichhardt MP, Warren Entsch, has confirmed to the party and the prime minister that he will run again, giving the LNP its best shot in his north Queensland seat. Labor sees the seat as a prime target once Entsch is no longer the candidate. He had discussed pulling the pin at the next election after internal battles with the state branch and frustration with the party room in Canberra. But he told Guardian Australia he had decided to stay to finish work on local projects, including connecting the Daintree to a mains-like power grid, continuing his work tackling tuberculosis, and road projects. \u201cI call it unfinished business,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve committed to not starting new projects, big projects, but to get this done. I mean, marriage equality was a 14-year long battle. I don\u2019t have another 14 years in the parliament.\u201d But he, more than his Queensland party room colleagues, acknowledged holding the north would be tough. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I will win it,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a Labor candidate, a Greens candidate, there is Pauline Hanson and Katter and Palmer as well. The ETU and CFMEU are out here protesting all the time, along with GetUp and anti-Adani folk \u2026 \u201cAnd for me, this is the second election where people who were born in 1996, when I first ran, will be voting. The second ... \u201cIt is going to be difficult. But I think this election we just need to focus on our own seats and leave the bigger stuff to take care of itself. Be the best MP you can be, keep your concern for your own patch, don\u2019t worry about what is happening next door, just concentrate on your own electorate. \u201cI think that is how we can succeed.\u201d Morrison has signalled the election will be held in May, after announcing the budget would be on 2 April, in which the government is set to announce a multibillion-dollar surplus. But pressure remains for the election to be called for March, with the announcement to be made immediately after Australia Day, ahead of the NSW state election.",

Minutes from board meetings obtained by attorneys for the shareholder reveal the personal involvement of Alphabet directors in behavior that has harmed the company, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys Ann Ravel, Louise Renne and Frank Bottini said at a press conference. \u201cThe directors\u2019 wrongful conduct allowed the illegal conduct to proliferate and continue,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cAs such, members of Alphabet\u2019s board were knowing and direct enablers of the sexual harassment and discrimination.\u201d The shareholder, James Martin, is suing each of Alphabet\u2019s current directors, a former director and several current or former executives on behalf of Alphabet itself, in what is known as a shareholder derivative lawsuit. \u201cGoogle and the board of directors have direct personal liability for covering up the wrongdoing and allowing it to continue for years, thereby significantly harming women employees at Google,\u201d Bottini said. \u201cThey would never sue themselves \u2026 [so] the law allows a current shareholder to bring a case against the board.\u201d The suit seeks damages, including the return of more than $90m that was paid to two former executives in severance packages, as well as reforms to Alphabet\u2019s corporate governance and share structure. \u201cThere has been substantial evidence of sexual harassment at Google, and yet there hasn\u2019t been the appropriate follow-through,\u201d said Renne. \u201cIn fact, quite to the contrary, the perpetrators of the sexual harassment have been awarded handsomely \u2026 What Ann and Frank and I are saying is \u2018Time\u2019s up.\u2019 Now it\u2019s really time to start doing the right thing.\u201d Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The allegations in the suit chiefly concern the board\u2019s handling of Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android software platform who left Google in 2014. In October, the New York Times reported that Rubin\u2019s departure followed an investigation into a claim by a female employee that he had forced her to perform oral sex. Despite finding the allegation credible, Google allowed Rubin to resign with a $90m exit package, the Times reported. News of the payout ignited unprecedented outrage among Google employees, thousands of whom staged a global walkout to demand change. The lawsuit alleges that the board minutes show that the payout was approved by board members \u201csince they apparently feared that if they fired Rubin for cause, he would sue Google for wrongful termination and all the tawdry details of sexual harassment by senior executives at Google would become public\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Confused by the latest developments in the UK\u2019s fraught departure from the European Union? Here\u2019s your no-frills primer to what\u2019s going on in Brexit \u2013 and what might happen next. What should be happening? Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part divorce deal late last year. The first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the \u201cbackstop\u201d) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada. In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March. Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal). So why isn\u2019t it? Essentially because the withdrawal agreement \u2013 and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border \u2013 does not have a majority in parliament. MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels \u201crule-taker\u201d, potentially trapped in the EU\u2019s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU. The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons. That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over. And what now? Good question. The EU hasn\u2019t budged (it can\u2019t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters. Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals \u2013 in the form of amendments to the deal \u2013 with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work. In the meantime, the prime minister\u2019s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling \u2013 and winning \u2013 amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely. The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May\u2019s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour\u2019s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted \u201cNorway-plus\u201d, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking. Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it \u2013 or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament \u2013 to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.

Trailing his series This Week, which has to wait to get on air until Bruce\u2019s show is over at 11.45pm, Neil concluded a metaphor about traffic jams with the words, \u201cHonk if you hate Question Time,\u201d an apparent resumption of the bad blood between the Thursday night rivals, for which Neil has been ticked off by BBC bosses in the past.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/david-dimbleby-question-time-departure-bbc-ramp-format\">Thanks, David Dimbleby. Now maybe Question Time can get with the times | Anne Perkins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bruce\u2019s opening link, in which she declared \u201cit\u2019s lovely to be here!\u201d, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show. But her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists - James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson - were as brisk and persistent as Dimbleby\u2019s.</p> \n<p>Bruce could do nothing, though, about the fact that it was a case of new year, new presenter, but same old format and subject matter.</p> \n<p>The only sign of a tweak to the usual proceedings was that Bruce seemed slightly keener to include the people. \u201cLet\u2019s hear from the audience!\u201d made an early bid to become her catchphrase, those interludes introduced by a firm \u201cWait a minute!\u201d to the panellists. And wearing distinctive clothing seems to be the trick to catching her eye. She called on \u201cthe man in the hat\u201d, and members of the public wearing a yellow scarf and jacket respectively. She was so keen to be inclusive that her pen, waving invitingly at the audience, often intruded in the corner of the shot.</p> \n<p>But, if the public is going to be more involved in the discussion, there surely need to be fewer than five panellists. Comedian Nish Kumar spent the first 22 minutes draining his water glass, before being invited to make the first of only three contributions in the hour. The other non-Westminster presence \u2013 journalist Melanie Phillips \u2013 was also called on so rarely that the camera caught her at one point with her head in her hands on the desk.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/07/fiona-bruce-appointed-host-of-bbcs-question-time\">Fiona Bruce 'thrilled and daunted' to be new Question Time host</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Too many guests faced too few topics. One consequence of Theresa May delaying the Commons Brexit vote from early December was that Bruce was stuck with exactly the same questions as Dimbleby had fielded in his farewell show: Could the PM win and was there a plan B if she didn\u2019t? Kumar lamented that, on his three Question Time appearances in the last year, the questions had been the same each time: \u201cI\u2019m stuck in an endless loop!\u201d</p> \n<p>The fate of May\u2019s deal occupied 40 of the available 60 minutes, leaving time for only one other matter: the rise in knife crime in London, the city in which Bruce\u2019s debut was taking place.</p> \n<p>The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.</p> \n<p>As she moves on to Derby and Winchester in the next two weeks, the problem for the host of Antiques Roadshow may be that she has been handed what was sold as a priceless television treasure but which, on close inspection, looks like a rather faded and wobbly relic.</p>",

Trailing his series This Week, which has to wait to get on air until Bruce\u2019s show is over at 11.45pm, Neil concluded a metaphor about traffic jams with the words, \u201cHonk if you hate Question Time,\u201d an apparent resumption of the bad blood between the Thursday night rivals, for which Neil has been ticked off by BBC bosses in the past. Bruce\u2019s opening link, in which she declared \u201cit\u2019s lovely to be here!\u201d, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show. But her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists - James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson - were as brisk and persistent as Dimbleby\u2019s. Bruce could do nothing, though, about the fact that it was a case of new year, new presenter, but same old format and subject matter. The only sign of a tweak to the usual proceedings was that Bruce seemed slightly keener to include the people. \u201cLet\u2019s hear from the audience!\u201d made an early bid to become her catchphrase, those interludes introduced by a firm \u201cWait a minute!\u201d to the panellists. And wearing distinctive clothing seems to be the trick to catching her eye. She called on \u201cthe man in the hat\u201d, and members of the public wearing a yellow scarf and jacket respectively. She was so keen to be inclusive that her pen, waving invitingly at the audience, often intruded in the corner of the shot. But, if the public is going to be more involved in the discussion, there surely need to be fewer than five panellists. Comedian Nish Kumar spent the first 22 minutes draining his water glass, before being invited to make the first of only three contributions in the hour. The other non-Westminster presence \u2013 journalist Melanie Phillips \u2013 was also called on so rarely that the camera caught her at one point with her head in her hands on the desk. Too many guests faced too few topics. One consequence of Theresa May delaying the Commons Brexit vote from early December was that Bruce was stuck with exactly the same questions as Dimbleby had fielded in his farewell show: Could the PM win and was there a plan B if she didn\u2019t? Kumar lamented that, on his three Question Time appearances in the last year, the questions had been the same each time: \u201cI\u2019m stuck in an endless loop!\u201d The fate of May\u2019s deal occupied 40 of the available 60 minutes, leaving time for only one other matter: the rise in knife crime in London, the city in which Bruce\u2019s debut was taking place. The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter. As she moves on to Derby and Winchester in the next two weeks, the problem for the host of Antiques Roadshow may be that she has been handed what was sold as a priceless television treasure but which, on close inspection, looks like a rather faded and wobbly relic.",

A year later, however, on a boiling hot day at SW19, he faced down Novak Djokovic for the second time in three slam finals and won again, in straight sets, although he said he could hardly serve in the final game. He ended the 77-year wait for a British men\u2019s singles champion, against the man considered the <br> best in the world at the time.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>2016: Grand slam No 3</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The defence of his Wimbledon title in 2014 had not gone as planned, but two years later he showed he was back to his best. Against Milos Raonic in the final in SW19, he nullified the Canadian\u2019s huge serve and cantered to victory in straight sets, leaving him one shy of Perry\u2019s total of three Wimbledon wins.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>2016: A slice of Olympic history</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Murray had won gold in the 2012 Games on familiar turf but Rio de Janeiro presented different challenges, yet he overcame those to make Olympic history.

What renders them exquisite is not merely the uniqueness of their acts, be they acrobats, magicians, dancers or songbirds. It\u2019s their immersive theatrical aesthetics that honour the imagined glories of the past: the burlesque bars, circuses, travelling carnivals, speakeasies, music halls and other smoke-and-mirrors spaces in whose shadows common humanity could experience the exotic and thrillingly taboo.</p> <p>In this tradition, Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Mimi promises to \u201cpart the curtains on an enchanted world\u201d. Billing itself as a \u201csumptuous cabaret of delights\u201d, its aesthetic homage is to 1930s Shanghai, \u201ca city famous for its flamboyant clubs and heady nights\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian company Finucane and Smith is an international master of the genre, and the involvement of the brilliant Moira Finucane is reason enough to see a show. She directs this production, which engages \u2013 through cabaret \u2013 the cultural conversation between east and west, and features an international lineup of acts including the Qinghai Acrobatic Troupe and a live band playing \u201clong-lost vintage Chinese jazz and blues unearthed in a condemned Mumbai warehouse\u201d.</p> <p>Also, guests are invited to \u201cdress to the nines and immerse yourself\u201d.

Schaub\u00fchne is known globally for its twisted take on classic texts, but this is the first time it has collaborated with the British theatre-maker and auteur McBurney, whose company Complicite \u2013 according to this publication \u2013 irrevocably changed the face of British theatre. Set in Europe on the brink of war, the story is of a man whose pity-driven social gaffe \u2013 and subsequent poor choices \u2013 sets a terrible train of events in motion from which he cannot escape. \u201cWith dazzling virtuosity, McBurney and his team evoke a vanished world,\u201d wrote Michael Billington of this \u201castonishing\u201d production when it ran at the Barbican in February 2017. McBurney\u2019s last show to tour Australia was his \u201caural masterpiece\u201d, the Encounter, which used 3D audio to transport audiences deep into the Amazon rainforest. I\u2019m eager to see what this collaboration brings. \u2022 Beware of Pity runs at the Roslyn Packer Theatre, Walsh Bay, from 23-27 January Masters of Modern Sound Recommended by: Kate Hennessy I love a good gallery mash-up of sound, art and ideas. This three-night series is set amid the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s Masters of Modern Art from the Hermitage, which is being marketed as a \u201cblockbuster exhibition\u201d with works by Kandinsky, Picasso and Matisse. Yet it will not be \u201cblockbuster\u201d artists performing because that\u2019s not how these things roll. Instead we\u2019ll have cultish iconoclasts such as the pianist Chris Abrahams (The Necks), the ambient maestro William Basinski (The Disintegration Loops), Lawrence English (Room40), Dean Hurley (Twin Peaks: The Return) and the Italian minimalist Caterina Barbieri. Will English ask us to lie down to sponge up the sound? Everyone was nude at the last gallery dance show I saw, so what transgressions might Force Majeure\u2019s Danielle Micich be plotting? Australian sound artists and musicians Del Lumanta, Corin Ileto, Becky Sui Zhen (No Zu) and Casey Hartnett are presenting newly commissioned work, a netherworld that festival ticket-holders often neglect to properly explore although it often yields the most gold with artists still striving and pushing outwards. How will these women respond to iconic works from dead male artists? \u2022 Masters of Modern Sound takes place at the Art Gallery of NSW from 10-12 January Man with the Iron Neck Recommended by: Emily Nicol After premiering last year at Brisbane festival, the beloved Aboriginal actor and playwright Ursula Yovich\u2019s Man with the Iron Neck has been praised as a moving, poetic and visually stunning work of physical theatre which addresses the youth suicide crisis faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Directors Josh Bond and Gavin Robens mix aerial theatre with video design to explore universal themes of loss, trauma and survival through the experience of three Aboriginal teens in small-town Australia. We enter the search for meaning and hope with Ash, who \u2013 after losing his best friend, Bear, to suicide \u2013 becomes obsessed with 1930s death-defying stuntman The Great Peters who in his act jumped from bridges with a rope around his neck. With an ultimately hopeful narrative, it\u2019s a timely and potent offering which will hopefully open up more discussion about a subject that should be on the national agenda. \u2022 Man with the Iron Neck runs at the Sydney Opera House from 23-26 January; it is also part of the 2019 Adelaide festival in March Home Recommended by: Alexandra Spring At last count I figured I\u2019ve lived in about 25 homes during my life. Only one was newly built, one was freshly renovated, and the rest were existing homes that I tried to put my stamp on. Mostly I didn\u2019t spend too much time wondering about those who\u2019d walked on those floors before me, who\u2019d stared up at the same ceilings during sleepless nights or washed themselves in those showers. But maybe I should have. These are some of the questions that the US theatre-maker Geoff Sobelle \u2013 last in Australia for 2016\u2019s The Object Lesson \u2013 explores in his acclaimed show Home. The theatre/music/dance/magic show asks \u201cWhere is home? If it is not a place, what is home?\u201d On stage a house is constructed in real time, then all the residents move in to live out their lives, often on top of each other and all at the same time. It\u2019s a commentary on overcrowded living, gentrification, migration and our ever-disposable society. And yet according to the critics, these important questions are handled in a light and deft way. The Boston Globe critic Don Aucoin writes, \u201cIndeed, the show turns into an all-out party at the end \u2026 to which the audience is invited.\u201d That sounds like a show I want to see. \u2022 Home runs at the Roslyn Packer Theatre, Walsh Bay, until 18 January Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Mimi Recommended by: Van Badham Local cabaret favourites like La Clique and Velvet have whetted a popular appetite for high-end variety shows. What renders them exquisite is not merely the uniqueness of their acts, be they acrobats, magicians, dancers or songbirds. It\u2019s their immersive theatrical aesthetics that honour the imagined glories of the past: the burlesque bars, circuses, travelling carnivals, speakeasies, music halls and other smoke-and-mirrors spaces in whose shadows common humanity could experience the exotic and thrillingly taboo. In this tradition, Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Mimi promises to \u201cpart the curtains on an enchanted world\u201d. Billing itself as a \u201csumptuous cabaret of delights\u201d, its aesthetic homage is to 1930s Shanghai, \u201ca city famous for its flamboyant clubs and heady nights\u201d. The Australian company Finucane and Smith is an international master of the genre, and the involvement of the brilliant Moira Finucane is reason enough to see a show. She directs this production, which engages \u2013 through cabaret \u2013 the cultural conversation between east and west, and features an international lineup of acts including the Qinghai Acrobatic Troupe and a live band playing \u201clong-lost vintage Chinese jazz and blues unearthed in a condemned Mumbai warehouse\u201d. Also, guests are invited to \u201cdress to the nines and immerse yourself\u201d. Who wouldn\u2019t want to go to this? You\u2019ll see me in my diamant\u00e9s. \u2022 Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Mimi runs at the Riverside Theatre, Parramatta, from 10-20 January Biladurang Recommended by: Steve Dow Joel Bray, a fair-skinned, queer, Wiradjuri dancer, stands in a dressing gown on a bed in a Sydney hotel room performing a preview of his show Biladurang. He tells his boutique audience of about 20, who have also changed into robes, about entering a newsagent at age 15 wearing his school uniform and selecting a magazine with a hot dude on the cover. \u201cMy cock jumped,\u201d he grins, then carefully enunciates each word: \u201cA real \u2026 gay \u2026 porno.\u201d Coming of age in rural Orange, New South Wales, in a white Pentecostal household, and spending summers with his Indigenous father, a land rights activist, Bray embraced his difference. This show\u2019s title, which means platypus, is apposite, as Sydney festival\u2019s director, Wesley Enoch, explains, being a monotreme and a duck-billed, amphibious mammal. \u201cWho knows what a platypus is? This notion of a mix of everything, and what\u2019s your identity in this world?\u201d Moreover, what I\u2019m looking forward to in Bray\u2019s coming show, already seen at Melbourne Fringe and Brisbane festival and soon at the Dance Massive festival in Melbourne, is the sense of shared humanity. Bray waits in the foyer afterward: \u201cI\u2019ve had people hug me, I\u2019ve had people crying, I\u2019ve had people share their stories of discovering their Aboriginality late in life.\u201d \u2022 Biladurang runs at the QT Hotel from 11-20 January Nakhane Recommended by: Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore The South African-born and London-based Nakhane is perhaps most well-known for his starring role in the 2017 movie The Wound. The film took a long hard look at the hyper-masculine Xhosa circumcision ritual, ulwaluko and, controversially, featured three main gay characters (its homosexual scenes prompted protests across South Africa). He is also a musician whose songs \u2013 mixing electronics, vocals, folk and acoustic guitar \u2013 often draw on the heritage of his Christian roots. Openly gay since his 20s, Nakhane\u2019s latest album, You Will Not Die, documents the collision between his sexuality and the religion he has now rejected. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Hutchison pegged him as One to Watch last year, comparing his sound with the \u201cemphatic pop\u201d of Perfume Genius and describing the record as \u201cfearless \u2026 delivered with heart-stopping fragility\u201d. He is also a stellar performer. Do not miss this concert. \u2022 Nakhane plays at the Spiegeltent in Hyde Park on 18 January, before playing at Mona Foma, in Launceston, at the Tivoli, in Brisbane and at Melbourne Museum during Midsumma",

They have lost nine matches in a row, eight of those in the league, and while they have got some way to go before reaching the Premier League record (Sunderland\u2019s 2002-03 run of 15 consecutive losses), they have definitely reached the stage where they are looking for any help they can get. In the run-up to Saturday\u2019s away game at Cardiff, David Wagner said he has no idea whether they will be able to address their biggest problem by signing a striker, so they may have to look to another source for goals. Jason Puncheon has not scored this season but, at the very least, his arrival from Crystal Palace will add a little more dynamism to their attack. At this point, anything is worth a try. <strong>NM</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/10/mauricio-pochettino-should-reject-manchester-united-history-spurs\">Mauricio Pochettino should reject United and make history at Spurs</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>8) Cleverley\u2019s return eases Watford\u2019s window worries</h2> <p>It has been a tough journey to fitness for Tom Cleverley. An achilles problem kept him out of the Watford team for the best part of a year, but after a few substitute appearances he made his first start <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/woking-watford-fa-cup-match-report\">against Woking in the FA Cup</a> last weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long hard year and a long road back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for me.\u201d In some respects, Cleverley\u2019s return could not be better timed, given the continuing uncertainty over Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, who this week offered the world\u2019s politest \u201ccome and get me\u201d plea to PSG. Central midfield is not an area of massive weakness for Watford, who visit Crystal Palace on Saturday, but if Doucour\u00e9 does depart then Cleverley being an option again will at least mean they will not have to rush to find a replacement. <strong>NM</strong></p> <h2>9) Wolves wary of Guardiola\u2019s goal-hungry side</h2> <p>Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have hammered in 16 goals in two matches and, regardless of opposition, those numbers are frightening. Wolves have an impressive record against the top six, appearing to raise their game when the big boys come to Molineux, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/05/wolves-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">beaten Chelsea</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/wolves-liverpool-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/tottenham-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham</a>. But when Manchester City \u2013 who host them on Monday \u2013 are in the mood, especially at the Etihad, they are a different beast. Wolves should arrive with confidence and not total trepidation after upsetting Liverpool in the FA Cup but Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side must again bring their A-game. Wolves, so comfortable without the ball, are solid but flexible in defence \u2013 they have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal \u2013 and given that City will want to dominate possession, they will have to show patience. <strong>BF</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10) Dyche\u2019s side on rise thanks to McNeil\u2019s menace</h2> <p>Is it a coincidence that Burnley\u2019s results have improved since Dwight McNeil broke into their first team? Maybe but the young winger has certainly added more of a spark to Sean Dyche\u2019s side, who have won all three games he has started, two in the league and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/match/2019/jan/05/burnley-v-barnsley\">against Barnsley in the FA Cup</a>. They host second-bottom Fulham on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we put him in for the sake of it, it\u2019s because we think he can deliver performances, which he has done,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cI think we\u2019ve timed our run well with that. It\u2019s not just dropping somebody in, taking them out and you never see them again, it\u2019s been building up slowly but surely.\u201d As well as McNeil\u2019s introduction, Tom Heaton has returned in goal, and praise must go to Dyche: neither decision was hasty but both are paying off nicely so far. <strong>NM</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "1) Stretched Spurs squad could be punished by Pogba Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s impending move to Beijing Guoan is a reminder of Tottenham\u2019s lack of depth in important areas. The Belgian midfielder was once a mandatory pick for Mauricio Pochettino but injuries have caught up with him and he has featured in only 10 league games this season. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s decline has been a blow for Pochettino and Tottenham\u2019s manager has also had to deal with injuries to Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama, forcing him to ask a lot from Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko in the past month. Sissoko and Winks have responded by forming an effective partnership in central midfield, enabling Tottenham to force their way into the title race, but they looked tired against Chelsea on Tuesday. Manchester United, who visit Wembley on Sunday, will spy a weakness to exploit given that Pochettino\u2019s only alternative in recent weeks has been the inexperienced Oliver Skipp. Paul Pogba is probably licking his lips at the thought of stamping his authority all over midfield \u2013 assuming, of course, the United showman\u2019s resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is the real deal. JS 2) Feast-or-famine season frustrates Foxes If you want an idea as to why some Leicester fans are frustrated with their team and Claude Puel, then observe their infuriating inconsistency of late. Their past six games in all competitions have been: defeat on penalties to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup after making a number of changes to the team; victory at Chelsea; victory in the league over Manchester City; defeat at home to Cardiff; victory at Everton; defeat to Newport in the FA Cup. Puel\u2019s decision to make wholesale changes against Newport was more defensible than against City, with their opponents 13th in League Two. But now they are out of both cups and have only that big seventh place to fight for as Puel prepares to take on his former club Southampton on Saturday. That is where they are at the moment but they may not stay there if they continue to be so erratic.

Not in the post-Wenger era, though. \u00d6zil\u2019s importance has dwindled, even though he still has the ability to unlock any defence with an eye-of-the-needle pass. The thinking is the team\u2019s defensive structure is not strong enough to carry brittle individuals and, although Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u2019s foot injury means a creative spot needs filling, Arsenal also have to think about containing Marko Arnautovic and Felipe Anderson in West Ham\u2019s attack. With that in mind, it could be a day for Alex Iwobi or Aaron Ramsey to provide extra thrust in midfield. Iwobi is in good form and Ramsey has knuckled down despite his impending move to Juventus; both will have cause to feel aggrieved if they lose out to \u00d6zil. JS 4) Silva on shaky ground after Moshiri\u2019s comments The dismissal of Gary Rowett by Stoke this week called to mind another manager who is talking a good game but not getting the results to back up his words. Marco Silva is different to Rowett in that he does have trophies to his name, most prominently the Greek title with Olympiakos, but even that is worth putting in context: Olympiakos have been champions 10 times since the Superleague was formed in 2006, so he was not exactly dragging a team to success with his managerial brilliance. Troy Deeney recently rated Silva as the best coach he has worked with but that will not be much use with the words of the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, hanging in the air. \u201cI look at the table and it is just not good enough,\u201d said Moshiri, and while he also said the club will \u201cstick with\u201d Silva, things can change extremely quickly. Everton host Bournemouth on Sunday. NM 5) Ben\u00edtez\u2019s spoiling tactics could scupper Sarri again Having seen how Chelsea were frustrated by Southampton\u2019s organisation in their previous league game, it is unlikely that Newcastle will be adventurous when they visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Rafael Ben\u00edtez often uses a spoiling approach against the big sides and the Spaniard will surely tell his players to sit deep, absorb pressure and try to take advantage of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s issues in attack. Chelsea drew another blank in their midweek defeat by Tottenham, despite dominating territory and possession, and it will not be in Newcastle\u2019s interests to play an open game. Another game of patience will test Sarriball\u2019s foundations. JS 6) Klopp\u2019s defensive quandary for trip to Brighton Liverpool could head to Brighton on Saturday with Virgil van Dijk as their only fit recognised central defender. With Joe Gomez and Jo\u00ebl Matip sidelined and Dejan Lovren not expected to recover from a thigh injury in time, J\u00fcrgen Klopp will likely turn to Fabinho. Chris Hughton\u2019s side are unbeaten in four games and have proved a tough nut to crack at home \u2013 only Tottenham and Chelsea have beaten them there in the league this season. But the assured performance of the 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever in Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup defeat at Molineux on Monday will have given Klopp food for thought, especially when watching him wriggle away from H\u00e9lder Costa and R\u00faben Neves before freeing Mohamed Salah on the counterattack.

In the run-up to Saturday\u2019s away game at Cardiff, David Wagner said he has no idea whether they will be able to address their biggest problem by signing a striker, so they may have to look to another source for goals. Jason Puncheon has not scored this season but, at the very least, his arrival from Crystal Palace will add a little more dynamism to their attack. At this point, anything is worth a try. NM 8) Cleverley\u2019s return eases Watford\u2019s window worries It has been a tough journey to fitness for Tom Cleverley. An achilles problem kept him out of the Watford team for the best part of a year, but after a few substitute appearances he made his first start against Woking in the FA Cup last weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long hard year and a long road back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for me.\u201d In some respects, Cleverley\u2019s return could not be better timed, given the continuing uncertainty over Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, who this week offered the world\u2019s politest \u201ccome and get me\u201d plea to PSG. Central midfield is not an area of massive weakness for Watford, who visit Crystal Palace on Saturday, but if Doucour\u00e9 does depart then Cleverley being an option again will at least mean they will not have to rush to find a replacement. NM 9) Wolves wary of Guardiola\u2019s goal-hungry side Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have hammered in 16 goals in two matches and, regardless of opposition, those numbers are frightening. Wolves have an impressive record against the top six, appearing to raise their game when the big boys come to Molineux, having beaten Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham. But when Manchester City \u2013 who host them on Monday \u2013 are in the mood, especially at the Etihad, they are a different beast. Wolves should arrive with confidence and not total trepidation after upsetting Liverpool in the FA Cup but Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side must again bring their A-game. Wolves, so comfortable without the ball, are solid but flexible in defence \u2013 they have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal \u2013 and given that City will want to dominate possession, they will have to show patience. BF 10) Dyche\u2019s side on rise thanks to McNeil\u2019s menace Is it a coincidence that Burnley\u2019s results have improved since Dwight McNeil broke into their first team? Maybe but the young winger has certainly added more of a spark to Sean Dyche\u2019s side, who have won all three games he has started, two in the league and against Barnsley in the FA Cup. They host second-bottom Fulham on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we put him in for the sake of it, it\u2019s because we think he can deliver performances, which he has done,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cI think we\u2019ve timed our run well with that. It\u2019s not just dropping somebody in, taking them out and you never see them again, it\u2019s been building up slowly but surely.\u201d As well as McNeil\u2019s introduction, Tom Heaton has returned in goal, and praise must go to Dyche: neither decision was hasty but both are paying off nicely so far.

      "bodyText": "State school budgets in England have deteriorated in the last year, according to analysis by a thinktank that says councils could redistribute surpluses to bail out struggling schools in the same region. The Education Policy Institute looked at the accounts submitted by maintained and academy schools for 2017-18 and found that secondary schools were particularly hard hit. According to the EPI, half of all secondary academies and 60% of maintained secondary schools \u2013 those managed by local authorities \u2013 are spending more than they are receiving, forcing them to dip into their reserves. Jules White, head of a secondary school in West Sussex and a founder of the WorthLess? campaign for fairer funding, said: \u201cTime and time again, independent analysts are confirming what every headteacher in the country knows; schools are sliding further and further into debt, regardless of whether they are local authority or academy controlled. \u201cNo doubt the Department for Education will bury its head in the sand again and trot out all of the usual smokescreens regarding efficiencies and surpluses, yet on the ground headteachers continue to cut staffing, their curricular offer and crucial pastoral services in order to make ends meet.\u201d In a worrying sign, the EPI also said the proportion of local authority special schools in deficit has doubled from 5% to 10% since 2014. \u201cThese findings are further evidence of the funding pressures schools and councils are under, including support for children with special needs,\u201d said Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board. But while schools budgets had worsened in the space of a year, the EPI said that many still had strong bank balances, and that overall the value of surpluses exceeded that of the combined deficits. In 2017-18, local authority school deficits totalled \u00a3233m, while the total of surplus balances was \u00a31.8bn, of which \u00a3580m met the DfE\u2019s \u201cexcessive balance\u201d definition. \u201cIn fact, by the Department for Education\u2019s definition, nearly a quarter of a billion pounds is in accounts deemed excessive and uncommitted to any specific expenditure. The challenge for government, local authorities and school leaders is whether that money should now be redistributed,\u201d said Jon Andrews, the report\u2019s author and deputy head of research at the EPI. \u201cIn practice, over half of the \u2018excessive\u2019 balances are already committed by the schools to specific projects, and given the priority which the government attaches to school autonomy, there would likely be serious policy challenges involved in trying to reallocate such surpluses,\u201d the EPI said. The EPI\u2019s suggestion drew a tepid response from school leaders, with Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of Schools and College Leaders, arguing that it was \u201cprudent financial management\u201d for schools to have surpluses. \u201cWhat is clear is that the current trend is one of increasing deficits and unless action is taken to improve the level of funding it is highly likely that educational standards will deteriorate,\u201d said Barton. A DfE spokesperson said that more than 90% of academies and maintained schools had broken even or were in surplus last year. \u201cWhilst the core schools and high needs budget is rising from almost \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to \u00a343.5bn by 2019-20, we do recognise the budgeting challenges schools face. \u201cThat is why the education secretary has set out his determination to work with the sector to help schools reduce the \u00a310bn they spend on non-staffing costs and ensure every pound is spent as effectively as possible to give children a great education,\u201d the DfE said. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the government was refusing to accept that it had caused the funding crisis. \u201cThese cuts have made it impossible for many schools to even make ends meet, and there will be a generation of children paying the price for the Conservatives\u2019 failure,\u201d Rayner said.",
