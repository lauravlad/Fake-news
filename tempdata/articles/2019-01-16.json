She confirmed that the offer of inspections was not enough and that the US was demanding the destruction of the missile system, known as the 9M729. \u201cWe explained to our Russian counterparts specifically what they would need to do in order to return to compliance in a manner that we can confirm, verifiable destruction of the non-compliant system,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cTo see the missile does not confirm the distance that missile can travel, and at the end of the day that\u2019s the violation of the treaty,\u201d Thompson said in a phone briefing for reporters. She said that there were currently no plans for follow-up talks on the INF before the 2 February deadline laid down by the Trump administration, though US and Russian diplomats would be meeting, including at a summit of the Nato-Russian council next week. Thompson said that if Russia did not show willingness to comply with the treaty by the deadline, the US would suspend its own obligations, meaning that the US defense department could start research and development on missiles with ranges currently banned by the INF, from 500 to 5,500km. At the same time, she told reporters, the US would formally give notice of its withdrawal from the treaty, which could come into effect on 2 August. After that, there would be no restrictions on deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe or the Pacific. The Obama administration had complained to Russia about its new missile but had not threatened to leave the treaty. Diplomats said that Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, John Bolton, persuaded him to withdraw, despite opposition from the state and defence departments, and from European allies. After a reported appeal from Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, the administration agreed to a two-month delay, to give a last chance for diplomacy to save the INF. Thompson confirmed that the Russian delegation in Geneva had raised their concerns about US missile defence launchers which Moscow says can be adapted to fire offensive missiles. She said that the US officials had repeated US insistence that the launchers were compliant with the INF, and provided documentary evidence. The Trump administration was criticised by former officials and arms control advocates for not pursuing the Russian offer of inspections. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent years trying to get something \u2013 anything \u2013 out of the Russians on INF. The Russian offer of an exhibition of the 9M729 is not enough, but it is something,\u201d Alexandra Bell, a former senior state department official who is now senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. \u201cPerhaps it is a foundation on which to build. Not trying to take advantage of this opportunity is to leave diplomatic options on the table and that\u2019s just foolish.\u201d Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association said: \u201cIf the INF is terminated on 2 August, there will be nothing to prevent Russia from deploying nuclear missiles that threaten Europe and the Trump administration will have no hesitation in pursuing the deployment of INF-prohibited weapons in Europe.\u201d",

I haven\u2019t seen Pep Guardiola give that. I haven\u2019t seen J\u00fcrgen Klopp give that. Pochettino give that. They do that sort of thing behind closed doors but they don\u2019t do it to the public. It surprised me, definitely. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back at St Mary\u2019s, Derby repeated the trick of the first game, coming from 2-0 behind once more to force extra time and ultimately spot-kicks. Southampton surely thought they had a fourth-round place in the bag after goals from Stuart Armstrong and Redmond, only for the Liverpool loanee, Harry Wilson, to inspire Derby\u2019s comeback, firstly with a goal of his own, then by crossing for Martyn Waghorn to equalise. \u201cI think if you have a 2-0 lead twice over Derby and can\u2019t winthe game,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve to be in the next round.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37338b40c3ec2f8ea5fa1f6daaae598d53c94db7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37338b40c3ec2f8ea5fa1f6daaae598d53c94db7/0_117_4129_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Derby players celebrate after Richard Keogh\u2019s winning penalty put Frank Lampard\u2019s side through.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Derby players celebrate after Richard Keogh\u2019s winning penalty put Frank Lampard\u2019s side through.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The first half was a pretty grim exhibition but, when good bits of football did poke through the mist of mediocrity, they were from Derby. One delicious move involved a Matthias Sammer-esque carry out of defence from Keogh, followed by a couple of flicks and back-heels among the forwards, but its deserved finish did not arrive when Mason Mount skied his shot from the edge of the box. Otherwise it was tedious: pity the poor Bielsa assistant who had to compile a dossier on this one.</p> \n<p>But they sat up straight on 38 minutes, when Derby took the lead. Or, at least they thought they had. Tom Huddlestone slid a fine pass into the box for Waghorn, who laid it off for Craig Bryson to finish neatly. However, VAR was called for and after the sort of forensic, frame-by-frame examination only previously seen by conspiracy theorists watching the Zapruder film, it was determined that the bottom half of Waghorn\u2019s leg was offside. No goal.

      "bodyText": "Marcelo Bielsa might have been able to tell everyone this before the game but penalties were required to separate Southampton and Derby in their third-round FA Cup replay. It was Frank Lampard\u2019s side who held their nerve and go through to face Accrington Stanley in the fourth round after Nathan Redmond was the only man to miss in the shootout, the winning kick struck home by the unlikely figure of Richard Keogh. \u201cReady for my presentation everyone?\u201d said Lampard as he walked into his post-match press conference, making light of Bielsa\u2019s extraordinary 70-minute press conference earlier on Wednesday, in which he revealed he had not only Derby\u2019s training sessions watched but every team they have faced this season. When it was put to him that Bielsa gave the impression he knew more about Derby than their own manager, Lampard said: \u201cWell\u201a he gave an impression of himself. I haven\u2019t seen Pep Guardiola give that. I haven\u2019t seen J\u00fcrgen Klopp give that. Pochettino give that. They do that sort of thing behind closed doors but they don\u2019t do it to the public. It surprised me, definitely. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d Back at St Mary\u2019s, Derby repeated the trick of the first game, coming from 2-0 behind once more to force extra time and ultimately spot-kicks. Southampton surely thought they had a fourth-round place in the bag after goals from Stuart Armstrong and Redmond, only for the Liverpool loanee, Harry Wilson, to inspire Derby\u2019s comeback, firstly with a goal of his own, then by crossing for Martyn Waghorn to equalise. \u201cI think if you have a 2-0 lead twice over Derby and can\u2019t winthe game,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve to be in the next round.\u201d The first half was a pretty grim exhibition but, when good bits of football did poke through the mist of mediocrity, they were from Derby. One delicious move involved a Matthias Sammer-esque carry out of defence from Keogh, followed by a couple of flicks and back-heels among the forwards, but its deserved finish did not arrive when Mason Mount skied his shot from the edge of the box. Otherwise it was tedious: pity the poor Bielsa assistant who had to compile a dossier on this one. But they sat up straight on 38 minutes, when Derby took the lead. Or, at least they thought they had. Tom Huddlestone slid a fine pass into the box for Waghorn, who laid it off for Craig Bryson to finish neatly. However, VAR was called for and after the sort of forensic, frame-by-frame examination only previously seen by conspiracy theorists watching the Zapruder film, it was determined that the bottom half of Waghorn\u2019s leg was offside. No goal. In the stands the Derby fans sang \u201cFuck VAR!\u201dbut afterwards Lampard was more sanguine. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have to get used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind as long as they get the decision right. Was it right? I haven\u2019t looked closely enough but it looked like it was millimetres.\u201d Then, after the boredom of the first period came a glut of goals in the second. Southampton went ahead after 67 minutes when Shane Long\u2019s header was blocked on the line, only for Armstrong to swoop in and nod the loose ball home. Two minutes later it was two. Redmond timed his run through the middle of the Derby defence perfectly and on the very edge of the defensive line collected Jack Stephens\u2019s pass and delicately chipped over the advancing Kelle Roos. Derby were given hope with 15 minutes remaining. Wilson took a free-kick from the right corner of the box, zipped it into the middle at pace and it went past everyone into the net. \u201cI was just about to take him off,\u201d said Lampard, his second thoughts proving crucial a few moments later. Wilson curled over a cross from the right, and Waghorn found space between two defenders to head into the top corner. Extra time was required, meaning the Prime Minister\u2019s statement in Downing Street was relegated to BBC2 as BBC1 continued to show the game. \u201cThey deserve those moments,\u201d said Lampard, of his players. \u201cTheresa May will have many a moment coming up over the next few weeks, I would say.\u201d After a cagey extra 30 minutes came penalties. Redmond was the only player to err, shooting well wide after opening up his body and aiming for the top corner.

For those of you who are not Marcelo Bielsa, here are some basic pointers for the game ahead: Frank Lampard\u2019s team are vying with Southampton for the right to travel to Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup fourth round. This replay doesn\u2019t particularly excite the Saints manager, Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl, who has said that the best thing about it is that it enables Charlie Austin, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Yan Valery to serve their suspensions so as to be available for this weekend\u2019s Premier League match against Everton. Southampton are also missing Michael Obafemi, Ryan Bertrand and Danny Ings through injury, while Maya Yoshida is at the Asian Cup. So Derby, who came back from 2-0 down in the first match, have a fine chance to progress today. But has their manager done his homework?<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m delighted for the team. The work-rate they put in there. Great penalties, great courage. VAR going against us. They were winners anyway going into the penalties but the way they took them showed great character.\u201d \u201cI thought we were outstanding through the game. The fight. The bravery on the ball. I\u2019m really pleased.\u201d What a terrific - and deserved - result for Derby, who came back from two goals down to knock out their Premier League hosts. Keogh converts the decisive penalty to send Derby through. Southampton 2-2 Derby (3-5) Targett scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (3-4) Lawrence sends the keeper the wrong way and scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (2-4) Vestergaard makes no mistake. Southampton 2-2 Derby (2-3) Mount slams it into the net off the underside of the bar. Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-3) Redmond misses, sidefotting high and wide! Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-2) Nugent send the keeper the wrong way and scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-2) Ward-Prowse send the keeper the wrong way and scores. Southampton 2-2 Derby (1-1) Waghorn slams a super penalty high into the net. Southampton 2-2 Derby (0-1) Derby\u2019s Waghorn will take the first penalty. That always looked the most likely outcome after normal time. Now, anyone got Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s number to tip us off as to which way Derby\u2019s player are going to send their spotkicks? 118 min: Derby are at sixes and sevens at the back as Gallagher sprints down the right and delivers a cross. Elyounoussi fails to connect. 116 min: A kerfuffle in the Derby box after a cross from the right. The crowd chant \u201cVAR\u201d in the hope that a foul might be picked up but nothing doing. 114 min: Mount curls the freekick towards Tomori at the back post. Gunn punches it away and then Vestergaard completes the clearance. 113 min: Soares brings down Malone, giving Derby a freekick wide on the left. A prime crossing opportunity. \u201cNo matter how many changes Southampton made, as an Everton fan I\u2019m delighted that this game has gone to extra time less than 72 hours before their trip to St. Mary\u2019s,\u201d rejoices Matt Burt. And I guess they\u2019ll feel even more jaded if, after all this effort, they don\u2019t even win the game. 112 min: Redmond scampers forward again, this time darting down the left. Then he cuts on to his right foot and had a pop from 20 yards. It sails into the stands. 109 min: Romeu wins the ball in midfield and romps forward. Southampton have four v two! Romeu plays in Redmond to his right. Redmond takes a touch and then blasts it straight at the out-rushing Roos. He could have eliminated the goalkeeper by knocking the ball to a teammate to his left, or he could have finished properly but he rushed it and it\u2019s a waste. Southampton substitution: Targett on, Ramsay off. 107 min: Waghorn flips a the ball through to Lawrence, running on to it at speed 25 yards from goal. But he leans back and hoists his shot over the bar. He\u2019s better than that. 106 min: Ramsay appears to be suffering from cramp after making a fine sliding tackle on Nugent wide on the right. Penalties are looking the most likely outcome at this point, although as the teams tire a mistake could make the difference. 105+1 min: Ward-Prowse wafts a harmless freekick over the bar. Waste of time. 105 min: Freekick to Southampton, dead centre and about 30 yards out. Derby erect a wall as Ward-Prowse prepares to takes it. 104 min: Waghorn slips a nice ball through to Nugent in the box. Nugent tries to help it on to the underlapping Holmes but makes a sloppy pass. 102 min: It\u2019s all getting a bit stodgy. Play bogged down in midfield. Derby substitution: Bennett on, Wilson off. 97 min: Elyounoussi provided a lovely finessed cross for Southampton\u2019s second goal but other than that he has been very disappointing. He has just been shrugged off the ball with ridiculous ease by Holmes as the hosts launched a promising counter-attack. 96 min: Derby are looking the stronger team. That weariness detected in the Saints\u2019 ranks towards the end of normal time has resurfaced and they\u2019er being penned back at the moment. 95 min: The corner is cleared as far as Lawrence, who tries to bash it back into the net from 25 yards. Ramsay deflects it wide for another corner. Derby substitution: Holmes on, Bogle off. 94 min: Derby win a corner after a good attack. But before it can be taken they need to make a change because Bogle appears to be injured. 91 min: Off we go again. Hard to know how this is going to pan out because both teams had spells of superiority during normal time. Southampton seemed to be tiring towards the end but then, in stoppage time, perked right back up and could have won it. As in the first match Derby came back from two goals down to draw level. Extra-time to follow ... 90+4 min: Following a lovely one-two in the box, Redmond rolls the ball across the face of goal Derby\u2019s goal. Elyounoussi lunges at it but can\u2019t apply the decisive touch! 90+3 min: Derby stream forward on the counter. Waghorn pings in a cross from the left. Lawrence gets to it ahead of Vestergaard ... but heads over from six yards! 90+2 min: Freekick to Derby after a foul by Ramsay on Lawrence. Mount drifts it in to the box. It\u2019s headed clear. Wilson picks it up and tries to lash it into the net from 20 yards. No dice. 90 min: The sides have at least four minutes to find a winner and avoid extra-time ... 90 min: At the end of a sweeping move, Ramsay clips a cross from the right towards the back post, where Wilson gets in the way of an acrobatic attempt by Elyounoussi. Corner to Southampton. It\u2019s cleared. 88 min: A Derby corner is cleared and Southampton suddenly have a breakaway. But Tomori hares back to make an excellent saving challenge on Soares. 86 min: Derby are looking the more likely winners at the moment. There\u2019s a zippiness to them, while Southampton have grown a little ragged. 84 min: Redmond, ever dangerous since his introduction at half-time, darts into the opposing area before offloading to Elyounoussi, whose shot from 15 yards is badly aimed. They\u2019ve done it again! Derby complete the comeback from two goals down as Wilson curls in a cross from the right and Waghorn heads into the top corner from six yards! Now they can they get a winner? 81 min: Tomori, who\u2019s looked good at the back for Derby, cuts out a pass by Ward-Prowse intended for Gallagher. Derby substitution: Lawrence on, Huddlestone off. Wilson lines up a freekick at the right-hand corner of the Southampton box ... and curls it around the wall and into the far corner of the net! There\u2019s a pause while VAR has a gander but the ref eventually allows the goal. Are Derby about to recover from two goals down again, like they did in the first game? Derby substitution: Nugent on, Marriott off. The former Pompey player is greeted with boos by the home crowd. 74 min: Soares booked for deliberately bumping into Bogle to curtail a break. Southampton substitution: Gallagher on, Long off. No sense keeping the Irishman on now, best get him off and rest that hurt leg. He\u2019s had a decent game and made the second goal. Southampton double their lead before Derby can even stammer a reply to the first goal. And it was so easy: Stephens strode out from the back and threaded a pass through for Redmond to chase. He won the race easily and then finished with style, dinking the ball over the advancing keeper. That\u2019s why they Claude Puel called him the new Thierry Henry. Long scampers into the box and then rolls the ball through to Elyounoussi and charges to the back post to received the clipped cross. The Irishman heads past the keeper ... but Malone clears it off the line ... sonly for Armstrong to convert on the follow-up. VAR has no quibble with that one. 64 min: This time Redmond decides to do it all himself ... and he\u2019s nearly vindicated spectacularly. After a bit of jinking and ducking he unleashes a vicious shot from the left-hand corner of the box. Roos palms it behind for a corner and is relieved to do so. 62 min: Armstrong leads a breakaway attack for Southampton. Long peels off the the left and receives the ball, then tries to cross to one of his three teammates in the box. But he only finds the keeper. 60 min: A dinky turn by Wilson at the edge of the Southampton box, followed by a powerful swirling shot from over 20 yards. Gunn needs to attempts to hold it. 58 min: Tomori runs across to cover Malone and cut out a Southampton break at the expense of a corner. Then Tomori clears Ward-Prowse\u2019s delivery. 56 min: Redmond has seen a lot of the ball since his introduction and continually cuts in with it from the right but so far he has failed to produce a cutting final ball. 54 min: Southampton has perked u in the second period and now Derby are responding in kind. Keogh gets his head to a corner and forces a solid save from Gunn. 51 min: Long and Keogh chase a ball as it heads for the byline. Long gives Keogh a little shove in the back, sending him careering towards the advertising boards. Keogh manages to stop before crashing into them and then smiles as if acknowledging the top-class bantz by his Ireland teammates. 48 min: Mount receives a pass fro Huddlestone in midfield and immediately darts forward, looking for an opening. He finds one and lets fly from 25 yards but his low shot hurtles a couple of yards wide. 46 min: Southampton start as if intent on reaffirming their superiority, which they showed fleetingly at the start of the first half. Armstrong spanks a decent effort over the bar from the edge of the area after a nimble move. Long looks sprightly. Southampton substitution: Redmond on, Johnson off. Long, apparently, has overcome that leg injury that caused him to limp around for the last minutes of the first half. \u201cI thought football suffered a serious wound to its body when that penalty was given after perpetual replays in the World Cup final,\u201d blasts Drew Goldie. \u201cIt just died a little more when the Derby goal was chalked off. His arm is clearly offside, I grant you. But other than that, they\u2019re level. Surely VAR is there for - as with cricket - when the officials have made a palpable error.\u201d The position of his arm is irrelevant, of course. Still, there\u2019s something amusing about Lampard\u2019s side being thwarted by VAR on this day. I do hope the official who made the decision was is sitting in a bush. That was a so-so half in which the best moment was negated by hyper-pernickety use of Var, Bryson\u2019s fine goal chalked out for offside. Multiple replays suggest Waghorn was perhaps an inch offside in the buildup. Or perhaps not. The upshot is we\u2019re still goalless. Southampton\u2019s best chance fell to Long, who shot straight the keeper from six yards and later suffered an injury that may lead to him being replaced at half-time. 44 min: Long is back on and immediately back into the action, racing on to a through-ball. But it\u2019s apparent that he\u2019s still in pain and he offloads the ball quickly and begins hobbling again. 42 min: Long is struggling. The Irishman has suffered an injury. It\u2019s not clear how, as he appeared to feel pain as he prepared to jump for an aerial ball. There was no impact. He limps off. 38 min: Derby think they had taken the lead through a lovely goal and celebrated accordingly. Tramsay\u2019s hurried pass out from the back was intercepted and quickly used against the home side, with a Derby player fizzing a low pass into Waghorn in the middle of the box, via a dummy by Bryson. Waghorn took it under control 12 yards out and then slipped the ball into the path of Bryson, who had continued his run and finishes with a smart low shot into the bottom corner. He\u2019s engulfed by happy Derby players. But the ref asks the VAR to have a look at it. And the goal is ruled out because Waghorn was about an inch offside when he received the ball in the first place! 34 min: Armstrong overhits an attempted pass to Soares, who looks forlorn - if the ball had been good, he would have had a clear run into the box. 33 min: Derby have looked more comfortable in the last 10 minutes or so, playing more of the match in the opposing half as Southampton\u2019s early vim has dipped. After a decent move just now, Marriott forced another save from Gunn, albeit a comfortable one from a low shot from 12 yards. 30 min: A foul on Mount by Romeu gives Derby a freekick midway inside the home half. Wilson curls it into the box but it\u2019s headed clear. 27 min: Lovely, flowing move by Derby! Keogh strode out from the back and slipped a pass to Waghorn, who turned beautifully before helping it on to Wilson, who performed a similar turn and then teed up Mount for a shot from 20 yards. And that\u2019s where the move came a cropper, as Mount ballooned his shot over the bar. 24 min: Tyreke Johnson, a 20-year-old making his first senior start, looks a bright prospect out on the left wing. He\u2019s a strong and clever runner with a nice cross. 22 min: After yet more diligent pressing, Saints win the ball off Derby in midfield and work it wide to Armstrong on the left. Armstrong swings in a sweet cross and Long runs on to it and tries to guide it into the net from six yards .... but his powerful sidefooter is batted away by Roos! Excellent reactions from the keeper, but Long shouldn\u2019t have left him with any chance. 19 min: Ward-Prowse spanks a fine pass wide to the right. Soares collects it, looks up and tries to send a well-aimed cross to his men in the box. Instead he shanks it into the nearest stand. 18 min: The first booking of the match goes to Johnson for another over-zealous tackle, this time on Wilson. 16 min: IT\u2019s been a fairly even match so far. Most of the play is in Derby\u2019s half but the visitors have generally kept Southampton at bay and showed a willingness to counter-attack when possible. Neither side has looked sharp so far, however. 14 min: Bogle dodges an over-enthusiastic challenge by Johnson and darts down the right ... but then made a mess of his cross. 12 min: Now a better corner from Ward-Prowse. Stephens gets on the end of it but heads over from six yards. 10 min: Corner to Southampton after Bryson pokes the ball out of play as Elyounoussi readied a cross. Ward-Prowse delivers an out-swinger, which Derby clears effectively. 8 min: Johnson scurries down the left and sends a decent cross into the area. Again, the striker just fails to get on the end of it, in this case Long. 7 min: Mount tires to pick out Marriott with a nice low pass into the area from mid-way inside the Saints\u2019 half. But the striker, who\u2019d made a canny run, just fails to get on the end of it. 6 min: Ward-Prowse curls a freekick from the right into the Derby box. It\u2019s headed away. 4 min: Saints are playing with the dynamism Hassenh\u00fcttl has introduced, ensuring Derby have next to no time on the ball when in possession. 2 min: Huddlestone loses possession just outside his own areas as Saints\u2019 press causes bother to Derby. But they regroup and get a counter going through Mount, who helps the ball on to Wilson. He glides in from the left and feeds Waghorn, who has a bang from 20 yards. Gunn saves his low drive easily. 1 min: Off we go. The teams have arrived on the pitch. There\u2019s a fir-sized crowd at St Mary\u2019s. Derby are wearing a grey number with yellow trim, while Saints sport their familiar red and white stripe (if looking from the front, at least), albeit with a silly red drape across the shoulder. First up, he\u2019s asked whether he has any comment to make in response to Bielsa\u2019s press conference earlier today. \u201c\u201cNo. I made quite a few comments earlier in the week. I haven\u2019t seen the latest press conference. I\u2019ve been told about in general terms so maybe it\u2019s one the comment on later when I know more.\u201d Moving on to this tie, he says: \u201cI love the competition,so do the players. It\u2019s important for us. And we\u2019re searching for form. We want to win.\u201d Southampton have made five changes to the side that started their win over Leicester last weekend. Lampard, meanwhile, has confirmed what Harry Wilson\u2019s arm movements had already indicated - he has made six alterations to the team schooled at Elland Road on Friday.Harry Wilson\u2019s arm gestures made that Southampton: Gunn; Soares, Stephens, Vestergaard, Ramsay; Romeu, Ward-Prowse; Elyounoussi, Armstrong, Johnson; Long Subs: McCarthy, Bednarek, Targett, Slattery, Barnes, Redmond, Gallagher Derby: Roos; Bogle, Keogh, Tomori, Malone; Bryson, Mount, Hudlestone; Waghorn, Marriott, Wilson Subs: Carson, Lawrence Evans, Bennett, Holmes, Lowe, Nugent Hello. For those of you who are not Marcelo Bielsa, here are some basic pointers for the game ahead: Frank Lampard\u2019s team are vying with Southampton for the right to travel to Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup fourth round. This replay doesn\u2019t particularly excite the Saints manager, Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl, who has said that the best thing about it is that it enables Charlie Austin, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Yan Valery to serve their suspensions so as to be available for this weekend\u2019s Premier League match against Everton. Southampton are also missing Michael Obafemi, Ryan Bertrand and Danny Ings through injury, while Maya Yoshida is at the Asian Cup. So Derby, who came back from 2-0 down in the first match, have a fine chance to progress today. But has their manager done his homework?",

      "body": "<p>Six years after his death, we get Revolution in Ruins: The Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Story (BBC Two), a dense and deeply depressing precis of his 14-year rule of Venezuela: a country with the largest proven oil reserves on the planet where 90% of the population live in poverty. Why this, now? Probably because of the rise in populism and the cult of personality in politics, which collide with such magnetic force in the polarising figure of Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>Of course there\u2019s a world of difference between the populism of the left and the right, which is what we\u2019re seeing in Brazil, Hungary, the US and the endless chaos of Brexit.

Inflation is said to be more than 1,000,000%. People are starving to death. Childhood friend Rafael Simon Jimenez says of the president\u2019s death from cancer at the age of 58, \u201c[it] spared him from dealing with the disaster that began under his rule\u201d.</p> <p>But I\u2019m fast-forwarding to the end. This balanced explainer begins with the longstanding inequities in a country of 30 million people, many of whom have never benefited from Venezuela\u2019s unparalleled oil reserves. Ch\u00e1vez was one of them: the son of teachers raised in the impoverished southwestern plains. His childhood nickname was Goofy on account of being skinny with big feet. (Those who later tuned into the president\u2019s singing and dancing TV show, described by a former adviser as \u201ca variety show happening all day, every day\u201d, might have assumed it was for different reasons.)

Before going to prison, Ch\u00e1vez asked to address the country live on TV. \u201cWe have not met our objectives \u2026 for now,\u201d he announced. It was those last two bristling words \u2013 \u201c<em>por ahora</em>\u201d in Venezuelan Spanish \u2013 that seized the imagination of an entire country. In that moment Ch\u00e1vez, the charismatic <em>comandante</em>, socialist revolutionary and media superstar, was born.</p> <p>The other Ch\u00e1vez, the one drunk on power who persecuted his opponents and by 2009 was announcing his intention (live on TV, naturally) \u201cto stand for re-election, indefinitely\u201d, comes later. First we get the shock 56% win four years out of prison, the defiant world tour which, one commentator recalls, \u201cfelt like an ABC of US enemies\u201d, and the governing by reality TV. How often is a head of state\u2019s makeup artist one of the main talking heads on a political documentary?</p> <p>\u201cHe was funny and you hung on everything he said,\u201d recalls Eva Golinger, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s foreign policy adviser from 2004-13. Later, she tells a chilling story. Interviewing him in private, Golinger asked Ch\u00e1vez a question that \u201cset him off\u201d. Ch\u00e1vez turned off the tape. \u201cHe said: \u2018My neck is sore. Do you give massages?\u2019 I thought, my time here is up.\u201d</p> <p>His charisma and sheer audacity could be electrifying. When referring to President George W Bush in a UN address, Ch\u00e1vez said: \u201cYesterday the devil came here and it still smells of sulphur.\u201d Socialists call this Latin America\u2019s golden decade, when Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina all elected leftwing populist presidents.</p> <p>But \u201cthe dark side of Ch\u00e1vez\u201d, as Margarita Lopez Maya of the Central University of Venezuela calls it, was there in his ruthless pursuit of enemies, addiction to power and capacity to spend trillions of dollars in oil revenues without helping the poor he vowed to champion. Ch\u00e1vez spent more on his final election campaign, when the country knew he was dying and elected him anyway, than either Obama or Trump.</p> <p>This may be a documentary about a man leading a specific revolution, but it\u2019s also, unfortunately, a story as old as civilisation: how power corrupts men, idealism gets warped, and the cult of personality ends up a one-way track to megalomania. And yet we seem incapable of changing the script. Told you. Deeply depressing. So yes, this may be the last documentary you can face watching right now. But that probably means you should watch it. </p>",

First we get the shock 56% win four years out of prison, the defiant world tour which, one commentator recalls, \u201cfelt like an ABC of US enemies\u201d, and the governing by reality TV. How often is a head of state\u2019s makeup artist one of the main talking heads on a political documentary? \u201cHe was funny and you hung on everything he said,\u201d recalls Eva Golinger, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s foreign policy adviser from 2004-13. Later, she tells a chilling story. Interviewing him in private, Golinger asked Ch\u00e1vez a question that \u201cset him off\u201d. Ch\u00e1vez turned off the tape. \u201cHe said: \u2018My neck is sore. Do you give massages?\u2019 I thought, my time here is up.\u201d His charisma and sheer audacity could be electrifying. When referring to President George W Bush in a UN address, Ch\u00e1vez said: \u201cYesterday the devil came here and it still smells of sulphur.\u201d Socialists call this Latin America\u2019s golden decade, when Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina all elected leftwing populist presidents. But \u201cthe dark side of Ch\u00e1vez\u201d, as Margarita Lopez Maya of the Central University of Venezuela calls it, was there in his ruthless pursuit of enemies, addiction to power and capacity to spend trillions of dollars in oil revenues without helping the poor he vowed to champion. Ch\u00e1vez spent more on his final election campaign, when the country knew he was dying and elected him anyway, than either Obama or Trump. This may be a documentary about a man leading a specific revolution, but it\u2019s also, unfortunately, a story as old as civilisation: how power corrupts men, idealism gets warped, and the cult of personality ends up a one-way track to megalomania. And yet we seem incapable of changing the script. Told you. Deeply depressing. So yes, this may be the last documentary you can face watching right now. But that probably means you should watch it.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not hold talks with Theresa May until the prime minister agrees to remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit, ruling out any meeting with the prime minister in the immediate aftermath of the no-confidence vote. Responding to May\u2019s offer of swift talks to break the Brexit impasse, the Labour leader told MPs that before he would entertain \u201cpositive discussions about the way forward\u201d she had to agree to his precondition. \u201cThe government must remove clearly once and for all the catastrophe of a no-deal exit from the European Union and all the chaos that would result from that,\u201d Corbyn said minutes after the opposition party was defeated in the confidence vote. Minutes after the exchanges in the Commons, with Downing Street refusing to take no deal off the table, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said that as things stood, the Labour leader would not take up May\u2019s offer of an evening Brexit meeting. The two sides were still in discussions, but in light of such a fundamental difference, appeared unlikely to come to an agreement to speak in the immediate future \u2013 even though only 10 weeks remain until the UK\u2019s planned departure date. When asked directly if Corbyn was going to No10, the spokesman added: \u201cAs I understand it that is not going to take place.\u201d Labour is willing to support a Brexit deal if May will accept a customs union, a close relationship with the single market and enhanced protections for workers and consumers rights. However, this would represent a massive shift for the prime minister and risk splits in her own party, making it hard to see how a deal could be agreed. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman acknowledged this, saying, \u201cAny change in the government red lines will cause them internal splits.\u201d With the Brexit impasse no closer to being resolved, Corbyn is also under growing pressure from second referendum campaigners to embrace a fresh vote as a way forward. Earlier on Wednesday, half a dozen Labour MPs came out in support of a second referendum for the first time at a Westminster photocall, arguing that it was the \u201cthe only logical option\u201d if the party could not secure a general election.

      "bodyText": "Moving more might help to keep people\u2019s brains sharp as they age \u2013 even in the face of dementia, researchers have said. Scientists have found older adults fared better when it came to cognitive tasks if they clocked up higher levels of daily activity on a wrist-based tracker \u2013 something the researchers said picked up everything from exercising to mundane tasks like chopping onions. What\u2019s more, the benefits of movement remained even when the team took into account the level of tell-tale signs of Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementia-related diseases in the brain. Co-author of the Rush University study, Dr Aron Buchman, said the results showed that \u201ceven though we don\u2019t have a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology, and we know people are accumulating it, you can mitigate the deleterious effects \u2026 by having more activity.\u201d But it\u2019s not only moving more which is linked to better scores for traits like thinking, comprehension and and memory: the team found better motor abilities, as measured through tasks like the strength in gripping items or speed of turning on the spot, also seemed to offer protection when it comes to cognitive prowess. The team say previous work has shown that moving more is linked to a lower risk of dementia, and slows the decline in thinking and memory skills in older adults as they age \u2013 but the latest research goes further. Writing in the journal Neurology, the authors report how they came to their conclusions after studying 454 individuals, 191 of whom had dementia, as they progressed through older age to death \u2013 which on average occurred around the age of 91. The researchers looked at participants\u2019 data collected, on average, two years before they died \u2013 including their prowess in a series of 21 cognitive tests, as well as seven days of activity data and motor skill assessment. The results show those without dementia clocked up higher levels of activity, on average, than those with the condition. After taking into account factors such as age, sex and education, the team found that both the motor abilities of participants and their level of physical activity were separately linked to thinking and memory abilities, meaning they had a stronger impact together than either alone. When the team looked at the brains of the participants after they died, they found those with more of the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease had scored worse on the thinking and memory tests. But among those with the same extent of the disease, participants with better motor abilities or more physical activity had fared better cognitively. The beneficial link held even when other dementia-related diseases of the brain linked to cognition were considered, including the presence of proteins called Lewy bodies. However, there was no sign that activity or motor skills were changing the impact of the disease itself on thinking or memory abilities. The team say more work is now needed to unpick how and why physical activity and motor skills might offer a protective effect on cognition, contributing to so-called resilience or \u201ccognitive reserve\u201d. \u201cThe concept of resilience is an empowering concept,\u201d said Buchman, indicating it offered individuals the chance to make changes to mitigate problems. A limitation of the study was that it only looked at data relating to participants\u2019 activity levels and motor skills at one point in time, and did not take into account how active participants had been earlier in their life. It is also not clear whether particular activity types, or their durations, would offer greater benefits than others or whether worse cognition might also lead people to move less. Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, welcomed the study. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about this research is that it suggests physical activity might not slow down dementia-related changes in the brain, but could help the brain cope with these changes,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has ruled out any movement on customs union membership after Brexit-supporting Conservatives told Theresa May that a change of course to gain support for her deal would risk a serious party split, and possible breakaway. The government set out its position on Wednesday night before the prime minister began Brexit talks with party leaders. May responded to the historic defeat of her Brexit bill on Tuesday by pledging to speak to \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d to identify a deal that could secure a majority vote. However, after one leave-supporting backbencher said that if she made any concessions on the customs union \u201cthere\u2019s a real risk to the party staying together\u201d, No 10 stressed its commitment to the principle of an \u201cindependent trade deal\u201d, which May does not believe is compatible with a customs union. Those who support a permanent customs union include the Labour frontbench under Jeremy Corbyn and Tory backers of a Norway-style deal. It is unlikely talks with either group will get off the ground if May maintains her red lines, although Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats have insisted May must keep all options on the table before talks can begin. Corbyn has said he will not speak to May until she rules out a no-deal Brexit. Privately, some ministers and MPs believe the prime minister can only achieve some form of cross-party consensus by pledging permanent customs union membership. \u201cThere is no other way,\u201d one frontbencher said. \u201cAt some point, that penny will drop.\u201d No 10 has not yet spelled out how May intends to identify the kind of deal that would have a chance of winning over enough of the 128 Conservative and Democratic Unionist MPs who voted against her on Tuesday night. The prime minister is expected to approach senior members of the European Research Group, the hard Brexit group chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg which includes Steve Baker and Iain Duncan Smith. MPs in the hard Brexit faction suggested the deal could still be salvaged by agreeing on a hard end-date for the Irish border backstop. Several Eurosceptic rebels warned the prime minister against any efforts to pursue a softer Brexit. Simon Clarke, the MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, a marginal leave seat, said he feared a split if an eventual May deal was carried by Labour votes. \u201cThe PM is within her rights to try to find a sensible way forward, but there must be red lines,\u201d he said. \u201cWere we to adopt the terrible Labour idea of being non-voting members of the customs union, for example, I fear there\u2019s a real risk to the party staying together.\u201d Ben Bradley, who resigned his post as Tory vice-chair to vote against the deal, said May could still win if she pivoted towards the Brexiters. \u201cOnly one single thing needs to change,\u201d he said. \u201cAn alternative to, or exit mechanism from, the backstop would in my view get a majority in the Commons, and the longer-term discussion about customs unions or free trade agreements then becomes a matter for future negotiations. \u201cThe DUP have consistently said that\u2019s what they need, and I think most Brexiteer colleagues would support [that] along with leave-minded Labour MPs. The alternative \u2013 reaching out to Corbyn on a customs union deal \u2013 would split the government benches in half and make an election far more likely.\u201d May is expected to extend her invitation for talks to Labour and other opposition backbenchers, as well as Tory Eurosceptics. One cabinet source expressed pessimism that trying to achieve a softer Brexit would be effective. \u201cGetting a customs union would be extremely difficult. It would only work if the calculation was that Labour votes were absolutely the only way of preventing no deal,\u201d he said. The justice secretary, David Gauke, said the government needed to show some flexibility but there were disadvantages to remaining in a customs union. Gauke told the BBC: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can today be boxing ourselves in. What we need to be doing is engaging across parliament, seeing what ideas emerge, where the support is for those particular ideas, and at that point we need to make an assessment: is this something negotiable with the European Union and something with majority support in the House of Commons? \u201cI think the right answer would be to leave the customs union, but given where we are we have to be open to proposals that are put forward and make an assessment on the way forward.\u201d Gauke did not rule out holding talks with Corbyn but suggested they would be futile. \u201cI think there may be others who might be easier to work with.\u201d May said in the Commons that the exercise of reaching out was about \u201cwanting to understand the views of parliamentarians so that we can identify what could command the support of this House\u201d. She said engagement had to align with what she defined as respecting the vote to leave, citing \u201cending free movement, a fairer deal for farmers and fishermen, opening up new opportunities to trade with the rest of the world and keeping good ties with our neighbours in Europe\u201d. Ken Clarke, the pro-remain Tory MP, urged May to consider a customs union. \u201cI have had to accept the majority in the House is committed to the UK leaving the European Union. She must also accept that she must now modify her red lines that she set for herself at Lancaster House and find a cross-party majority which will be along the lines I have indicated,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The wickets tumbled on the second day of warm-up cricket at the Three Ws Oval and never more so than on the stroke of tea, when Stuart Broad offered a reminder of his penchant for a burst by claiming his third hat-trick in the whites of England. Broad was returning for his second spell of the day against the President\u2019s XI when, with thoughts turning to refreshments in 30-degree heat, he exploited the capricious pitch to remove tail-enders Alzarri Joseph and Miguel Cummins lbw in the space of two balls. After an over of Moeen Ali, Broad stood at the end of his run and, with a wry smile, started a slow handclap to rev up the sparse crowd. While this was not entirely forthcoming, Broad still steamed in, teasing an edge from the No 10, Bryan Charles, that Ben Stokes snaffled low at second slip. This intervention, which became four in five balls after the interval when the Test-capped Jermaine Blackwood slashed to slip in his second knock of the day, does not go on Broad\u2019s first-class record due to the nature of the two-day training game, and clearly won\u2019t rival his Test hat-tricks against India in 2011 and Sri Lanka in 2014. It was nevertheless the highlight of a day when England\u2019s bowlers reduced their hosts to a farcical 203 for 19 (nineteen) by the close, with Jimmy Anderson looking grooved after figures of four for 12 from 14 overs. The only black cloud came with the news that Olly Stone, the uncapped fast bowler, is now ruled out of the tour following the detection of a stress injury to his lower back. \u201cMaybe 16 January is my lucky day \u2013 it was three years ago I took six-fer at The Wanderers [against South Africa]. It\u2019s just a shame this wasn\u2019t a Test match,\u201d said Broad, who finished with four for 19 from 10 overs. \u201cI would love three Test hat-tricks, so maybe this was just good practice.\u201d On Stone, a replacement for whom is yet to be announced, Broad added: \u201cIt\u2019s hugely disappointing. He felt sharp pain in his lower back the other day and that\u2019s a sign of a bone reaction. He\u2019s a fine bowler and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see him in an England shirt soon.\u201d These are interesting times for Broad, who sought advice from Sir Richard Hadlee at the end of the English summer. He received a detailed two-page reply from the New Zealand and Nottinghamshire great and has shortened his run-up, both for greater efficiency and to extract more bounce by standing taller at the crease. This follows previous work on his wrist position after last winter\u2019s Ashes defeat but it remains to be seen whether he shares the new ball with Anderson or Sam Curran in next week\u2019s first Test at the Kensington Oval. The Dukes ball used in the Caribbean has more lacquer than its English cousin and can potentially swing for longer. But England may still want their best exponents used up front given cloud cover is fleeting. The 20-year-old Curran met the brief in the morning, sharing four for 13 with Anderson in the first eight overs as the hosts endured a horror start. While Anderson got one over John Campbell thanks to a loose drive (the recent Test call-up was later run out from the long-on boundary by the sub Joe Denly), Curran followed his dismissal of the wild Blackwood with a beauty that angled across Sun Ambris and feathered his outside edge. It was injury to Curran that brought Jonny Bairstow back into the side in Sri Lanka and, with the Yorkshireman cementing his place with a fine century, and Jos Buttler due to return, England may well stick with the five-bowler policy come the first Test. Stokes, who sent down seven overs here, would be the fourth seamer ahead of Chris Woakes and, unless the pitch looks conducive to turn, Jack Leach may miss out. It would make Moeen, who took two for 33 from 14, the only frontline spinner, with Joe Root, who took three himself during some late chaos, as support.",

It must refocus the debate on what unites both tribes, such as living standards, jobs, the NHS, taxing the rich and public ownership. That means advocating a compromise. A majority does exist in parliament for a customs union. And although many within the Labour leadership regard it as unsatisfactory, so-called Norway plus, combining the single market and a customs union, has a good chance of winning support across the parliamentary divide. The EU has made it clear that a shift in Britain\u2019s red lines will open up new opportunities. That will refocus the debate on bitter Tory divisions, too. Labour will be shouted down by a vocal lobby if it fails to back a second referendum. But, for now, the party must surely direct its efforts at constructing a new deal. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

This scenario would require some kind of alignment with the EU single market regulation to avoid a hard Northern Irish border. But crucially was this what the electorate voted for in the original referendum? Politically it would be extremely messy. </p> <p>\u201cOther routes forward are being priced as lower probabilities now. There is very little chance of the UK parliament committing hari-kari and deciding that No Deal Brexit is the way to solve the current impasse. This would be economic suicide and result in a severe contraction in economic activity and a guaranteed recession. It is hard to see that this route will come to pass as there is no parliamentary majority for a No Deal cliff edge exit from the EU. Parliament will take control of the process should May fail to deliver any improved deal option and block this route by extending Article 50. So a No Deal Brexit has now morphed into a never ending Brexit.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe only other option available is return to the electorate in some kind of Peoples Vote aka a second referendum. The probability of this is difficult to measure as many MPs publicly don\u2019t support it. A Remain win on a second referendum would open fresh Brexit wounds (would Brexiteers demand a best of three?!) but the impact to certain financial markets would be instantaneously positive with sterling jumping. UK equities with international earnings wouldn\u2019t necessarily jump on the news but domestic earners would fly.\u201d<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3f6341e4b00173154a570d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T17:11:03.192Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>London\u2019s stock market has closed for the day, leaving the FTSE 100 index of top shares in the red.</p> <p>The Footsie lost 32 points, or almost 0.5%, to end the day at 6,862 points.</p> <p>Domestic stocks such as house builders had a good day - another sign that no-deal Brexit fears have eased (for the moment, at least.)</p> <p>Internationally focused firms had it tougher, though, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stubborn losses in its commodity sector \u2013 with the likes of BP, Shell and Rio Tinto all feeling edgy about the state of the Chinese economy \u2013 meant that the FTSE 100 was stuck in the red. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling spent the day acting as if it didn\u2019t have a care in the world, posting a leisurely 0.3% increase against both the dollar and the euro.

However, it is still not clear whether it would be approved in a second vote, thus opening the door to other scenarios.</li> <li><strong>General election</strong> <br>Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn had been itching to trigger a no confidence vote in Parliament and force an early election and did so following the vote yesterday. Currently, Labour and Conservatives are neck-and-neck in the polls, so it is far from clear who would form the new government in this scenario. We see this as unlikely as, despite their differences on Brexit, DUP and tory rebels are still likely to support PM May, preventing the no confident vote from passing.</li> <li><strong>Second referendum</strong><br>Many politicians from both sides of the debate have been calling for a second referendum. However, many unknowns remain. The most important one being what question will be submitted to the electorate. It is very unlikely to be a repeat of the 2016 referendum where voters were asked whether they wanted to leave or stay in the EU. The next choice would rather be between types of Brexit relationships; some have even proposed a multiple choice referendum where voters rank by preference. The likelihood of this scenario has risen sharply in recent weeks. </li> <li><strong>Norwegian-style Brexit</strong> <br>This has often been floated as the UK government\u2019s plan B in case of a rejection of the deal. This would involve the UK joining the EFTA/EEA to offer the UK time to renegotiate the Brexit deal while being out of the EU but keeping very close ties to EU. However, this would still have to introduce border checks as the EFTA countries are not part of the customs union, leaving the question of the Irish border unresolved. Moreover, many members of the EFTA/EEA have expressed opposition to the UK joining their club on a temporary basis. This scenario is still possible but we think a second referendum is much more likely given the change in political rhetoric.</li> <li><strong>No deal Brexit</strong> <br>The UK leaves the EU without any agreement with the EU or any ties to the zone and becomes a third-party country, meaning the end of the free movement of goods, services and persons and the reinstating of custom checks with the EU. Interestingly, the likelihood of this scenario has fallen sharply, especially given the European Court of Justice\u2019s judgement that UK can unilaterally withdraw Article 50</li> <li><strong>Brexit is cancelled</strong><br>In its recent ruling, the European Court of Justice said that the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether. We believe this is very unlikely to happen as the political cost of ignoring the 2016 Brexit vote would be huge for all the stakeholders involved.</li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c3f2eeae4b0649df24d2add\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-16T13:23:16.630Z\">1.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has compiled a neat chart, showing how economic and political crises are bad for sterling.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46f921dceaddabe9ce589886fe83fe3bb9bb4e5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46f921dceaddabe9ce589886fe83fe3bb9bb4e5a/0_0_481_308/481.jpg\" alt=\"Chart showing economic uncertainty vs the value of sterling\" width=\"481\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chart showing economic uncertainty vs the value of sterling</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Professor Costas Milas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the Governor is right to point out that we should not make much of the very short-run movements in the exchange rate.

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our news story about Mark Carney\u2019s testimony to parliament. Goodnight! GW Sterling is resolutely refusing to rally tonight, despite Theresa May winning her no-confidence vote (as expected). The pound is hovering around $1.2877, little changed against the US dollar on the day. It\u2019s a little higher against the euro, at \u20ac1.13. Investors are weighing up the situation, with plenty of chatter that a soft Brexit is more likely. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, suggests Theresa May could rub out some of her \u2018red lines\u2019 to get a deal through: A revised and watered-down deal getting through is probably the most likely scenario at the current time and a much softer Brexit seems to be the current expectation in markets. This scenario would require some kind of alignment with the EU single market regulation to avoid a hard Northern Irish border. But crucially was this what the electorate voted for in the original referendum? Politically it would be extremely messy. \u201cOther routes forward are being priced as lower probabilities now. There is very little chance of the UK parliament committing hari-kari and deciding that No Deal Brexit is the way to solve the current impasse. This would be economic suicide and result in a severe contraction in economic activity and a guaranteed recession. It is hard to see that this route will come to pass as there is no parliamentary majority for a No Deal cliff edge exit from the EU. Parliament will take control of the process should May fail to deliver any improved deal option and block this route by extending Article 50. So a No Deal Brexit has now morphed into a never ending Brexit. \u201cThe only other option available is return to the electorate in some kind of Peoples Vote aka a second referendum. The probability of this is difficult to measure as many MPs publicly don\u2019t support it. A Remain win on a second referendum would open fresh Brexit wounds (would Brexiteers demand a best of three?!) but the impact to certain financial markets would be instantaneously positive with sterling jumping. UK equities with international earnings wouldn\u2019t necessarily jump on the news but domestic earners would fly.\u201d London\u2019s stock market has closed for the day, leaving the FTSE 100 index of top shares in the red. The Footsie lost 32 points, or almost 0.5%, to end the day at 6,862 points. Domestic stocks such as house builders had a good day - another sign that no-deal Brexit fears have eased (for the moment, at least.) Internationally focused firms had it tougher, though, as Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Stubborn losses in its commodity sector \u2013 with the likes of BP, Shell and Rio Tinto all feeling edgy about the state of the Chinese economy \u2013 meant that the FTSE 100 was stuck in the red. Sterling spent the day acting as if it didn\u2019t have a care in the world, posting a leisurely 0.3% increase against both the dollar and the euro. The currency is in for another rough night, however, as investors prepare for the no-confidence vote in Theresa May and, dun dun dun, whatever fresh Brexit hell its aftermath brings. Kerim Derhalli, CEO of Invstr, fears investors are being too complacent about the Brexit risks: \u201cThe markets have been remarkably calm overnight after yesterday\u2019s historic government defeat. The rally in the pound from the 1.2670 low yesterday implies that the scale of the defeat makes a no Brexit outcome more likely. This has been the Prime Minister\u2019s argument but seems naively optimistic. \u201cWithout a re-negotiated deal, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is the next most likely outcome. This would imply far greater political and economic uncertainty. The pound would fall towards $1.10 and lower. \u201cNo Brexit, which the market is hoping for, could only be achieved by a second referendum or a general election. The only certainty in either of those scenarios is civil disorder in the UK similar to the gilets jaunes movement in France. A Labour government would create a greater market shock than a no-deal Brexit. Goldman Sachs\u2019 European economist Adrian Paul has added his weight to the growing City chorus predicting that Britain will remain in the EU beyond March. In a research note published today, Paul says: \u201cWe still expect a slim majority of MPs to ultimately consent to a close variant of the current Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d But the size of May\u2019s historic Brexit vote defeat does \u201cskew the risks to that base case further in the direction of a softer, later Brexit \u2014 or no Brexit at all,\u201d Paul added. He also reckons that No Deal is looking less likely - while an extension to Brexit Day is more probable..... We think the prospect of a disorderly \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit has faded further. That sharper skew implies a greater probability of an extension to the 29 March Brexit deadline embedded in Article 50. Over in the US, Bank of America has defied recent market turmoil by beating forecasts. The Wall Street giant posted earnings of 73 cents per share, compared to 63 cents expected. At $22.7bn, revenues beat forecasts of $22.4bn - even though its bond-trading division saw revenues fall 15% Significantly, CEO Brian Moynihan struck a reassuring tone about the state of the US economy, saying: \u201cThrough the trillions of dollars of consumer transactions we process and from the steady confidence and activity of our small business and commercial clients, we see a healthy consumer and business climate driving a solid economy.\u201d Rival bank Goldman Sachs has also just smashed forecasts, with profits of $6.04 per share in profit for the fourth quarter of 2018, versus the $4.45 per share expected. This has helped Wall Street open higher today, as investors take a break from worrying about economic slowdown (which wouldn\u2019t make Brexit any easier...). Over in Westminster, MPs are getting their teeth into the No Confidence motion that could bring down Theresa May. We\u2019re live-blogging it here. Sterling, though, is remarkably calm..... basically unchanged against the US dollar today after yesterday\u2019s late-night recovery. And that\u2019s because May is widely expected to survive. Many of her own MPs hate her Brexit bill, but they don\u2019t love the idea of Labour winning a snap election either. Neither does Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP, whose support should see the PM survive.... Charles St Arnaud, senior investment strategist at City firm Lombard Odier Investment Managers, has reckons a Brexit delay is now \u2018unavoidable\u2019 (providing further support to Mark Carney\u2019s point this morning) But there are six possible scenarios, he suggests: Second vote (Almost certain to happen) Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to meet with the UK\u2019s European counterparts to try to secure concessions on the Irish backstop and other parts of her deal to make it more palatable to a majority of MPs, before resubmitting it to Parliament. However, it is still not clear whether it would be approved in a second vote, thus opening the door to other scenarios. General election Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn had been itching to trigger a no confidence vote in Parliament and force an early election and did so following the vote yesterday. Currently, Labour and Conservatives are neck-and-neck in the polls, so it is far from clear who would form the new government in this scenario. We see this as unlikely as, despite their differences on Brexit, DUP and tory rebels are still likely to support PM May, preventing the no confident vote from passing. Second referendum Many politicians from both sides of the debate have been calling for a second referendum. However, many unknowns remain. The most important one being what question will be submitted to the electorate. It is very unlikely to be a repeat of the 2016 referendum where voters were asked whether they wanted to leave or stay in the EU. The next choice would rather be between types of Brexit relationships; some have even proposed a multiple choice referendum where voters rank by preference. The likelihood of this scenario has risen sharply in recent weeks. Norwegian-style Brexit This has often been floated as the UK government\u2019s plan B in case of a rejection of the deal. This would involve the UK joining the EFTA/EEA to offer the UK time to renegotiate the Brexit deal while being out of the EU but keeping very close ties to EU. However, this would still have to introduce border checks as the EFTA countries are not part of the customs union, leaving the question of the Irish border unresolved. Moreover, many members of the EFTA/EEA have expressed opposition to the UK joining their club on a temporary basis. This scenario is still possible but we think a second referendum is much more likely given the change in political rhetoric. No deal Brexit The UK leaves the EU without any agreement with the EU or any ties to the zone and becomes a third-party country, meaning the end of the free movement of goods, services and persons and the reinstating of custom checks with the EU. Interestingly, the likelihood of this scenario has fallen sharply, especially given the European Court of Justice\u2019s judgement that UK can unilaterally withdraw Article 50 Brexit is cancelled In its recent ruling, the European Court of Justice said that the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether. We believe this is very unlikely to happen as the political cost of ignoring the 2016 Brexit vote would be huge for all the stakeholders involved. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has compiled a neat chart, showing how economic and political crises are bad for sterling. He explains: I think the Governor is right to point out that we should not make much of the very short-run movements in the exchange rate. The exchange rate will only strengthen if Brexit uncertainty recedes. The best way to see this is by plotting together economic policy uncertainty in the UK ( based on newspaper articles regarding policy uncertainty from The Times and The Financial Times; available here) and the \u00a3 effective exchange rate from the BoE database. To avoid the distraction of very short-term fluctuations, I plot together the two series in terms of 1-year rolling average growth rates. There is a very strong negative correlation: Rising policy uncertainty harms sterling growth. Notice that policy uncertainty has moved down notably since early 2017 when we finally triggered Article 50. This provided a lift to the exchange rate on the ground that Ms May engaged seriously with our EU partners in Brexit discussions. Will the exchange rate lift further if we extend Article 50? I suspect so provided that the extension is only short lived with the aim of tweaking Ms May\u2019s deal slightly. The pound is strengthening against the euro, up 0.3% today at \u20ac1.13. That\u2019s another sign that Brexit worries are fading, a little. In the last hour, prime minister Theresa May has told parliament that the EU would only agree to delay Brexit if the House of Commons had agreed on a new plan. That\u2019s seen as a softening of the PM\u2019s position. Another potentially significant move -- Conservative MP Dominic Grieve has presented a bill that would put another referendum on the table.... Andy Bruce of Reuters has rounded up the latest City views on Brexit: David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers, has weighed in to support Mark Carney. He concurs that investors believe Britain is less likely to crash out of the EU without a deal, now that MPs have delivered such as resounding defeat on the PM. Here\u2019s his logic: Parliament rejected the government\u2019s negotiated exit deal with the EU by an historic 230 votes. Labour have tabled a motion of no confidence, which could deliver early elections, but we expect it to fail at 7pm tonight. The government must produce a new plan on Monday. We doubt it has such a plan, but Parliament will become increasingly involved in the sculpting of a new deal. This suggests a more politically centrist driven approach to Brexit, suggesting a softer Brexit (Norway/Customs Union) or even a second referendum. However, there is no majority position within Parliament and no clear path to an alternative outcome. This process is likely to require longer than the 10 remaining weeks until Brexit, and we see a delay to Brexit from 29 March as likely. Markets consider Parliamentary involvement, to see a receding risk of \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit. This is supporting sterling. Governor Mark Carney played today\u2019s session fairly tightly -- understandably keen not to spook the markets at such a crucial time. But there are a few key points to flag up. The financial markets believe that Brexit could be delayed, according to Carney. He believes the recovery in sterling since last night\u2019s vote shows a no-deal Brexit is seen as less likely. Governor Carney also predicted that there will be more volatility in the weeks ahead. Carney remains confident that the UK banking sector is resilient enough to cope with a hard Brexit - citing the capital reserves that could be deployed to support lending. Carney denied there is a big rift with the European Central Bank over Brexit - but the two sides do still disagree over derivative contracts (there are tens of trillions of pounds of derivatives contracts owned by EU firms held in the City) He also warned that China\u2019s economy will keep slowing this year, due to the trade war with America and the clean-up of its shadow banking operations. Carney makes one final point on the Bank\u2019s \u2018worst-case\u2019 disorderly Brexit scenario (in which the pound plunges 25% and a staggering 8% is wiped off GDP). That scenarios is mainly based on the imposition of tariffs and economic dislocation, not higher interest rates (which has a longer-term impact). the governor adds. [Some critics, though, insist that the bank would cut rates, not hike them]. That\u2019s the end of the session. BoE policymaker Richard Sharp makes an important point -- the economy will suffer if global investors lose faith in the credibility of the government to handle its financial affairs. In other words, uncertainty over Brexit (or a general election) could hurt demand for UK assets (an interest rate hike to prop up the currency could drive debt defaults and cost jobs, for example) So how will markets respond of MPs grab control of Brexit back, John Mann asks... Sharp declines to speculate.... How much more uncertainty and delays can we take? Sharp replies that, in his experience, there is always uncertainty at the climax to a major negotiation. But with the global economy already slowing, Brexit uncertainty is another reason for firms to hold back from fresh investment. More Christmas card news -- John Mann MP reassures Mark Carney that his Christmas card went on the main mantlepiece at Mann Towers (not with the missives from \u201cpoliticians and other curiosities\u201d). Carney\u2019s card was proudly displayed between Borussia Dortmund Football Club and the ambassador of Nepal, apparently. Ever on the pulse, Carney suggests Mann doesn\u2019t let any Tottenham Hotspur fans know of this Germanic friendship (ahead of their Champion\u2019s League clash #coys). Mann then turns to the serious stuff -- is there a row between the Bank and the European Central Bank over how a Brexit deal will play out? Carney insists that relations are \u201cexemplary\u201d. However, there is a difference of opinion over how derivatives contracts would be handled in a no-deal, no transition scenario. Labour MP Wes Streeting asks Carney about another big issue - the rise in unsecured household debt. It has hit \u00a315,400 per person, according to the TUC. Carney argues that the true picture is lower -- the TUC\u2019s data includes student loans, which are effectively a tax (you only pay them back at a certain income level). It also includes loans to non-profitable bodies such as schools and hospitals. But still, the Bank does watch this issue closely, and has noted that the burden of unsecured debt is highest in the North West of England - while secured debt (mortgages) is highest in London. The Treasury committee now turn to the UK\u2019s persistent current account deficit (the gap between the goods and money flow into and out of the country) Q: Could Brexit make it worse? BoE policymaker Alex Brazier says there is a potential danger that foreigners could lose their appetite for UK assets. That would worsen the deficit. Brazier also warns that new tariff and non-tariff barriers would make the \u201csustainable size\u201d of the UK current account deficit smaller. That would create a painful adjustment, in which the pound falls, saving rises, and investment falls. As a nation we are spending more than we earn.... the onus is on the UK to maintain its attractiveness for that overseas investment, unless we want to go through that painful adjustment. Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s inflation data: Back on China, Mark Carney warns that Chinese lenders have been using some of the techniques seen in America in the run-up to the financial crisis. Brexiteer Steve Baker MP starts his questioning with an apology.....for not sending Mark Carney a Christmas card! Apparently it was part of a wider failure.... (readers can insert their own joke about Brexit planning). Baker then asks about the government\u2019s decision to end the \u201czero risk weight rule\u201d on eurozone government debt in a no-deal scenario. Currently, EU banks in Britain don\u2019t need to set aside extra capital to cover losses on their own government debt, as they\u2019re assumed to be so safe they carry a \u201czero\u201d risk weight. That deal would end if Britain leaves without a deal, according to a \u2018statutory instrument\u2019 issues last year. Q: Did the FPC ask the government to do this? Carney says it did not - this is a mechanical consequence of the UK leaving the EU. Baker is concerned about the explosion in government debt since the financial crisis a decade ago, and fears problems ahead. BoE policymaker Richard Sharp weighs in, concurring with Baker that government debt can turn from safe to risky. At the start of my career, Sharp says, Venezuala had a top-rank Triple A rating at the start of his City career (it\u2019s now languishing at C, close to default). Christopher Smart, head of macroeconomic &amp; geopolitical research at Barings, thinks Mark Carney is right -- the markets do believe the Brexit date could be extended, and that a hard Brexit can be avoided. Smart writes: \u201cTheresa May has been the Energizer Bunny of British politics. She just keeps going, in spite of all obstacles. Everyone hates her plan, but they hate the alternatives even more. Lots of people want her job, but they don\u2019t want it now. With this vote, however, she may be coming to the end of her rope. Even if she wins the confidence vote tonight, it\u2019s just hard to imagine that in consultation with other party leaders she can develop a fresh approach that will garner broad support. This raises the chance of a general election, with the EU offering more time for a democratic consultation that will help identify a path forward that does garner broad support. The EU doesn\u2019t want to risk a hard Brexit any more than most British businesses do. This chart from Refinitiv shows the pound\u2019s rebound last night which Carney alluded to. As you can see, sterling weakened steadily through Tuesday as the meaningful vote loomed, only to bounce back off the mat once the scale of May\u2019s defeat became clear. Uh oh.... Mark Carney is now talking about potential problems in the financial system. This includes the growth in leveraged loans and loan securitisation (bundling debt into new securities - a popular and dangerous practice that led to the 2008 crisis). Conservative MP Colin Clark turns to the trade dispute between the US and China. Q: Has the UK already been hurt by the trade war? Governor Carney says third countries such as the UK are relatively insulated, unless it spills into the financial markets.... which has already happened. There is a possibility, over time, of trade diversion to third countries - which would help UK companies. But that happens over time. Q: Is the dispute reaching a resolution? It\u2019s hard to say, Carney replies, as the talks aren\u2019t being conducted in public. The US president thinks they are, Clark jokes, pointing to @realdonaldtrump\u2019s twitter feed. Q: What\u2019s a bigger threat - Brexit, or China\u2019s slowdown? Alex Brazier, BoE executive director for risk, says the Bank doesn\u2019t rank them -- it trie to ensure that the financial system is strong enough to cope with both. Brexit isn\u2019t the only risk facing the UK economy, of course. Mark Carney is now outlining how an economic shock in China could hurt Britain, as it\u2019s such an open economy. Q: Does Apple\u2019s profits warning show that a China downturn is coming? The governor says there are several signs that China\u2019s economy has slowed in 2018, and will continue to slow in 2019. He says this is partly due to \u201ctrade tensions\u201d, particularly due to the trade war with the US. The \u201cnecessary but difficult\u201d reform of China\u2019s shadow banking sector is also a factor -- credit conditions are tightening, as Beijing clamps The UK\u2019s exposure to China is relatively modest, Carney continues, but it does have considerable exposure to the Chinese banking sector. So the City could be hurt by a China hard landing. Anil Kashyap, an external member of the Bank\u2019s FPC, suggests that a 3% shock in Chinese GDP could knock 0.5% off UK growth. Carney adds that Chinese growth could potentially slow to the \u201chigh five percent\u201d level, which would be lower than Beijing\u2019s target of 6%-6.5%. We are looking to avoid a situation where the financial system makes the next downturn worse, Carney says. He points out that the Bank has forced commercial banks to hold more capital (through its counter-cyclical capital buffer). That cash is effectively on standby for an economic shock, and could be released to support lending. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell is quizzing Mark Carney over the Bank\u2019s predictions that interest rates could rise sharply if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. The governor explains, at some length, that the bank\u2019s \u201cmechanical formulae\u201d models how such a shock would ripple through the system, and the actions policymakers should take. That\u2019s why the Bank has designed such tough stress tests, to ensure that the financial system is robust enough to handle whatever Brexit (or anything else) throws at it. Carney says: We have confidence that the core of the system is resilient to the kinds of shock we could see. McKinnell isn\u2019t convinced. Wouldn\u2019t hiking rates to 4% simply help banks profits, even though it would also hurt the economy? Alex Brazier, the Bank\u2019s executive director for Financial Stability Strategy, denies it -- high interest rates are actually bad for the banks, he argues, as they also create more bad debts (as households default on mortgages, credit card loans, etc) Just in: UK inflation has fallen to its lowest level in almost two years -- giving households some relief as they brace for possible Brexit upheaval. The consumer prices index shows that prices rose by 2.1% year-on-year in December, down from 2.3% in November, thanks to falling fuel costs. Carney adds that he wouldn\u2019t put \u2018too much weight\u2019 on short-term market moves. Mark Carney begins his session by talking about the financial markets\u2019 reaction to last night\u2019s Brexit vote. The governor says that market sentiment across a range of markets are affected by Brexit developments, particularly in parliament. Last night, Carney explains, there was a \u201csharp rebound in sterling following the vote\u201d. That reflects some investors\u2019 belief that Brexit could be delayed beyond the end of March. Carney says: Public market commentary, consistent with our market intelligence, that rebound appears to reflect some expectation that the process of resolution would be extended and that the prospect of no-deal may have been diminished. As this tweet shows, the pound fell below $1.27 after May lost the vote, but is now back at almost $1.29. Carney insists he isn\u2019t giving his own opinion of how Brexit will develop -- he\u2019s simply citing the market\u2019s initial take, and how it was expressed. The issue remains in the hands of parliament, he continued, adding: The markets, like the country, are looking to parliament for direction, and one could expect continued volatility. Mark Carney\u2019s hearing is underway now. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Newsflash: Environmental threats, and politicians inability to tackle them, are the biggest risk to the global economy, the World Economic Forum has warned. WEF\u2019s annual global risks report, just released, cites extreme weather events, natural disasters, and failure to address climate change as the three biggest threats. WEF, which will hold its annual meeting in Davos next week, warns: Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis? Global risks are intensifying but the collective will to tackle them appears to be lacking. Instead, divisions are hardening... The report is based on the views around around 1,000 experts and decision-makers, and most are worried. WEF adds: Nine out of 10 respondents expect worsening economic and political confrontations between major powers this year. Over a ten-year horizon, extreme weather and climate-change policy failures are seen as the gravest threats. More here: The pound is calm now, but may rally if Theresa May wins today\u2019s no-confidence vote, called after last night\u2019s historic Brexit deal defeat. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says: The UK voted for Brexit, markets priced it in (to a large degree) and now are watching, slack-jawed, as the Government tries to find a path to the exit which it can rally politicians behind. Today\u2019s confidence vote isn\u2019t quite a done deal and so if the Government survives, sterling should get a bit of a lift. Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s isn\u2019t considering cutting the UK\u2019s credit rating, yet anyway, following the Meaningful Vote on the Brexit deal last night. It says: The outcome of the vote further extends the period of uncertainty over the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, a credit negative for many rated debt issuers. However, the vote against the deal is not, in itself, sufficient grounds for Moody\u2019s to shift its base case to a no-deal scenario in which the rating agency would formally review the UK\u2019s credit profile and other affected issuers City analysts and fund managers have been scrambling to update clients on the Brexit situation, after Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal deal was resoundingly rejected by MPs. David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, says the drubbing highlights the PM\u2019s weak position: \u201cFrom our view, the most likely outcome is that May acquiesces and either delays or revokes article 50, effectively pushing the \u2018pause button\u2019 just before the train flies off the tracks. UK businesses and consumers should expect to live under continued uncertainty for quite a while longer. It is important to recognize that the Brexit referendum was about an ideal \u2013 a United Kingdom independent of the EU. So far, that ideal has not been matched by a realistic plan or process to deliver it. Until such a plan emerges, the withdrawal process will probably be put on hold.\u201d Dean Turner, UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, sees more storms ahead. At this stage we do not advocate taking directional views on sterling and UK assets. The reaction of the pound following the vote would suggest that markets are not currently increasing the risk of an adverse outcome. For the time being, we expect that uncertainty will remain high and UK markets will stay volatile. Within portfolios, exposure to sterling-denominated assets should be maintained at benchmark levels until more clarity emerges.\u201d Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart, predicts Brexit will be delayed, or even cancelled.... As Mrs May licks her wounds after last night\u2019s humiliating defeat what matters now is how hard she tries to build a consensus on the basis that a large majority in the Commons including half her ministers (and possibly herself but she is not saying) are determined to avoid \u2018no deal\u2019. She has her work cut out as nobody really trusts her competence or veracity any more (ironically, rather like Mr Trump, whom she no doubt fastidiously disdains as her mirror image). She may genuinely be taken aback by the intensity of division both in Parliament and amongst voters but as Prime Minister she has to deal with it responsibly in order to limit the economic and social damage.The scale of the defeat means there is little point in her persisting with the current deal as Europhile MPs who loyally supported her yesterday will now feel able to go their own way. This, in turn, means that Brexit will not take place on 29 March, if at all. Mark Carney will be quizzed today about the Bank of England\u2019s latest Financial Stability Report, released at the end of November. That report predicted that the UK banking sector could survive a disorderly Brexit, thanks to the Bank\u2019s work since June 2016 (if only the rest of the system had worked as efficiently....) The Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) declared: The FPC has reviewed a disorderly Brexit scenario, with no deal and no transition period, that leads to a severe economic shock. Based on a comparison of this scenario with the stress test, the FPC judges that the UK banking system is strong enough to continue to serve UK households and businesses even in the event of a disorderly Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney has played the \u2018adult in the room\u2019 role a few times since he joined the Bank of England in 2013. And today, MPs and investors alike will be looking to the BoE governor as he testifies to parliament on the UK\u2019s financial stability. He\u2019ll be quizzed about the City\u2019s ability to handle Brexit, and the preparedness (or otherwise) of firms for a cliff-edge, or disorderly, departure. He\u2019ll be accompanied by Alex Brazier, Executive Director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk, and two external members of the financial policy committee -- Anil Kashyap and Richard Sharp. It kicks off at 9.15am. Carney\u2019s hearing is well-timed -- barely 12 hours after MPs threw Brexit into fresh chaos by sensationally rejecting Theresa May\u2019s deal by a historically thumping 230 votes. May now faces a confidence vote tonight, while the rest of the country faces further uncertainty. Will the UK crash out without a deal on 29th March? Will MPs now force a softer Brexit, a second referendum, or even a revoke Article 50 altogether? The markets are taking the uncertainty remarkable well. Sterling is hovering around $1.28 against the US dollar - having swiftly rebounded from yesterday\u2019s losses last night. That doesn\u2019t mean the business world are relaxed about the situation, of course, with barely 70 days until Brexit day (delays and cancellations notwithstanding). Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, warned Bloomberg TV that the vast majority of companies simply aren\u2019t prepared for a no-deal, so they want parliament to move swiftly onto the next step. Robert Ward, editorial director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, reckons Theresa May options are running thin... We also discover whether the Brexit uncertainty has hit house prices this morning. Plus new inflation data, which may show the consumer prices rose by 2.1% per year in December, down from 2.3% in November.

The ambassador said that any convicted prisoner subject to a jail sentence of under 10 years could be released after serving a third of their sentence on the recommendation of the prison to the prosecutor general, so long as the individual was not deemed to be a threat to society or likely to reoffend. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail more than two years ago and would therefore now be eligible for release. Referring to her chances of clemency, Baeidinejad said: \u201cI will let you judge if the person involved is in good conduct and is helping and assisting the prison authorities.\u201d Baeidinejad\u2019s intervention came as the Free Nazanin campaign said she had been allowed to call her husband to tell him of the end of her hunger strike, which she undertook along with a fellow prisoner. A statement said on Wednesday: \u201cThe Free Nazanin campaign can confirm with relief that Nazanin and Narges [Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian human rights activist in jail in the country] have ended their hunger strike today, and have not extended it beyond the original three days.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe lost 3kg over the three days she was on hunger strike and suffered increasing dizziness and a constant headache, the campaign group said. Richard Ratcliffe said: \u201cThe past few days have been really stressful.

All the familiar banking features of greed, incompetence and hubris are present. And all the main players look ridiculous.</p> <p>Top of the list is Ana Bot\u00edn, the Spanish bank\u2019s executive chair. Recruiting Orcel, an Italian investment banker, was a bizarre move in the first place. Orcel, at UBS and previously at Merrill Lynch, was a longstanding adviser to Santander on acquisitions, but deal merchants tend to make terrible retail bankers.</p> <p>Bot\u00edn\u2019s biggest mistake, however, was to announce the appointment last September before she had squared Orcel\u2019s money. Who would pick up the tab for Orcel\u2019s pile of unvested rewards at UBS, reputed to be as much as \u20ac50m? It was an obvious issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/15/santander-abandons-unacceptable-cost-of-new-chief-andrea-orcel\">How much? Santander's choice of new boss deemed too dear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Usual practice is for the new employer to shoulder the sum, but for Santander to shell out \u20ac50m worth of shares just to get Orcel through the door would cause a storm in Spain, not least among the customers. Bot\u00edn seems to have gambled that she could bully UBS into taking some of the hit, since the Swiss bank presumably wanted to continue to serve as adviser to Santander. When UBS refused to cough up, she was in a pickle.

      "bodyText": "The tale of how Banco Santander hired Andrea Orcel as its chief executive, and is now dropping him because it will not pay a \u20ac50m golden hello, is a mini classic. All the familiar banking features of greed, incompetence and hubris are present. And all the main players look ridiculous. Top of the list is Ana Bot\u00edn, the Spanish bank\u2019s executive chair. Recruiting Orcel, an Italian investment banker, was a bizarre move in the first place. Orcel, at UBS and previously at Merrill Lynch, was a longstanding adviser to Santander on acquisitions, but deal merchants tend to make terrible retail bankers. Bot\u00edn\u2019s biggest mistake, however, was to announce the appointment last September before she had squared Orcel\u2019s money. Who would pick up the tab for Orcel\u2019s pile of unvested rewards at UBS, reputed to be as much as \u20ac50m? It was an obvious issue. Usual practice is for the new employer to shoulder the sum, but for Santander to shell out \u20ac50m worth of shares just to get Orcel through the door would cause a storm in Spain, not least among the customers. Bot\u00edn seems to have gambled that she could bully UBS into taking some of the hit, since the Swiss bank presumably wanted to continue to serve as adviser to Santander. When UBS refused to cough up, she was in a pickle. Her own board seems to have told her to call the whole thing off. Orcel emerges as ridiculous because he quit his lucrative gig at UBS before he had tied down his new contract at Santander, an astonishing oversight on his part. He could, of course, have agreed to cut his price to secure a job he apparently craved, but that idea seems to have gone nowhere. Do not weep for him. By rights, his status as a respected adviser should have been ruined for his role in helping Royal Bank of Scotland buy the toxic parts of ABN Amro in 2007, a deal that led to RBS\u2019s collapse the following year. Orcel was reportedly paid \u00a37.5m for that gig. At a push, one might say the refuseniks on Santander\u2019s board emerge with credit for saving the bank from a bigger PR disaster. Really, though, they should be asking themselves whether Bot\u00edn, the towering figure at the bank, has too much power. As for UBS, it was entirely within its rights to refuse to cooperate, but it will also have to explain how Orcel could have clocked up such huge rewards during his seven-year stint. It\u2019s not as if UBS\u2019s share price has soared in that period. As a demonstration of how little has changed at the big banks since the crisis a decade ago, the Orcel parable is hard to beat. The sums remain enormous and the cult of the superstar banker remains entrenched. The only difference is that boards are sometimes dimly aware that the outside world is repulsed. Orcel described the banking industry as \u201ctoo arrogant, too self-convinced\u201d in the pre-crash years when he appeared before the UK\u2019s banking standards commission in 2013. The idea was that the future would be different. Ho, ho. No cakewalk for Patisserie Valerie It is hard to choose the most shocking ingredient in Patisserie Holding\u2019s latest confession. Was it the revelation that the financial misstatements uncovered last October stemmed from \u201cthousands of false entries into the company\u2019s ledgers\u201d?

Rai\u2019s chapel of Italy\u2019s journalists\u2019 union said in a statement released a couple of days ago that the \u20ac7m Saudi Arabia are paying for the right to host each of the three Supercoppe they signed up for last year represented \u201cthe price of silence in the face of bombs which have been massacring civilians in Yemen for four years, in the face of the enlistment of child soldiers, in the face of the brutal murder ... of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in the face of the investigations which have singled out as direct instigator Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In the face of a stadium with \u2018sectors reserved for men.\u2019 In the face of a country where women\u2019s rights are still crushed and many activists are in prison ...\u201d </p> <p>This is where we are. The price has been paid and the game will be played. \u201cThe Italian league made this contract and we have to go,\u201d said the Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. \u201cThey told us to play there and we\u2019re going.\u201d </p> <p>So let\u2019s focus on the football. It is widely assumed that Juventus, 22 points ahead of Milan in Serie A, will win at a canter. Especially with Suso, who plays a crucial role for the Rossoneri bridging midfield and attack, suspended. But this will be Juve\u2019s seventh successive Supercoppa, and they have lost three of the last four, to Lazio last year thanks to Alessandro Murgia\u2019s stoppage-time winner, and on penalties to Milan in 2016 and Napoli in 2014. \u201cDuring these years when they have eaten everything,\u201d the Gazzetta dello Sport writes today, \u201conly in the Supercoppa have Juventus shown signs of having a full stomach.\u201d</p> <p>Milan\u2019s gameplan will presumably focus on solidity at all costs, on stopping Juventus, on staying in the game. <em>Parcheggiando l\u2019autobus</em>, in other words. Let\u2019s see how it goes.</p> <p>Here\u2019s something I wrote about this match for the Observer:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/13/supercoppa-controversy-rages-saudi-arabia-treatment-women-jamal-khashoggi\">Supercoppa controversy rages over Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of women</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m off. Bye! And up it goes! There is a disappointing lack of sparkle and firework as Chiellini hoists the Supercoppa skyward, but only because someone was a bit late pressing the button. Then suddenly the sky is full of gold and silver. Better late than never, eh? Chiellini steps up last, and as captain will lift the hefty trophy. Now Juve are queueing up for their gold versions. The Milan players are picking up their silver medals. Pjanic\u2019s pass to set up the goal just clipped the studs of a defender, aiding its path towards Ronaldo. Handbags! There\u2019s some post-match on-field fury, with Higuain at the heart of it. Presumably he\u2019s unimpressed with the referee\u2019s failure to award a penalty in the 87th minute. Or it\u2019s something else. Whatever. That was, really, pretty humdrum. Inevitably, Ronaldo rose above the rest to provide the one moment of true incision. 90+5 mins: And that\u2019s it! Juventus have won another trophy! 90+4 mins: Dybala is booked for clinging on to Higuain on the half-way line. 90+3 mins: Milan are trying to find an equaliser, but they can\u2019t find a gap in the Juve rearguard, while at the other end it looks like Juventus could find another goal pretty easily if they really put their minds to it. 90+1 mins: Massive gaping chasms are opening up in Milan\u2019s defence. Ronaldo has the ball with three team-mates available to his right, but he\u2019s more interested in having an optimistic shot of his own. It\u2019s saved. 90+1 mins: There will be five minutes of stoppage time, plenty long enough for Milan to change the course of this game (though they don\u2019t look likely to do so). 90 mins: Khedira comes on for Douglas Costa, who is also limping a bit. 89 mins: Dybala\u2019s shot from the edge of the area deflects behind. This, meanwhile, is an unfortunate habit: 87 mins: Rodriguez wrestles Douglas Costa to the ground, and is booked. Moments earlier Emre Can slid in from behind to challenge Conti for a low cross at the near post. It looked a penalty to me, but nothing is given and VAR doesn\u2019t intervene. 86 mins: A thrilling surge from Cancelo takes him into the area, but eventually into a defender. 86 mins: Juve make a change, Bernardeschi replacing Bentancur, who is limping a bit. 84 mins: Juve, in no hurry at all, make triangles on the right, Ronaldo and Cancelo and Matuidi popping passes to each other. 82 mins: Calabria is booked for halting a Juve break by bringing down Douglas Costa. 81 mins: Milan\u2019s fresh front two have done little, but they at least try to link up here. Borini has the ball on the left, but his attempt to find Higuain fails. 78 mins: A Juve cross from the left clips a defender and spins into the near post, with Donnarumma flummoxed. 77 mins: I instantly thought that was a probable red. He may just have been innocently planting his foot, but the way he did so made it look part stamp, part rake. 74 mins: The referee spends about five seconds in front of the monitor, sees a single replay, and immediately reaches for his pocket! 74 mins: The referee has been called over to have a closer look at that Kessie challenge on the VAR. 73 mins: Kessie is booked, for fouling Can. That was a bit nasty. 72 mins: Talking of Higuain, here\u2019s our latest story on his future: 70 mins: Higuain is on! Borini is also on! Cutrone and Paqueta go off. 68 mins: Juventus have a goal disallowed! Dybala passes to Ronaldo, gets the ball back, passes to Matuidi, gets the ball back and passes into the net, but the last two passes in the move were clearly offside. 67 mins: Ronaldo goes down in the penalty area, but seemed overkeen to do so. No penalty. 66 mins: Cancelo\u2019s cross from the right wing is just too strong for Ronaldo, who gets the top of his head to it. 65 mins: The assist was Pjanic\u2019s final meaningful contribution, as he has just been replaced by Emre Can. 64 mins: VAR had a good look at the offside decision, but replays suggest that Ronaldo was perfectly level. 62 mins: Pjanic chipped the ball into the area from deep, and Ronaldo had timed his run brilliantly, was entirely alone as it reached him, and headed in from six yards! I apologise, Milan fans, for cursing your side so efficiently there. 60 mins: Calhanoglu has a shot for Milan, which bounces a yard or so wide. The Rossoneri are probably edging this on points at the moment. 58 mins: Ronaldo cuts in from the left before whipping a vicious shot high towards the near post. It\u2019s straight at Donnarumma, but there\u2019s no way he could hold it. He flaps it blindly away and it\u2019s cleared. 56 mins: Cutrone, who\u2019s having a fine game, wins the ball in Juventus\u2019s half but Paqueta then spanks a long-range shot into a defender. 54 mins: Douglas Costa\u2019s lovely curling cross from the right bounces out of play. It did look nice on its way, though. 53 mins: Juventus have started the second half as if they\u2019re determined not to let the game go to extra time, one way or the other. 50 mins: Another chance for Milan! Cutrone, on the right, plays the ball inside to Kessie, who has one defender to his left but two team-mates. The pass to the unmarked Calhanoglu appeared straightforward, but he gets it wrong and Juve come away with the ball. 48 mins: Milan hit the bar! Calhanoglu is tackled just outside the D but Pjanic accidentally pushes the ball to Cutrone, just inside the area. He spins and smacks the ball goalwards, but with the keeper beaten it cannons back into play off the woodwork! 47 mins: Ronaldo\u2019s free kick is low, hard, and blasted into a defender. 46 mins: Bakayoko brings down Dybala, not far outside his area. Bakayoko what-me-guv head-in-hands reaction is a classic of its type. 46 mins: It\u2019s back on! Juve get the second half started. Higuain appears to be stripping off and getting ready for action. Milan have indeed been solid, worked hard, and held Juventus at bay. The game, to be sure, needs a goal. The players are coming back out, more action soon. 45+3 mins: That\u2019s half time. There have been no great chances, but a bit of fouling and shooting, and very occasionally saving. 45+2 mins: Castillejo brings down Matuidi from behind, and is booked. 45+1 mins: There will be about two minutes of stoppage time. 45 mins: Save! Calhanoglu goes down the left then tries to work the ball inside to Paqueta. It rebounds back to him, though, and he hammers a low shot goalwards, which Szczesny holds! 44 mins: Pjanic is booked, for sliding in on Calhanoglu about two yards from the referee. Again, a free kick would probably have sufficed there, but maybe the referee thought doing that right in front of him was a bit cheeky. 42 mins: Finally, a chance! Well, a half-chance. Douglas Costa crosses from the left and picks out Ronaldo beyond the far post, whose scissor kick bounces over the bar! 40 mins: Castillejo fouls Alex Sandro, perhaps in retribution for the one the Brazilian was booked for. There\u2019s no yellow card this time, but it\u2019s a dangerous position on the left wing. The cross, though, is cleared. 37 mins: Juve push forward again, but the move ends with Costa laying off to Pjanic, who shoots high from 23 yards. 34 mins: Juventus have a goal disallowed! Douglas Costa cuts in from the right, then cuts further in, then picks out a lovely pass to Matuidi. He\u2019s challenged, and the loose ball rolls into the net, but Milan are saved by the fact that Matuidi was three yards offside. 33 mins: Calhanoglu puts the ball through, and Cutrone is perhaps half a foot offside as he does so. Moments later he\u2019s 25 yards clear, but the flag is up! 31 mins: Milan win another corner, and it\u2019s another good one. This time it lands at the near post and falls to earth, but Juventus have the luck and the ball drops to a defender. Juventus clear, and suddenly have a three-on-two break, with Douglas Costa running down the middle, Ronaldo on the right and Dybala to the left. He picks the wrong option, or at least the wrong pass, and Ronaldo has to check back. His cross towards Dybala is cleared, and Chiellini runs onto the loose ball and pummels a shot over the bar! 30 mins: Douglas has had a couple of crossing opportunities in the last couple of minutes, one he overhit straight out of play and the other he underhit straight to the goalkeeper. 27 mins: Castillejo is facing his own goal, inside his own half and on the right flank when Alex Sandro rakes his studs down the back of his ankle, for little obvious purpose. Yellow card. 24 mins: Chaos from the corner! Szczesny comes for it but gets nothing on the ball, which drops to Bakayoko at the far post, but then refuses to land conveniently and he\u2019s eventually forced to turn back. 24 mins: Milan win a free-kick on the left wing, and spend ages getting their players in position for it to be taken. Finally, Calhanoglu hits the one-man wall. 21 mins: Calhanoglu is the first player to be booked, though in truth he made little contact with Betancur. 20 mins: Dybala wins a free-kick on the left, landing on the ball as he fell, which certainly hurt more than the foul. The free kick is headed clear. 18 mins: Ronaldo and Alex Sandro link up well on the left, but then Kessie ruins it all by shoving the latter. Free kick. 16 mins: Juventus come close again! Joao Cancelo bursts into the area, but drags his low shot just wide of the same post Douglas Costa shot just wide of a while back. 13 mins: Ronaldo has barely touched the ball so far. He\u2019s hardly stood near it. 12 mins: Calhanoglu attempts a shot from range, but it flies well wide. 9 mins: Bakayoko goes down after reaching the ball ahead of Betancur. I was pretty sure there had been no contact whatsoever, but he does look genuinely pained, and we haven\u2019t been playing long enough for him just to be knackered. 8 mins: Milan rip down the left, but their cross is also a little firm, and Calhanoglu, well wide of the near post, heads even further wide of the near post. 7 mins: Douglas Costa whips in a cross so vicious it might actually have been a shot. It lands on Dybala\u2019s head, but it would have been beyond miraculous had he done anything with it. 6 mins: Juventus, after a difficult first 60 seconds, have settled and are looking dangerous. 4 mins: Close! Juventus attack down their right, with Cancelo attracting three defenders before passing inside to Douglas Costa, who curls a shot across goal and just wide of the far post. 1 min: Milan keep the ball well and attack down the right, only for Kessie to curl his cross out of play. Then they come again, but Calhanoglu\u2019s low cross is cleared. 1 min: They\u2019re off! Milan get the game started. OK, hands have been shaken, anthems played, coins tossed. Now for the football. Juventus have a full team of mascots in little Juventus kits. Milan have a full team of mascots in little Milan kits. Slightly more remarkably, the referees have mascots in little referee kits. And out they come! It\u2019s not so much a tunnel as a cluster of corridors, but importantly they lead to the pitch. Kick-off is just a few minutes away. The Supercoppa itself has just been brought out, with the players to follow shortly. The subs\u2019 benches, meanwhile, look like this: Juventus: Perin, Pinsoglio, Del Favero, De Sciglio, Rugani, Spinazzola, Khedira, Emre Can, Bernardeschi, Kean. Milan: Reina, Antonio Donnarumma, Mauri, Higuain, Borini, Conti, Bertolacci, Montolivo, Abate, Musacchio, Strinic, Laxalt. Milan will apparently start like this: Gianluigi Donnarumma; Calabria, Zapata, Romagnoli, Rodriguez; Kessie, Bakayoko, Paqueta; Castillejo, Cutrone, Calhanoglu. Higuain is on the bench. Here\u2019s the Juventus team. For those who can\u2019t see embedded tweets, it\u2019s as follows: Szczesny; Joao Cancelo, Bonucci, Chiellini, Alex Sandro; Betancur, Pjanic, Matuidi; Douglas Costa, Dybala, Ronaldo. This is a little unsettling. I think many Britons could come up with some creative uses for effigies of our political leaders at the moment, but brandishing them with pride at major sporting events would not, I\u2019d warrant, be on the list. Hello world! Today\u2019s Supercoppa will go ahead despite and soundtracked by raucous protest. Rai\u2019s chapel of Italy\u2019s journalists\u2019 union said in a statement released a couple of days ago that the \u20ac7m Saudi Arabia are paying for the right to host each of the three Supercoppe they signed up for last year represented \u201cthe price of silence in the face of bombs which have been massacring civilians in Yemen for four years, in the face of the enlistment of child soldiers, in the face of the brutal murder ... of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in the face of the investigations which have singled out as direct instigator Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In the face of a stadium with \u2018sectors reserved for men.\u2019 In the face of a country where women\u2019s rights are still crushed and many activists are in prison ...\u201d This is where we are. The price has been paid and the game will be played. \u201cThe Italian league made this contract and we have to go,\u201d said the Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri. \u201cThey told us to play there and we\u2019re going.\u201d So let\u2019s focus on the football. It is widely assumed that Juventus, 22 points ahead of Milan in Serie A, will win at a canter. Especially with Suso, who plays a crucial role for the Rossoneri bridging midfield and attack, suspended. But this will be Juve\u2019s seventh successive Supercoppa, and they have lost three of the last four, to Lazio last year thanks to Alessandro Murgia\u2019s stoppage-time winner, and on penalties to Milan in 2016 and Napoli in 2014. \u201cDuring these years when they have eaten everything,\u201d the Gazzetta dello Sport writes today, \u201conly in the Supercoppa have Juventus shown signs of having a full stomach.\u201d Milan\u2019s gameplan will presumably focus on solidity at all costs, on stopping Juventus, on staying in the game. Parcheggiando l\u2019autobus, in other words. Let\u2019s see how it goes. Here\u2019s something I wrote about this match for the Observer:",

As has been made abundantly clear, referendums alone, like elections, are blunt instruments that remove complexity in pursuit of simple propositions,\u201d they wrote. The MPs said that citizens\u2019 assemblies could \u201cdisrupt the bad habits that have come to characterise Brexit \u2013 kicking issues into the long grass, placing party interests over the national interest, and assuming the public are unable to cope with hard choices\u201d. Nandy and Creasy said citizens\u2019 assemblies could be completed in seven weeks, faster than a second referendum and had many successful predecessors, including in Iceland following the banking crisis, and in Canada and Australia on issues such as nuclear waste and constitutional reform. Nandy, during the debate in the Commons ahead of the vote on Tuesday, used her speech to push the benefits of an assembly and said it would go some way to healing MPs\u2019 relationships with the public. \u201cI have not seen this level of anger directed towards MPs since I was first elected nearly 10 years ago during the expenses scandal,\u201d Nandy said. \u201cWe are playing with fire, we are breaking our democracy, but there is the hope. The public are better than we are.\u201d A small-scale citizens\u2019 assembly on Brexit was held in the aftermath of the referendum by the constitution unit at University College London, and concluded that the negotiations should seek close trading ties with the EU27 through a customs union but not full single-market membership. If a bespoke deal like this were not available participants said they would prefer full single-market and customs union membership over leaving without a deal.",

That morning, speaking outside No 10, May gave not a hint of apology or humility, let alone suggest she would flex her position on Brexit to accommodate the dramatically different parliamentary reality.

It is certainly preferable to Lampard\u2019s attempts to gain the moral high ground when he is aware that Chelsea used to do much the same thing under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Bielsa ought to have cottoned on a bit quicker to the possibility that what goes without comment in South America might be frowned on in England, but differences in custom and practice between footballing cultures are there to be enjoyed, not censured. Bielsa may well have acted against the spirit of the EFL clubs\u2019 charter, whatever that is, but even if you could track such a document down you would not find anything specific about lurking in bushes to get a glimpse of rival preparations.</p> \n<p>When the transgression was first discovered it was reported that the interloper was wearing camouflage gear and carrying bolt-cutters. That sounded exciting, borderline illegal in fact, though it was later toned down to sportswear and a pair of pliers. And the unnamed individual turned up in a Leeds United vehicle. Even more hilariously, Derby were able to work out he had done it before. A rustling in the undergrowth that had been noticed but not acted upon earlier in the season turned out to have taken place on the eve of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/11/derby-county-leeds-united-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">Leeds\u2019s 4-1 win at Pride Park</a> back in August.</p> \n<p>The Leeds manager should probably accept that such skulduggery is considered bad form in England, though it is worth remembering that the police who turned up at the latest incident did not make an arrest. No crime had been committed. Derby\u2019s training ground is overlooked by private houses anyway. The Leeds spy was spotted by a resident rather than a member of the football club\u2019s staff, and though Lampard is right to say he ought not to have to conduct a search of the perimeter fence before each training session, his point underlines the fact that not many training facilities are that private.</p> \n<p>Manchester City, before they moved to the Etihad campus, a purpose-built city-centre location, were always complaining that they had no privacy at Carrington because a public footpath bordered their land. All any interested party \u2013 usually press but possibly opponents \u2013 would need was a stepladder or the ability to poke a lens through a hedge.</p> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s Melwood training ground has a reasonably substantial wall around its perimeter, though it is hardly one of forbidding height. Again, the training ground is surrounded by private houses, and not only would residents rightly object were Liverpool to build prison-style walls around the place, those inside the facility would suffer a loss of light. Liverpool have plans to move out to a greenfield site on the outskirts eventually, but for now the sight of onlookers using wheelie bins and stepladders to gain a peek at the players in training is a familiar one during school holidays.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fa13de4c3e109fbab2cc938262a8b5fb3a1a78d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fa13de4c3e109fbab2cc938262a8b5fb3a1a78d/0_315_4506_2703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Carlos Osorio (centre) lived within sight of Liverpool\u2019s Melwood training ground for two years.

Juan Carlos Osorio stayed for two years, most of the time living in a bedroom that gave him an unrestricted view of Liverpool\u2019s training routines. He is currently the manager of Paraguay but gained his greatest prominence last summer as coach of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/17/germany-mexico-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Mexico team that defeated Germany</a> in the World Cup in Russia.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jan/15/david-squires-on-football-spying-and-neil-warnock-brexit-thoughts\">David Squires on \u2026 football spying and Neil Warnock's Brexit views</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is an obvious difference between snooping to further one\u2019s education and doing it to undermine an opponent in a competitive match, but the bottom line is that training grounds are not sacrosanct. If anyone wants to see what goes on badly enough, it can usually be managed, and when drone technology is developing at such a pace there is probably no point either in clubs investing in mountain hideaways with reinforced security.</p> \n<p>Bielsa has been accused of cheating, though checking out the opposition in advance could just as easily be viewed as part of the game. Some will regard his actions more generously as obsessive attention to detail, a coach going about his work with a thoroughness that is rare. While this is clearly a grey area, at least until the EFL or the FA hands down some sort of protocol that everyone can sign up to, defenders of Bielsa might also point out that not every coach or manager would be able to interpret or act upon such snippets of information that might be gleaned from a drone or a spy in the bushes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Equally, though some managers prefer to be as secretive as possible, others are relaxed about gameplans becoming public knowledge. Most clubs do not alter their playing styles that much from game to game, after all. A coach might adapt his formation for a particular game or opponent, switching to three at the back for instance or deploying a different striker, but he is not going to keep doing that week after week. Most gameplans are on very public view every Saturday afternoon, in front of thousands of paying spectators.</p> \n<p>Perhaps rugby is a more straightforward game than football, but one of the best quotes on the overrated nature of gameplans came from John Monie, the Australian who was in charge of Wigan for four seasons in the early 90s and won the cup and league double in every one. \u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing about gameplans \u2013 ours isn\u2019t a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any opponents are listening, I can tell you what we plan to do. We are going to run all over you for the first half hour then have a look and see what\u2019s left.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "One hopes Marcelo Bielsa does not get punished too severely after admitting that he spies on everyone. The Leeds United manager confessed immediately when caught blatantly watching Derby County training sessions, contacting Frank Lampard and taking responsibility for the stunt, and was reminded by his own club of Leeds\u2019s \u201cintegrity and honesty\u201d. That alone should have been enough to conclude this entertaining episode with the wry smile it deserved, although Bielsa gave it fresh impetus with his honesty offensive. Such disarming frankness and willingness to cooperate with official investigations ought to be welcomed. It is certainly preferable to Lampard\u2019s attempts to gain the moral high ground when he is aware that Chelsea used to do much the same thing under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Perhaps Bielsa ought to have cottoned on a bit quicker to the possibility that what goes without comment in South America might be frowned on in England, but differences in custom and practice between footballing cultures are there to be enjoyed, not censured. Bielsa may well have acted against the spirit of the EFL clubs\u2019 charter, whatever that is, but even if you could track such a document down you would not find anything specific about lurking in bushes to get a glimpse of rival preparations. When the transgression was first discovered it was reported that the interloper was wearing camouflage gear and carrying bolt-cutters. That sounded exciting, borderline illegal in fact, though it was later toned down to sportswear and a pair of pliers. And the unnamed individual turned up in a Leeds United vehicle. Even more hilariously, Derby were able to work out he had done it before. A rustling in the undergrowth that had been noticed but not acted upon earlier in the season turned out to have taken place on the eve of Leeds\u2019s 4-1 win at Pride Park back in August. The Leeds manager should probably accept that such skulduggery is considered bad form in England, though it is worth remembering that the police who turned up at the latest incident did not make an arrest. No crime had been committed. Derby\u2019s training ground is overlooked by private houses anyway. The Leeds spy was spotted by a resident rather than a member of the football club\u2019s staff, and though Lampard is right to say he ought not to have to conduct a search of the perimeter fence before each training session, his point underlines the fact that not many training facilities are that private. Manchester City, before they moved to the Etihad campus, a purpose-built city-centre location, were always complaining that they had no privacy at Carrington because a public footpath bordered their land. All any interested party \u2013 usually press but possibly opponents \u2013 would need was a stepladder or the ability to poke a lens through a hedge. Liverpool\u2019s Melwood training ground has a reasonably substantial wall around its perimeter, though it is hardly one of forbidding height. Again, the training ground is surrounded by private houses, and not only would residents rightly object were Liverpool to build prison-style walls around the place, those inside the facility would suffer a loss of light. Liverpool have plans to move out to a greenfield site on the outskirts eventually, but for now the sight of onlookers using wheelie bins and stepladders to gain a peek at the players in training is a familiar one during school holidays. Just over 20 years ago in fact, a Colombian studying a degree course in football science at Liverpool\u2019s John Moores university became so friendly with a family living alongside Melwood through borrowing a small table to see over the wall that he ended up moving in as a lodger. Juan Carlos Osorio stayed for two years, most of the time living in a bedroom that gave him an unrestricted view of Liverpool\u2019s training routines. He is currently the manager of Paraguay but gained his greatest prominence last summer as coach of the Mexico team that defeated Germany in the World Cup in Russia. There is an obvious difference between snooping to further one\u2019s education and doing it to undermine an opponent in a competitive match, but the bottom line is that training grounds are not sacrosanct. If anyone wants to see what goes on badly enough, it can usually be managed, and when drone technology is developing at such a pace there is probably no point either in clubs investing in mountain hideaways with reinforced security. Bielsa has been accused of cheating, though checking out the opposition in advance could just as easily be viewed as part of the game. Some will regard his actions more generously as obsessive attention to detail, a coach going about his work with a thoroughness that is rare. While this is clearly a grey area, at least until the EFL or the FA hands down some sort of protocol that everyone can sign up to, defenders of Bielsa might also point out that not every coach or manager would be able to interpret or act upon such snippets of information that might be gleaned from a drone or a spy in the bushes. Equally, though some managers prefer to be as secretive as possible, others are relaxed about gameplans becoming public knowledge. Most clubs do not alter their playing styles that much from game to game, after all. A coach might adapt his formation for a particular game or opponent, switching to three at the back for instance or deploying a different striker, but he is not going to keep doing that week after week. Most gameplans are on very public view every Saturday afternoon, in front of thousands of paying spectators. Perhaps rugby is a more straightforward game than football, but one of the best quotes on the overrated nature of gameplans came from John Monie, the Australian who was in charge of Wigan for four seasons in the early 90s and won the cup and league double in every one. \u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing about gameplans \u2013 ours isn\u2019t a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any opponents are listening, I can tell you what we plan to do. We are going to run all over you for the first half hour then have a look and see what\u2019s left.\u201d",

From midnight on Thursday the site must publish the names of touts who have identified themselves to the platform. Touts use a variety of means to obtain tickets before genuine fans to sell them on at a profit. Viagogo will release full data about touts under the terms of a court order secured by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year, demanding greater transparency for consumers. But the website briefly disclosed details of some of its sellers this week, before the information disappeared again. They include North Financial Group, a company run by Andrew Newman, who was revealed as one of Britain\u2019s biggest touts by the Observer in a 2016 investigation. According to information released by Viagogo, Newman\u2019s company sold two tickets to see Bastille at the O2 Academy Glasgow for \u00a3130.92 to Kelly Dowling, 29, who said she had no idea she had been buying from a professional tout and felt \u201ccompletely cheated\u201d.

She did not wish to reveal her name but said she feared being turned away at the turnstile because the Rugby Football Union does not permit resale through Viagogo.

The details of many more tickets listed by sellers, including professional touts, are expected to emerge on Friday if Viagogo complies with the CMA\u2019s demands in full. Claire Turnham, awarded an MBE for obtaining close to \u00a31m of refunds from the ticket website through her Victim of Viagogo group, said the scant details already emerging about ticket sellers using Viagogo raised concerns. \u201cAs the few seller identities released so far include a super-tout, we have to wonder what horrors will emerge when Viagogo publishes fuller details on Friday, assuming it complies.\u201d A spokesperson for Viagogo said: \u201cWe fully intend to comply with the agreement that we reached with the CMA and we are working tirelessly to ensure we meet the deadline.\u201d The publication of touts\u2019 details is a requirement of a court order obtained by the CMA, forcing the company into a complete overhaul of its business.

To Waight Keller, it was all deeply personal \u2013 the 1970s seen through someone whose twenties coincided with the 1990s. \u201cI used to deliberately put a T-shirt under something chic because I didn\u2019t want to look like my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was how I expressed myself and it\u2019s how I see Parisian boys express themselves too.\u201d To make the point, she wore Givenchy menswear. \u201cThe idea is that you can wear this as a woman, just in a slightly different way to men,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is more interest, certainly this century, in blurring lines between men\u2019s and women\u2019s [fashion].\u201d What sounds like a pledge to gender equality is also good business acumen. Givenchy is one of the few brands where sales are split 50/50 between womenswear and menswear and Waight Keller \u2013 a keen adopter of the co-ed show format \u2013 has the experience, having worked in menswear at Ralph Lauren and Pringle. According to insiders, the hope at Givenchy\u2019s owners, LVMH, is that the label will reach the size of Dior, a member of the billion dollar club, and that Waight Keller is the woman for the job.",

      "bodyText": "Melbourne has become the first city in Australia to have all of its council-owned infrastructure powered by renewable energy. The City of Melbourne switched all its operations to renewable energy on 1 January. The power is supplied by the Crowlands windfarm near Ararat in western Victoria, which was funded through a power purchase agreement with the City of Melbourne and 13 other Melbourne councils and institutions. The transition means that council libraries, gyms, childcare centres and buildings are now fully powered by renewable energy, as are all of the city\u2019s street lights. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty nice New Year\u2019s resolution to go to 100% renewable energy,\u201d the deputy mayor, Arron Wood, said. The Yarra, Port Phillip and Moreland councils, as well as Australia Post, Bank Australia, the National Australia Bank, Melbourne University, Federation Square, Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre and Zoos Victoria were also part of the buying group and began their new energy contracts on the same day. The group agreed to purchase 88GWh of electricity per year, about half of the energy that will be produced by the 80MW Crowlands windfarm. Under the agreement 40% of the power will be purchased at a fixed price while 60% will be a market-based price that is renegotiated every two years. \u201cThis will be a good hedge against future price rises,\u201d Wood said. The value of the contract is commercial in confidence but Wood said council was purchasing more than 19GWh per year, or about 23% of the total purchase agreement. It was funded, in part, by efficiency measures including a $16m upgrade of the city\u2019s 12,000 street lamps to LED lights, which is expected to shave $1m a year off the council\u2019s power bills once the changeover is completed in July. \u201cWhen people say to me that it costs money to support renewable energy projects, well, we are actually paying for our renewable energy projects through our efficiency projects,\u201d Wood said. He said the council had created a \u201cno frills\u201d version of the power purchase agreement used by the group and was working with private corporations based in Melbourne who were interested in copying the idea. \u201cThere will just be four or five in the buying group,\u201d he said. The remaining turbines are expected to be operational in May. There are more than 40 large-scale wind and solar projects either under construction or with planning approval in Victoria, as well as more than 26 that are already producing electricity. The sector is on track to create 6,000 annual jobs. Most of the new projects are funded through the state\u2019s 650MW reverse auction but others, like Crowlands, were funded by private purchase agreements. Last week the Andrews government approved a proposal for a $1.5bn, 17,000 hectare windfarm at Golden Plains, which is big enough to provide up to 10% of the state\u2019s energy needs at less than $50/MWh. Victoria is on track to exceed its renewable energy targets of generating 25% of the state\u2019s electricity needs from renewable sources by 2020 and 40% by 2025, causing some environmental groups to say the 2030 target of 50% renewable energy is not strong enough.",

      "bodyText": "We know remarkably little about the oceans that cover most of the Earth, provide half of our oxygen and help to regulate the climate. Maps of the ocean floor are less detailed than those of Mars or the moon. Marine biologists have discovered deeply weird and genuinely wonderful species: boxer crabs wielding anemones like weapons; the rope-like Praya dubia, up to 50 metres long; immortal jellyfish, which unlike any other known creature can revert from maturity to an earlier stage of development, akin to a butterfly becoming a caterpillar. But on one estimate we have identified less than a tenth of ocean-dwelling creatures. What we can be certain about is that the extraordinary diversity of life in the oceans is under immense and growing threat. This week we learned that the last five years were the hottest on record. Global warming has heated the oceans by the equivalent of one atomic explosion per second for the last century and a half; in recent years the pace has accelerated to between three and six atomic bombs per second. More than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas. Billions of people living in coastal areas are under threat from rising sea levels, due both to the melting of ice \u2013 happening at a frightening and increasing rate \u2013 and the physical expansion of water as it warms. Climate change is making storms more powerful and disrupting the patterns of marine life on which communities depend. But it is only the most comprehensive of the dangers. Carbon emissions are also causing ocean acidification. Intensive fishing, pollution and the exploitation of mineral resources are all taking their toll. Between a fifth and a quarter of marine species are already threatened with extinction; global marine populations have halved since 1970. Though only three humans have reached the deepest known point, the Mariana trench, our collective impact is felt there in the form of pollutants and plastics. Recently, an expert warned that today\u2019s children may be the last generation to see the glory of coral reef systems which have survived for tens of millions of years. Bleaching, first observed in 1983, has already affected up to a third of warm-water reefs. Scientists around the world are \u201cfarming\u201d corals in an ingenious attempt to sustain them, but the only real solution is to stave off the worst climate change scenario. The New York summit overseen by the UN secretary general this September will be a key test of whether nation states are serious about cutting emissions. The new reports provide yet more evidence of how urgent this is. As one expert on ocean warming notes in the Guardian today, it can still be tackled if we act immediately; this is a test of will, not ability. We know that the human consequences if we fail will be catastrophic. And yet, because we have still to explore the oceans more fully, we may never realise quite how much we have lost.",

Chronic overcrowding in the central \u201cpens\u201d on the terraces at that end of Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s stadium during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final caused a crush that killed 96 people. Richard Matthews QC told the jury at Preston crown court on Wednesday, the second day of the trial, that David Duckenfield \u2013 promoted and appointed match commander shortly before the semi-final on 15 April 1989 \u2013 did not know how 24,500 Liverpool supporters were to gain access to the ground, through only 23 turnstiles.

Matthews took the jury through a history of changes to the Leppings Lane end, which were made after Tottenham Hotspur supporters suffered crushing at the 1981 FA Cup semi-final against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Police at that match guided some Tottenham supporters out of the terraces, to sit around the perimeter of the pitch. After that incident, the Leppings Lane terrace was divided into pens and Matthews said expert evidence will be given that the division reduced the terrace\u2019s safe capacity from 7,200 \u2013 the figure stated on the Hillsborough safety certificate \u2013 to 5,246. Of these changes to the capacity and confined layout of the pens, Matthews said: \u201cThe scene was almost literally set for \u2026 the subsequent failures by David Duckenfield and Graham Mackrell.\u201d Mackrell is accused of failing to agree with police, as required by the safety certificate, a change to how Liverpool supporters were admitted to the Leppings Lane end compared with the semi-final the previous year, which was also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The change meant that in 1989 all 10,100 people with tickets to stand on the Leppings Lane and North West terraces had to be admitted through seven turnstiles. That was an average of 1,443 supporters through each turnstile, whereas almost three times the number of turnstiles were available for Nottingham Forest supporters, at 468 people each. Matthews said that Duckenfield\u2019s \u201cfirst extraordinarily bad failure\u201d was not to be fully aware of how the Liverpool supporters were to be admitted from the \u201cbottleneck\u201d of the Leppings Lane: \u201cIt was so very far from good enough or sufficient to be simply aware that 23 turnstiles were going to serve the entry of 24,000 people.\u201d Duckenfield should have been aware of the safety risks, Matthews said, partly due to a general warning in the 1986 \u201cGreen\u201d Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds, of \u201cthe potential scale of death and injury at a crowded sporting event.\u201d He said that the risk of death at Hillsborough did not need hindsight after the disaster to be identified; \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the match commander would have recognised it in the arrangements of the turnstiles, and the tunnel across the concourse that led directly to the confining central pens. \u201cThe Crown say that the risk of death was obvious, serious and present throughout the failings of David Duckenfield to show reasonable care in discharging his duty as match commander,\u201d Matthews said.

      "body": "<p>When a government is spectacularly defeated on a major plank of its legislative programme, the expected outcome is surely a general election, but this is routinely dismissed in your pages, in favour of \u201cconstitutional devices\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/the-guardian-view-on-mays-brexit-deal-its-over-but-whats-next\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 16 January), which would inevitably be protracted.</p> <p>However, eventually joining Labour in a no-confidence vote could be the only way for those Tories who cannot stomach no deal to avoid a cliff edge, as Theresa May runs down the clock. Moreover, a general election has the clear advantage of setting the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU in the context of a broad policy programme, rather than prioritising an inherently divisive issue. The Tories could put whatever version of the May (or no) deal their fractured party can agree upon directly to the public.</p> <p>Labour could propose a time-limited negotiation with the EU to achieve its preferred option of closer alignment, followed by submitting any agreement to a, by then, reconstituted electorate, for consideration against the merits of retaining membership. The election result would be based not only on a clear choice on Brexit, but on the proffered solutions to the scourges of poverty, inequality, homelessness and environmental degradation which threaten the wellbeing of us all.<br><strong>Dr Anthony Isaacs</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The suggestion in your editorial that Mrs May should reach out to her opponents in other political parties fails to appreciate the level of cynicism that her approach to the EU represents. It is now apparent that her real fear is that a softer Brexit negotiated with members of other parties would lead to a permanent Conservative split.</p> <p>She clearly appreciates that no deal would do immense damage to the economy but believes it to be a price worth paying in order to keep her party intact. The clock will now be run down.<br><strong>Rick Hanley</strong><br><em>Colchester, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your well-observed editorial suggests a Hobson\u2019s choice for Theresa May, but this doesn\u2019t do justice to a sorry tale of such epic proportions. Having steered a course as monomaniacally as Moby Dick\u2019s Captain Ahab; entered a contract of Faustian proportions with the DUP; presided over a party with even more Mad Hatters than Alice in Wonderland, and exhibited an insatiable appetite for deploying petards with which to hoist herself; Theresa May\u2019s late conversion to cross-party consultation neatly demonstrates (in Westminster\u2019s political cathedral) the tortured predicament of the conflicted martyr: \u201cthe last temptation is the greatest treason / to do the right thing for the wrong reason\u201d \u2013 and we\u2019re still nowhere near the last chapter.<br><strong>Paul McGilchrist</strong><br><em>Colchester, Essex </em></p> <p>\u2022 Parliament debated Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill for a week in December, and for another week this month. If Mrs May wants to know what are the views of \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d \u2013 or indeed any parliamentarians \u2013 she could read Hansard.

      "bodyText": "When a government is spectacularly defeated on a major plank of its legislative programme, the expected outcome is surely a general election, but this is routinely dismissed in your pages, in favour of \u201cconstitutional devices\u201d (Editorial, 16 January), which would inevitably be protracted. However, eventually joining Labour in a no-confidence vote could be the only way for those Tories who cannot stomach no deal to avoid a cliff edge, as Theresa May runs down the clock. Moreover, a general election has the clear advantage of setting the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU in the context of a broad policy programme, rather than prioritising an inherently divisive issue. The Tories could put whatever version of the May (or no) deal their fractured party can agree upon directly to the public. Labour could propose a time-limited negotiation with the EU to achieve its preferred option of closer alignment, followed by submitting any agreement to a, by then, reconstituted electorate, for consideration against the merits of retaining membership. The election result would be based not only on a clear choice on Brexit, but on the proffered solutions to the scourges of poverty, inequality, homelessness and environmental degradation which threaten the wellbeing of us all. Dr Anthony Isaacs London \u2022 The suggestion in your editorial that Mrs May should reach out to her opponents in other political parties fails to appreciate the level of cynicism that her approach to the EU represents. It is now apparent that her real fear is that a softer Brexit negotiated with members of other parties would lead to a permanent Conservative split. She clearly appreciates that no deal would do immense damage to the economy but believes it to be a price worth paying in order to keep her party intact. The clock will now be run down. Rick Hanley Colchester, Essex \u2022 Your well-observed editorial suggests a Hobson\u2019s choice for Theresa May, but this doesn\u2019t do justice to a sorry tale of such epic proportions. Having steered a course as monomaniacally as Moby Dick\u2019s Captain Ahab; entered a contract of Faustian proportions with the DUP; presided over a party with even more Mad Hatters than Alice in Wonderland, and exhibited an insatiable appetite for deploying petards with which to hoist herself; Theresa May\u2019s late conversion to cross-party consultation neatly demonstrates (in Westminster\u2019s political cathedral) the tortured predicament of the conflicted martyr: \u201cthe last temptation is the greatest treason / to do the right thing for the wrong reason\u201d \u2013 and we\u2019re still nowhere near the last chapter. Paul McGilchrist Colchester, Essex \u2022 Parliament debated Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill for a week in December, and for another week this month. If Mrs May wants to know what are the views of \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d \u2013 or indeed any parliamentarians \u2013 she could read Hansard. After all, taking back control must mean that all those parliamentarians must have been saying something helpful during 10 days of debate.

      "body": "<p>Two and a half years on, the Brexit process is in total stalemate, with the Damocles sword of a disastrous no deal hanging over our heads. We are told that finally the government has been forced to open a dialogue with parliament. But the scale of the democratic and constitutional crisis we are witnessing suggests that this is one of those times when \u201cwe the citizens\u201d have a right to a say on what happens next, precisely because what is at stake is a set of very basic questions about how we are ruled.</p> <p>This is happening because the 2016 referendum never debated what should happen after the divorce with the EU and left that circle to be squared. In fact Brexit has exposed a raft of contentious issues that go largely beyond the UK-EU relationship: the Irish border; the constitutional question about sovereignty; the level of inequalities between different parts of the country and the whole direction of Britain\u2019s economic model. What to do then?</p> <p>If the current withdrawal agreement is not acceptable, the arbitrary deadline of 29 March is even less acceptable. Despite massive opposition, the minority who want a no-deal outcome may get their way by accident. Parliament must do whatever it takes to allow a longer period of discussion to review all options and prevent a car-crash Brexit. For the sake of Britain\u2019s democracy, an extension to the deadline for at least a year is essential.</p> <p>Under article 50, the government can obtain an extension from the European council, provided that the other 27 countries unanimously accept. All parliament needs to do is instruct the government to request this extension, and for the government to give a clear sign that this extension would come with a different approach to the negotiations as a whole. A general election, or a people\u2019s vote \u2013 either before or after a people\u2019s debate through the citizens\u2019 assemblies that many are starting to discuss \u2013 would give an opportunity for this different approach. All require more time.</p> <p>We are calling on British and European citizens everywhere to join us in making this alternative a reality. We need more time and a better democratic process to understand what to make of Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Two and a half years on, the Brexit process is in total stalemate, with the Damocles sword of a disastrous no deal hanging over our heads. We are told that finally the government has been forced to open a dialogue with parliament. But the scale of the democratic and constitutional crisis we are witnessing suggests that this is one of those times when \u201cwe the citizens\u201d have a right to a say on what happens next, precisely because what is at stake is a set of very basic questions about how we are ruled. This is happening because the 2016 referendum never debated what should happen after the divorce with the EU and left that circle to be squared. In fact Brexit has exposed a raft of contentious issues that go largely beyond the UK-EU relationship: the Irish border; the constitutional question about sovereignty; the level of inequalities between different parts of the country and the whole direction of Britain\u2019s economic model. What to do then? If the current withdrawal agreement is not acceptable, the arbitrary deadline of 29 March is even less acceptable. Despite massive opposition, the minority who want a no-deal outcome may get their way by accident. Parliament must do whatever it takes to allow a longer period of discussion to review all options and prevent a car-crash Brexit. For the sake of Britain\u2019s democracy, an extension to the deadline for at least a year is essential. Under article 50, the government can obtain an extension from the European council, provided that the other 27 countries unanimously accept. All parliament needs to do is instruct the government to request this extension, and for the government to give a clear sign that this extension would come with a different approach to the negotiations as a whole. A general election, or a people\u2019s vote \u2013 either before or after a people\u2019s debate through the citizens\u2019 assemblies that many are starting to discuss \u2013 would give an opportunity for this different approach. All require more time. We are calling on British and European citizens everywhere to join us in making this alternative a reality. We need more time and a better democratic process to understand what to make of Brexit.

      "body": "<p>Germany and France have signalled their willingness to delay Brexit as Michel Barnier offered to renegotiate with Theresa May in the event that she is able to build a majority with Labour in favour of a closer relationship with the EU.</p> <p>EU ambassadors also discussed the issue for the first time at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, as the member states attempted to decide on their terms for extending the negotiating time beyond 29 March.</p> <p>With Downing Street opening cross-party talks after the government\u2019s historic defeat, EU politicians and officials were looking ahead in case the prime minister finds a majority in the Commons for a fresh approach.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Emmanuel Macron, coming to the end of a seven-hour town hall meeting as news of May\u2019s Brexit vote defeat came through, said he believed the British government would seek an extension to article 50 in order to renegotiate the deal before a second parliamentary vote. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. I know them a bit,\u201d said the French president. \u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll look into it, and maybe we\u2019ll make improvements on one or two things.\u201d</p> <p>However, he cautioned: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the maximum for what we can do with the deal.\u201d He warned that the EU would not stop defending European interests \u201cjust to solve Britain\u2019s domestic political issues\u201d.</p> <p>He added that the whole basis for Brexit was flawed: \u201cIt\u2019s a referendum that has been manipulated, manipulated from outside by a lot of what we call fake news.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Altmaier, Germany\u2019s economics minister, suggested he would see it \u201cas a reasonable request\u201d if the UK wanted an extension. Nathalie Loiseau, France\u2019s EU affairs minister, confirmed that a delay would be possible in the right context.</p> <p>A similar argument was made by Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, during a late-night private meeting with senior members of the European parliament in the hours immediately after the Commons vote. The EU has previously suggested that only a general election or second referendum could persuade them to delay Brexit.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/what-are-the-alternatives-to-mays-rejected-brexit-deal\">What are the alternatives to May's rejected Brexit deal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday, Macron became the first EU leader to publicly raise the prospect of an extension beyond European elections in May. \u201cMaybe they will step over the European elections in order to find [negotiate] something else,\u201d Macron said, comments that represent a subtle shift in tone, as France has long insisted that there could be no prolongation of article 50 beyond the elections.</p> <p>During Wednesday\u2019s meeting of ambassadors and senior EU officials, several member states raised the issue of extending the two years allowed under article 50 for withdrawal talks.</p> <p>It is hoped that May might be able to construct a cross-party position to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Labour has said that it would support a deal involving a permanent customs union, a position that the prime minister nevertheless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/no-10-rules-out-customs-union-before-cross-party-talks-begin\">reiterated her opposition to </a>on Wednesday.</p> <p>Speaking to a full chamber of the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Barnier said the motivations of the MPs who delivered the rebuff to May \u2013 a defeat by 230 votes, the largest ever for a sitting government \u2013 were \u201ccontradictory\u201d.</p> <p>He said the Commons had failed to offer an alternative vision, and warned May that no progress could be made until she found a majority for a deal. \u201cObjectively speaking, this vote is not a clear manifestation of a positive majority which would define an alternative project, and an alternative to the proposal on the table today,\u201d Barnier said.</p> <p>\u201cSo, in this context, it is up to the British authorities today or tomorrow to assess the outcome of this vote, and up to the British government to find how we are to take things forward on 29 March towards an orderly withdrawal.\u201d</p> <p>Barnier, whose speech was applauded by MEPs despite the problems being faced in ratifying the deal he brokered, told the parliament that he would not speculate on the \u201cscenarios\u201d opening up following the rejection of the deal. \u201cNow, with this standstill, until we have found a way forward which will see a full majority we won\u2019t be able to move forward, so this is why the future steps must be indicated very clearly \u2026 by the British government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the former French minister added: \u201cI would like to remind you that your parliament, and unanimously the European council, have always said that if the UK chooses to shift its red lines in the future, and it makes that choice, a choice to be ambitious, and go beyond a simple free trade agreement, which would be quite something, then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a> will be immediately ready to go hand in hand with that development and to give a favourable response.\u201d</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Tuesday that there would be time to negotiate, but that it was \u201cup to the British side, as the prime minister has announced, to tell us what happens next\u201d.</p> <p>The EU is willing to reopen the political declaration on the future relationship, a 26-page document that is not legally binding, but remains highly resistant to any suggestion of unpicking the 585-page withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>Barnier told MEPs that whatever emerged from future talks, the withdrawal agreement would still need to contain the contentious Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border, which Brexiters fear will trap the UK in a customs union.</p> <p>Philippe Lamberts, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, said the withdrawal agreement containing the backstop would likely be received by rapporteurs<em>,</em> the MEPs who would present the draft to the chamber, next week as the EU continued on with its ratification process. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement will not be reopened because whatever deal we have, we need that\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Critics of May\u2019s deal have called for a time limit or unilateral right to exit the arrangements. Barnier told MEPs: \u201cThe backstop that we agreed with the UK must remain a backstop, must remain a credible backstop. The backstop must remain a backstop.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jan/15/how-did-your-mp-vote-on-mays-brexit-deal-meaningful-vote\">How did your MP vote on May's Brexit deal?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While EU officials once ruled out the UK remaining in the EU beyond elections in May 2019, attention is turning to legal fixes to permit an extension if Brexit talks drag on through the summer.</p> <p>One idea is writing text into the 585-page withdrawal agreement that would allow British representatives to sit in the parliament Brussels and Strasbourg temporarily. The model would be a reverse copy of arrangements for countries joining the EU, when national parliaments send delegates to the European parliament if they join halfway through a term.</p> <p>But not everyone agrees with this analysis. \u201cThe logical consequences of an extension is that they will have to participate in European elections,\u201d the senior official said.

      "bodyText": "Germany and France have signalled their willingness to delay Brexit as Michel Barnier offered to renegotiate with Theresa May in the event that she is able to build a majority with Labour in favour of a closer relationship with the EU. EU ambassadors also discussed the issue for the first time at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, as the member states attempted to decide on their terms for extending the negotiating time beyond 29 March. With Downing Street opening cross-party talks after the government\u2019s historic defeat, EU politicians and officials were looking ahead in case the prime minister finds a majority in the Commons for a fresh approach. On Tuesday night, Emmanuel Macron, coming to the end of a seven-hour town hall meeting as news of May\u2019s Brexit vote defeat came through, said he believed the British government would seek an extension to article 50 in order to renegotiate the deal before a second parliamentary vote. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. I know them a bit,\u201d said the French president. \u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll look into it, and maybe we\u2019ll make improvements on one or two things.\u201d However, he cautioned: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the maximum for what we can do with the deal.\u201d He warned that the EU would not stop defending European interests \u201cjust to solve Britain\u2019s domestic political issues\u201d. He added that the whole basis for Brexit was flawed: \u201cIt\u2019s a referendum that has been manipulated, manipulated from outside by a lot of what we call fake news.\u201d Peter Altmaier, Germany\u2019s economics minister, suggested he would see it \u201cas a reasonable request\u201d if the UK wanted an extension. Nathalie Loiseau, France\u2019s EU affairs minister, confirmed that a delay would be possible in the right context. A similar argument was made by Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, during a late-night private meeting with senior members of the European parliament in the hours immediately after the Commons vote. The EU has previously suggested that only a general election or second referendum could persuade them to delay Brexit. On Wednesday, Macron became the first EU leader to publicly raise the prospect of an extension beyond European elections in May. \u201cMaybe they will step over the European elections in order to find [negotiate] something else,\u201d Macron said, comments that represent a subtle shift in tone, as France has long insisted that there could be no prolongation of article 50 beyond the elections. During Wednesday\u2019s meeting of ambassadors and senior EU officials, several member states raised the issue of extending the two years allowed under article 50 for withdrawal talks. It is hoped that May might be able to construct a cross-party position to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Labour has said that it would support a deal involving a permanent customs union, a position that the prime minister nevertheless reiterated her opposition to on Wednesday. Speaking to a full chamber of the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Barnier said the motivations of the MPs who delivered the rebuff to May \u2013 a defeat by 230 votes, the largest ever for a sitting government \u2013 were \u201ccontradictory\u201d. He said the Commons had failed to offer an alternative vision, and warned May that no progress could be made until she found a majority for a deal. \u201cObjectively speaking, this vote is not a clear manifestation of a positive majority which would define an alternative project, and an alternative to the proposal on the table today,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cSo, in this context, it is up to the British authorities today or tomorrow to assess the outcome of this vote, and up to the British government to find how we are to take things forward on 29 March towards an orderly withdrawal.\u201d Barnier, whose speech was applauded by MEPs despite the problems being faced in ratifying the deal he brokered, told the parliament that he would not speculate on the \u201cscenarios\u201d opening up following the rejection of the deal. \u201cNow, with this standstill, until we have found a way forward which will see a full majority we won\u2019t be able to move forward, so this is why the future steps must be indicated very clearly \u2026 by the British government,\u201d he said. But the former French minister added: \u201cI would like to remind you that your parliament, and unanimously the European council, have always said that if the UK chooses to shift its red lines in the future, and it makes that choice, a choice to be ambitious, and go beyond a simple free trade agreement, which would be quite something, then the European Union will be immediately ready to go hand in hand with that development and to give a favourable response.\u201d The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Tuesday that there would be time to negotiate, but that it was \u201cup to the British side, as the prime minister has announced, to tell us what happens next\u201d. The EU is willing to reopen the political declaration on the future relationship, a 26-page document that is not legally binding, but remains highly resistant to any suggestion of unpicking the 585-page withdrawal agreement. Barnier told MEPs that whatever emerged from future talks, the withdrawal agreement would still need to contain the contentious Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border, which Brexiters fear will trap the UK in a customs union. Philippe Lamberts, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, said the withdrawal agreement containing the backstop would likely be received by rapporteurs, the MEPs who would present the draft to the chamber, next week as the EU continued on with its ratification process. \u201cThe withdrawal agreement will not be reopened because whatever deal we have, we need that\u201d, he said. Critics of May\u2019s deal have called for a time limit or unilateral right to exit the arrangements. Barnier told MEPs: \u201cThe backstop that we agreed with the UK must remain a backstop, must remain a credible backstop. The backstop must remain a backstop.\u201d While EU officials once ruled out the UK remaining in the EU beyond elections in May 2019, attention is turning to legal fixes to permit an extension if Brexit talks drag on through the summer. One idea is writing text into the 585-page withdrawal agreement that would allow British representatives to sit in the parliament Brussels and Strasbourg temporarily. The model would be a reverse copy of arrangements for countries joining the EU, when national parliaments send delegates to the European parliament if they join halfway through a term. But not everyone agrees with this analysis. \u201cThe logical consequences of an extension is that they will have to participate in European elections,\u201d the senior official said. EU lawyers have yet to express a view. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2019 to correct Peter Altmaier\u2019s position from finance minister to economics minister.",

May responded: \u201cWhen they were [voting in the EU referendum] I believe they did vote to ensure we continue to have a good trading relationship with our nearest neighbours in the EU but also to improve our trading relationships with others around the world.\u201d May did not rule out delaying article 50 or ever joining a customs union permanently. Peter Altmaier, a close ally of Angela Merkel in Germany\u2019s government, said a request to extend article 50 would be given serious consideration. \u201cWhen parliament needs more time, then this is something that will have to be considered by the European council, and personally I would see that as a reasonable request,\u201d he told the BBC. The pound fell below $1.27 after May lost the vote, but quickly recovered to hit $1.29. On Wednesday sterling settled around $1.28 and also remained steady against the euro at \u20ac1.13. Carney insisted he was not giving his own opinion of how Brexit would develop. He was only citing the market\u2019s initial take, and how it was expressed. The issue remained in the hands of parliament. He added: \u201cThe markets, like the country, are looking to parliament for direction, and one could expect continued volatility.\u201d Carney, who was answering questions as chair of the bank\u2019s financial policy committee, which monitors the health of the financial system, warned that there was not currently \u201cgood visibility of the nature of the future relationship\u201d between the UK and the EU. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on these short-term movements. The market is waiting.\u201d MPs asked the governor about the bank\u2019s stress test scenarios, which included an assessment of a disorderly no-deal Brexit that would trigger an 8% collapse in GDP. Threadneedle Street has come under fire from Brexiters, who said the scenarios exaggerated the likely impact of a no-deal departure. The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell asked how realistic it was to include an increase in interest rates to 4% in the worst-case scenario, when the more likely reaction of the bank would be to cut rates, as it did following the 2008 financial crash. Carney said the increase was to preserve the ability of banks to lend in the midst of a crisis and to keep Britain attractive to international investors. However, McKinnell said an increase in interest rates would likely harm the economy more than it would help the banks, hurting consumer confidence and fuelling rises in unemployment and home repossessions. She said: \u201cEven if the banks have the capital reserves to lend, in the scenario you describe would banks be lending to companies and house builders when there is serious economic turbulence?\u201d",

It would also limit the UK's ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion.

      "bodyText": "UK inflation fell to its lowest level in nearly two years in December after a drop in petrol prices offered some respite to consumers who are reining in spending as Brexit looms. The annual rate dipped to 2.1% from 2.3% in November, the weakest since January 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists said the drop reduced the likelihood that the Bank of England would raise interest rates in the near future. Petrol prices fell to an eight-month low in December after a drop in the price of crude oil. The cost of a litre of petrol fell by 6.4p between November and December, compared with a rise of 0.8p a litre in the same period a year earlier. The cost of air and sea travel rose less than it did a year earlier, which also contributed to the fall in inflation. Clothing and footwear prices fell 0.9% in the year to December as retailers slashed prices in a bid to win customers over the crucial festive trading season. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: \u201cInflation eased mainly due to a big fall in petrol, with oil prices tumbling in recent months. Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year. These were partially offset by small rises in hotel prices and mobile phone charges.\u201d The easing of consumer price rises in December took the inflation rate to just a touch above the Bank of England\u2019s official target of 2%, giving policymakers breathing space to consider Brexit developments before making a move on interest rates. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith inflation within a whisker of its 2% target, the [Bank\u2019s rate-setting] monetary policy committee will probably feel comfortable in waiting until Brexit uncertainty is resolved before moving again.\u201d The Bank of England has raised interest rates just twice since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, once in November 2017 and again in August 2018, taking the benchmark cost of borrowing to 0.75%. The drop in inflation \u2013 in line with economists\u2019 forecasts \u2013 provides welcome relief for consumers, hit by higher prices in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote as the sharp fall in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation peaked at 3.1% in November 2017, well above average wage increases of 2.3% at the time. Pay growth is now back above inflation, at 3%, but surveys have indicated that consumers are taking a more cautious approach to spending as they are uncertain about what impact Brexit will have on household finances. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said inflation was likely to fall further as a result of lower oil prices and Ofgem\u2019s price cap, which is expected to put some downward pressure on domestic energy prices from January. Archer said: \u201cConsumer price inflation could dip below 2% in January and stay below that level for much if not all of 2019. We see inflation averaging 1.8% over 2019, and it could get as low as 1.6%.\u201d",

I\u2019ve always wanted to write anything that I was either asked to, or wanted to write.\u201d</p> <p>With nearly 200 works to his credit, covering every genre, his catalogue was far from limited, with oratorios \u2013 including Wings of Faith (2003), An English Requiem (for the 2010 Three Choirs festival) and St Mark Passion (2016) \u2013 songs, and song cycles. Instrumental works included organ music, three symphonies, a sinfonietta and five concertos (one apiece for violin, piano, bassoon, cello and oboe).</p> <p>He also produced other orchestral works, four string quartets, a string trio, piano trio, octet and three piano sonatas, recorded by his friend John McCabe. Every composition was impeccably crafted and easily assimilated by virtue of his expert writing for voices or instruments.</p> <p>There were also eight operas, or nine counting the two distinct versions of his last, Jane Eyre. Composed in 1987-97 in three acts, it was recast in 2014-15, with much of the discarded music reworked as his Symphony No 3, completed in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f4fe8f7ff6d247f9a7af3f55a4fdbc8f316b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f4fe8f7ff6d247f9a7af3f55a4fdbc8f316b31/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"April Frederick performs Jane Eyre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The most famous of Joubert\u2019s 80 recordings was the reworked Jane Eyre (2016), featuring April Fredrick, pictured, as Jane and the English Symphony Orchestra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Robertson/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the more than 80 recordings devoted to Joubert, or featuring at least one of his works, the most celebrated is of <a href=\"https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/joubert-jane-eyre\" title=\"\">the revised opera</a> <a href=\"https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/joubert-jane-eyre\" title=\"\">premiere</a> in Birmingham in October 2016. It features April Fredrick as Jane and the English Symphony Orchestra conducted by Kenneth Woods.</p> <p>Joubert\u2019s third opera, Silas Marner, based on the novel by George Eliot, was intended to form part of the 50th anniversary celebrations in 1960 for the Union of South Africa. After the festival organisers found it to be unsuitable \u2013 presumably because of its subject matter \u2013 it was mounted at the University of Cape Town and hailed by the press as the first full-length opera by a South African composer. But although Joubert is the most distinguished classical composer to have come out of the country, he took British citizenship when he left after this first return visit. </p> <p>Born in Cape Town, John had Huguenot ancestry on the side of his father, a clerk, and Dutch on his mother\u2019s side. She had studied the piano with Harriet Cohen in London. His own outlook was English by virtue of his education, at the Anglican Diocesan college, Bishops, in Cape Town, run on English public school lines.</p> <p>While still a schoolboy he studied at the South African College of Music, part of the University of Cape Town, with its retired principal WH Bell, a pupil in Britain of Frederick Corder, who also taught Arnold Bax and Granville Bantock. <a href=\"http://www.sacomposers.co.za/sacomposers/Joubert,_John.html\" title=\"\">Joubert graduated from both school and the SACM in 1944</a>, and continued to study with Bell privately, having flirted with the idea of becoming a writer or an artist.</p> <p>The Cape Town municipal orchestra played some of his earliest compositions, and in 1946 he was given a Performing Rights Society scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. There his teachers included Alan Bush, Howard Ferguson and Theodore Holland. </p> <p>In 1950 he graduated with a BMus from Durham University, started lecturing at Hull and had his First String Quartet published by Novello, which remained his principal publishers. In 1962 he moved to Birmingham University as a senior lecturer, later reader, in music, retiring in 1986 to devote himself to composition. He was appointed visiting professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand (1979), and was composer-in-residence at the Peterborough Cathedral (1990) and Presteigne (1997) festivals.</p> <p>In 1951 he married Mary Litherland, having met her as a piano student at the Royal Academy. She became a music teacher, and Torches, based on a Galician carol, was written for her pupils.</p> <p>She survives him along with their daughter, Anna, a cellist, son, Pierre, a violinist, and four grandchildren, Matthew, John, Naomi and Alexander.</p> <p>\u2022 John Pierre Herman Joubert, composer, born 20 March 1927; died 7 January 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the years following the composer John Joubert\u2019s arrival in Britain from South Africa, he produced such staples of the Anglican choral repertoire as the carols Torches (1951) and There is No Rose of Such Virtue (1954), and the anthem O Lorde, the Maker of Al Thing (1952). But he did not forget his roots, whether in his abortive operatic project based on Alan Paton\u2019s Cry, The Beloved Country; his powerful single-movement Symphony No 2 (1970), inscribed to the memory of the victims of the Sharpeville massacre of a decade earlier; or the suite South of the Line (1985), where he set five anti-Boer war poems by Thomas Hardy for chorus and percussion. In his orchestral fantasia D\u00e9ploration (1978), marking the death of Benjamin Britten two years earlier, he commemorated a composer similarly taken up with war and cruelty, with the Last Post hauntingly stalking the closing pages. Joubert, who has died aged 91, once commented: \u201cI\u2019ve never really wanted to be pigeonholed as a composer. I\u2019ve always wanted to write anything that I was either asked to, or wanted to write.\u201d With nearly 200 works to his credit, covering every genre, his catalogue was far from limited, with oratorios \u2013 including Wings of Faith (2003), An English Requiem (for the 2010 Three Choirs festival) and St Mark Passion (2016) \u2013 songs, and song cycles. Instrumental works included organ music, three symphonies, a sinfonietta and five concertos (one apiece for violin, piano, bassoon, cello and oboe). He also produced other orchestral works, four string quartets, a string trio, piano trio, octet and three piano sonatas, recorded by his friend John McCabe. Every composition was impeccably crafted and easily assimilated by virtue of his expert writing for voices or instruments. There were also eight operas, or nine counting the two distinct versions of his last, Jane Eyre. Composed in 1987-97 in three acts, it was recast in 2014-15, with much of the discarded music reworked as his Symphony No 3, completed in 2017. Of the more than 80 recordings devoted to Joubert, or featuring at least one of his works, the most celebrated is of the revised opera premiere in Birmingham in October 2016. It features April Fredrick as Jane and the English Symphony Orchestra conducted by Kenneth Woods. Joubert\u2019s third opera, Silas Marner, based on the novel by George Eliot, was intended to form part of the 50th anniversary celebrations in 1960 for the Union of South Africa. After the festival organisers found it to be unsuitable \u2013 presumably because of its subject matter \u2013 it was mounted at the University of Cape Town and hailed by the press as the first full-length opera by a South African composer. But although Joubert is the most distinguished classical composer to have come out of the country, he took British citizenship when he left after this first return visit. Born in Cape Town, John had Huguenot ancestry on the side of his father, a clerk, and Dutch on his mother\u2019s side. She had studied the piano with Harriet Cohen in London. His own outlook was English by virtue of his education, at the Anglican Diocesan college, Bishops, in Cape Town, run on English public school lines. While still a schoolboy he studied at the South African College of Music, part of the University of Cape Town, with its retired principal WH Bell, a pupil in Britain of Frederick Corder, who also taught Arnold Bax and Granville Bantock. Joubert graduated from both school and the SACM in 1944, and continued to study with Bell privately, having flirted with the idea of becoming a writer or an artist. The Cape Town municipal orchestra played some of his earliest compositions, and in 1946 he was given a Performing Rights Society scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. There his teachers included Alan Bush, Howard Ferguson and Theodore Holland. In 1950 he graduated with a BMus from Durham University, started lecturing at Hull and had his First String Quartet published by Novello, which remained his principal publishers. In 1962 he moved to Birmingham University as a senior lecturer, later reader, in music, retiring in 1986 to devote himself to composition. He was appointed visiting professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand (1979), and was composer-in-residence at the Peterborough Cathedral (1990) and Presteigne (1997) festivals. In 1951 he married Mary Litherland, having met her as a piano student at the Royal Academy. She became a music teacher, and Torches, based on a Galician carol, was written for her pupils. She survives him along with their daughter, Anna, a cellist, son, Pierre, a violinist, and four grandchildren, Matthew, John, Naomi and Alexander. \u2022 John Pierre Herman Joubert, composer, born 20 March 1927; died 7 January 2019",

      "bodyText": "The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has asked Donald Trump to delay, or deliver in writing, his State of the Union address scheduled for 29 January as long as the government remains partially shut down. The request came as the record-long shutdown dragged into a 26th day with little sign of progress. In a letter to the president, Pelosi said the US Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security, both of which are responsible for coordinating and implementing security at the event, have been \u201chamstrung\u201d by the funding lapses. \u201cSadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to Congress on January 29,\u201d Pelosi wrote in the letter. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Republicans accused Pelosi of playing politics with the address, which, should it proceed without a funding resolution, could be the first time a president has delivered a State of the Union while parts of the government remained closed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a security issue,\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s politics and she knows it.\u201d It was unclear on Wednesday afternoon what would happen if Trump rejected Pelosi\u2019s request to reschedule the speech or submit it in writing. The address to a joint session of Congress gathers leaders from all three branches of government in the House chamber. With so many officials in one room, the event takes weeks to coordinate and involves law enforcement agencies at the local, state and federal level. Traditionally, one member of the cabinet is selected to be the \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d and does not attend in the event a catastrophe incapacitates the president, vice-president and all other officials in the line of succession. \u201cBoth the US Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security have not been funded for 26 days now \u2013 with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs,\u201d Pelosi wrote. Although George Washington and John Adams delivered the State of the Union in person, presidents for over a century delivered it via writing. It wasn\u2019t until 1913 that President Woodrow Wilson began the practice of delivering a speech to Congress as a way of rallying the nation behind his agenda. The last time a president delivered the State of the Union in writing was in 1981 when Jimmy Carter did so days before Ronald Reagan took office. Hours after she was elected speaker on 3 January, Pelosi invited Trump to deliver his speech to a joint session of Congress on 29 January. Since then, the shutdown has stretched into a fourth week while the White House is warning that the funding lapse could have a sustained negative impact on economic growth as nearly 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without pay. Trump has demanded that Democrats, newly empowered in the House of Representatives, designate $5.7bn to build a wall along the southern border as part of legislation to fund the government.

Through our open windows we heard shouts of: \u201cGo back to where you come from!\u201d This was followed by a commotion, and then gunshots and then death grunts. My daughter was standing by the window looking outside \u2013 I crawled to her yelling at her to get on her stomach \u2013 and then I woke up relieved.</p> \n<p>And then I read about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/nairobi-kenya-gunfire-hotel-complex-dusitd2\" title=\"\">attack in Nairobi at the Dusit hotel</a> in which at least 14 people were killed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/16/briton-victims-nairobi-hotel-complex-attack-kenya\">Briton and American among dead in Nairobi hotel attack</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>My family and I had been planning to stay at the Dusit hotel next month when they come to visit me in Kenya. It is where we stayed last year and where the winners and organisers of the Mabati-Cornell Kiswahili prize for African Literature stayed in 2016. The shop where my daughter and wife had dresses hand-tailored is just a few doors down from Dusit.</p> \n<p>I feel upset and helpless not so much because I think the attack could have happened when we were there, it is more the randomness of it all. Anyone could die, the timing does not belong to us, it belongs to the terrorist. It is this indiscriminate nature of terror that, well, terrifies me.</p> \n<p>And that is the point. Unlike revolutionary movements that used violence to achieve specific attainable political goals, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a> terror is for terror\u2019s sake. Where South Africa\u2019s Nelson Mandela-led ANC had the all-inclusive and progressive freedom charter, al-Shabaab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram\" title=\"\">Boko Haram</a> or the Islamic State have vague proclamations and edicts.

      "bodyText": "A few nights ago I had a nightmare \u2013 my family and I were living on the seventh floor of an apartment building in a US city that I could not name. It was a hot summer night. Through our open windows we heard shouts of: \u201cGo back to where you come from!\u201d This was followed by a commotion, and then gunshots and then death grunts. My daughter was standing by the window looking outside \u2013 I crawled to her yelling at her to get on her stomach \u2013 and then I woke up relieved. And then I read about the attack in Nairobi at the Dusit hotel in which at least 14 people were killed. My family and I had been planning to stay at the Dusit hotel next month when they come to visit me in Kenya. It is where we stayed last year and where the winners and organisers of the Mabati-Cornell Kiswahili prize for African Literature stayed in 2016. The shop where my daughter and wife had dresses hand-tailored is just a few doors down from Dusit. I feel upset and helpless not so much because I think the attack could have happened when we were there, it is more the randomness of it all. Anyone could die, the timing does not belong to us, it belongs to the terrorist. It is this indiscriminate nature of terror that, well, terrifies me. And that is the point. Unlike revolutionary movements that used violence to achieve specific attainable political goals, for al-Shabaab terror is for terror\u2019s sake. Where South Africa\u2019s Nelson Mandela-led ANC had the all-inclusive and progressive freedom charter, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram or the Islamic State have vague proclamations and edicts. They are most erudite when speaking of violence \u2013 think of those well-produced Isis videos of torture and death. But I also think about the videos released by the Pentagon of pretty, blue-green flare lights over Baghdad \u2013 the death and devastation below unseen \u2013 or the recent US army tweet during the New Year\u2019s Eve ball that read: \u201cIf ever needed, we are #ready to drop something much, much bigger.\u201d Think of what a US drone strike on a wedding party, for example, does to the bodies of women, children and men, and the mental and physical trauma it inflicts on the survivors. Think of the Israeli Defense Force and the ongoing attacks on protesting unarmed Palestinians that have left 214 Palestinians dead and a staggering 18,000 wounded. Watch this New York Times investigative piece on the killing of a nurse who was out in the protests to help the wounded and decide for yourself who has the monopoly on violence and terror. To eradicate group terrorism we have to get rid of the state terrorism that feeds stateless terror organisations in the first place. I don\u2019t see any other way around this. Writing for the Guardian in 2013 shortly after the Nairobi Westgate Mall attack that left 71 dead, I argued that al-Shabaab was the creation, in part, of the Ethiopian and US governments. There was a small window of hope when Somalia had started reconstituting itself under the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) after the fall of the western-sponsored dictator Siad Barre and the anarchy that ensued. But the idea of an Islamic government was too much and the US-sanctioned Ethiopian attack in 2006 on the ICU splintered it, with radical and radicalised elements forming al-Shabaab. After the 2013 Westgate Mall attack, the Kenyan government went on to do everything it should not have done. Kenyan Somalis became the enemy and were herded into soccer fields, concentration camps by another name. But earlier, in 2011, the Kenya Defense Force had invaded Somalia, ostensibly because al Shabaab had been kidnaping tourists and NGO workers. Never mind that we as a people have yet to fully atone for the 1980 Garissa and the 1984 Wagalla massacres that left thousands of Kenyan Somalis dead. Writing six years later about the same city, very little has changed. There is a certain feeling of vulnerability and loss of control that makes terror urgent and personal. We need to take the long view of history if any solution is to come about.

      "body": "<p>One Saturday last May, Shane Heath woke up with an idea: the young serial entrepreneur would market the drink he had been sharing with friends in Venice Beach \u2013 a muddy concoction of tea, cocoa, spices and four kinds of mushrooms \u2013 to the wider world. \u201cOver the weekend I designed the brand, ordered a minimal amount of inventory, and put up a website,\u201d says Heath. By Tuesday, he was online selling 15-serving tins of the dry drink mix he dubbed Mud\\Wtr for $30 each. Six months later, revenues exceeded six figures, he says, and with the start of the new year, \u201cwe secured a million-dollar investment fund and moved into an office in Los Angeles\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9a52dc59dc477797b8f462b6a914386060f717dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a52dc59dc477797b8f462b6a914386060f717dc/0_0_500_757/330.jpg\" alt=\"Shane Heath of Mud/Wtr mushroom drink company\" width=\"330\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shane Heath of Mud\\Wtr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mud/Wtr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mushrooms are having a moment. And the market goes far beyond the portobellos, shiitakes and button mushrooms you find in the produce section. Whole Foods named so-called \u201cfunctional mushrooms\u201d, used for centuries in traditional medicine, as one of the top 10 food trends of 2018. Suddenly, exotic varieties such as reishi, chaga, cordyceps and lion\u2019s mane are turning up in everything from powders and extracts to coffees, teas, smoothies, broths, chocolates, face creams and shower gels.<br><br>US sales of mushrooms accounted for nearly $5bn in revenue in 2017, according to the market research firm Grand View Research, and the market is projected to rise to $7.4bn in the next three years.</p> <p>Heath freely admits that the draw is not so much the earthy flavor, but the idea that consuming mushrooms will make you feel and perform better. According to the Mud\\Wtr website, <a href=\"https://www.mudwtr.com/\">chaga mushrooms \u201cprovide energy and mood enhancement\u201d, </a>cordyceps \u201cincrease vitality and endurance\u201d, lion\u2019s mane \u201cimprove brain function\u201d and reishi \u201cfight off tumor and cancer growth\u201d.</p> <p>Mud\\Wtr joins scores of other companies selling products that tout mushrooms as a magic elixir. Dried mushroom powders from Om Mushrooms, for example, have \u201canti-aging properties to retain your youthful vibrance\u201d and \u201charmonize your longevity, energy and spirit\u201d. Moon Juice promotes Brain Dust, featured on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s website Goop, as \u201cedible intelligence\u201d that will \u201chelp combat the effects of stress to align you with the cosmic flow for great achievement\u201d.</p> <p>Some won\u2019t be surprised to learn that even Alex Jones has discovered mushrooms.

(Chaga, for example, has the taste and texture of tree bark.) But from a nutritional standpoint, the varieties we commonly nibble on and cook with are quite good for you. Edible mushrooms are low in calories (one cup of raw sliced white mushrooms is only 16 calories), rich in protein and fiber, and a good source of B vitamins as well as minerals such as potassium, copper and selenium.</p> <p>Mushrooms also contain unusually high amounts of the antioxidants ergothioneine and glutathione, according to a 2017 study conducted at Pennsylvania State University published in the journal Food Chemistry. Antioxidants are known for protecting cells from damage associated with diseases such as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.<br><br>And mushrooms do have at least one \u201cmagic\u201d property: like people (and unlike plants) they can convert ultraviolet light from the sun into vitamin D. Outside of a few types of fatty fish and fortified dairy products, mushrooms are one of the only good dietary sources of the essential vitamin.</p> <p>The catch is that commercial farms often grow mushrooms inside says Katherine Phillips, PhD, a senior research scientist at Virginia Tech University. She was a co-author on a study for the US Department of Agriculture that found that the mushrooms Americans commonly buy at the grocery store often contain little vitamin D.</p> <p>You can buy mushrooms labelled \u201cvitamin D enriched\u201d, which indicates that they were exposed to ultraviolet light, but those often cost more, says Phillips. Instead, she suggests going the DIY route: \u201cOur research found that setting sliced mushrooms outside on aluminum foil for as little as 15 minutes enhances the vitamin D content by at least 25%,\u201d she says. If you use whole mushrooms, she advises laying them gills up, where the concentration of D-producing compounds are highest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"38f05a17f1a9d2a70a70d13e138e3b84c8ab941b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38f05a17f1a9d2a70a70d13e138e3b84c8ab941b/0_0_2535_3810/665.jpg\" alt=\"Harvesting edible funghi in skelghyll woods, Ambleside, Lake district, UK\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harvesting edible fungi in skelghyll woods, Ambleside, Lake District, UK.

The Greek physician Hippocrates identified the amadou mushroom as good for reducing inflammation and cauterizing wounds around 450 BCE. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, preserved in the Italian alps for some 5,300 years, was discovered with whipworm eggs in his digestive tract and, probably not coincidentally, a leather strap around his neck threaded with mushrooms that are known to kill intestinal parasites.</p> <p>Chinese medical texts dating back to as early as 206BC describe reishi as a tonic against ageing. Widespread use of medicinal mushrooms continues in Asia today, with more than 100 varieties used just to treat cancer.</p> <p>You need only look to the psychoactive effects of hallucinogenic mushrooms and the toxicity of poisonous varieties to understand that mushrooms can have potent biochemical effects says David Hibbett, PhD., a mycologist (mushroom expert) and professor of biology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cMushrooms produce a lot of interesting chemical compounds that could be defensive,\u201d he says, and that might be useful for fending off bacteria and other bodily invaders that make us sick. \u201cFungi produce some of our most important drugs,\u201d says Hibbett, pointing out that both penicillin and cholesterol-lowering statins were derived from fungi, the category of organisms that includes mushrooms.</p> <p>One of the best-studied types of medicinal mushroom is turkey tail, so named because it grows in autumn-color rings resembling feathers. Studies in humans and animals suggest that a component of turkey tail, polysaccharide-K (PSK), may stimulate the immune system. In clinical trials, the supplement appeared to improve survival for people with gastric or colon cancer and, although the evidence is not as strong, may also benefit those with other types of cancer.</p> <p>Several clinical trials show that a similar compound, lentinan, extracted from shiitake mushrooms, extends survival in patients with stomach, prostate, colorectal and liver cancers when combined with chemotherapy. Both PSK and lentinan are approved in Japan as an addition to conventional therapies for treating cancer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33f61c3f81b15805b49a94ee13991840a0d23eb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33f61c3f81b15805b49a94ee13991840a0d23eb9/0_0_3270_2184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A local buyer in Western China weighs a pile of caterpillar fungus, also known as Cordyceps sinensis, a traditional Tibetan medicine now popular in China and across the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A local buyer in western China weighs a pile of caterpillar fungus, also known as Cordyceps sinensis, a traditional Tibetan medicine now popular in China and across the world.

      "bodyText": "One Saturday last May, Shane Heath woke up with an idea: the young serial entrepreneur would market the drink he had been sharing with friends in Venice Beach \u2013 a muddy concoction of tea, cocoa, spices and four kinds of mushrooms \u2013 to the wider world. \u201cOver the weekend I designed the brand, ordered a minimal amount of inventory, and put up a website,\u201d says Heath. By Tuesday, he was online selling 15-serving tins of the dry drink mix he dubbed Mud\\Wtr for $30 each. Six months later, revenues exceeded six figures, he says, and with the start of the new year, \u201cwe secured a million-dollar investment fund and moved into an office in Los Angeles\u201d. Mushrooms are having a moment. And the market goes far beyond the portobellos, shiitakes and button mushrooms you find in the produce section. Whole Foods named so-called \u201cfunctional mushrooms\u201d, used for centuries in traditional medicine, as one of the top 10 food trends of 2018. Suddenly, exotic varieties such as reishi, chaga, cordyceps and lion\u2019s mane are turning up in everything from powders and extracts to coffees, teas, smoothies, broths, chocolates, face creams and shower gels. US sales of mushrooms accounted for nearly $5bn in revenue in 2017, according to the market research firm Grand View Research, and the market is projected to rise to $7.4bn in the next three years. Heath freely admits that the draw is not so much the earthy flavor, but the idea that consuming mushrooms will make you feel and perform better. According to the Mud\\Wtr website, chaga mushrooms \u201cprovide energy and mood enhancement\u201d, cordyceps \u201cincrease vitality and endurance\u201d, lion\u2019s mane \u201cimprove brain function\u201d and reishi \u201cfight off tumor and cancer growth\u201d. Mud\\Wtr joins scores of other companies selling products that tout mushrooms as a magic elixir. Dried mushroom powders from Om Mushrooms, for example, have \u201canti-aging properties to retain your youthful vibrance\u201d and \u201charmonize your longevity, energy and spirit\u201d. Moon Juice promotes Brain Dust, featured on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s website Goop, as \u201cedible intelligence\u201d that will \u201chelp combat the effects of stress to align you with the cosmic flow for great achievement\u201d. Some won\u2019t be surprised to learn that even Alex Jones has discovered mushrooms. His infamous Infowars website sells Wake Up America: Immune Support Blend coffee infused with mushroom extracts celebrated for \u201cenhancing immune response and physical stamina\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that some of these compounds have got really remarkable properties,\u201d says Nicholas Money, PhD., biology professor at Miami University in Ohio. But his 2016 review of the evidence published in the journal Fungal Biology found that marketing claims go far beyond what is supported by the science. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are making a great deal of money from compounds of unspecified chemical nature without experimental evidence to show that they have any benefit.\u201d Magic shrooms Mushrooms traditionally associated with medicinal properties are not always tasty on their own. (Chaga, for example, has the taste and texture of tree bark.) But from a nutritional standpoint, the varieties we commonly nibble on and cook with are quite good for you. Edible mushrooms are low in calories (one cup of raw sliced white mushrooms is only 16 calories), rich in protein and fiber, and a good source of B vitamins as well as minerals such as potassium, copper and selenium. Mushrooms also contain unusually high amounts of the antioxidants ergothioneine and glutathione, according to a 2017 study conducted at Pennsylvania State University published in the journal Food Chemistry. Antioxidants are known for protecting cells from damage associated with diseases such as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s. And mushrooms do have at least one \u201cmagic\u201d property: like people (and unlike plants) they can convert ultraviolet light from the sun into vitamin D. Outside of a few types of fatty fish and fortified dairy products, mushrooms are one of the only good dietary sources of the essential vitamin. The catch is that commercial farms often grow mushrooms inside says Katherine Phillips, PhD, a senior research scientist at Virginia Tech University. She was a co-author on a study for the US Department of Agriculture that found that the mushrooms Americans commonly buy at the grocery store often contain little vitamin D. You can buy mushrooms labelled \u201cvitamin D enriched\u201d, which indicates that they were exposed to ultraviolet light, but those often cost more, says Phillips. Instead, she suggests going the DIY route: \u201cOur research found that setting sliced mushrooms outside on aluminum foil for as little as 15 minutes enhances the vitamin D content by at least 25%,\u201d she says. If you use whole mushrooms, she advises laying them gills up, where the concentration of D-producing compounds are highest. Mushrooms as medicine? In addition to eating mushrooms, cultures around the world have used them medicinally for thousands of years. The Greek physician Hippocrates identified the amadou mushroom as good for reducing inflammation and cauterizing wounds around 450 BCE. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, preserved in the Italian alps for some 5,300 years, was discovered with whipworm eggs in his digestive tract and, probably not coincidentally, a leather strap around his neck threaded with mushrooms that are known to kill intestinal parasites. Chinese medical texts dating back to as early as 206BC describe reishi as a tonic against ageing. Widespread use of medicinal mushrooms continues in Asia today, with more than 100 varieties used just to treat cancer. You need only look to the psychoactive effects of hallucinogenic mushrooms and the toxicity of poisonous varieties to understand that mushrooms can have potent biochemical effects says David Hibbett, PhD., a mycologist (mushroom expert) and professor of biology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cMushrooms produce a lot of interesting chemical compounds that could be defensive,\u201d he says, and that might be useful for fending off bacteria and other bodily invaders that make us sick. \u201cFungi produce some of our most important drugs,\u201d says Hibbett, pointing out that both penicillin and cholesterol-lowering statins were derived from fungi, the category of organisms that includes mushrooms. One of the best-studied types of medicinal mushroom is turkey tail, so named because it grows in autumn-color rings resembling feathers. Studies in humans and animals suggest that a component of turkey tail, polysaccharide-K (PSK), may stimulate the immune system. In clinical trials, the supplement appeared to improve survival for people with gastric or colon cancer and, although the evidence is not as strong, may also benefit those with other types of cancer. Several clinical trials show that a similar compound, lentinan, extracted from shiitake mushrooms, extends survival in patients with stomach, prostate, colorectal and liver cancers when combined with chemotherapy. Both PSK and lentinan are approved in Japan as an addition to conventional therapies for treating cancer. Other varieties show promise, but for the most part research has not progressed beyond test tubes and animal studies.

Members opposed the deal for a number of reasons, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/brexit-what-is-the-uks-backstop-proposal\">Irish backstop agreement</a> and the continued role of the European court of justice.</p> <p>The party was organised on Tuesday, with invitations sent via a WhatsApp group and by text, one source said. MPs were invited to Rees-Mogg\u2019s six-bedroom family home, which is a five-minute walk from the Palace of Westminster.</p> <p>Those who attended were greeted with a flute of champagne at the door, and said they felt a \u201cwave of relief\u201d following the rejection of May\u2019s deal.</p> <p>One person said: \u201cJacob has held quite a few events at his home following big votes because it is a convenient venue not far from the Palace of Westminster. It was organised at the last minute so there were were no canapes or nibbles, but his wife was a wonderful host.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the people there were pleased to have rejected the deal, and some were enjoying a drink, but they were mostly relieved to have done the deed of voting down the PM\u2019s deal. In life you sometimes have to do the difficult thing even if it is hard.\u201d</p> <p>The party occasionally spilled out on to the street, onlookers said. When asked to identify what they were drinking, one partygoer said: \u201cChampagne, of course.\u201d</p> <p>While Rees-Mogg and the former Welsh secretary Sir John Redwood denied the event was a celebration, the veteran Brexiter Sir Bill Cash did not. \u201cIt was a party and a celebration,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another partygoer said Hoey, who would be banned from joining the ERG for not being a Tory, was the only Labour MP spotted at the event. Members of the Democratic Unionist party were not present but had attended other Rees-Mogg parties, sources said.</p> <p>Johnson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/boris-johnson-resigns-as-foreign-secretary-brexit\">resigned as foreign secretary in July</a> over May\u2019s deal, arrived at the party on a bicycle with the lights turned off and his head bowed. The former foreign secretary left the party after an hour, saying to a waiting journalist that he had not had a drink at the event.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the ERG pledged to support May to vote down Labour\u2019s vote of no confidence. Privately, some of its members expressed anger at May\u2019s reluctance to move towards a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The former Tory minister Mark Francois, who briefly attended the event, told the BBC the mood at gathering was positive after the vote.</p> <p>\u201cObviously we were pleased because we had worked for a long while to defeat this document. The British people voted clearly to leave the European Union so we are trying to honour the instruction that they gave us as members of parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Others were less complimentary about the gathering. \u201cJacob Rees Mogg and the Tory Party have plunged the country into crisis over Brexit so this champagne popping party goes to show how out of touch the Tories are,\u201d said Labour MP Rupa Huq. </p> <p>\u201cWhile Jacob Rees Mogg sips champagne, Britain is drawing ever closer to a dangerous no-deal exit from the European Union. This must be stopped.\u201d</p> <p><br><br></p>",

David Davis, the minister in charge of the Brexit deal for two years until July, the Labour MP Kate Hoey, the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, and Boris Johnson were among more than 30 MPs invited to the grade II-listed home of Rees-Mogg, who chairs the hardline European Research Group (ERG). The gathering was held less than two hours after members of the group helped reject Theresa May\u2019s deal by a majority of 230. Some MPs questioned whether it was appropriate to hold such a party while Britain still had no clear plan for dealing with Brexit. The Conservative MP Rees-Mogg and the ERG have been instrumental in coordinating pro-Brexit MPs against the prime minister\u2019s deal. Members opposed the deal for a number of reasons, including the Irish backstop agreement and the continued role of the European court of justice. The party was organised on Tuesday, with invitations sent via a WhatsApp group and by text, one source said. MPs were invited to Rees-Mogg\u2019s six-bedroom family home, which is a five-minute walk from the Palace of Westminster. Those who attended were greeted with a flute of champagne at the door, and said they felt a \u201cwave of relief\u201d following the rejection of May\u2019s deal. One person said: \u201cJacob has held quite a few events at his home following big votes because it is a convenient venue not far from the Palace of Westminster. It was organised at the last minute so there were were no canapes or nibbles, but his wife was a wonderful host. \u201cOf course the people there were pleased to have rejected the deal, and some were enjoying a drink, but they were mostly relieved to have done the deed of voting down the PM\u2019s deal. In life you sometimes have to do the difficult thing even if it is hard.\u201d The party occasionally spilled out on to the street, onlookers said. When asked to identify what they were drinking, one partygoer said: \u201cChampagne, of course.\u201d While Rees-Mogg and the former Welsh secretary Sir John Redwood denied the event was a celebration, the veteran Brexiter Sir Bill Cash did not. \u201cIt was a party and a celebration,\u201d he said. Another partygoer said Hoey, who would be banned from joining the ERG for not being a Tory, was the only Labour MP spotted at the event. Members of the Democratic Unionist party were not present but had attended other Rees-Mogg parties, sources said. Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary in July over May\u2019s deal, arrived at the party on a bicycle with the lights turned off and his head bowed. The former foreign secretary left the party after an hour, saying to a waiting journalist that he had not had a drink at the event. On Wednesday, the ERG pledged to support May to vote down Labour\u2019s vote of no confidence. Privately, some of its members expressed anger at May\u2019s reluctance to move towards a hard Brexit. The former Tory minister Mark Francois, who briefly attended the event, told the BBC the mood at gathering was positive after the vote. \u201cObviously we were pleased because we had worked for a long while to defeat this document. The British people voted clearly to leave the European Union so we are trying to honour the instruction that they gave us as members of parliament.\u201d Others were less complimentary about the gathering. \u201cJacob Rees Mogg and the Tory Party have plunged the country into crisis over Brexit so this champagne popping party goes to show how out of touch the Tories are,\u201d said Labour MP Rupa Huq. \u201cWhile Jacob Rees Mogg sips champagne, Britain is drawing ever closer to a dangerous no-deal exit from the European Union. This must be stopped.\u201d",

We get 1,000 most days and 3,700 for the derby at North Sydney. We choose grounds that have great wickets to play on, which is obviously really important for the game, but that are also great from a fan engagement point of view.\u201d</p> <p>That engagement and creating the matchday experience is where the WBBL has really been able to set itself apart from its male counterpart. While casual fans may be driven to the excitement, pyrotechnics and loud music of a BBL match, many cricket fans prefer a more mellow vibe and the WBBL offers that. With its summer afternoon matches in suburban grounds full of picnic blankets on lush green hills, kids starting up their own mini-matches around the perimeter and old-fashioned canteens serving sausage sandwiches, it\u2019s a far cry from the modern sporting experience.

Her achievement is incredible considering the men\u2019s competition began four seasons before the women\u2019s and her runs have come from only 58 innings. This season has also been the all-rounder\u2019s best with the ball, taking nine wickets so far, four more than she did in the 2017-18 season.</p> <p>And while Perry\u2019s form has been attracting the most media attention, there has been no shortage of excellence throughout the competition. Perry\u2019s teammate Alyssa Healy, as well as the Adelaide Strikers pair of Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates, have also been piling on the runs. The Perth Scorchers\u2019 Heather Graham has taken 22 wickets across her 14 games this season, while three wicketkeepers \u2013 Healy, the Hobart Hurricanes\u2019 Georgia Redmayne and the Brisbane Heat\u2019s Beth Mooney all sit at 15 dismissals.</p> <p>With the competition pumping out both excellence and nostalgic summer picnics in equal measures, the introduction of the standalone season looks like it will be just what is needed to boost the WBBL to new heights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/22/2018-womens-sport-leads-the-way-in-a-landmark-year\">2018: women's sport leads the way in a landmark year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hawkins agrees, but is aware of the challenges that lay ahead with bringing the competition forward, out of the school holidays and summer break.</p> <p>\u201cIn Sydney we know that people don\u2019t think really about cricket until the Test rolls around, she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be some behavioural change that we\u2019re going to need to drive. But we\u2019ve built some really good will around the WBBL that I think people will naturally come with us. It\u2019s a really exciting opportunity for us to see how it builds over the next five years and what it\u2019s going to become.

It was a fraught decision and the new direction taken could have gone either way, but Sixers general manager, Jodie Hawkins is certain it was the right one for her team. \u201cWe thought it was time for to charge for an elite level product,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been great interest in it as a free-of-charge product, but people expect to pay for quality entertainment and we felt that it was time that the WBBL received that recognition.\u201d Most pleasingly for Hawkins has been the reaction of the public. \u201cWe\u2019ve had zero negative feedback on charging for tickets,\u201d she said. \u201cThe feedback we\u2019ve received has all been really positive and people have shown that by their attendance. We get 1,000 most days and 3,700 for the derby at North Sydney. We choose grounds that have great wickets to play on, which is obviously really important for the game, but that are also great from a fan engagement point of view.\u201d That engagement and creating the matchday experience is where the WBBL has really been able to set itself apart from its male counterpart. While casual fans may be driven to the excitement, pyrotechnics and loud music of a BBL match, many cricket fans prefer a more mellow vibe and the WBBL offers that. With its summer afternoon matches in suburban grounds full of picnic blankets on lush green hills, kids starting up their own mini-matches around the perimeter and old-fashioned canteens serving sausage sandwiches, it\u2019s a far cry from the modern sporting experience. It\u2019s a perfectly idealised version of cricket watching that older generations are delighting in introducing their children and grandchildren to. But it\u2019s not just the atmosphere that\u2019s turning the heads of the Australian public \u2013 the players have been in fine form as well. Sixers captain Ellyse Perry last weekend became the first Big Bash player (male or female) to reach 2,000 runs. Her achievement is incredible considering the men\u2019s competition began four seasons before the women\u2019s and her runs have come from only 58 innings. This season has also been the all-rounder\u2019s best with the ball, taking nine wickets so far, four more than she did in the 2017-18 season. And while Perry\u2019s form has been attracting the most media attention, there has been no shortage of excellence throughout the competition. Perry\u2019s teammate Alyssa Healy, as well as the Adelaide Strikers pair of Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates, have also been piling on the runs. The Perth Scorchers\u2019 Heather Graham has taken 22 wickets across her 14 games this season, while three wicketkeepers \u2013 Healy, the Hobart Hurricanes\u2019 Georgia Redmayne and the Brisbane Heat\u2019s Beth Mooney all sit at 15 dismissals. With the competition pumping out both excellence and nostalgic summer picnics in equal measures, the introduction of the standalone season looks like it will be just what is needed to boost the WBBL to new heights. Hawkins agrees, but is aware of the challenges that lay ahead with bringing the competition forward, out of the school holidays and summer break. \u201cIn Sydney we know that people don\u2019t think really about cricket until the Test rolls around, she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be some behavioural change that we\u2019re going to need to drive. But we\u2019ve built some really good will around the WBBL that I think people will naturally come with us. It\u2019s a really exciting opportunity for us to see how it builds over the next five years and what it\u2019s going to become. We want it to be the kickstarter of the summer of cricket in this country and it\u2019s the perfect vehicle to do it with.\u201d It\u2019s likely to be an uphill battle, but no doubt one this elite group of athletes is ready for. The opportunity to flourish away from the dramas of the men\u2019s game is integral to the growth of the competition and women\u2019s sport more broadly.",

      "bodyText": "For the past 25 years I\u2019ve been lucky enough to enjoy a spectacular view of Collaroy-Narrabeen beach from my old wooden house tucked into the northern slopes of Mt Ramsay. I survey a gorgeous, curved slice of coast where swell dispatched from the far reaches of the Southern and Pacific oceans reaches a final, spectacular resignation. Collaroy-Narrabeen on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches is arguably as well known for its peerless status in Australian surfing culture as it is the pinup for rising sea levels due to climate change. There cannot be a beach in Australia that has been more studied by experts and fought over by homeowners, beach users and grandstanding politicians than Collaroy-Narrabeen. At 2.6km it\u2019s Sydney\u2019s second-longest stretch of golden sand and pounding surf (Cronulla, at 4.8km is the longest). It\u2019s also classified as the most at-risk beach from erosion in New South Wales and the third most at-risk in the nation. Collaroy takes its name from an 1881 shipwreck. The paddle steamer Collaroy, that plied its trade between Newcastle and Sydney as a passenger vessel, grounded at the end of my street, according records in the State Library of NSW. As for \u201cNarrabeen\u201d, its name is disputed as meaning either \u201csource of fresh water\u201d or \u201cswan\u201d. Camaraigal descendant and historian Dennis Foley, describes the idyllic shores and waterway of Narrabeen Lagoon, \u201cthe heart of our world\u201d before British settlement. Collaroy-Narrabeen is mecca for international surfers. A bucket-list wave. Quick trivia question: which is the only non-American surf spot mentioned in the Beach Boys\u2019 Surfin\u2019 USA? It\u2019s Narra-beyaaan\u2026 There you go. Look it up. (You owe me a chop from your next triumphant meat tray.) World-renowned surfing legends Simon Anderson, Terry Fitzgerald, Nat Young, Damien Hardman, Laura Enever, Mark Warren, Col Smith and Ozzie Wright had their pick of waves along the stretch \u2013 from the powerful beach break at Collaroy to the fabled left-hander at North Narrabeen known as \u201cnorthy\u201d. Surf writer Nick Carroll says: \u201cIt is possible that more surfers learned to pull vertical off-the-lips here than any other surf spot in the world.\u201d Standards and expectations are high and routinely met. Master the hassle at \u201cnorthy\u201d and you\u2019ll survive any competitive break on earth, my surfing husband Brendan Donohoe reckons. He\u2019s been the president of the northern beaches branch of Surfrider Australia since 1999 (also former chair of the board) and through him I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to observe the pitched battles fought over Collaroy-Narrabeen. For those not immersed in surfing culture, the beach is that one in those ubiquitous news pictures of smashed houses, tangled timber and a swimming pool wrenched from its moorings \u2013 all flung to the sand in the wild winter storm of 2016 which swallowed 50m of coastline, 150m of sand and dumped it in the surf zone. The images don\u2019t surprise anyone with a passing local knowledge. Storms have been claiming houses and various bits of the beach\u2019s four surf life saving clubs regularly since the first recorded image of splintered timber in 1920. Ask the old-timers. Question is, can a man-made seawall hold back the tides? One thing is absolutely certain according to coastal scientists worldwide: seawalls protect land property in the short-term but, eventually, destroy beaches. Think of the dunes of a beach as its precious lungs \u2026 breathing in and out with the tides. Sand is accreted, washed away. Breathe in. Breathe out. For the vast swathes of Australia\u2019s uninhabited shoreline it\u2019s a dynamic, natural process. When humans build houses in the dunes or breakwalls and seawalls on beaches and rivers, they harden the coast and its ability to recover naturally.

No comfort to the many thousands of homeowners along Australia\u2019s vast, settled coastline whose precious properties (built in good faith) are now subject to the merciless forces of evermore destructive coastal surges due to climate change. So, what\u2019s the answer? Coastal municipalities have been tackling the problem with a suite of measures.

A search indicates regular access was granted to people seeking their own information until June 2016.</p> <p>That month, social justice advocate Renee Eaves was granted access to her QPrime file.

      "bodyText": "Queensland\u2019s freedom of information watchdog and the state\u2019s police service met quietly last year and agreed citizens should be blocked from accessing their personal data held in a controversial police records system. Guardian Australia can reveal details about a \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d meeting between police and the Office of the Information Commissioner, an independent body that reviews contested information access decisions made by state government agencies. Justice Martin Daubney, the president of the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal, launched an extraordinary criticism of the process when details about the meeting emerged during a recent hearing. \u201c[The meeting is] starting to sound awfully like the police and the [Office of the Information Commissioner] sat down behind closed doors to set matters of policy,\u201d Daubney said. \u201cCan you just sit back and think about how this looks? If it were to be the subject of discussion, I don\u2019t know, on the front page of a metropolitan daily, you know, how would that look? \u201cThere\u2019s this old-fashioned thing called the rules of natural justice and giving people the opportunity to be heard.\u201d Privacy advocates say citizens have a fundamental right to access personal data held by government agencies. Queensland has a set of information privacy principles that require agencies holding personal information to grant individuals access unless they are expressly exempted under law. Police previously granted individuals access to their personal data in the QPrime records system. A search indicates regular access was granted to people seeking their own information until June 2016. That month, social justice advocate Renee Eaves was granted access to her QPrime file. It revealed officers had accessed her records 1,400 times over eight years and sparked ongoing concern about the management and protection of data held by police. Several officers have been charged with computer hacking for conducting unauthorised or irrelevant searches. But most complaints do not result in punishment and concerns remain that audits of the system are retroactive and usually only occur when a complaint is made. Since June 2016, police have routinely refused access to people seeking personal information from QPrime on \u201cpublic interest\u201d grounds. David Vaile, the chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation, said the ability for individuals to access their own information was \u201cone of the few antidotes that can act as a restraint to abuse of power\u201d. \u201cIt may well be this is a policy that\u2019s designed to conceal large-scale problematic breaches of data,\u201d Vaile said, and noted that the policy could prevent crimes committed by police officers from coming to light. Vaile said the meeting between the information regulator and police \u201csounds completely inappropriate\u201d and that any blanket policy to deny access to personal information was \u201cdrifting towards a repressive police state\u201d. Police insisted in a statement that freedom-of-information decisions \u2013 known as \u201cright to information\u201d in Queensland \u2013 were still made on an individual basis and that \u201cthere is no blanket refusal\u201d. In the same statement police said they had conducted a review and \u201cformed the view that disclosure of [QPrime activity reports] would likely be contrary to the public interest as it causes significant detriment to the QPS law enforcement activities\u201d. In the tribunal hearing, police lawyer Craig Capper said police had met with the information commissioner to discuss four specific right to information appeals. Capper said police conveyed the view that all QPrime records were \u201ca class of documents that give rise to, and if revealed and if published, would give evidence that could be injurious to the public\u201d. \u201cThere were certainly some discussions that took place in a closed door meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the nature or the breadth of the applications that were being received and the consequences of the breath of those ... we identified there were much broader public policy implications to be considered in terms of what documents get released.\u201d Capper also told the tribunal police \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to acknowledge the existence of any documents\u201d in some cases. Daubney criticised police and the Office of the Information Commissioner for not providing detailed information to support their decision to deny access to QPrime records in a specific case. He also questioned why the applicant had not been informed about the meeting, or given the opportunity to challenge the outcome. \u201cWhen did we lose intellectual rigour in relation to these matters?\u201d Daubney said. \u201cWhen did we lose legal rigour in relation to these matters?\u201d The Office of the Information Commissioner said in a statement it was permitted to \u201cobtain information in any way the information commissioner considers appropriate\u201d. \u201cThe Right to Information Act permits the information commissioner to receive evidence in the absence of the applicant if it is necessary to do so to prevent disclosure of information that is claimed to be exempt. \u201c[The] OIC notes that the Crime and Corruption Commission [has] also issued consistent guidance that reflects relevant obligations for agencies and officers to safeguard personal information held by the agency, including that specifically focused on improper access to public-sector databases.\u201d",

Audience members are treated to spicy lamb biriyani or chick pea and eggplant curry in the foyer, then make their way into purpose-built wooden stadium seating with cushions that fills most of the hall, surrounding a generous, long stage. Up high, right off where the actors enter, three musicians provide a live soundtrack that is joyous and rhythmic, sometimes haunting, with instruments including violin, flute, tabla percussion and a long traditional drum. Young Radha dances in wearing a stunning red and gold sari, a braided hair extension down her back; actor Suryaprakash, who was born in India, was able to draw on her own traditional dancing skills. The ensemble dance in her wake, tossing white flowers from golden pots and woven baskets. Including the musicians, there are 19 performers who come from six countries, mostly with south Asian heritage \u2013 generally India and Sri Lanka \u2013 and speak 11 languages between them. \u201cHaving so many languages in that room is so beautiful,\u201d says Suryaparakash. \u201cYou get such a feeling of place and culture and identity from the rhythms.\u201d Writer Shakthi believes Tamil is a \u201creally performative\u201d language; one word can have different meanings \u201cdepending on the emotion you say it with\u201d. Hence the actors, who sometimes slip into Tamil and Sinhala during the show \u2013 which fellow actors beside the stage immediately translate to English \u2013 add to the musicality. In one scene, a 48-year-old version of Radha (Nadie Kammallaweerra) is confronted by a man raising funds for the guerilla organisation the Tamil Tigers (Rajan Velu), who pushes his way inside her Pendle Hill apartment in western Sydney. He aggressively insists Radha\u2019s son Siddhartha (Shiv Palekar), born in Australia, be sent to Sri Lanka to join the armed struggle. \u201cI\u2019m not Sri Lankan; I\u2019m Australian,\u201d insists Siddhartha, who becomes the focal point of the play\u2019s theme: searching for identity within and between borders. He calls himself \u201cSid\u201d to fit in. Palekar, who was born in India and raised in Hong Kong, relates to his character\u2019s quest for home and belonging. \u201cI was in this full existential spiral when I was 21, Siddhartha\u2019s age, just kind of not knowing anything, having no real anchor to a place,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a foreigner when I go back to India, a foreigner in Hong Kong and a foreigner here.\u201d Siddhartha comes to understand his place in Australia through his Yolngu girlfriend Lily (Rarriwuy Hick). The character was inspired by a conversation Shakthi had with his erstwhile theatrical collaborator, Yolngu performer Rosealee Pearson, about DNA research that linked south Asians and northern Indigenous peoples of 4,000 years ago. This country\u2019s cultural origins is woven neatly into the play, along with Australia\u2019s continuing political paranoia over the continent\u2019s borders. Australia\u2019s obligations under the UNHCR\u2019s 1951 Refugee Convention come into play, as one character pleads with another: \u201cDo not get on that boat. People die on those boats.\u201d Shakthi hopes Counting and Cracking \u201ccan help people heal\u201d, encouraging a feeling among his community that \u201cwe\u2019re part of the Australian story\u201d. He also hopes that it will gently fill \u201cthis silence that exists between first- and second-generation migrants \u2026 and that the wisdom of the incredible experiences they went through overseas can be passed on to future generations\u201d. \u2022 Counting and Cracking plays Sydney festival until 2 February, before a run at Adelaide festival from 2-9 March.",

Security forces in the city beat people in their homes, forced residents to remove barricades from streets and fired on looters, local witnesses said. At least one person has been shot dead. The disorder followed a national strike called from Monday by unions in response to a steep rise in fuel prices ordered by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a ruling party stalwart who took power when Robert Mugabe was forced to resign after a military takeover in November 2017. Legacies of Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule include massive unemployment, huge government debts, an acute shortage of hard currency and a crumbling infrastructure. Desperation for food has forced some people to venture out in major cities but virtually all shops are closed and fuel stations empty. \u201cI went out to buy some vegetables for my sick mother and the streets were full of sullen, hostile young men. They tried to make me buy a single mango for $15,\u201d said one Harare resident. Police fired teargas in the capital after a crowd tried to overrun a shopping centre that opened to sell bread. Soldiers with AK-47s took charge of the long line. The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights, a respected NGO, said it had received reports of human rights violations across Zimbabwe. Its members had attended to more than 100 patients by Tuesday afternoon, some with serious injuries. One doctor said they had treated at least 30 people with gunshot wounds, and 80 victims of serious assault. Activists working to provide care to victims of political violence said hundreds of people had been injured, but the true total was unknown because many were too frightened to seek medical treatment. \u201cThings are very grim. It is very confused. No one knows what is happening,\u201d said one veteran human rights worker. Eight people including a police officer died during clashes on Monday, according to human rights activists. Mnangagwa is travelling in Asia and Europe, leaving the hardline vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, in charge. Chiwenga has been blamed for the shooting by soldiers of six civilians during opposition protests days after Zimbabwe\u2019s election on 30 July last year, and for a brutal wave of repression after the results were announced in August. It is unclear who is conducting the raids, but their methods are very similar to those of security forces during the wave of repression following the election, which was won by Mnangagwa. It is also unclear to what extent the disorder and protests over the last 48 hours have been centrally organised.

The information minister, Monica Mutsvangwa, said on state television on Tuesday night that the demonstrations amounted to \u201cterrorism\u201d and were \u201cwell-coordinated\u201d by the opposition. The crackdown has largely targeted opposition strongholds, though the leader of the ruling Zanu-PF party\u2019s youth wing was arrested along with six others for burning buses belonging to the state-owned transport company. Amos Chibaya, a senior official in the Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Zimbabwe\u2019s main opposition party, said \u201cunknown assailants\u201d had attacked his home in Harare on Tuesday night and then again on Wednesday morning. Evan Mawarire, a pastor and prominent social media activist, was arrested his home in Harare early on Wednesday morning and has been charged with inciting violence. Speaking to the Guardian moments before his arrest, Mawarire described armed police massing outside his house. \u201cThey are not letting anyone in or out except my lawyer,\u201d he said. Residents of Kuwadzana, a poor neighbourhood of Harare, said unidentified men had been going \u201cdoor to door\u201d. \u201cThey smashed our windows then burned out our car,\u201d said Carol Maguwu, 27. Relatives of Kinos Shoko, another resident, said the 56-year-old had been abducted at noon on Tuesday by unidentified men and returned to his home at midnight, very badly beaten and unable to hear or speak.",

Lawyers for the government have written to campaigners to say their decision-making was flawed and agreed to look again. The mine in the Pont Valley, known as Bradley, began operating last year after four decades of opposition. This week, James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, told campaigners the decision not to revoke permission for the mine would be re-examined. The move comes as Brokenshire is also considering whether to grant planning permission for another open-cast mine, at Druridge Bay in Northumberland. The mines are operated by Banks Group, which is at the forefront of open-cast mining, despite the government\u2019s pledge to phase out coal by 2025.

      "body": "<h2>UNITED IN PAIN</h2> <p>There was a point in the game between Blackeye Rovers and Newcastle United when Isaac Hayden, who had come on for the injured Jamaal Lascelles, who had come on for the injured Ciaran Clark, went down injured. For a while the crowd held their breath. They were, it seemed, about to witness the substitution of a substitute\u2019s substitute. This was something they could tell their children about, and their children\u2019s children.</p> <p>Frustratingly, Hayden eventually rose to his feet and limped on for the rest of the game. He was one of his team\u2019s most impressive players in an extra-time-, deflection- and linesman-blindness-assisted 4-2 victory at Ewood Park, even if what really made him stand out was the fact that when it ended he was still able to walk. \u201cWe have to assess them over the next couple of days,\u201d said Rafa Ben\u00edtez afterwards of his wounded. \u201cLascelles, I don\u2019t think it is very serious. He was limping, because he felt something. Clark went off at half-time with a knock to the knee but I don\u2019t think it will be serious.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/15/blackburn-rovers-newcastle-united-fa-cup-match-report\">Newcastle see off Blackburn with Joselu and Ayoze P\u00e9rez extra-time flourish</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Lascelles felt something, it was probably the cruel hand of fate conspiring against his team. Either that or his hamstring. Possibly both. This was after all a Newcastle side without several injured players, with others left out for their own safety and with an eye on Saturday\u2019s do-or-die league fixture against Cardiff, and still they ended the match with two freshly-hobbled colleagues and with Hayden and Fabian Schar among those limping towards a lengthy queue for the physio\u2019s attention. At St James\u2019 Park there is more competition for places on the treatment table than there is for spots in the team.</p> <p>These days Newcastle players can barely lace up their boots without being doubled over in agony. This is literally true in the case of Kenedy, the Brazilian winger who was unable to face Blackeye because of agonising toenail-knack. \u201cThe reality is he cannot put the boots on,\u201d Ben\u00edtez explained. \u201cAs soon as he puts the boots on, he is feeling pain.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Kenedy is the only person at Newcastle struggling with what Ben\u00edtez termed \u201ca problem with a nail\u201d \u2013 though the ones, as a result of both the injuries and the team\u2019s general inability to pick up points, regularly being hammered into their Premier League coffin are also troubling. Victory over Cardiff is imperative, though the way things are going the only survival fight their players will be interested in is the increasingly difficult battle to make it off the pitch alive.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Simon Burnton from 5.30pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Juventus 2-0 Milan in the Supercoppa Italiana</a> and then follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Southampton 3-2 Derby in the FA Cup third-round replay at 7.45pm</a> with Paul Doyle.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cAt certain times, you have to provoke friction with footballers.

      "bodyText": "UNITED IN PAIN There was a point in the game between Blackeye Rovers and Newcastle United when Isaac Hayden, who had come on for the injured Jamaal Lascelles, who had come on for the injured Ciaran Clark, went down injured. For a while the crowd held their breath. They were, it seemed, about to witness the substitution of a substitute\u2019s substitute. This was something they could tell their children about, and their children\u2019s children. Frustratingly, Hayden eventually rose to his feet and limped on for the rest of the game. He was one of his team\u2019s most impressive players in an extra-time-, deflection- and linesman-blindness-assisted 4-2 victory at Ewood Park, even if what really made him stand out was the fact that when it ended he was still able to walk. \u201cWe have to assess them over the next couple of days,\u201d said Rafa Ben\u00edtez afterwards of his wounded. \u201cLascelles, I don\u2019t think it is very serious. He was limping, because he felt something. Clark went off at half-time with a knock to the knee but I don\u2019t think it will be serious.\u201d If Lascelles felt something, it was probably the cruel hand of fate conspiring against his team. Either that or his hamstring. Possibly both. This was after all a Newcastle side without several injured players, with others left out for their own safety and with an eye on Saturday\u2019s do-or-die league fixture against Cardiff, and still they ended the match with two freshly-hobbled colleagues and with Hayden and Fabian Schar among those limping towards a lengthy queue for the physio\u2019s attention. At St James\u2019 Park there is more competition for places on the treatment table than there is for spots in the team. These days Newcastle players can barely lace up their boots without being doubled over in agony. This is literally true in the case of Kenedy, the Brazilian winger who was unable to face Blackeye because of agonising toenail-knack. \u201cThe reality is he cannot put the boots on,\u201d Ben\u00edtez explained. \u201cAs soon as he puts the boots on, he is feeling pain.\u201d For now, Kenedy is the only person at Newcastle struggling with what Ben\u00edtez termed \u201ca problem with a nail\u201d \u2013 though the ones, as a result of both the injuries and the team\u2019s general inability to pick up points, regularly being hammered into their Premier League coffin are also troubling. Victory over Cardiff is imperative, though the way things are going the only survival fight their players will be interested in is the increasingly difficult battle to make it off the pitch alive.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Manchester City have refused to give Uefa any comment on allegations that they breached FFP because the club believe the claims were based on \u201chacked or stolen\u201d emails. Shrewsbury\u2019s Twitter feed got a bit giddy after the League One strugglers scored three goals in 10 minutes to come from 2-0 down to knock the Potters out of the FA Cup. \u201cWOW!!!

Which teams have meddled with their playing surface to put the brakes on an opposition team? The Knowledge reveals all. Their governments may be locked in a diplomatic stand-off but Saudi Arabia and Qatar are playing down off-field issues before the Asian Cup match, writes John Duerden. Chelsea should think twice before splashing the cash on Leandro Paredes and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, reckons Martin Laurence.

The Briton was named by his employer, the charity Gatsby Africa, as Luke Potter, its Africa programmes director. In a statement, it said he had devoted the past 10 years to helping some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. \u201cLuke was respected by all he worked with, bringing huge drive, determination, a relentless work ethic, and a thirst for new ideas to every project,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe brought a calm head and his unique sense of humour to every situation \u2026 He was our colleague and our friend.\u201d The charity said it shared the grief of his family, partner, daughter and friends. Nic Hailey, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, said authorities were providing support to his family and friends. Another British person was wounded and was receiving medical attention, the Foreign Office said. Jason Spindler, the American who died, was the director of a business development firm who was based in the Kenyan capital, and had survived the September 11 attacks in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that I announce that my brother, Jason Spindler, passed away this morning during a terror attack in Nairobi,\u201d his brother Jonathan wrote on Facebook. \u201cJason was a survivor of 9/11 and a fighter. I am sure he gave them hell.\u201d Eleven Kenyans were confirmed dead, a mortuary official told Agence France-Presse. One victim had no papers, the official added. The London-based consultancy firm Adam Smith International said two of its employees had died on the terrace of a restaurant in the complex, where the company has offices. Abdalla Dahir and Feisal Ahmed, Kenyans of Somali descent, had been working on the Somalia Stability Fund managed by ASI to \u201cbring peace and prosperity to Somalia\u201d, the company said. Fifty staff and consultants were safely evacuated, it added. Another victim was named as James Oduor, commonly known as Cobra. Oduor, known for his love of football, was tweeting as the attack was going on, asking people outside the complex what was going on. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at 14 Riverside man? We\u2019re trapped in our buildings.\u201d he said in one message. He worked for an electrical company in the building. Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said early on Wednesday that security forces had ended operations at the dusitD2 hotel, having killed all four attackers. A member of the British SAS took part in the mission to end the assault, photos from the scene showed. The heavily armed man with a military vest and balaclava worked with local forces and helping victims leave the complex. It was reported the lone SAS member took part in the operation alongside US Navy seals, having been in the country to train Kenyan special forces. The MoD said it did not comment on special forces. Families who went to the Chiromo morgue were told they could not view the bodies until a forensic investigation had been performed, provoking grief and anger. The family of a missing 35-year-old man collapsed in the courtyard upon hearing that a body had arrived with his identification papers. \u201cHe is gone, he is gone,\u201d the father repeated into his phone as his mother wrapped a shawl around herself and wept. A woman who gave her name as Njoki wept as she said: \u201cMy sister is not in any of the hospitals and the last time we spoke she was a bit calm but suddenly she started crying and shouting and I could hear gunshots and her phone remained on but she wasn\u2019t speaking.

Kenyatta said more than 700 civilians were safely evacuated from the complex. The assault began shortly after 3pm on Tuesday with an explosion in the parking lot and then a suicide bomb blast in the hotel\u2019s foyer. It was claimed by al-Shabaab, the militant Islamist organisation based in neighbouring Somalia that carried out the 2013 attack on Nairobi\u2019s Westgate mall that left at least 67 dead.

      "bodyText": "Business leaders have suggested the UK resembles a \u201csupertanker heading for the rocks\u201d that will not be saved unless factions in the Conservative party drop their own \u201cred lines\u201d for a Brexit deal. As the prime minister, Theresa May, ruled out staying in a customs union despite pledging to reach out to her opponents after her historic defeat on Tuesday in the Commons, the Confederation of British Industry launched yet another appeal asking MPs to shift position and compromise. The CBI\u2019s deputy director general, Josh Hardie, said it was \u201cvery very, concerning\u201d that the divisions in the Tory party had hardened so much. Unless MPs woke up to reality and shifted their position, Britain would be hurtling towards an \u201chistoric act of self harm\u201d in the shape of a no dealover Brexit, he claimed. Hardie said: \u201cOur competitive advantage is being eroded already. The majority of contingency plans are already being executed. Companies have contingencies to be triggered at three months, two months, one month to go. It is not that contingencies will all happen in one fell sweep, but every week the deadlock continues the more contingencies plans will be enacted. \u201cThat\u2019s all to the detriment to the UK, to the economy, to jobs. It\u2019s in the form of relocating, cancelling investment plans, stockpiling. These are all unproductive sunk costs.\u201d He said the CBI\u2019s analysis was that there were five different groupings in parliament, with each rigidly expecting the other to come to their point of view. \u201cIf that mindset doesn\u2019t change, there will never be a majority for anything. We are a supertanker heading for the rocks and unless the crew gets together to change the destination we will be on the rocks,\u201d he said. The CBI did not consider May\u2019s Brexit deal perfect but last week had urged MPs to back it to ensure a transition period and negotiation towards an ultimate trade deal that would minimise friction and barriers for importers and exporters. Hardie said he thought MPs did listen to business leaders across the board \u2013 including those at Jaguar Land Rover, which last week announced 4,500 redundancies, mostly in the UK. But he said he was despondent about a group of MPs, including the Tories Jacob Ree Mogg and Suella Braverman, who have said that the consequences of a no-deal outcome had been exaggerated. Hardie added: \u201cI believe there is not a majority for no deal, and business can take credit for that, but there are still a significant number of MPs who do not understand that, who do not want to accept the evidence because it would contradict their own philosophy.

That they are not, in Theresa May\u2019s discredited words, crying wolf. The police are part of a social system that is being played like a game of Jenga. The building blocks are being removed one by one \u2013 education, housing, support for families, mental health services, domestic violence refuges \u2013 and the tower is falling. The police are at the sharp end because the damage manifests itself most urgently in increases in violent crime. But this violence also has a relationship with women not being supported to leave violent partners, people with mental health issues struggling to access services and those boys on London streets, excluded from school, falling prey to individuals offering them something that society isn\u2019t: money, a sense of belonging and respect. A 2017 report from the National Crime Agency shows some street gangs evolving into more serious criminal enterprises: networked, technologically savvy, internationalised, more predatory and sometimes more violent. Things can get worse. We have to wake up to what is happening, and quickly. Policing is only one, albeit important, ingredient in combating this. \u2022 Kate London is a former homicide detective and the author of the novel, Gallowstree Lane, published by Corvus on 7 February, priced \u00a312.99",

      "bodyText": "Pope Francis has been offering parenting advice and, sad to say, it is rubbish. It would, perhaps, be more surprising if it were sensible. The Catholic church is an institution dominated by avowedly celibate men who are not meant to have children. Then there is its \u2013 how shall we put it? \u2013 distinctly patchy recent record of prioritising the needs of children, which you would think might disqualify it from opining about anything much. Still, the pope is the pope and a lot of people take him seriously \u2013 and what he has said is that it\u2019s fine to have a blazing row with your partner, just not in front of the children. Take your slanging match about who was supposed to have organised the dishwasher repair out of sight and earshot. Anyone who has actually had children will know this is pointless. The one thing I have learned from bringing up four children over what feels like an awfully long period of time \u2013 and which is, in fact, more than 30 years \u2013 is that they are always subtler and more sophisticated than you think. They are invariably one step ahead. You can go into the bedroom and shut the door and seethe at each other through gritted teeth, more or less inaudibly, and they can still tell that something is up. They won\u2019t know what it is, though. They may jump to the conclusion that you\u2019re getting a divorce when you are only having a fight about poor recycling practices. The pope was, perhaps in the way of popes, quite dogmatic. \u201cI would like to give advice,\u201d he said, during a baptismal mass at the Vatican. \u201cSorry, but I recommend this: never fight in front of the children, never.\u201d \u201cNever\u201d presumably means that if you are in a confined space \u2013 the car, say \u2013 and your partner says something patently offensive, you are meant to suppress your cries of outraged ridicule until some later stage. By which time your annoyance will have curdled into disdain and left you in a thoroughly bad, unaccommodating mood. Children are like Geiger counters for their parents\u2019 emotions, says E Mark Cummings, a psychology professor who has written a book about the effects of parental conflict on children. Yet while children are almost supernaturally attuned to parental unhappiness, they don\u2019t necessarily possess the rational capacity to make sense of it. Pretending that you are not massively annoyed by your idiot partner when a child can tell you that you are is not, then, an act of kindness. Better an explosion of honest irritation, promptly kissed-and-made-up, than festering hostility. Emotion, like water, will always find a way out, and repressed emotion is likely to emerge as sniping or cold hostility, hours after you should have acknowledged that while idiotic, your partner may also have a point and anyway is rather lovely. Expert opinion differs wildly on the merits of arguing in front of the children, to the point of being almost comically contradictory. On the one hand, it\u2019s the most dangerous thing you can do, raising levels of cortisol to dangerous levels, disrupting their sleep patterns, causing illness and anxiety. On the other it is a useful teachable moment, demonstrating conflict resolution and the enduring power of love. This unhelpfully conflicting advice is explained by the fact that the experts are talking about quite different things. There are disagreements about the dishwasher and the recycling, and then there are disagreements about acts of betrayal, affairs, or spending all the money: long-term, horrible things that are better described as being profoundly at odds.

It has made me start to wonder how to respond if I see this behaviour in public. How can you support people? If I witnessed a person experiencing racism, I would want to help but wouldn\u2019t want to appear like </strong><strong>a white knight</strong><strong> coming to the rescue</strong><strong> because I thought they couldn\u2019t speak for themselves. And what if they wanted to ignore it, so as not to draw attention to themselves or give the aggressor the reaction they wanted? At the same time, I don\u2019t want to just be a bystander who </strong><strong>tacitly validates </strong><strong>th</strong><strong>is unacceptable behaviour by not saying anything at all.</strong></p> <p>You are right to start by putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes \u2013 sometimes good intentions are not enough, particularly if walking on uncharted ground. The answer very much depends on your relationship to the person in question. Have you thought about asking people \u2013 friends, colleagues, acquaintances \u2013 about their experiences of these issues? It may feel nerve-racking, but trust yourself. The articles you have read can be a starting point for conversation, and you\u2019ll have to gauge how far you should go with it. Be clear about your own lack of knowledge; it\u2019s fine to say to someone, \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to ask this question\u201d or, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if this is offensive or the sort of thing you necessarily want to talk to me about \u2013 I know it\u2019s not your job to educate me.\u201d</p> <p>Of course you might get it wrong \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s likely you will \u2013 as no two people are the same and racism is a sensitive subject; some people might not feel at ease talking to you about it. They may fear that you will become defensive \u2013 as has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/19/am-i-a-racist-you-asked-google\" title=\"\">written about</a> by many writers of colour \u2013 that you might deny their experience of racism, or fail to understand it. But you might be able to ask how they would like people to react when these things happen to them. As long as you are open-minded, willing to accept criticism and to be clear about your own lack of knowledge, you have the chance of building a better understanding of someone else\u2019s life and becoming better equipped to support them.</p> <p>You may be in a situation where you witness racism towards someone you don\u2019t know. A person may appear to want to ignore it, but that could be for a host of reasons \u2013 feeling others don\u2019t care, or out of embarrassment, shame or feeling like they are a burden. In these situations you should gauge whether it is safe to intervene or you need to call the police. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/21/boston-fight-islamophobia-viral-how-to-transport-cartoon\" title=\"\">There are guides</a> that suggest helpful behaviours in these situations, focusing on diverting attention from the situation (sitting next to someone and talking to them about a random, unrelated topic, rather than \u201cstanding up for them\u201d or confronting the aggressor). In reality, you will do what you feel comfortable with and are able to. That may mean making eye contact, or mouthing to see whether they are OK.

At the same time, I don\u2019t want to just be a bystander who tacitly validates this unacceptable behaviour by not saying anything at all. You are right to start by putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes \u2013 sometimes good intentions are not enough, particularly if walking on uncharted ground. The answer very much depends on your relationship to the person in question. Have you thought about asking people \u2013 friends, colleagues, acquaintances \u2013 about their experiences of these issues? It may feel nerve-racking, but trust yourself. The articles you have read can be a starting point for conversation, and you\u2019ll have to gauge how far you should go with it. Be clear about your own lack of knowledge; it\u2019s fine to say to someone, \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to ask this question\u201d or, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if this is offensive or the sort of thing you necessarily want to talk to me about \u2013 I know it\u2019s not your job to educate me.\u201d Of course you might get it wrong \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s likely you will \u2013 as no two people are the same and racism is a sensitive subject; some people might not feel at ease talking to you about it. They may fear that you will become defensive \u2013 as has been written about by many writers of colour \u2013 that you might deny their experience of racism, or fail to understand it. But you might be able to ask how they would like people to react when these things happen to them. As long as you are open-minded, willing to accept criticism and to be clear about your own lack of knowledge, you have the chance of building a better understanding of someone else\u2019s life and becoming better equipped to support them. You may be in a situation where you witness racism towards someone you don\u2019t know. A person may appear to want to ignore it, but that could be for a host of reasons \u2013 feeling others don\u2019t care, or out of embarrassment, shame or feeling like they are a burden. In these situations you should gauge whether it is safe to intervene or you need to call the police. There are guides that suggest helpful behaviours in these situations, focusing on diverting attention from the situation (sitting next to someone and talking to them about a random, unrelated topic, rather than \u201cstanding up for them\u201d or confronting the aggressor). In reality, you will do what you feel comfortable with and are able to. That may mean making eye contact, or mouthing to see whether they are OK. In times of crisis and upset, it is always OK to ask. \u2022 What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

Nothing, Barr argued, could stop the president\u2019s \u201ccomplete authority to stop or start a law enforcement proceeding\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The appearance of a single green leaf hinted at a future in which astronauts would grow their own food in space, potentially setting up residence at outposts on the moon or other planets. Now, barely after it had sprouted, the cotton plant onboard China\u2019s lunar rover has died. The plant relied on sunlight at the moon\u2019s surface, but as night arrived at the lunar far side and temperatures plunged as low as -170C, its short life came to an end. Prof Xie Gengxin of Chongqing University, who led the design of the experiment, said its short lifespan had been anticipated. \u201cLife in the canister would not survive the lunar night,\u201d Xie said. The Chang\u2019e-4 probe entered \u201csleep mode\u201d on Sunday as the first lunar night after the probe\u2019s landing fell. Nighttime on the moon lasts for approximately two weeks, after which the probe would wake up again. Its rover, Yutu-2, has also been required to take a midday nap to avoid overheating while the sun was directly overhead and temperatures could reach more than 120C. Unlike Earth, the moon has no atmosphere to buffer extreme temperature variations. The plants and seeds would gradually decompose in the totally enclosed canister, and would not affect the lunar environment, according to the China National Space Administration. Although astronauts have cultivated plants on the International Space Station, this was the first time any have grown on the moon. \u201cWe had no such experience before. And we could not simulate the lunar environment, such as microgravity and cosmic radiation, on earth,\u201d Xie said. The experiment also included potato seeds, yeast and Arabidopsis, or rockcress, a small, flowering plant of the mustard family, but none of these showed signs of having sprouted. Fruit fly eggs were also placed in the canister. The hope was that a micro-ecosystem would form, in which the plants would provide oxygen to the fruit flies, which would feed on the yeast and produce the carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis.

It was set up to oversee the ceasefire, including a phased withdrawal of Houthi forces and the introduction of a new security force in Hodeidah.</p> <p>Peter Salisbury, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, said in a recent report: \u201cWith the deadline for redeployments now past \u2013 they were scheduled for completion by 8 January \u2013 speculation is mounting that the deal may be on the verge of collapse. The Stockholm agreement is imperfect and imprecise, but it was hard-won. If it is allowed to break down, there will be no opportunity for a similar deal for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cUnlike most ceasefire agreements, this one did not include technical details on the scope, nature or duration of the halt to hostilities; definition of breaches; or mechanisms for quickly stopping fighting if it breaks out anew.\u201d Salisbury said the loopholes in the deal left the Houthis free to hand over the ports to themselves.</p> <p>The Houthi leadership claimed Patrick Cammaert, the UN chair of the committee, was overstepping his mandate, and that meetings were being held in Yemeni government-controlled territory.</p> <p>Burt said: \u201cMy sense is that it is only so far that a resolution can go. It is really about confidence-building between the parties.\u201d He added it was critical to keep the RDC talks going.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/21/yemen-uae-united-arab-emirates-profiting-from-chaos-of-civil-war\">Yemen on the brink: how the UAE is profiting from the chaos of civil war | Ghaith Abdul-Ahad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He warned: \u201cIt is not just the two parties in the room. The UN envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, estimates there could be as many as 1 million combatants in Yemen because other groups have joined the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Burt also disclosed that David Beasley, the UN world food programme director, had spoken this week \u201cof a more positive Houthi attitude\u201d to cooperation over the distribution of humanitarian supplies in its areas, which had improved, although food was still being diverted and taxes imposed.</p> <p>In another positive step, Jordan had agreed to stage talks next week on a mass political prisoner exchange, one of the confidence-building measures that the UN hopes could build trust. Burt said Oman\u2019s foreign minister was acting as a mediator, adding the issue was \u201cvery live\u201d.</p> <p>Burt, contrary to some American descriptions of the conflict, said he did not believe the Houthis were a proxy of Iran, describing them as independent-minded, and pointing out Iran had played a part in ensuring the Houthis attended the Stockholm talks.</p> <p>But he said it was not possible to minimise \u201cthe huge existential fears\u201d felt by the Gulf states due to Iran. He said: \u201cSaudi Arabia is not going to to take the risk of a border which could be under the influence, if not the control, of another power that it considers to be hostile.\u201d</p> <p>The civil war in Yemen began in 2014 when the rebels captured the capital, Sana\u2019a, and a Saudi-led coalition intervened a year later, fighting alongside government troops.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UN has tried to prevent the collapse of the ceasefire agreement in Yemen by endorsing a fresh security council resolution urgently increasing the number of monitors overseeing the deal in Hodeidah, the strategic port that lies at the heart of the three-year civil war. The resolution, drafted by the UK, extends the UN monitoring role for a further six months and increases the number of monitors to as many as 75 people. UN personnel are likely to be transferred from Djibouti to Hodeidah. The Houthi rebels and the UN-backed government of Yemen\u2019s president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, have accused each other of multiple breaches of the ceasefire. The terms of that ceasefire \u2013 agreed in haste at UN-brokered talks in Stockholm in December \u2013 were seen as flawed due to a lack of precision and the country\u2019s geographical limits. Having too few monitors has also made it more difficult for the UN to ascribe responsibility for breaches, and so prevent their repetition. The British and Americans have accused the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of breaching the spirit of the ceasefire after drones were used to attack a Yemeni government military parade, killing six people including the head of Yemeni intelligence. The Houthis said the attack in Lahij governorate was outside the ceasefire zone and accused the Saudi air force of continuing to launch airstrikes in Hodeidah since the ceasefire was announced on 18 December. Alistair Burt, the UK\u2019s Middle East minister, in evidence to a Lords select committee on Wednesday, stressed that \u201cthe ceasefire was holding\u201d, but admitted \u201cconfidence between the parties is nil\u201d. The Houthis have started to boycott meetings of the UN-backed regional deployment committee (RDC). It was set up to oversee the ceasefire, including a phased withdrawal of Houthi forces and the introduction of a new security force in Hodeidah. Peter Salisbury, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, said in a recent report: \u201cWith the deadline for redeployments now past \u2013 they were scheduled for completion by 8 January \u2013 speculation is mounting that the deal may be on the verge of collapse. The Stockholm agreement is imperfect and imprecise, but it was hard-won. If it is allowed to break down, there will be no opportunity for a similar deal for a long time.\u201d He added: \u201cUnlike most ceasefire agreements, this one did not include technical details on the scope, nature or duration of the halt to hostilities; definition of breaches; or mechanisms for quickly stopping fighting if it breaks out anew.\u201d Salisbury said the loopholes in the deal left the Houthis free to hand over the ports to themselves. The Houthi leadership claimed Patrick Cammaert, the UN chair of the committee, was overstepping his mandate, and that meetings were being held in Yemeni government-controlled territory. Burt said: \u201cMy sense is that it is only so far that a resolution can go. It is really about confidence-building between the parties.\u201d He added it was critical to keep the RDC talks going. He warned: \u201cIt is not just the two parties in the room. The UN envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, estimates there could be as many as 1 million combatants in Yemen because other groups have joined the conflict.\u201d Burt also disclosed that David Beasley, the UN world food programme director, had spoken this week \u201cof a more positive Houthi attitude\u201d to cooperation over the distribution of humanitarian supplies in its areas, which had improved, although food was still being diverted and taxes imposed. In another positive step, Jordan had agreed to stage talks next week on a mass political prisoner exchange, one of the confidence-building measures that the UN hopes could build trust. Burt said Oman\u2019s foreign minister was acting as a mediator, adding the issue was \u201cvery live\u201d. Burt, contrary to some American descriptions of the conflict, said he did not believe the Houthis were a proxy of Iran, describing them as independent-minded, and pointing out Iran had played a part in ensuring the Houthis attended the Stockholm talks. But he said it was not possible to minimise \u201cthe huge existential fears\u201d felt by the Gulf states due to Iran. He said: \u201cSaudi Arabia is not going to to take the risk of a border which could be under the influence, if not the control, of another power that it considers to be hostile.\u201d The civil war in Yemen began in 2014 when the rebels captured the capital, Sana\u2019a, and a Saudi-led coalition intervened a year later, fighting alongside government troops.",

Yet that final meeting between the two women is a showstopper, especially Mary\u2019s angry spasm of pride in calling Elizabeth her inferior. It is an aria of tragic scorn.</p>",

However, Rourke and Willimon create elegant initial scenes in which the queens allow introductory portraits of themselves to be sent back and forth: Elizabeth\u2019s is pointedly larger than Mary\u2019s \u2013 and there is an interestingly surreal moment when a lady-in-waiting has to hold it up in front of her face, like an avatar. Ronan is just so good in this movie \u2013 so intelligent, so passionate, but she upstages Robbie, and Robbie\u2019s parts of the film, often lumbered with leaden historical exposition dialogue, especially from Pearce, don\u2019t have the same snap. Perhaps Elizabeth comes off disconcertingly badly because there is, dramatically, only room for one proud-yet-vulnerable 16th-century queen in a film about proud-yet-vulnerable 16th-century queens, so they must compete for a finite supply of queenly mannerisms. Yet that final meeting between the two women is a showstopper, especially Mary\u2019s angry spasm of pride in calling Elizabeth her inferior. It is an aria of tragic scorn.",

When asked if the MPs\u2019 actions were a distraction, he added: \u201cRight now the priority is to bring about a general election; we\u2019ve got a no-confidence motion down today.\u201d Frustration about the timing of the MPs\u2019 actions \u2013 some of whom want Labour to move within days to supporting a second referendum \u2013 spilled into the open when Joe Bradley, a member of staff in the leader\u2019s office, tweeted: \u201cNot one of these MPs cares about removing a Tory government,\u201d in response to a picture of the photocall. Bradley, who is responsible for trade union and NEC relations, deleted his Twitter account, and Corbyn\u2019s office said it did not comment on staffing matters. Other MPs who had not previously declared their support for another referendum included John Grogan, Graham Jones, Stephen Morgan and Matt Western, according to the organisers of the statement released on Wednesday morning. Few expect Labour to win the vote of no confidence, given that the DUP has said it will support May\u2019s minority government. That has prompted growing pressure for the party to back a second referendum, despite the reservations of the party\u2019s leadership. Labour\u2019s repeatedly stated policy was to press for an election after May\u2019s deal had been voted down, but then to consider a second referendum as an option if no election could be secured. But in his speeches in Tuesday night\u2019s Brexit debate, Corbyn made no reference to a second referendum and his spokesman said the party would consider demanding more than a confidence vote before accepting that it could not force a general election. Stephen Doughty, one of the organisers of the declaration, said the MPs were \u201csupporting the confidence vote \u2013 we want to get rid of the Tory government\u201d but called on the party to act soon. The MP refused to give Corbyn a timescale, saying the leadership had \u201cgood reasons\u201d for taking its time. But he added: \u201cThe clock is ticking, therefore we have to move forward, because it\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s investments, it\u2019s our public services that are at risk.\u201d Other Labour sources closer to the party\u2019s leadership said there were only a handful of MPs who had supported a fresh referendum for the first time, and noted that the number who signed the declaration was well below the 100 figure that had been touted earlier. The organisers of the letter said there were a further 24 Labour MPs who supported a second referendum who had not signed the statement for administrative reasons, or because their position was already well known. Other Labour MPs called on Corbyn to act more quickly if the confidence vote was defeated. Bridget Phillipson said: \u201cIn the event we don\u2019t succeed in securing a general election we should commit immediately to going back to the people in a fresh referendum.\u201d",

In addition to our local work, we currently financially support 60 children with cancer in Myanmar, and later this month we start operations in Ghana. Our international work is done in partnership with another UK charity. It took us over a year to source an aeroplane we could afford for our work in the UK. Our specially prepared aircraft has a Czech Republic registration and is flown by our volunteer pilots in the UK. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, from 29 March our pilots won\u2019t be able to legally fly the plane. This means our charity will stop operations and the provision of services to our beneficiaries. Fernando Pinho, CEO of Please Take Me There, founded in 2016 \u2018We sought government advice but were unable to get any assurances; we\u2019ve now closed our operation in France\u2019 Wentworth Jones is a UK company that provides tourism and hospitality consultancy services internationally. AktivExperience was a French registered branch of Wentworth Jones which we have decided to close after trading successfully for 10 years. We were a small ski operating company offering fully catered accommodation in five chalets in Meribel. We sought government advice on the legal status of our business model and of our temporarily posted English staff in France post-Brexit. We were unable to get any assurances that our model, the legal status of our company operating in France or the status of our staff would be protected post-Brexit. The only assurance from the Department for Exiting the EU was that we can legally operate up to the 29 March, just over halfway through the ski season! As we were about to take up new five-year leases on our chalets we decided that the potential liability and risk was too high and therefore reluctantly closed that operation. Peter Jones, director of Wentworth Jones \u2018We are still cautious but a no-deal Brexit will be good for our business\u2019 We are still cautious but from what we can see a no-deal Brexit will be good for our business. Most of our sales are to overseas advertisers, and most of those to EU-based companies. Firstly, a no-deal Brexit will probably mean the pound falls lower than it is now, which will be a huge benefit. Secondly, we will not have to charge our EU customers VAT any more. While almost all of them can claim this back, it still means a cashflow saving for them, and a reduction in admin for them. This helps us to be marginally more competitive. We will also benefit from not having to file an ESL return to the EU every month. This is an onerous administrative task, akin to doing a VAT return. Anonymous, founder of a publishing company dealing with information and communication \u2018We can\u2019t have an open conversation with our customers because we don\u2019t know what will happen for sure \u2013 just that it will be bad\u2019 We design bike frames in the UK and work with factories outside the EU to have them produced. Around 25% of our orders are exported within the EU. The uncertainty we have had to endure since the referendum has been severely disruptive already. The volatility in foreign currency exchange rates has hurt us significantly. We launched just prior to the referendum and our first batch of frames were bought at 1.46 USD. The rate today? 1.23 USD. We can\u2019t talk about Brexit publicly as a business. We can\u2019t have an open conversation about it with our customers and we can\u2019t be clear with them about what the implications actually are. Firstly because we don\u2019t know for sure \u2013 just that it will be bad. And secondly because any mention of Brexit is met with vitriol and ridicule. We\u2019re \u201ccomplaining\u201d or \u201cmaking excuses\u201d. Building a new business from scratch is difficult at the best of times but in this environment, it has been extremely challenging.

      "body": "<p>A legal case from January 2017 which relates to Megan McCann\u2019s long-running attempt to sue Bet365 for \u00a31m appears to suggest co-operation between Britain\u2019s biggest online bookmaker and the leading money-transfer company, Skrill.</p> \n<p>McCann is suing Bet365 over a \u00a325,000 bet on four races in Britain and Ireland which was placed and accepted via the firm\u2019s website in June 2016. The winnings due on the bet amount to just over \u00a3975,000 but Bet365 has refused to pay out, or return the initial \u00a325,000 stake, because it claims that the stake was provided by a \u201cthird party\u201d in contravention of its Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/16/talking-horses-racecourses-vow-to-ban-drone-giving-punters-an-edge-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Racecourses vow to ban drones giving punters an edge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A procedural hearing in the case is scheduled to take place at the high court in Belfast on Friday, with a full hearing expected later in the year. However, the Guardian has learned that in January 2017, Bet365 successfully applied for a \u2018Norwich Pharmacol\u2019 order against Skrill at the chancery division of the high court in London, requiring Skrill to reveal details of McCann\u2019s account with the firm.</p> \n<p>Skrill, an \u201ce-wallet\u201d, has millions of customers globally and is a popular way for punters to deposit money with online gambling sites. What is concerning, though, is that Skrill did not contest the application. As a result, the witness statement by a Bet365 lawyer which supported the application was not subjected to scrutiny and the application was rubber-stamped in chambers.</p> \n<p>All online businesses which hold or transfer funds have extensive T&amp;Cs to which customers must agree \u2013 usually via a tick-box \u2013 before they can open an account. The Data Protection Act also requires businesses to have a robust regime in place to protect clients\u2019 private data.</p> \n<p>Skrill said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cwe take our data protection obligations very seriously and are satisfied we\u2019ve met our obligations in this matter.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe were entitled to comply with the order. Under the Skrill privacy policy which all customers agree to, we can disclose customer personal information to third parties in certain limited circumstances, including \u2018in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, or as otherwise required to by law\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe took legal advice at the time we were served with the order which affirmed our position. At the time we were served the order we were prevented from disclosing the content of the order to anyone else.\u201d</p> \n<p>The wording of Skrill\u2019s privacy policy is certainly broad enough to cover their acquiescence with Bet365\u2019s application.</p> \n<p>Bet365 is involved in a civil action with McCann and the bookmaker applied for the order several months before the details of McCann\u2019s winning bet became public, in July 2017. The fairness and legal status of Bet365\u2019s T&amp;Cs will be central to the proceedings when McCann\u2019s case finally reaches a full hearing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f10d7783-ffa0-48bc-bff2-228ee3b6039d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Market Rasen&nbsp;</b><b>12.30</b> Deyrann De Carjac <b>1.00</b> Let\u2019s Get At It <b>1.35</b> Oregon Gold <b>2.05</b> Ontopoftheworld <b>2.40 </b>A Perfect Gift <b>3.15</b> West Wizard <b>3.45</b> The Jugopolist</p>\n    <p><b>Ludlow&nbsp;</b><b>12.40</b> Humble Hero <b>1.10</b> Brillare Momento <b>1.45</b> Shelcomeonfordrun <b>2.15</b> Gortroe Joe <b>2.50</b> Gold Chain <b>3.25</b> Beeves <b>4.00</b> Perfect Predator</p>\n    <p><b>Wincanton&nbsp;</b><b>12.50</b> Shillingsworth <b>1.20</b> Elusive Belle <b>1.55</b> Peterborough <b>2.25</b> Wandrin Star (nap) <b>3.00</b> Theatre Territory <b>3.35</b> First Du Charmil <b>4.10</b> Golden Gift</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle&nbsp;</b><b>3.55</b> Kyoto Star <b>4.25</b> Our Manekineko <b>4.55</b> Beryl The Petal <b>5.25</b> Dawn Delight <b>5.55</b> Glory Of Paris <b>6.25</b> Astrophysics <b>6.55</b> Wiff Waff <b>7.25</b> Social Butterfly (nb)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "A legal case from January 2017 which relates to Megan McCann\u2019s long-running attempt to sue Bet365 for \u00a31m appears to suggest co-operation between Britain\u2019s biggest online bookmaker and the leading money-transfer company, Skrill. McCann is suing Bet365 over a \u00a325,000 bet on four races in Britain and Ireland which was placed and accepted via the firm\u2019s website in June 2016. The winnings due on the bet amount to just over \u00a3975,000 but Bet365 has refused to pay out, or return the initial \u00a325,000 stake, because it claims that the stake was provided by a \u201cthird party\u201d in contravention of its Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs). A procedural hearing in the case is scheduled to take place at the high court in Belfast on Friday, with a full hearing expected later in the year. However, the Guardian has learned that in January 2017, Bet365 successfully applied for a \u2018Norwich Pharmacol\u2019 order against Skrill at the chancery division of the high court in London, requiring Skrill to reveal details of McCann\u2019s account with the firm. Skrill, an \u201ce-wallet\u201d, has millions of customers globally and is a popular way for punters to deposit money with online gambling sites. What is concerning, though, is that Skrill did not contest the application. As a result, the witness statement by a Bet365 lawyer which supported the application was not subjected to scrutiny and the application was rubber-stamped in chambers. All online businesses which hold or transfer funds have extensive T&amp;Cs to which customers must agree \u2013 usually via a tick-box \u2013 before they can open an account. The Data Protection Act also requires businesses to have a robust regime in place to protect clients\u2019 private data. Skrill said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cwe take our data protection obligations very seriously and are satisfied we\u2019ve met our obligations in this matter.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe were entitled to comply with the order. Under the Skrill privacy policy which all customers agree to, we can disclose customer personal information to third parties in certain limited circumstances, including \u2018in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, or as otherwise required to by law\u2019. \u201cWe took legal advice at the time we were served with the order which affirmed our position. At the time we were served the order we were prevented from disclosing the content of the order to anyone else.\u201d The wording of Skrill\u2019s privacy policy is certainly broad enough to cover their acquiescence with Bet365\u2019s application. Bet365 is involved in a civil action with McCann and the bookmaker applied for the order several months before the details of McCann\u2019s winning bet became public, in July 2017. The fairness and legal status of Bet365\u2019s T&amp;Cs will be central to the proceedings when McCann\u2019s case finally reaches a full hearing.",

It\u2019s a beautiful view with trees that look almost fantastical, then a glinting cottage with just a light on inside. It makes you feel safe somehow, even though the expanse of nature can be quite terrifying. It is the kind of painting that people are going to fall head over heels in love with.\u201d</p> <p>The British poet and novelist John Burnside regards Sohlberg as Norway\u2019s finest painter and will <a href=\"https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/whats-on/lectures-talks/2019/may/radical-beauty-harald-sohlbergs-street-scenes/\">explain why at a talk at the gallery in May</a>. A character in his book, A Summer of Drowning, laments that nobody abroad knows anything about Norwegian art other than The Scream.</p> <p>One of Sohlberg\u2019s other admirers is the UK\u2019s ambassador to Norway, Richard Wood. \u201cThere is something very lasting and contemporary in Sohlberg\u2019s work which Norwegians identify with very strongly, namely a sense of the country\u2019s majestic but daunting geography and climate,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>He added: \u201cNorwegian art is relatively unknown in the UK.

Curators of the Sohlberg show see his pictures as having a very different function. \u201cHe is an artist of escapism when the world appears to be going crazy,\u201d Jennifer Scott, director of the Dulwich gallery, said. \u201cSohlberg\u2019s work is the antidote to the horrors of daily life. Winter Night in the Mountains was painted in 1914 so his paintings were immensely important in times of trouble.\u201d Featuring more than 90 works, the exhibition is the first Sohlberg show outside Norway and marks the 150th anniversary of his birth. It will also coincide with the major exhibition of Munch\u2019s work that opens in April at the British Museum. \u201cIt is part of our mission to introduce artists who are relatively unknown in this country,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI really hope visitors will see both exhibitions, but it is lovely that ours opens first because I think we need it more. \u201cMunch is exciting and raw. But, with Sohlberg, there is something that feels more profound and you can keep finding new things in his work.\u201d She picks out his 1906 work Fisherman\u2019s Cottage. \u201cI remember seeing it as a kid and I didn\u2019t know who Harald Sohlberg was, so I\u2019m so excited that we\u2019ve got it. It\u2019s a beautiful view with trees that look almost fantastical, then a glinting cottage with just a light on inside. It makes you feel safe somehow, even though the expanse of nature can be quite terrifying. It is the kind of painting that people are going to fall head over heels in love with.\u201d The British poet and novelist John Burnside regards Sohlberg as Norway\u2019s finest painter and will explain why at a talk at the gallery in May. A character in his book, A Summer of Drowning, laments that nobody abroad knows anything about Norwegian art other than The Scream. One of Sohlberg\u2019s other admirers is the UK\u2019s ambassador to Norway, Richard Wood. \u201cThere is something very lasting and contemporary in Sohlberg\u2019s work which Norwegians identify with very strongly, namely a sense of the country\u2019s majestic but daunting geography and climate,\u201d he told the Guardian. He added: \u201cNorwegian art is relatively unknown in the UK. I hope that this will change with the Sohlberg exhibition and that the British public will be curious to discover more.\u201d \u201cSohlberg\u2019s works are clearly aesthetically pleasing. But I hope that audiences will also be able to step back and understand what he is saying about the psyche of a country with growing pains on the harsh periphery of Europe.\u201d He also backed Norway\u2019s choice of Sohlberg\u2019s work as its national painting over the better-known work by Munch. Wood said: \u201cWhile The Scream is a unique and fascinating painting, it is about Munch\u2019s tormented soul. While not without angst at the enormity of the cosmos, Winter Night captures the soul of a whole nation perfectly. And the light and depth and colour are simply wonderful.\u201d Wood was diplomatic when asked whether the two exhibitions would help secure ties between the UK and Norway at a time of growing interest in the \u201cNorway plus\u201d option as a possible route out of the Brexit crisis. He said: \u201cNorwegians feel a very strong bond with the UK. They remember historical links, they grow up watching UK media, learn flawless English, trade with British companies, support British football clubs. \u201cThe exhibiting of Norwegian artists in the UK will go some way to raise the profile of Norway in the UK. So I\u2019m confident that whatever the outcome of political processes, the links with Norway will stay strong.\u201d",

While other freshers were getting to know each other, I was squeezing my breasts into a pump and cursing the price of nappies. My life as an Oxford student and mum was so unexpected that one student thought the \u201cbaby\u201d I talked about was a doll. It\u2019s 2019: women earn scholarships while pregnant and mothers study at top universities while raising children, but the existence of student parents still goes unacknowledged.</p> <p>I crammed a full academic schedule into my daughter\u2019s nursery hours. It was exhausting. I breastfed at 5am while trying to finish essays. My tutors were very kind but, as an institution, Oxford does not expect you to be a mother. More than 700 Oxford students had children in 2016, but many feel they are not on the university\u2019s radar. Ash Mohanaprakas, who discovered she was pregnant during her undergraduate degree, says she felt \u201cconstantly lonely\u201d trying to reconcile motherhood with her studies.</p> <p>\u201cI almost expected to be disowned,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mum had been so proud of me. Now, she was asking me to hide when her gossipy friend visited.\u201d</p> <p>Already facing rejection from her community, Mohanaprakas struggled to cope financially at Oxford with her son. Unable to get childcare support from student finance, she was also barred from the university hardship fund, which regards childcare as a pre-planned circumstance. This rhetoric risks discounting whole groups of people \u2013 lone parents who lack a partner\u2019s income, students with unexpected pregnancies, those who can\u2019t afford childcare \u2013 from places they have gained on merit. Mohanaprakas could only afford two days of childcare a week for her son, which gave her just enough time to go to tutorials. She cared for him the rest of the week and wrote her essays at night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jun/14/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-at-university\">What to expect when you're expecting at university</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the university supports staff with parenting responsibilities \u2013 it has a <a href=\"https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/research/internal/funding-directory/returning-carers-fund\">\u00a35,000 fund for returning carers</a> \u2013 students with identical needs can feel overlooked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a place to breastfeed,\u201d says Anna Sarkissian, who returned to her DPhil in anthropology at Oxford when her daughter was four months old. \u201cI pumped milk in a communal toilet, trying not to touch anything, while people banged on the door outside.</p> <p>\u201cIt took a long time just to find somewhere to nurse and work. Eventually my department found me a small office, which was great, but you have to push for everything you need to be able to complete your degree. As student parents, we\u2019re already overtaxed.

Few parents can study during evenings and weekends when childcare providers are closed, giving us less time to complete tasks than other students. It\u2019s also physically tiring. Sleep technology company Simba found that <a href=\"http://wellbeingnews.co.uk/child-development/how-much-sleep-should-new-parents-expect-to-get-in-their-childs-first-year/\">parents lose 50 nights of sleep</a> in the first year of their child\u2019s life. Despite these access barriers, society still views parenthood as a private affair which should not affect academic work.</p> <p>\u201cI worry that other researchers see motherhood as this frivolous thing,\u201d says Sarkissian. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for women in academia. Once you have kids, people doubt your level of commitment. If I had to wash my breast pump in my department\u2019s kitchen, I\u2019d rush to do it as quickly as possible. I didn\u2019t want to run into any of my colleagues. I had this fear people would think I was distracted or not working hard enough. There\u2019s still a stigma surrounding breastfeeding; it\u2019s viewed as a private activity which doesn\u2019t belong in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>Student parents face specific financial pressures. For Sarkissian, UK childcare fees \u2013 around \u00a312,000 a year \u2013 are unaffordable, and this is with the university\u2019s discounted rate. The family are considering travelling back to Canada where they can afford to live, and where childcare is sufficiently subsidised.</p> <p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a partner supporting me, I couldn\u2019t do this degree. It\u2019s 100% contingent on my husband being able to take time off from paid employment and take care of the baby during the day.\u201d</p> <p>For single parent Summer Qassim, waking up at 4.30am is how she balances her master\u2019s degree with caring for her two children, aged six and seven. \u201cIt asks a lot of my body,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I have a 9.30am seminar, everything has to be done by 6.30am, before I get the kids ready for school.\u201d</p> <p>Where a partner could help in the absence of affordable childcare, Qassim lacks support. \u201cI had to get neighbours to sit with my kids during their school holidays, when I had classes,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt awful. Someone suggested setting up a childcare camp in my college, but I was the only student who needed it. This is where funding can really help single parents, but most funding doesn\u2019t acknowledge children. There\u2019s this assumption that if you have kids, it\u2019s your responsibility and you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/19/homesickness-at-university-is-there-a-cure\">Homesickness at university: is there a cure?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Qassim describes her department as \u201cgreat\u201d, with professors who changed class schedules for her and lent her books, she believes universities need to recognise student parents as a minority. \u201cI bet there are so many students with children who haven\u2019t even thought about applying. I want them to know that they can, and it won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>Mohanaprakas, who graduated in 2014, says: \u201cI want to show women in my position that they can achieve anything they want.\u201d Observing the determination of student parents, it\u2019s clear that pregnancy is not a barrier. But the onus should not be entirely on individuals to prove their children will not get in the way of systems that could easily be more accessible and welcoming.</p> <p>Student parents make fantastic students. You can\u2019t balance a degree and the overwhelming job of parenting without being hardworking and resilient. I\u2019m even more determined to succeed now I\u2019m studying for my daughter\u2019s future, as well as my own.</p>",

Now, she was asking me to hide when her gossipy friend visited.\u201d Already facing rejection from her community, Mohanaprakas struggled to cope financially at Oxford with her son. Unable to get childcare support from student finance, she was also barred from the university hardship fund, which regards childcare as a pre-planned circumstance. This rhetoric risks discounting whole groups of people \u2013 lone parents who lack a partner\u2019s income, students with unexpected pregnancies, those who can\u2019t afford childcare \u2013 from places they have gained on merit. Mohanaprakas could only afford two days of childcare a week for her son, which gave her just enough time to go to tutorials. She cared for him the rest of the week and wrote her essays at night. While the university supports staff with parenting responsibilities \u2013 it has a \u00a35,000 fund for returning carers \u2013 students with identical needs can feel overlooked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a place to breastfeed,\u201d says Anna Sarkissian, who returned to her DPhil in anthropology at Oxford when her daughter was four months old. \u201cI pumped milk in a communal toilet, trying not to touch anything, while people banged on the door outside. \u201cIt took a long time just to find somewhere to nurse and work. Eventually my department found me a small office, which was great, but you have to push for everything you need to be able to complete your degree. As student parents, we\u2019re already overtaxed. We\u2019re just trying to survive.\u201d Sixty per cent of student parents have considered leaving their course, a number which rises to 65% for single parents. Few parents can study during evenings and weekends when childcare providers are closed, giving us less time to complete tasks than other students. It\u2019s also physically tiring. Sleep technology company Simba found that parents lose 50 nights of sleep in the first year of their child\u2019s life. Despite these access barriers, society still views parenthood as a private affair which should not affect academic work. \u201cI worry that other researchers see motherhood as this frivolous thing,\u201d says Sarkissian. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for women in academia. Once you have kids, people doubt your level of commitment. If I had to wash my breast pump in my department\u2019s kitchen, I\u2019d rush to do it as quickly as possible. I didn\u2019t want to run into any of my colleagues. I had this fear people would think I was distracted or not working hard enough. There\u2019s still a stigma surrounding breastfeeding; it\u2019s viewed as a private activity which doesn\u2019t belong in the workplace.\u201d Student parents face specific financial pressures. For Sarkissian, UK childcare fees \u2013 around \u00a312,000 a year \u2013 are unaffordable, and this is with the university\u2019s discounted rate. The family are considering travelling back to Canada where they can afford to live, and where childcare is sufficiently subsidised. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a partner supporting me, I couldn\u2019t do this degree. It\u2019s 100% contingent on my husband being able to take time off from paid employment and take care of the baby during the day.\u201d For single parent Summer Qassim, waking up at 4.30am is how she balances her master\u2019s degree with caring for her two children, aged six and seven. \u201cIt asks a lot of my body,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I have a 9.30am seminar, everything has to be done by 6.30am, before I get the kids ready for school.\u201d Where a partner could help in the absence of affordable childcare, Qassim lacks support. \u201cI had to get neighbours to sit with my kids during their school holidays, when I had classes,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt awful. Someone suggested setting up a childcare camp in my college, but I was the only student who needed it. This is where funding can really help single parents, but most funding doesn\u2019t acknowledge children. There\u2019s this assumption that if you have kids, it\u2019s your responsibility and you\u2019re on your own.\u201d While Qassim describes her department as \u201cgreat\u201d, with professors who changed class schedules for her and lent her books, she believes universities need to recognise student parents as a minority. \u201cI bet there are so many students with children who haven\u2019t even thought about applying. I want them to know that they can, and it won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s possible.\u201d Mohanaprakas, who graduated in 2014, says: \u201cI want to show women in my position that they can achieve anything they want.\u201d Observing the determination of student parents, it\u2019s clear that pregnancy is not a barrier. But the onus should not be entirely on individuals to prove their children will not get in the way of systems that could easily be more accessible and welcoming. Student parents make fantastic students. You can\u2019t balance a degree and the overwhelming job of parenting without being hardworking and resilient. I\u2019m even more determined to succeed now I\u2019m studying for my daughter\u2019s future, as well as my own.",

Yet making a second vote happen would require tearing up much of what we consider to be the elementary workings of British parliamentary democracy. Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">June 2016 referendum</a>, MPs have repeatedly voted in support of the result, in the name of implementing a decision taken by a majority of the electorate. Many seem to forget that between the original Brexit vote and today, we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">a general election</a>. Conservative and Labour parties both committed themselves in their manifestos to implementing the referendum result. Only the Liberal Democrats could say that they opposed Brexit in an election that saw them pick up only a handful more seats than the catastrophic 2015 election.

Parliament would in effect be seeking, in a Brechtian fashion, to dissolve \u201cthe people\u201d and put another in place that will vote differently in a second referendum.</p> \n<p>Why should it not be possible to change one\u2019s mind in a democracy? Of course it should be, but calls for a second referendum have very little to do with a changing of minds and more to do with a hardening of views. What lies behind the call for another vote is a belief that those who voted to leave in June 2016 should change their minds.

It would also limit the UK's ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence, as the UK would no longer have MEPs or a seat on the European Council. It also isn't entirely clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/efta-countries-wary-of-commons-interest-in-norway-brexit-option\">the UK would be welcomed into Efta</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This is what the second referendum campaigners hang their arguments on, so it merits some scrutiny. At the heart of it is an epistemic claim: people did not understand what was at stake and now that they do, we should give them a chance to vote differently.

      "bodyText": "A health food brownie containing dates and brown rice bran has been deemed a cake \u2013 and so free from VAT charges \u2013 after a judge taste-tested the product alongside Mr Kipling\u2019s French fancies and Tunnock\u2019s teacakes. Pulsin could reclaim up to \u00a3300,000 from HMRC after Judge Amanda Brown ruled in the Gloucestershire-based manufacturer\u2019s favour, saying the company\u2019s Raw Choc Brownies would \u201cabsolutely not look out of place\u201d at \u201ca cricket or sporting tea\u201d. Brown dismissed Pulsin\u2019s claims that the brownies were \u201cnot sweet enough\u201d to be considered confectionery, on which VAT is charged, but said this did not exclude them from being cakes. Unlike sweets, cakes are considered to be a staple food and therefore zero-rated for VAT. Biscuits are also zero-rated unless they are a luxury item, which usually means they have chocolate on top. Brown said the ingredients used in making the brownies, the manufacturing method, their taste and texture were all \u201cconsistent with those of a cake\u201d. She said: \u201cWith the rise in obesity the public look for cakes different in nature to those of the 1970s. \u201cPut alongside a slice of traditional Victoria sponge, a French fancy and a vanilla slice or chocolate eclair, the products may look out of place. \u201cHowever, put alongside a plate of brownies or, for instance, at a cricket or sporting tea, where it is more likely that bought and individually wrapped cakes will be served on a plate, the products would absolutely not stand out as unusual.\u201d The dispute began in 2016 when Pulsin said it had wrongly been paying VAT on the products for four years. An HMRC spokesman said: \u201cWe are carefully considering the decision in this case.\u201d Brown\u2019s ruling referred to the 1991 Jaffa Cakes case when McVitie\u2019s successfully argued that the product was a cake and not a biscuit and so not liable for VAT. A tribunal determined that certain characteristics of the Jaffa Cake were cake-like, including the ingredients and texture, but it was also the size and shape of a biscuit, packaged and sold alongside biscuits and presented to be eaten with the fingers and not, as might be expected of a cake, eaten with a fork. The product was nevertheless determined to be a cake.",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s prime minister has denied having secret plans to introduce checks at the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Leo Varadkar was accused by the leader of Ireland\u2019s opposition of keeping plans from voters after his deputy was overheard telling his transport minister he should avoid talking about checks on the border. \u201cIt seems there is a private understanding and knowledge of a border in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit but at all costs that private understanding must not be shared with the public,\u201d said the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, during leaders\u2019 questions in the D\u00e1il. \u201cIt\u2019s like the scene in Fawlty Towers: \u2018Whatever you do don\u2019t mention the war,\u2019\u201d added Martin, whose party is supporting Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael in a confidence and supply deal similar to Theresa May\u2019s deal with the DUP. The row over border checks erupted after the transport minister, Shane Ross, told reporters at a press conference after May\u2019s Commons defeat on Tuesday he \u201cwould anticipate that there would be checks\u201d on lorries coming from Scotland to the Republic of Ireland via Northern Ireland. In an unguarded comment caught on microphone after the press conference, he asked Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, whether he should have made the remark. Coveney replied: \u201cYes, but we can\u2019t get into where they\u2019ll be at this stage. They could be in the sea, they could be \u2026 But once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we\u2019ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.\u201d Ross responded: \u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Coming under pressure during leaders\u2019 questions, Varadkar said: \u201cWe are not planning for checks on the land border in Northern Ireland.\u201d All Coveney\u2019s remarks proved, he said, is \u201cthat if you use the wrong words, or you say things in the wrong way, people will misinterpret that as meaning a secret plan and there is no such secret plan\u201d. \u201cWe had a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. I remember it well during the Troubles \u2026 and before the single market in 1993,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember going there as a teenager. I remember the customs checks, I remember the 24-hour rule, I remember seeing soldiers, and I never want to see any of that ever again.\u201d Pressed on how the government could possibly avoid mandatory checks on the border to protect the single market, Varadkar said that was for Brexiters who voted against May\u2019s deal to sort out. Hitting out at Conservative MPs such as Owen Paterson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson who say the border issue is a fiction, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for those who rejected that to say there isn\u2019t going to be a hard border because everyone says [so]. \u201cThe only way we can avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is having an agreement on customs, common customs union and regulatory alignment and that\u2019s what we negotiated in the withdrawal agreement and the backstop.\u201d \u201cWe have come up with the solution, we have it in the agreement,\u201d he said, adding that if Westminster opted for no deal it would still have to honour the border promises. \u201cIt is now for those who rejected that to honour their commitment to us that there will be no hard border in island of Ireland \u2013 the ball is very much in their court,\u201d Varadkar continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will be able to come up with a solution very different [to the withdrawal agreement].\u201d His remarks come after the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, also claimed the border fears were exaggerated and that Ireland was refusing to come up with a solution. \u201cFor those of us who lived on the border and who were attacked by the IRA, we know that the IRA escaped across that border, so it was not a hard border, nobody wants to go back to that,\u201d she told U105.8 FM radio. \u201cIt takes the will to look for solutions and the regrettable thing is the Republic of Ireland has not been in the solution-finding mode.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>After a Banksy mural <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46771722\">appeared on his Port Talbot garage last month</a>, Ian Lewis found himself facing a \u201cvery, very stressful\u201d battle to protect the artwork from thieves and vandals. Here, four people share their own, very different experiences of being \u201cBanskied\u201d.</p> <h2>\u201cPeople went, \u2018We love the house, but we\u2019re not buying it with that graffiti on it\u2019\u201d</h2> <p><em><strong>Clik! Clack! Booom, </strong></em><em><strong>Cato Street, Bristol (2003)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>David Anslow, property owner: </strong>I had a house in Easton, Bristol \u2013 where <a href=\"http://www.banksy.co.uk/\">Banksy</a> used to hang out \u2013 which I was renting out to students. One day, one of the students phoned up to ask if his \u201cgraffiti artist friend\u201d could do some artwork on the side. I thought it would be pretty cool but didn\u2019t think much more about it. Years later, a friend of ours suddenly said, \u201cDid you know you\u2019ve got a Banksy on your house?\u201d He showed me Banksy\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece\">Wall and Piece</a>, and there was our house, with a 32-foot mural on it, the full width of the building. It reminded me of <a href=\"https://www.pablopicasso.org/guernica.jsp\">Picasso\u2019s Guernica</a>.</p> <p>The crazy thing is that at the time we were trying to sell the house, but couldn\u2019t sell it because of the graffiti. People went, \u201cWe love the house, but we\u2019re not buying it with all that stuff on the side.\u201d Then we had this bright idea of selling the Banksy and throwing the house in for free as a publicity stunt for the urban art gallery <a href=\"https://www.redpropeller.co.uk/\">Red Propeller</a> we were starting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8438dfb31c747d367927f5c1d38132eed9a2c0e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8438dfb31c747d367927f5c1d38132eed9a2c0e9/0_301_2514_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Banksy for sale \u2013 with free house!\u2019 ...

The phone started ringing day and night. An Australian offered \u00a3400,000. Someone from Los Angeles wanted to take the entire wall to California \u2013 the house would have fallen down. When the council sent someone to clean it off, the local people went mad and chased them down the street: we were all very protective of the Banksy. But once the news got round, someone broke into the house, smashed it up and chucked buckets of red paint all over the picture. It was ruined, but then every graffiti artist in Bristol wanted to tag it, so it became this collage of graffiti art, with the remnants of the Banksy still visible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the council sent someone to clean it off, the locals went mad and chased them down the street</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When it all quietened down, the house sold for around its value: \u00a3160,000. Part of the reason Banksy goes incognito is because he got into trouble with the council for defacing public property.</p> <h2>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t suck that probably the most famous artist in the world today wants to paint your property.\u201d</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7db2df2b516df5662f231cf972715855065ad68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7db2df2b516df5662f231cf972715855065ad68/0_126_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banksy Graffiti Murals Pop Up Around New Orleans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Looters, Elysian Fields, New Orleans (2008)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Sean Cummings, property developer: </strong>Banksy visited New Orleans in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/hurricanegustav.naturaldisasters2\">Hurricane Gustav</a>. Through an intermediary I was asked if he could put something on my warehouse, which is on a prominent boulevard. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t suck that probably the most famous artist in the world today wants to paint your property.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t told when it would happen, but then the next day people started calling, saying, \u201cHave you seen what\u2019s on your building?\u201d There was this giant mural. Looters isn\u2019t subtle [it depicts two National Guards taking a TV out of a window]. There were reports of looting after Hurricane Katrina and Gustav and he\u2019s obviously channelled that into his wry contempt for authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"047c6516ecf366f79082012ef55f0be9303d6b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/047c6516ecf366f79082012ef55f0be9303d6b48/848_882_2279_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caretaker Tyrone Bonner poses with the restored mural in an undisclosed New Orleans warehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caretaker Tyrone Bonner poses with the restored mural in an undisclosed New Orleans warehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerald Herbert/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can draw a line from when [early graffiti artist] <a href=\"https://al-diaz.com/about/\">Al Diaz</a> and a 19-year old <a href=\"http://basquiat.com/\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> were running around downtown Manhattan and street art was thought of as vandalism but had the beginnings of social commentary, to Banksy.</p> <p>It\u2019s rare to find someone so creative with both image and text. I love his quotes, such as \u201cThe poet produces poems, the painter produces paintings, the criminal produces crimes. If you can do all three at once, you can really confuse the shit out of them.\u201d</p> <p>I knew Looters was a controversial piece, so we protected it with plexiglass, which failed miserably. Other graffiti artists tagged it, people put placards over it; then it almost burned in a fire. Amazingly, a guy from the New Orleans fire department recognised it as a Banksy and protected it from the blaze. By then there were 11 layers of paint, paper and glue on top of the original work. After midnight one night we cut out that whole section of wall, put it on a tractor trailer and hauled it away for restoration. It took nearly four years after the fire to get back to the original paint. <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/expo/erry-2018/05/15a8eb85561509/see_the_17_banksy_paintings_in.html\">Banksy did 17 pieces in New Orleans</a> \u2013 this is one of only three that survived. It\u2019s currently in a warehouse, but we want to allow the piece to spread its message, so in March it goes on display at my <a href=\"https://www.ihhotel.com/the-story/history\">International House hotel</a>. We\u2019re going to have to dismantle the entrance to get it in.

I\u2019m a keen photographer, so got straight down there. It was an ace atmosphere, with busloads of people arriving and taxi drivers bringing people to see it. I had a tingly feeling looking at the mural, and the thought that Banksy had been to Hull and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/hull-after-brexit-will-the-city-of-culture-regret-voting-out\">left a political message about Brexit</a> and division on a disused/raised bridge that separates two halves of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89e27a5519c6395a9086d07e03082e90a8a1bc35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89e27a5519c6395a9086d07e03082e90a8a1bc35/0_0_893_816/500.jpg\" alt=\"Banksy\u2019s acknowledgment of the Hull mural, 27 January 2018.\" width=\"500\" height=\"457\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banksy\u2019s acknowledgment of the Hull mural, 27 January 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram.com/banksy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BebMS9ZDaM_/\">Banksy put it on his Instagram</a>, which verified it as genuine, but on the second night my missus was on Facebook and saw that it had been vandalised. It had been intact for two days, which isn\u2019t bad for a Banksy.</p> <p>Social media was full of people ranting and raving, but I wanted to do something about it, so headed down with my ladders. It\u2019s a three by four foot mural, but you need ladders to get up to the top. I was hoping the paint would still be wet, but water wouldn\u2019t touch it. Loads of people were turning up to help, so I did the top on my ladders while a girl rubbed at the bottom. We tried white spirit. I didn\u2019t even think \u201cWhat if it brings off the Banksy?\u201d which is stupid really, but gradually the picture came up underneath: it was magical.</p> <p>Someone at a local gallery sniffed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they do it on canvas? That\u2019s the place for art\u201d. The council covered it with Perspex, which steams up so you can\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s left a legacy on the city. The <a href=\"http://www.spraycreative.co.uk/\">Hull Spray Creative</a> asked for permission to turn the whole area into a street art gallery so if you drive around the area now it\u2019s a vibrant mass of ever-evolving graffiti art \u2013 because of Banksy.</p> <h2>\u201cThe only way he could have painted it was to sail out on a boat\u201d</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37db9570da1090d421dc44d7b9664691afe1b5b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37db9570da1090d421dc44d7b9664691afe1b5b3/0_250_4345_2607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Grim Reaper paddles past the Thekla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Very much alive \u2026 the Grim Reaper paddles past the Thekla</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lookinglost/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>The Grim Reaper, the Thekla, Bristol (2003)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Pat Somers, senior promotions manager: </strong>The story goes that Banksy initially painted <a href=\"http://www.theklabristol.co.uk/\">the Thekla</a> [a floating vessel live venue] with just a simple \u201cBanksy\u201d tag on the ship\u2019s side, which the harbour master at the time painted over. So Banksy returned to paint the Grim Reaper in a rowing boat, which we believe represents the harbour master.</p> <p>The Thekla is such a hub for Bristol\u2019s music and creative community that it\u2019s almost certain Banksy would have come to gigs and parties here. He also had his first Bristol exhibition at the nearby Severnshed bar, so was definitely spending time in the vicinity. There\u2019s always been talk that there were also a couple of his famous rat stencils inside the venue at some point, but they were long gone when I arrived in 2006.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Thekla are very proud of his success and our artwork. It's an honour to be Banksied</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Banksy painted the Grim Reaper on the waterside of the moored boat, so the only way he could have done it would have been by sailing out in a rowing boat or something, most likely under cover of darkness. The Reaper is quite large \u2013 a couple of metres, and because of its position, it was unlikely to ever be stolen. It wouldn\u2019t just have caused a lot of attention in the harbour, but potentially have sunk the boat! It was probably more hassle than any vandal would be bothered with. But with it being so close to the waterline the big problem was deterioration.</p> <p>When we renovated the Thekla in the dry dock in 2014, we removed the Grim Reaper to preserve and restore the artwork, and came up with the idea of using the original space for other Bristol street artists. Inkie came to mind immediately due to his connections with Banksy and he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5czQdcVFNE\">happy to come and paint on the boat while it was still out of the water</a>. The Grim Reaper is now <a href=\"https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/m-shed/whats-on\">free to view in the M-Shed museum</a>.</p> <p>Banksy polarises opinion even in his home city, with some seeing him as a vandal, but they\u2019re probably in the minority these days. The Thekla team are very proud of his success and our artwork. It\u2019s an honour to be Banksied.</p>",

Here, four people share their own, very different experiences of being \u201cBanskied\u201d. \u201cPeople went, \u2018We love the house, but we\u2019re not buying it with that graffiti on it\u2019\u201d Clik! Clack! Booom, Cato Street, Bristol (2003) David Anslow, property owner: I had a house in Easton, Bristol \u2013 where Banksy used to hang out \u2013 which I was renting out to students. One day, one of the students phoned up to ask if his \u201cgraffiti artist friend\u201d could do some artwork on the side. I thought it would be pretty cool but didn\u2019t think much more about it. Years later, a friend of ours suddenly said, \u201cDid you know you\u2019ve got a Banksy on your house?\u201d He showed me Banksy\u2019s book, Wall and Piece, and there was our house, with a 32-foot mural on it, the full width of the building. It reminded me of Picasso\u2019s Guernica. The crazy thing is that at the time we were trying to sell the house, but couldn\u2019t sell it because of the graffiti. People went, \u201cWe love the house, but we\u2019re not buying it with all that stuff on the side.\u201d Then we had this bright idea of selling the Banksy and throwing the house in for free as a publicity stunt for the urban art gallery Red Propeller we were starting. I wanted to make sure any buyer would preserve the mural, but then it all kicked off. The phone started ringing day and night. An Australian offered \u00a3400,000. Someone from Los Angeles wanted to take the entire wall to California \u2013 the house would have fallen down. When the council sent someone to clean it off, the local people went mad and chased them down the street: we were all very protective of the Banksy. But once the news got round, someone broke into the house, smashed it up and chucked buckets of red paint all over the picture. It was ruined, but then every graffiti artist in Bristol wanted to tag it, so it became this collage of graffiti art, with the remnants of the Banksy still visible. When it all quietened down, the house sold for around its value: \u00a3160,000. Part of the reason Banksy goes incognito is because he got into trouble with the council for defacing public property. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suck that probably the most famous artist in the world today wants to paint your property.\u201d Looters, Elysian Fields, New Orleans (2008) Sean Cummings, property developer: Banksy visited New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Through an intermediary I was asked if he could put something on my warehouse, which is on a prominent boulevard. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t suck that probably the most famous artist in the world today wants to paint your property. I wasn\u2019t told when it would happen, but then the next day people started calling, saying, \u201cHave you seen what\u2019s on your building?\u201d There was this giant mural. Looters isn\u2019t subtle [it depicts two National Guards taking a TV out of a window]. There were reports of looting after Hurricane Katrina and Gustav and he\u2019s obviously channelled that into his wry contempt for authority. You can draw a line from when [early graffiti artist] Al Diaz and a 19-year old Jean-Michel Basquiat were running around downtown Manhattan and street art was thought of as vandalism but had the beginnings of social commentary, to Banksy. It\u2019s rare to find someone so creative with both image and text. I love his quotes, such as \u201cThe poet produces poems, the painter produces paintings, the criminal produces crimes. If you can do all three at once, you can really confuse the shit out of them.\u201d I knew Looters was a controversial piece, so we protected it with plexiglass, which failed miserably. Other graffiti artists tagged it, people put placards over it; then it almost burned in a fire. Amazingly, a guy from the New Orleans fire department recognised it as a Banksy and protected it from the blaze. By then there were 11 layers of paint, paper and glue on top of the original work. After midnight one night we cut out that whole section of wall, put it on a tractor trailer and hauled it away for restoration. It took nearly four years after the fire to get back to the original paint. Banksy did 17 pieces in New Orleans \u2013 this is one of only three that survived. It\u2019s currently in a warehouse, but we want to allow the piece to spread its message, so in March it goes on display at my International House hotel. We\u2019re going to have to dismantle the entrance to get it in. It\u2019s absurd, I know, but very Banksy. \u201cI wanted to save it, so headed down there with my ladders.\u201d Draw the Raised Bridge, Scott Street Bridge, Hull (2018) Jason Fanthorpe, window cleaner: I live two miles from Scott Street bridge and one night one of the local Facebook groups was buzzing with the news that Banksy had painted it. I\u2019m a keen photographer, so got straight down there. It was an ace atmosphere, with busloads of people arriving and taxi drivers bringing people to see it. I had a tingly feeling looking at the mural, and the thought that Banksy had been to Hull and left a political message about Brexit and division on a disused/raised bridge that separates two halves of the city. Banksy put it on his Instagram, which verified it as genuine, but on the second night my missus was on Facebook and saw that it had been vandalised. It had been intact for two days, which isn\u2019t bad for a Banksy. Social media was full of people ranting and raving, but I wanted to do something about it, so headed down with my ladders. It\u2019s a three by four foot mural, but you need ladders to get up to the top. I was hoping the paint would still be wet, but water wouldn\u2019t touch it. Loads of people were turning up to help, so I did the top on my ladders while a girl rubbed at the bottom. We tried white spirit. I didn\u2019t even think \u201cWhat if it brings off the Banksy?\u201d which is stupid really, but gradually the picture came up underneath: it was magical. Someone at a local gallery sniffed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they do it on canvas? That\u2019s the place for art\u201d. The council covered it with Perspex, which steams up so you can\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s left a legacy on the city. The Hull Spray Creative asked for permission to turn the whole area into a street art gallery so if you drive around the area now it\u2019s a vibrant mass of ever-evolving graffiti art \u2013 because of Banksy. \u201cThe only way he could have painted it was to sail out on a boat\u201d The Grim Reaper, the Thekla, Bristol (2003) Pat Somers, senior promotions manager: The story goes that Banksy initially painted the Thekla [a floating vessel live venue] with just a simple \u201cBanksy\u201d tag on the ship\u2019s side, which the harbour master at the time painted over. So Banksy returned to paint the Grim Reaper in a rowing boat, which we believe represents the harbour master. The Thekla is such a hub for Bristol\u2019s music and creative community that it\u2019s almost certain Banksy would have come to gigs and parties here. He also had his first Bristol exhibition at the nearby Severnshed bar, so was definitely spending time in the vicinity. There\u2019s always been talk that there were also a couple of his famous rat stencils inside the venue at some point, but they were long gone when I arrived in 2006. Banksy painted the Grim Reaper on the waterside of the moored boat, so the only way he could have done it would have been by sailing out in a rowing boat or something, most likely under cover of darkness. The Reaper is quite large \u2013 a couple of metres, and because of its position, it was unlikely to ever be stolen. It wouldn\u2019t just have caused a lot of attention in the harbour, but potentially have sunk the boat! It was probably more hassle than any vandal would be bothered with. But with it being so close to the waterline the big problem was deterioration. When we renovated the Thekla in the dry dock in 2014, we removed the Grim Reaper to preserve and restore the artwork, and came up with the idea of using the original space for other Bristol street artists. Inkie came to mind immediately due to his connections with Banksy and he was happy to come and paint on the boat while it was still out of the water. The Grim Reaper is now free to view in the M-Shed museum. Banksy polarises opinion even in his home city, with some seeing him as a vandal, but they\u2019re probably in the minority these days. The Thekla team are very proud of his success and our artwork. It\u2019s an honour to be Banksied.",

The prime minister responded to Tuesday\u2019s historic defeat in the meaningful vote by pledging to speak to \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d to identify a deal that could secure a majority.

      "body": "<p>Films are doing drugs again. The appeal is irresistible \u2013 the pure hit of human drama that comes with the needle or the rolled-up banknote. Now, a pair of new movies find two actors at opposite ends of their careers deep in the mire. In one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/08/beautiful-boy-review-timothee-chalamet-shines-in-grim-addiction-drama\">Beautiful Boy</a>, modish male lead Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Nic Sheff, a young addict lost to methamphetamine as his father David (Steve Carell) helplessly looks on. While in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/12/the-mule-review-clint-eastwoods-drug-running-drama-is-a-slow-misfire\">The Mule</a>, Clint Eastwood directs himself as Earl Stone, a 90-year-old horticulturalist recruited by a Mexican cartel to ferry cocaine around America. Both are based on real life, in the case of the Sheffs via parallel memoirs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/13/steve-carell-and-timothee-chalamet-on-drugs-disillusionment-and-playing-father-and-son\">Steve Carell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet on drugs, disillusionment and playing father and son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Drugs are nothing if not repetitive, and so it is for the drugs movie. Artful hard work, Beautiful Boy also feels almost cosily familiar \u2013 Chalamet passing from curious kid to black-eyed wreck, tumbling through the landmarks of familial heartbreak. While his poison is crystal meth rather than heroin, the beats haven\u2019t changed since Frank Sinatra\u2019s hapless jazz drummer Frankie Machine shot up in 1955\u2019s <a href=\"http://emanuellevy.com/pop-culture/man-with-the-golden-arm-hollywood-on-drugs-7/\">The Man With the Golden Arm</a>.</p> <p>That at least partly explains why Beautiful Boy \u2013 well acted and sensitively handled \u2013 has the air of ancient history. The events it portrays took place in the 2000s, but older days are everywhere. On screen, as in life, David Sheff is a baby boomer magazine journalist, his career built on <a href=\"https://www.davidsheff.com/music/\">profiles of 70s rock stars</a> for Rolling Stone. The young Nic wigs out in a Nirvana T-shirt, tipping the wink to Kurt Cobain, undone by heroin before his suicide. Despite his background, David is baffled by the world into which his son descends \u2013 the naive parent staring distraught across the generation gap. Same as it ever was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2eeb922b8356ca99343d0ecbfe906b968d320e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eeb922b8356ca99343d0ecbfe906b968d320e5c/0_30_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm, 1955.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm, 1955.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Kornman/United Artists/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then with drugs, it often feels that way. Almost half a century since Richard Nixon formally announced the US war on drugs, Donald Trump last week argued that his border wall would halt the flow of heroin and cocaine into America. In Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/23/qanda.markoliver\">our drugs laws</a> remain in the state of nervous confusion they have been for a generation.</p> <p>Drug movies don\u2019t help. Maybe it would be unfair to expect otherwise. Film is not a medium built for inner space. The one place it can\u2019t take us is where an experience with drugs actually happens \u2013 inside the mind of the person using them. Even visually, things get lost in translation.

In Beautiful Boy, David Sheff is a babe in the chemical woods, innocent of everything but a long-ago occasional joint.

But that would have spoiled the scene, of course, and added too much nuance to the relationship at the centre of the film. Ah well. Some scripts just need a little something to hit the emotional high notes.</p> <p>What drugs can do very efficiently is reduce life to an endless scratchy hunt for a fix. Admirable cinema has been made from exactly that \u2013 Lenny Abrahamson\u2019s flawless Dublin tragicomedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jun/03/7\">Adam &amp; Paul</a> saw heroin addiction as one long frantic non-event interrupted only by bleak sudden ends.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNeN9ZU2CSM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eNeN9ZU2CSM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for The Panic in Needle Park.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But frantic non-events and bleak sudden ends are unpopular at the box office, and junkies don\u2019t make great heroes. For American cinema, the answer came with scripts that subtly upped the chances of redemption \u2013 and a very specific approach to casting. In July 1971, a month after <a href=\"https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2016/06/26404/\">Nixon called drug abuse America\u2019s \u201cpublic enemy number one\u201d</a>, 20th Century Fox released The Panic in Needle Park, a snapshot of Manhattan addicts that gave its grimy verit\u00e9 an exciting new face \u2013 Al Pacino, in his first starring role. He had the charisma of Sinatra with the tang of the counterculture, the addict as pop idol. (The film-makers had originally planned to cast Jim Morrison, singer of the Doors, dead by the time the movie was released.)</p> <p>The persona went mainstream. Fuelled by the rhetoric coming out of the White House, a drug habit soon passed as youthful rebellion, a death wish middle finger to the straight world. Eventually, that filtered down into a new generation of film-makers smitten with the scuzz of junkiedom. Matt Dillon, last seen as the serial killer of Lars von Trier\u2019s The House That Jack Built, was a Hollywood cover star when he played the rogueish anti-hero of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Rs8c08hM8\">Drugstore Cowboy</a>. In the first boyish flush of his celebrity, Leonardo DiCaprio starred in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyfX9UHyxgY\">The Basketball Diaries</a> as underground writer Jim Carroll, forced on to the streets by his teenage dance with heroin. It was a stellar performance \u2013 young, damned and about to star in Titanic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c312a1b23ccc95d573e44137a1242c9ac183457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c312a1b23ccc95d573e44137a1242c9ac183457/0_59_1813_1088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and James Madio in The Basketball Diaries, 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Teenage dance with heroin\u2019 \u2026 Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and James Madio in The Basketball Diaries, 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/New Line/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yes, you\u2019re right \u2013 these were all men. Occasionally, a woman was allowed along for the ride (Germany produced the stark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG06RaXb3i8\">Christiane F</a>), but generally drugs on screen were declared a man\u2019s game.

Now there is Chalamet. The message was remarkably consistent: drugs might lay waste to male American beauty but my God, there will be some acting first.</p> <p>You\u2019re right again \u2013 they were white men too. Even as crack engulfed US inner cities, big-ticket dramas of drug abuse found black and Latino faces seen, if they were seen at all, only as dealers. That queasy dynamic lives on.

In the oddly mercurial way of Eastwood, he might actually have made a film that debunks Trump more brutally than the commentators quietly pointing out that most drugs enter the US in legal border crossings. In The Mule, however the powder gets into the country, it is then distributed by an American \u2013 as played by Clint Eastwood, with all the attendant cultural baggage. His whiteness is the centre of the story, allowing him the freedom from suspicion prized by the cartel (a point given an exclamation mark with the racial profiling of an innocent Hispanic driver). The same goes for his age. A war veteran wilfully helping destroy American lives?

      "bodyText": "Films are doing drugs again. The appeal is irresistible \u2013 the pure hit of human drama that comes with the needle or the rolled-up banknote. Now, a pair of new movies find two actors at opposite ends of their careers deep in the mire. In one, Beautiful Boy, modish male lead Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Nic Sheff, a young addict lost to methamphetamine as his father David (Steve Carell) helplessly looks on. While in The Mule, Clint Eastwood directs himself as Earl Stone, a 90-year-old horticulturalist recruited by a Mexican cartel to ferry cocaine around America. Both are based on real life, in the case of the Sheffs via parallel memoirs. Drugs are nothing if not repetitive, and so it is for the drugs movie. Artful hard work, Beautiful Boy also feels almost cosily familiar \u2013 Chalamet passing from curious kid to black-eyed wreck, tumbling through the landmarks of familial heartbreak. While his poison is crystal meth rather than heroin, the beats haven\u2019t changed since Frank Sinatra\u2019s hapless jazz drummer Frankie Machine shot up in 1955\u2019s The Man With the Golden Arm. That at least partly explains why Beautiful Boy \u2013 well acted and sensitively handled \u2013 has the air of ancient history. The events it portrays took place in the 2000s, but older days are everywhere. On screen, as in life, David Sheff is a baby boomer magazine journalist, his career built on profiles of 70s rock stars for Rolling Stone. The young Nic wigs out in a Nirvana T-shirt, tipping the wink to Kurt Cobain, undone by heroin before his suicide. Despite his background, David is baffled by the world into which his son descends \u2013 the naive parent staring distraught across the generation gap. Same as it ever was. But then with drugs, it often feels that way. Almost half a century since Richard Nixon formally announced the US war on drugs, Donald Trump last week argued that his border wall would halt the flow of heroin and cocaine into America. In Britain, our drugs laws remain in the state of nervous confusion they have been for a generation. Drug movies don\u2019t help. Maybe it would be unfair to expect otherwise. Film is not a medium built for inner space. The one place it can\u2019t take us is where an experience with drugs actually happens \u2013 inside the mind of the person using them. Even visually, things get lost in translation.

Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov against Uruguay\u2019s Pablo Cuevas is another one to look out for.</p> <p>As for the women, we have the Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber up first on Rod Laver Arena. The German meets Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil and will expect to win comfortably. Whether the same can be said of Maria Sharapova is less certain, though - the former champion had a good win over Harriet Dart on Monday, but she\u2019s looked past her peak in the past two years and could have to work hard against Sweden\u2019s Rebecca Peterson. Elsewhere we have Petra Kvitova versus Irina-Camelia Begu. That\u2019s enough to be getting on with, isn\u2019t it?</p> </div>   </div>",

The defending champion sails serenely into the third round, where she\u2019ll meet Caroline Wozniacki, after crushing her Swedish opponent. That was a mighty performance from the former champion. As someone who is now very hungry, I would like Maria Sharapova to get this done soon. She leads 6-2, 4-1. If, as looks likely, Maria Sharapova makes it through to the third round - as I write, she breaks again to lead 6-2, 3-0 - it will be interesting to see her level against Caroline Wozniacki. A former champ against the defending champ, that one. Sharapova hasn\u2019t mustered much since returning from that ban in 2017 but her level here has been high so far. Wozniacki will be wary of the 30th seed. An early break in the second set puts Sharapova in a commanding position. Thoughts turn to tomorrow\u2019s action. Johanna Konta meets Garbine Muguruza. There\u2019s Serena Williams versus Eugenie Bouchard. And, in a repeat of the 2008 men\u2019s final, Novak Djokovic against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who\u2019s here this year on a wild card. The first set goes to Maria Sharapova. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much hope for Rebecca Peterson. Maria Sharapova is cruising, breaking again to lead 5-2. She\u2019ll serve for the first set. Maria Sharapova\u2019s made a fast start, breaking quickly to lead 2-1 against Rebecca Peterson. Meanwhile here\u2019s a match report for your perusal. The tennis isn\u2019t done yet - Maria Sharapova and Rebecca Peterson are out on court now. Hooray for them. This is the final match of day three. Alex de Minaur has fought through the nerves and the tiredness to seal his place in the third round, sending the home fans wild on Margaret Court Arena. The only problem for the Australian wonderkid? He\u2019s goig to have to play Rafa Nadal after playing five gruelling sets. Still, this 6-4, 6-2, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3 win is one to savour for the 27th seed. He\u2019ll give Nadal a game. Over on Margaret Court Arena, they\u2019re witnessing one hell of a match between Alex de Minaur and Henri Laaksonen. The tension\u2019s high as the home fans attempt to get the young Australian over the line in the fifth set. We join them with Laaksonen serving at 3-4 \u2013 and just in time to see De Minaur break! He\u2019ll serve for a place in the third round. Ripping that forehand, Nadal gives himself a match point at 40-30. Ebden keeps fighting, saves it and earns a break point. Nadal scrubs it out with a firm serve. Then he earns a second chance. No more messing around. Nadal takes his opportunity this time and moves into the third round. He\u2019s looking good after recent injury problems. But Henri Laaksonen isn\u2019t giving up. After a long slog through deuce, he breaks back in the fifth set. Alex de Minaur can\u2019t believe it. There\u2019s better news for Australian fans as far as Alex de Minaur is concerned. The youngster has the early break in the fifth set against Henri Laaksonen. Matthew Ebden\u2019s earning some generous applause from the home fans with some spirited play on Rod Laver Arena. All a bit late, though, given Nadal\u2019s well on the way to winning in straight sets. It\u2019s a doddle for Rafa Nadal, who leads by two sets and a break on Rod Laver Arena. Day three\u2019s almost over. But we\u2019re still waiting for Maria Sharapova and Rebecca Peterson, who have been delayed by the shenanigans between Alex de Minaur and Henri Laaksonen. Speaking of matches going the distance, Alex de Minaur is going to have to do it the hard way to reach the third round. This is an impressive fightback from Henri Laaksonen, who\u2019s taken the fourth set 6-4. A brave fight from John Millman, but to no avail. The Australian\u2019s out after losing 6-3, 6-1, 3-6, 6-7, 6-4 to Roberto Bautista Agut, who plays the No10 seed Karen Khachanov in the next round. A Matthew Ebden return sails wide and Rafa Nadal crunches into a 6-3, 6-2 lead. Ebden was fearless early on, but reality\u2019s taken hold now. Just nipped off to get a coffee. And have returned to see that Bautista Agut has the crucial break in the fifth set against John Millman. The Spaniard will serve at 4-3. Alex de Minaur has regrouped, breaking back to get the fourth set back on serve against Henri Laaksonen. Meanwhile it\u2019s tight in the fifth set between Roberto Bautista Agut and John Millman. Rafa Nadal doesn\u2019t have to wait long for a break at the start of the second set. He knocks on the door with enough intent to force Matthew Ebden to net. Nadal leads 6-3, 2-1 and this has the whiff of formality about it. Things are starting to unravel for Alex de Minaur. He was two sets up, he had match point in the third set, but it\u2019s Henri Laaksonen who has an early break in the fourth. De Minaur needs to regroup quickly. The first set goes to Rafa Nadal. He frowns as he looks at his box and clenches his fist. It hasn\u2019t been plain sailing but he\u2019s taken control since that botched volley from Matthew Ebden, winning the set 6-3. Sure enough, Rafa Nadal breaks, capitalising on double-faults from Matthew Ebden. He\u2019ll serve for the first set at 5-3. As for Grigor Dimitrov, the 20th seed has finally seen off Pablo Cuevas, beating the Uruguayan 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5. You have to take your hat off to John Millman, who\u2019s only gone and forced that fifth set against Roberto Bautista Agut on Hisense Arena. Bautista Agut had match points in the tie-break, but Millman\u2019s digging ridiculously deep and has sent the home fans wild as he threatens to win from two sets down. Meanwhile Alex de Minaur has been taken to a fourth set by Henri Laaksonen, who saved a match point before winning the third-set tie-break. Matthew Ebden is giving Rafa Nadal a few early problems on Rod Laver Arena. He\u2019s showing no fear and a fizzing forehand down the line earns him a break point at 3-3. Yet Nadal is strong enough the net to force deuce. Ebden earns another chance and he plays the rally magnificently - until he nets a backhand volley with Nadal stranded. Eventually Nadal holds to lead 4-3. Ebden might look back at that volley and wonder. Having served for the fourth set at 5-4, now John Millman\u2019s having to deal with the disappointment of being broken. Roberto Bautista Agut will fancy his chances of getting this done without having to go through a fifth set. We\u2019ve got three Aussie men in action now. Matthew Ebden\u2019s just held his opening service game against Rafa Nadal on Rod Laver Arena, Alex de Minaur\u2019s two sets up and battling hard in the third against Henri Laaksonen, and John Millman is threatening to force a fifth set against Roberto Bautista Agut, who\u2019s having flashbacks to his dramatic tussle with Andy Murray on Monday. On Rod Laver Arena, they\u2019ve just said hello to Rafael Nadal and Matthew Ebden. Nadal has won his only previous meeting with the world No48. Grigor Dimitrov, the 20th seed, has a grip on proceedings on Court 3 again. He leads 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 against Pablo Cuevas. As for Alex de Minaur, he\u2019s two sets up against Henri Laaksonen - though the Swiss qualifier leads 4-1 in the third set. Maia sends one final forehand wide and Kerber, who looks totally dialled in, celebrates with the look of someone who\u2019s pleased to have got the job done with such efficiency. The former champion moves on to play the Australian qualifier Kimberly Birrell, who stunned Croatia\u2019s Donna Vekic earlier. Angelique Kerber will serve for the match. She breaks when Beatriz Haddad Maia knocks a forehand wide. It\u2019s 6-2, 5-3 to the No2 seed. Alex de Minaur is serving for a two-set lead against Henri Laaksonen. Elsewhere Grigor Dimitrov has established a measure of control against Pablo Cuevas, breaking to lead in 6-3, 6-7, 3-1. There\u2019s hope yet for John Millman on Hisense Arena! The Australian\u2019s only gone and taken the third set to lift home hopes, though Roberto Bautista still leads 6-3, 6-1, 3-6. Grigor Dimitrov has been dragged into a battle by Pablo Cuevas, who\u2019s levelled it up on Court 3 after snatching the second set on a tie-break. You don\u2019t want to rely on Grigor too much. It\u2019s never a wise move. After 47 minutes, Angelique Kerber yelps \u201cCome on!\u201d as she clenches her fist and walks back to her chair with the first set in the bag. The second seed took it 6-2, which makes it look easy, though she has been inconvenienced here and there by Beatriz Haddad Maia, the Brazilian qualifier. Maia\u2019s determined not to roll over. Alex de Minaur, who could play Rafael Nadal in the third round, is a set up against Henri Laaksonen. The young Australian took it 6-4. While I was distracted by a long chat with the football editor here, Belinda Bencic went and pulled off a remarkable turnaround in the third set against Yulia Putintseva on Court 20. She was a break down but the Swiss has ended up winning 7-6, 4-6, 6-2. Bencic will play Petra Kvitova next \u2013 the Czech had an easy win over Irina-Camelia Begu. Angelique Kerber\u2019s having little trouble dealing with her Brazilian opponent so far. The German already has an early break on Rod Laver Arena \u2013 a few nice touches from Beatriz Haddad Maia haven\u2019t been enough to make an impact so far. Just to put Andy Murray\u2019s five-set defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut in context, the Spaniard leads 6-3, 5-0 against John Millman. Meanwhile Yulia Putintseva is threatening to pull off a very impressive comeback against Belinda Bencic \u2013 after losing the first set to the Swiss, the Kazakh has an early break in the decider. The first set belongs to Grigor Dimitrov on Court 3. He took it 6-3 against Pablo Cuevas. As for Petra Kvitova, she remains in control against Irina-Camelia Begu, who\u2019ll do well to fight back from a set and a break down. They\u2019re out on the two main courts. Angelique Kerber, the No2 seed and 2016 champion, meets Beatriz Haddad Maia on Rod Laver Arena, while Alex de Minaur is up against Henri Laaksonen on Margaret Court Arena. De Minaur, seeded 27th, could go deep here. Big things are expected from the young Australian. Roberto Bautista Agut, conqueror of Andy Murray in the first round, is breaking hearts again. This time the 22nd seed\u2019s foiling a home hopeful on Hisense Arena, taking the first set 6-3 off John Millman. No problems for Petra Kvitova so far. The former Wimbledon champion\u2019s taken the first set 6-1 against the outgunned Irina-Camelia Begu, who can\u2019t live with her opponent\u2019s raw power. In fast start news, Grigor Dimitrov leads 3-0 in the first set against Pablo Cuevas. You\u2019ll note that Dimitrov, a semi-finalist in 2017, is the 20th seed this year. The Bulgarian was meant to produce so much more after winning the ATP World Tour Finals two seasons ago, but it\u2019s still not really happening for him. First-round defeats to Stan Wawrinka at Wimbledon and the US Open last year were hugely disappointing. At the age of 27, we\u2019re no longer talking about a guy with potential. It\u2019s a demolition so far. Petra Kvitova earns three break points and her venomous forehand gives her a 4-0 lead. She\u2019s hitting it so hard. Begu can\u2019t live with it at all. Petra Kvitova\u2019s got her eye in early on. She\u2019s broken already against Irina-Camelia Begu and her movement looks spot on, which is always a good sign for the Czech. Over on Court 20, Belinda Bencic has snatched the first set 7-5 off Yulia Putintseva. Meanwhile Petra Kvitova and Irina-Camelia Begu are underway. Roger Federer\u2019s third round opponent? It\u2019s Taylor Fritz, who\u2019s just secured a very good win over Gael Monils, the 30th seed. The young American took it 6-3, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5). Fine margins. It was more comfortable for Karen Khachanov, the powerful young Russian winning in three sets against Yoshihito Nishioka. The 10th seed has never been in the third round here before. There\u2019s no shame in losing this one for Boulter. It\u2019s not a drubbing \u2013 but Sabalenka, two years younger than Boulter, is on a different level. The Belarusian is through to the third round and her power will make her a serious threat. Another Brit bit the dust earlier today, though Dan Evans emerged with plenty of credit after an entertaining battle with Roger Federer, who plays Gael Monfils or Taylor Fritz next. Fans on Rod Laver Arena have also seen Sloane Stephens beat Timea Babos and Ashleigh Barty beat Wang Yafan. One of the more eye-catching results on day three, meanwhile, is the USA\u2019s Frances Tiafoe beating the No5 seed Kevin Anderson in four sets. That\u2019s a top win for the highly rated American youngster. Marin Cilic is also through to the third round after beating Mackenzie McDonald, while Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Victor Troicki in four. Elsewhere Caroline Wozniacki has cruised into round three, beating Sweden\u2019s Johanna Larsson 6-1, 6-3. The defending champion will play Maria Sharapova or Rebecca Peterson next. Speaking of British tennis, it\u2019s over to Melbourne Arena, where Katie Boulter\u2019s in action against Aryna Sabalenka, the brilliant Belarusian. However it isn\u2019t going to well for Boulter. The 22-year-old from Leicester lost the first set 6-3 and finds herself a break down deep in the second. Our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell, has been nattering with Jamie Murray. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the night session on day three of the Australian Open. The main event - assuming we aren\u2019t just going to watch a stroll - is Rafael Nadal taking on Australia\u2019s Matthew Ebden, who\u2019ll have plenty of home support on Rod Laver Arena. All that shouting might not be enough, though. That\u2019s the last match of the day on that court. Elsewhere in the men\u2019s second round, Aussies will be more hopeful when they watch their rising wonderkid, Alex de Minaur, take on Henri Laaksonen. John Millman, who beat Roger Federer at last year\u2019s US Open, is also in action \u2013 he plays the 22nd seed, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat Andy Murray in five sets on Monday. Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov against Uruguay\u2019s Pablo Cuevas is another one to look out for. As for the women, we have the Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber up first on Rod Laver Arena. The German meets Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil and will expect to win comfortably. Whether the same can be said of Maria Sharapova is less certain, though - the former champion had a good win over Harriet Dart on Monday, but she\u2019s looked past her peak in the past two years and could have to work hard against Sweden\u2019s Rebecca Peterson. Elsewhere we have Petra Kvitova versus Irina-Camelia Begu. That\u2019s enough to be getting on with, isn\u2019t it?",

The Russian president criticised what he described as deliberate efforts to increase western influence in a part of the world Moscow has long regarded as falling within its own orbit. \u201cThe policy of the United States and some other western nations in the Balkans, who seek to assert their dominance in the region, has been a serious destabilising factor,\u201d he was quoting as telling Serbia\u2019s Ve\u010dernje Novosti and Politika newspapers, according to remarks released by the Kremlin. \u201cThis will eventually increase mistrust and tension in Europe, rather than improve stability.\u201d Putin, who made the comments before a visit to Belgrade, Moscow\u2019s staunchest regional ally, deplored Nato\u2019s \u201cdestructive\u201d policy of expansion in the historically volatile Balkan peninsula. \u201cWe have repeatedly said that we see Nato expansion as a relic of the cold war, an ill-informed and destructive military and political strategy,\u201d he told the papers. Last week, Macedonian MPs endorsed a landmark accord that will rename the strategic Balkan nation the Republic of North Macedonia in a move that now opens the way to Nato membership. The name-change deal, reached after almost 30 years of dispute with Greece, is expected to be ratified by lawmakers in Athens within days following a vote of confidence in the Greek parliament at midnight on Wednesday. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called the vote after the nationalist Independent Greeks party, the junior partner in his leftist-led coalition, pulled out of the government in protest over the agreement. Tsipras is expected to win the motion, with officials telling the Guardian he would probably bring the Macedonia name-change accord to parliament immediately after. Athens has blocked Skopje\u2019s entry to Nato and the EU in opposition to a name it has long argued implied territorial ambitions against Greece\u2019s own province of Macedonia. Putin, who begins his visit to Belgrade on Thursday, singled out Montenegro, saying its decision to join the western alliance in April 2017 had resulted in the country \u201cnow going through a period of political instability\u201d. On Wednesday, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also voiced concerns over perceived western meddling in the Balkans, saying Moscow had credible grounds to question the legitimacy of the process by which Macedonia had changed its name.

Similar assertions of Russian interference in Macedonia have also been made by the US and EU, with both insisting that Moscow has waged a concerted campaign to stop the ex-Yugoslav republic joining Nato. Last year, the US then defence secretary James Mattis accused Russia of using money and influence to create opposition to changing the country\u2019s name in a landmark referendum. Washington, he said, had decided to step up cooperation with Macedonia \u201cto thwart malicious cyber activity that threatens both our democracies\u201d.",

Keep us entertained and your shortcomings are really your own business. It should therefore be no problem whatsoever for us to warm to You, now showing on Netflix. An adaptation of Caroline Kepnes\u2019 novel of the same name, it\u2019s a sparky, funny tale of unreliable narrator Joe wooing aspiring writer Beck by stalking her social media accounts and manipulating his way into a relationship with her. Blanch if you like, but it wasn\u2019t so long ago you were stanning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/hannibal-episode-by-episode\">cannibal</a>.</p> <p>And this Joe is certainly a charmer. His narration is crammed with one-liners on the crass idiocies of pop culture and harsh judgments on Beck\u2019s lovers (\u201cif he came anywhere close to making you come, you\u2019d have made a Broadway show out of it\u201d) and friends (\u201cyour wealthy girlfriends have just now woken up and have nothing better to do than plan their next pointless yet Instagrammable night\u201d). Joe knows only too well that Instagram is a lie, Twitter is a botfest and Facebook a cesspit \u2013 but he also knows that\u2019s where the good stuff is. Knowledge is power and every self-revelatory nugget he mines tips the scales further in his favour in his pursuit of Beck.</p> <p>So far, so gruesome. But relating to a predator like him isn\u2019t as hard as it sounds. The way he looks out for Paco, the lonely bookish kid in the apartment next door, shows that there is a human being somewhere beneath all the puppet mastery. He has something of Humbert Humbert about him \u2013 appalling but you want to hear more. \u201cI am just a mirror,\u201d that other great practitioner of the persuasive arts Charles Manson was fond of saying. \u201cAnything you see in me is you.\u201d Perhaps his role is to reveal some uncomfortable truths about ourselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c8090b10f9c38fc17f48023793f7afceca21e00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c8090b10f9c38fc17f48023793f7afceca21e00/0_358_5366_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A modern-day Humbert Humbert \u2026 Joe in You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A modern-day Humbert Humbert \u2026 Joe in You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If so, You feels perfectly placed to explore our anxieties about social media and the dangers of distributing our identities across a series of platforms that don\u2019t care for our lives, privacy or mental health. In this, it echoes Black Mirror which made its name fanning that particular flame. You is never quite that dystopian, but it is significantly more plausible. Could a charming psychopath harvest your online presence, hack your passwords and tailor his spiel to make you fall for him? We may think we\u2019re too savvy for that, but the <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a25570880/top-passwords-2018/\">evidence</a> suggests otherwise. It\u2019s a miracle, frankly, it hasn\u2019t happened already.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s why the show has struck a nerve. While you may naturally approach You resolute to never blaming the victim, prepare to do your share of facepalming at Beck\u2019s lax digital security, life choices and frankly feeble work ethic. Even manic pixie dream girls deserve love, though, and Joe is the handsome bookish sapiosexual she deserves. We know this because Joe tells us.</p> <p>But like all the best monsters, he is a product of society. It\u2019s like he says: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me [it\u2019s] crazy. It\u2019s the stuff of a million love songs.\u201d Valorising the obsessive pursuit of an unobtainable target is a staple of the romcom, the pop song, even the Bible story. It\u2019s too easy to fall into the Love Actually trap of <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/romantic-comedies-teach-women-that-stalking-is-a-compliment_us_56a8fa1fe4b0f7179928a17d\">normalising erotomania</a>, treating it as adorable, even heroic. The trick is not to lose sight of what you\u2019re portraying. You treads a fine line, giving Joe enough humanity to make him relatable but never making his actions defensible. It is smart enough to let us know that to sympathise with Joe is to be complicit in his crimes. Every time you feel you\u2019re being drawn in, the show pulls the rug from under you and reminds you that he is not the romantic hero you are looking for. If the show you\u2019re watching doesn\u2019t do that, it\u2019s probably not love.</p>",

The way he looks out for Paco, the lonely bookish kid in the apartment next door, shows that there is a human being somewhere beneath all the puppet mastery. He has something of Humbert Humbert about him \u2013 appalling but you want to hear more. \u201cI am just a mirror,\u201d that other great practitioner of the persuasive arts Charles Manson was fond of saying. \u201cAnything you see in me is you.\u201d Perhaps his role is to reveal some uncomfortable truths about ourselves. If so, You feels perfectly placed to explore our anxieties about social media and the dangers of distributing our identities across a series of platforms that don\u2019t care for our lives, privacy or mental health. In this, it echoes Black Mirror which made its name fanning that particular flame. You is never quite that dystopian, but it is significantly more plausible. Could a charming psychopath harvest your online presence, hack your passwords and tailor his spiel to make you fall for him? We may think we\u2019re too savvy for that, but the evidence suggests otherwise. It\u2019s a miracle, frankly, it hasn\u2019t happened already. Maybe that\u2019s why the show has struck a nerve. While you may naturally approach You resolute to never blaming the victim, prepare to do your share of facepalming at Beck\u2019s lax digital security, life choices and frankly feeble work ethic. Even manic pixie dream girls deserve love, though, and Joe is the handsome bookish sapiosexual she deserves. We know this because Joe tells us. But like all the best monsters, he is a product of society. It\u2019s like he says: \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me [it\u2019s] crazy. It\u2019s the stuff of a million love songs.\u201d Valorising the obsessive pursuit of an unobtainable target is a staple of the romcom, the pop song, even the Bible story. It\u2019s too easy to fall into the Love Actually trap of normalising erotomania, treating it as adorable, even heroic. The trick is not to lose sight of what you\u2019re portraying. You treads a fine line, giving Joe enough humanity to make him relatable but never making his actions defensible. It is smart enough to let us know that to sympathise with Joe is to be complicit in his crimes. Every time you feel you\u2019re being drawn in, the show pulls the rug from under you and reminds you that he is not the romantic hero you are looking for. If the show you\u2019re watching doesn\u2019t do that, it\u2019s probably not love.",

      "body": "<h2>Key points</h2> <p>Jeremy Corbyn started by saying he needed to correct the record. On Tuesday, he said this was the largest government defeat since the 1920s. In fact, it was the largest in our democratic history. Is Theresa May ruling out the UK staying in the customs union in her cross-party talks?</p> <p>May said she wanted to leave the EU in a way that respects people\u2019s votes. That means ending free movement, taking back control of laws and money, and having a good relationship with the EU.</p> <p>Corbyn asked May to confirm that there would not be a no-deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> after Greg Clark, the business secretary, said that in a call with business leaders on Tuesday. May said she did not want a no-deal Brexit. MPs could avoid no deal by voting for a deal, she said.</p> <p>Corbyn said the Commons rejected May\u2019s deal. Could she not understand she needed to come up with something else? But it was not just on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> she was failing. Poverty was rising. When would it fall while she was in office?</p> <p>May said there were 1 million fewer people in absolute poverty, and 300,000 fewer children. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> would spend \u00a31,000bn more, she said.</p> <p>Corbyn said May was in denial on a customs union, in denial on no deal, in denial on the amount of money spent on no-deal planning and on poverty. At this point Tory MPs jeer. Corbyn said this was significant. \u201cTell that to people queuing up at food banks.\u201d</p> <p>May said her government was delivering on education. She said Corbyn had consistently failed to set out what his Brexit policy was.</p> <p>Corbyn said May knew his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> policy \u2013 he wanted a customs union with the EU.</p> <p>One of the problems with the government was its disregard for statistics. There are 21,000 police officers. When May was home secretary, she would not accept police cuts had an impact on crime. Would she admit she got it wrong, the Labour leader asked?</p> <p>May defended her Home Office record. Corbyn only talks about money, she said. What mattered also was what powers the police were given. She said Corbyn consistently voted against more powers for the police.</p> <p>Corbyn said a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> government would properly fund the police. Ask people whether they feel safer now. We know what the answer will be, he said. He rattleed off a list of areas where the government was failing. And it has failed on the most important issue, Brexit. Every other previous PM would have resigned after last night\u2019s defeat.</p> <p>May said Corbyn had been calling for an election for weeks. Yet on Sunday, when asked whether he would campaign to leave the EU in an election campaign, Corbyn refused to answer. He had let antisemitism run riot in his party. He would abandon the UK\u2019s allies and wreck the economy. We would never let that happen, she said.</p> <h2>Snap verdict</h2> <p>The most interesting question at Westminster on Wednesday was the one raised by Nicola Sturgeon outside the Commons during her cross-party talks with MPs about an alternative Brexit plan: is May willing to abandon any of her rigid red lines? To his credit, Corbyn honed in on this in his very first question, and the topic was raised repeatedly by other MPs \u2013 although it was surprising how many seemed happy to stick with run-of-the-mill questions less than 24 hours after May broke all records for parliamentary humiliation.</p> <p>As usual, instead of properly engaging with the red lines question, May stuck to parroting the most recent line-to-take in her memory, the text of the statement she delivered to MPs last night about wanting \u201cconstructive\u201d talks while still honouring the result of the referendum. She would not address the question about whether she may now agree to the UK remaining in the customs union in any meaningful way. Her tone conveyed the clear impression that her lines remained almost as red as ever and that she was not seriously contemplating a departure from what she had already proposed. On one issue, however, May did hint at a rethink. Her response to Ken Clarke about extending article 50 implied that, if she was not exactly keen on an extension, she was at least less hostile to the idea than she was. (Some people assume that extending article 50 would automatically amount to a move in the direction of a softer Brexit, but that is not necessarily the case; she may want to extend it just to allow more time for no-deal preparations.)</p> <p>Corbyn was probably at his best when he asked about Brexit. He quite successfully exposed the hollowness of May\u2019s offer on cross-party talks. After that, he asked about poverty and other domestic policy issues, achieving some fairly easy hits but without saying anything especially memorable.</p> <h2>Memorable lines</h2> <p>Jeremy Corbyn:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This government has failed our country \u2026 They failed again and lost the vote last night. Isn\u2019t it the case \u2026 with every other previous prime minister, faced with the scale of defeat last night, they would have resigned and the country would be able to choose the government they want?</p> </blockquote> <p>Theresa May:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He has been calling for weeks for a general election in this country and yet on Sunday when he was asked \u2026 would he campaign to leave the European Union he refused to answer. Not once, not twice, not three times but five times he refused to answer. So on what he himself describes as the key issue facing the country, he has no answer.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Key points Jeremy Corbyn started by saying he needed to correct the record. On Tuesday, he said this was the largest government defeat since the 1920s. In fact, it was the largest in our democratic history. Is Theresa May ruling out the UK staying in the customs union in her cross-party talks? May said she wanted to leave the EU in a way that respects people\u2019s votes. That means ending free movement, taking back control of laws and money, and having a good relationship with the EU. Corbyn asked May to confirm that there would not be a no-deal Brexit after Greg Clark, the business secretary, said that in a call with business leaders on Tuesday. May said she did not want a no-deal Brexit. MPs could avoid no deal by voting for a deal, she said. Corbyn said the Commons rejected May\u2019s deal. Could she not understand she needed to come up with something else? But it was not just on Brexit she was failing. Poverty was rising. When would it fall while she was in office? May said there were 1 million fewer people in absolute poverty, and 300,000 fewer children. Labour would spend \u00a31,000bn more, she said. Corbyn said May was in denial on a customs union, in denial on no deal, in denial on the amount of money spent on no-deal planning and on poverty. At this point Tory MPs jeer. Corbyn said this was significant. \u201cTell that to people queuing up at food banks.\u201d May said her government was delivering on education. She said Corbyn had consistently failed to set out what his Brexit policy was. Corbyn said May knew his Brexit policy \u2013 he wanted a customs union with the EU. One of the problems with the government was its disregard for statistics. There are 21,000 police officers. When May was home secretary, she would not accept police cuts had an impact on crime. Would she admit she got it wrong, the Labour leader asked? May defended her Home Office record. Corbyn only talks about money, she said. What mattered also was what powers the police were given. She said Corbyn consistently voted against more powers for the police. Corbyn said a Labour government would properly fund the police. Ask people whether they feel safer now. We know what the answer will be, he said. He rattleed off a list of areas where the government was failing. And it has failed on the most important issue, Brexit. Every other previous PM would have resigned after last night\u2019s defeat. May said Corbyn had been calling for an election for weeks. Yet on Sunday, when asked whether he would campaign to leave the EU in an election campaign, Corbyn refused to answer. He had let antisemitism run riot in his party. He would abandon the UK\u2019s allies and wreck the economy. We would never let that happen, she said. Snap verdict The most interesting question at Westminster on Wednesday was the one raised by Nicola Sturgeon outside the Commons during her cross-party talks with MPs about an alternative Brexit plan: is May willing to abandon any of her rigid red lines? To his credit, Corbyn honed in on this in his very first question, and the topic was raised repeatedly by other MPs \u2013 although it was surprising how many seemed happy to stick with run-of-the-mill questions less than 24 hours after May broke all records for parliamentary humiliation. As usual, instead of properly engaging with the red lines question, May stuck to parroting the most recent line-to-take in her memory, the text of the statement she delivered to MPs last night about wanting \u201cconstructive\u201d talks while still honouring the result of the referendum. She would not address the question about whether she may now agree to the UK remaining in the customs union in any meaningful way. Her tone conveyed the clear impression that her lines remained almost as red as ever and that she was not seriously contemplating a departure from what she had already proposed. On one issue, however, May did hint at a rethink. Her response to Ken Clarke about extending article 50 implied that, if she was not exactly keen on an extension, she was at least less hostile to the idea than she was. (Some people assume that extending article 50 would automatically amount to a move in the direction of a softer Brexit, but that is not necessarily the case; she may want to extend it just to allow more time for no-deal preparations.) Corbyn was probably at his best when he asked about Brexit. He quite successfully exposed the hollowness of May\u2019s offer on cross-party talks. After that, he asked about poverty and other domestic policy issues, achieving some fairly easy hits but without saying anything especially memorable. Memorable lines Jeremy Corbyn: This government has failed our country \u2026 They failed again and lost the vote last night. Isn\u2019t it the case \u2026 with every other previous prime minister, faced with the scale of defeat last night, they would have resigned and the country would be able to choose the government they want? Theresa May: He has been calling for weeks for a general election in this country and yet on Sunday when he was asked \u2026 would he campaign to leave the European Union he refused to answer. Not once, not twice, not three times but five times he refused to answer. So on what he himself describes as the key issue facing the country, he has no answer.",

Unfolding inside on Tuesday night, a parliamentary procedural of quite staggering plotholes and continuity errors. Welcome to the Blunderdome.</p> \n<p>After Stanley Baldwin, then prime minister, had made the <a href=\"https://speakola.com/political/stanley-baldwin-abdication-crisis-house-of-commons-1936\" title=\"\">abdication announcement</a> in the House in 1936, the MP Harold Nicolson bumped into him in a corridor outside the chamber. The moment was obviously one of electrifying historic drama, yet Nicolson\u2019s diary entry archly conveys Baldwin\u2019s self-centric take on it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI detected in [Baldwin] that intoxication which comes to a man, even a tired man, after a triumphant success \u2026 \u2018I had a success, my dear Nicolson, at the moment I most needed it \u2026\u2019 No man has dominated the House as Baldwin did tonight,\u201d Nicolson concluded, \u201cand he knows it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The same could not be said of Theresa May, who rose to the occasion like a replicant Anglepoise lamp. Basic shambles model. Indeed, speaking of the abdication, it\u2019s grimly amusing to consider that Theresa May\u2019s big intervention in the 2015 general election campaign was to warn that \u201cif we saw a Labour government propped up by the SNP, it could be the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication\u201d. As it turned out, madam would have something rather bigger up her own sleeve.</p> \n<p>So what now? Well, there\u2019s a motion of no confidence to while away today, and 72 days left on the Brexit clock. May\u2019s serial dishonesty throughout this entire process saw jeers greet her post-vote claims of a new \u201cconstructive spirit\u201d in which \u201cthe government will work harder at taking parliament with us\u201d. The jeers were well founded, given it took barely hours for it to become clear that this wouldn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/theresa-may-fails-to-reach-out-to-jeremy-corbyn-to-strike-brexit-compromise\" title=\"\">extend to even speaking to Jeremy Corbyn</a>. Which might well suit Labour\u2019s leader, the High Triangulator, who is reportedly going to keep calling no confidence motions until one produces the answer he likes. An irony that will doubtless be appreciated by those of his supporters angling in vain for a second referendum.</p> \n<p>As for May, her clinical standoffishness is entirely of a piece with the way she has behaved for the best part of the two and a half years since the vote, and certainly since the 2017 election. One of the most remarkable, and indeed excruciating, things about May has been her insistence on governing like she\u2019s got a landslide majority. Why has no one told her? She\u2019s the Florence Foster Jenkins of politics, insulated from the realities of her situation by weird or venal enablers. Never has the intervention of a candid best mate been more needed. At some point in July 2017, surely Amber Rudd or whoever should have gone round and given May \u201cThe Talk\u201d. Along the lines of: \u201cBabe, true friends tell you the truth, amirite? Because if no one else is going to say this, then I will: the referendum vote was problematically close anyway, and then you totally spaffed your majority. Like, you literally have no majority.

The RSPCA has appealed to the EU Commission after a lorry was stopped at a UK port by the charity along with other campaigners and government officials on 10 January. The groups intervened to stop the lorry carrying about 250 calves after the animals appeared \u201cexhausted\u201d, and to avoid the vehicle exceeding the maximum transport time. Current laws state that calves must not be transported for more than nine hours without a one-hour rest period, and not longer than 21 hours before a 24-hour rest. The RSPCA estimated the lorry, which had come from Scotland, had been travelling for around 70 hours including rest stops, en route to Spain via Calais. If the animals had been taken on board the boat, they would have been in transit for longer than is permitted. Kent Action Against Live Exports (Kaale) said it would support an eight-hour maximum journey from the point of production to the animal\u2019s final destination. The campaign group told the Guardian that for journey times that exceed the legal limit, on average sheep travel for 14 hours from the UK, then have a one-hour rest on the lorry followed by another 14-hour route. For calves, aged between two and six weeks old, the journey is often nine hours followed by a one-hour rest and a further nine hours to Europe, north Africa and the Middle East.

Yvonne\u2019s husband Ian Birchall, chairman of Kaale, said the route through Kent to the continent has been used for years with only temporary gaps following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001 and the cases of BSE in the early 1990s. Mr Birchall said: \u201cWe cannot trust the authorities to do the right thing. \u201cUnless people are going to police it, it\u2019s going to be broken.\u201d Scotland is central to the trade in calves because elsewhere in Britain, ferry companies refuse to carry animals for slaughter, fattening or for the veal trade. James West, senior policy manager for Compassion in World Farming, is calling for the European Commission to introduce a one-off maximum permitted journey time of eight hours across the EU. He told the Guardian: \u201cCompassion believes that the long distance transport of animals for slaughter and fattening is completely inhumane and unnecessary. \u201cIn the UK, calves aged just a couple of weeks are being sent from Scotland, via Ramsgate, to Spain. \u201cThese animals are poorly equipped to deal with the stresses of a journey lasting over 60 hours. \u201cThe recent sailing from Ramsgate, which saw calves stuck in vehicles on board the export vessel for over 14 hours, highlights why such a journey limit is required.\u201d He said that in addition to an eight-hour limit within the EU, the organisation was calling on the Department for Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra), to end the live export of farm animals from the UK at the earliest possible opportunity post-Brexit. The government\u2019s Farm Animal Welfare Committee is reviewing evidence and is expected to make recommendations this year \u2013 which could include banning live exports when Britain leaves the EU. A Defra spokesman said: \u201cAnimals deserve respect and care at all stages of their lives, which is why we have consistently said that we will control the export of live farm animals for slaughter once we leave the European Union. \u201cFor that reason we have conducted a call for evidence on how we can achieve this, including through a possible ban.\u201d",

However, he was then able to devote the rest of his life to humanitarian work in some of the most dangerous places in the world.</p> <p>After answering an appeal for British surgeons to help treat victims of the civil war in Bosnia, he made frequent visits to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2018/jul/13/siege-of-sarajevo-ian-traynor-maggie-okane-1993\" title=\"\">the besieged city of Sarajevo</a> in the mid-1990s to work with and train local surgeons in trauma surgery. He also provided them with essential medical equipment and educational materials.</p> <p>On a return flight he met the businessman Simon Oliver, who was so impressed by John\u2019s commitment that he offered to fund the startup of a new charity, to be staffed by volunteer surgeons and physicians, and expand the work in Bosnia and other areas of conflict or natural disasters.</p> <p>What started as the Bosnian Fund gave rise in 2000 to <a href=\"https://www.ideals.org.uk/aboutus.html\" title=\"\">Ideals \u2013 International Disaster and Emergency Aid with Long-Term Support</a>. Under John\u2019s guidance as founder chairman, Ideals promoted primary trauma care (PTC) courses, which they deemed most cost-effective for the developing world. In 2003, John accompanied Ideals trustees and volunteers to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, to set up the first PTC courses. These proved so successful that they were adopted in other parts of the country, with more than 2000 doctors receiving training in the immediate management of seriously injured victims of trauma.</p> <p>The doctors proved invaluable when <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Kashmir-earthquake-of-2005\" title=\"\">an earthquake</a> hit northern Pakistan and surrounding areas in 2005. John arranged for food, medical equipment and tents to be delivered to the devastated village of Bedadi.</p> <p>At the start of that year John had gone to Sri Lanka, following the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, identified a badly damaged village, and provided emergency medical aid. In addition, Ideals funds were used to repair fishing boats and a local school, and support other small community projects. John set great store by the renewal of village life and giving back people\u2019s ability to earn a living.</p> <p>From 2009 onwards, he and Ideals focused on Palestine, initially together with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza, establishing PTC courses. Largely because of the rapport John established with Palestinian medical colleagues, as well as managers and politicians, Ideals became involved in all aspects of rehabilitation and post-trauma care, such as occupational care and physiotherapy.</p> <p>In partnership with the Tropical Health and Education Trust, three orthopaedic surgeons from Gaza received seven months\u2019 training in complex limb reconstruction surgery at King\u2019s College hospital in London. This proved invaluable to help the many civilian casualties of recent military assaults on Gaza. </p> <p>I first met John when his knowledge of trauma helped us upgrade the burns and plastic surgery clinical services in Gaza and the West Bank. He visited the region 30 times altogether, always on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>In 2011, John became a trustee of MAP and in 2015 joined the board of the International Medical Education Trust 2000, the other NGO working with Ideals and MAP in Palestine. He had the ability to defuse tense meetings and discussions by cracking a joke, often against himself, along the way to resolving serious arguments.</p> <p>Born in Brighton and adopted by William Beavis, a cook in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Ann (nee McAninch), John soon shone at <a href=\"https://www.varndean.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Varndean school</a> and went to University College London, graduating first in biochemistry and then in medicine.</p> <p>After qualifying as a doctor in 1967, he served as a medical officer (lieutenant, Royal Navy) to Royal Marine Commando Units until 1973 and developed his lifelong interest in trauma, orthopaedics, reconstructive surgery, the way modern weaponry damages living tissue and the effect of military conflict on both civilian victims and military personnel. He then specialised as an orthopaedic and trauma surgeon and worked in the NHS until the heart attack and bypass surgery that led to his retirement at the age of 53.</p> <p>He was deputy director of the Leonard Cheshire Centre for Conflict Recovery (1995-2005), researching the role of medical relief provided in war and disaster; chaired the Be Safe charity, promoting protection against knife and gun crime (2000-05); and in 2001 was awarded the Bosnian Medal of Honour for his work in Sarajevo hospitals during and after the civil war. In the recent New Year\u2019s honours he was appointed OBE.</p> <p>In 1961 John married Kate (Kay) Frankland. She survives him, along with their son, Stuart, and daughters, Telina and Carysse.</p> <p>\u2022 John Beavis, surgeon and humanitarian healthcare volunteer, born 8 June 1940; died 5 December 2018</p>",

On a return flight he met the businessman Simon Oliver, who was so impressed by John\u2019s commitment that he offered to fund the startup of a new charity, to be staffed by volunteer surgeons and physicians, and expand the work in Bosnia and other areas of conflict or natural disasters. What started as the Bosnian Fund gave rise in 2000 to Ideals \u2013 International Disaster and Emergency Aid with Long-Term Support. Under John\u2019s guidance as founder chairman, Ideals promoted primary trauma care (PTC) courses, which they deemed most cost-effective for the developing world. In 2003, John accompanied Ideals trustees and volunteers to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, to set up the first PTC courses. These proved so successful that they were adopted in other parts of the country, with more than 2000 doctors receiving training in the immediate management of seriously injured victims of trauma. The doctors proved invaluable when an earthquake hit northern Pakistan and surrounding areas in 2005. John arranged for food, medical equipment and tents to be delivered to the devastated village of Bedadi. At the start of that year John had gone to Sri Lanka, following the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, identified a badly damaged village, and provided emergency medical aid. In addition, Ideals funds were used to repair fishing boats and a local school, and support other small community projects. John set great store by the renewal of village life and giving back people\u2019s ability to earn a living. From 2009 onwards, he and Ideals focused on Palestine, initially together with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza, establishing PTC courses. Largely because of the rapport John established with Palestinian medical colleagues, as well as managers and politicians, Ideals became involved in all aspects of rehabilitation and post-trauma care, such as occupational care and physiotherapy. In partnership with the Tropical Health and Education Trust, three orthopaedic surgeons from Gaza received seven months\u2019 training in complex limb reconstruction surgery at King\u2019s College hospital in London. This proved invaluable to help the many civilian casualties of recent military assaults on Gaza. I first met John when his knowledge of trauma helped us upgrade the burns and plastic surgery clinical services in Gaza and the West Bank. He visited the region 30 times altogether, always on a voluntary basis. In 2011, John became a trustee of MAP and in 2015 joined the board of the International Medical Education Trust 2000, the other NGO working with Ideals and MAP in Palestine. He had the ability to defuse tense meetings and discussions by cracking a joke, often against himself, along the way to resolving serious arguments. Born in Brighton and adopted by William Beavis, a cook in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Ann (nee McAninch), John soon shone at Varndean school and went to University College London, graduating first in biochemistry and then in medicine. After qualifying as a doctor in 1967, he served as a medical officer (lieutenant, Royal Navy) to Royal Marine Commando Units until 1973 and developed his lifelong interest in trauma, orthopaedics, reconstructive surgery, the way modern weaponry damages living tissue and the effect of military conflict on both civilian victims and military personnel. He then specialised as an orthopaedic and trauma surgeon and worked in the NHS until the heart attack and bypass surgery that led to his retirement at the age of 53. He was deputy director of the Leonard Cheshire Centre for Conflict Recovery (1995-2005), researching the role of medical relief provided in war and disaster; chaired the Be Safe charity, promoting protection against knife and gun crime (2000-05); and in 2001 was awarded the Bosnian Medal of Honour for his work in Sarajevo hospitals during and after the civil war. In the recent New Year\u2019s honours he was appointed OBE. In 1961 John married Kate (Kay) Frankland. She survives him, along with their son, Stuart, and daughters, Telina and Carysse. \u2022 John Beavis, surgeon and humanitarian healthcare volunteer, born 8 June 1940; died 5 December 2018",

      "bodyText": "Tech giant Apple has announced that its first original feature film will reteam actor Bill Murray and director Sofia Coppola for a father-daughter comedy-drama called On the Rocks. According to the Hollywood Reporter, On the Rocks is about a young mother, played by Rashida Jones, who reconnects with her larger-than-life playboy father (Murray) on an adventure through New York. Coppola and Murray worked together on the 2003 comedy Lost in Translation, in which Murray played a jaded film star striking up an intense relationship with Scarlett Johansson\u2019s bored photographer\u2019s wife. Murray was Oscar-nominated for the role, while Coppola won the Academy award for best original screenplay. The film is the first fruit of Apple\u2019s deal with A24, the US distributor behind such cult hits as Spring Breakers, Ex Machina and Moonlight. Reports suggest Apple is planning to invest more than $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) in original content by 2022, with the vast majority to date going on TV programming such as a new Amazing Stories anthology from Steven Spielberg and untitled series from Damien Chazelle and M Night Shyamalan.",

      "body": "<p>In 1956, the then chancellor of the exchequer Harold Macmillan commissioned his officials to suggest the best way for Britain to integrate itself into the rapidly growing western European economy. Their plan, soon adopted as official policy, was that Britain and the emerging European Community would both join a new free trade area for industrial goods. In this perfect world, Britain would not be in the EC, would not have to pool any of its sovereignty with the other European powers, would maintain its preferential trade with the Commonwealth, would enjoy frictionless trade with Europe but would still be free to do whatever deals it wanted with the rest of the world. It could, in other words, have its cake and eat it. And why would the other Europeans agree to this? Because, as the Board of Trade explained: \u201cThe possibility of UK cooperation would be so welcome [to the Europeans] that we should be able to enter the plan more or less on our own terms.\u201d</p> <p>If this sounds familiar even to those of us who are not historians of British economic policy in the 1950s, it\u2019s because it is the vision for Brexit that was advertised 60 years later. Plan G, as it was known in 1956, is now Plan A for the true believers: we can have all the benefits of being in the EU without the burdens and compromises of actual membership. And the other Europeans will be so glad that we have condescended to deal with them that we can dictate our own terms.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t work in 1956, not least because, as Kevin O\u2019Rourke states in his crisp, clear and quietly devastating history, \u201cUK policymakers had been focused on what was required in order to achieve a domestic consensus in Britain. Not surprisingly, they had produced a blueprint that was indeed a very good deal for Britain \u2013 but in so doing they had paid insufficient attention to other countries\u2019 interests.\u201d And of course it has not worked since 2016 for precisely the same reasons. Here, as in so much else, we see that if Brexit has a history, it is not a linear one \u2013 it loops back not just to an imagined past but to assumptions about Britain\u2019s place in the world that were untenable even in the 1950s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexit's history loops\u00a0back to assumptions about Britain\u2019s place in the world\u00a0that were untenable even in the 1950s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Rourke is all too aware that, as titles go, <em>A Short History of Brexit</em> is problematic. For one thing, as the defeat of the withdrawal agreement has confirmed, this tale, however it turns out, will not be short. For another, the story is rapidly unfolding: the proofs of the book sent out to reviewers had empty space at the end for last-minute updates \u2013 the finished book takes events up to Christmas. It might indeed be questioned whether such a project is worth doing while the outcome is so uncertain. But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s book provides a bracing and absorbing answer. As he puts it towards the end, Brexit has already been \u201ca hugely informative, if costly, civics lesson for the people of Britain, Ireland, and the rest of Europe\u201d and he is superbly well fitted to draw out that lesson for the general reader.</p> <p>Kevin Hjortsh\u00f8j O\u2019Rourke, to give him his full name, has been Chichele professor of economic history at Oxford since 2011. His father was Ireland\u2019s permanent representative to the EU in the 1980s, his mother is Danish, he was born in Switzerland and is a municipal councillor in the small French village of Saint-Pierre-d\u2019Entremont. This mixture of expertise and life experience gives him both a sure grasp of the fine details and a wider human perspective.</p> <p>He is excellent on the realities of trade regimes: if you want the truth about what World Trade Organisation rules actually mean, or why hard borders cannot be avoided even if post-Brexit Britain merely ends up with different rules on VAT, he is a reliable guide. Some of these \u201ccivics lesson\u201d aspects of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s book have an urgency that is shaped by the sheer mendacity of the Brexiters. It should not, for example, be a great revelation that freedom of movement isn\u2019t a cunning trap devised after an innocent Britain had been lured into what it thought was merely a trading bloc: it is right there in the 1957 treaty of Rome. Yet it matters that such things are laid out with such clarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat\">Brexit:  May's plan for cross-party talks under fire as MPs condemn her for sidelining Corbyn - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Rourke is also acute on the very different ways in which first world war centenaries were commemorated in Britain and France. One memo to David Cameron as prime minister issued instructions that \u201cwe must ensure that our commemoration does not give any support to the myth that European integration was the result of the two World Wars\u201d. By contrast, the French prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe, speaking in 2017 at the armistice site at Compi\u00e8gne, did exactly that, evoking the idea of \u201ca Europe that reminds us of the eternal values that unite us, and the disasters we mourn\u201d.</p> <p>While O\u2019Rourke\u2019s cool account of the Brexit negotiations is valuable, it is his overview that is most important. He explains why the habit of setting the claims of Europe against those of the nation state is simply wrong. The European Union was the answer to a very real and urgent question: how can we enjoy the economic benefits of free trade while limiting the known ability of free trade to undermine national governments and the welfare states they had put in place? The dilemma, as he so neatly summarises it, is that \u201ceconomic prosperity required trade but political stability required welfare states. In order to achieve both prosperity and stability a free trade area was not enough: you needed European integration to set a common regulatory framework so as to prevent destructive races to the bottom. In this way Europe would come to the rescue of the European nation state.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps this thought might be taken a little further: if the EU was about rescuing the nation state, might the great structural problem of Britain\u2019s attitudes to it be precisely that the UK is not a nation state? It was, in the early days of European postwar unification, still an imperial power, and its official suspicion of the idea of a continental customs union was shaped by the belief that it could and should continue to prioritise its trade with its soon-to-be-former colonies. (The excruciating contradictions that this involved are perfectly captured by the conclusion of a British expert committee appointed in 1947: \u201cA continental customs union had little economically in its favour other than the damage which would be caused by being excluded from it.\u201d) And of course, the UK contains four different nations that would come over time to take very different views both of the nature of the welfare state and of the relevance of Europe to their sense of identity.</p> <p>The great limitation of historians is generally that they know too much. They cannot share the great ignorance of the people they are writing about: the condition, in which we are all still held after the stalemate at Westminster, of not knowing how it is all going to turn out. Though it is scant consolation for the pain it inflicts, Brexit does rather poignantly bring together the knowledge provided by a long-term historical perspective with the sheer terrifying unknowability of the outcome. O\u2019Rourke may not have known the result of the vote on the withdrawal agreement, but his guess turns out to be a well-educated one. He predicts, accurately, that alongside that deal, \u201cthe only logical alternatives would appear to be no deal and no Brexit\u201d. And he points to a hard fact that some of those suggesting other plans at this very late stage seem not to grasp: \u201cThe Labour party hopes that a general election might in such circumstances return it to power, but even if that happened the country would still face the same three alternatives; the \u2018Norway plus\u2019 option requires leaving on the basis of the existing Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d As O\u2019Rourke acknowledges: \u201cThis is what history feels like when it is being made.\u201d It feels simultaneously like reliving the past and forgetting everything that might have been learned from it.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>A Short History of Brexit: A Pelican Book by Kevin O\u2019Rourke is published by Pelican (RRP \u00a320).

They cannot share the great ignorance of the people they are writing about: the condition, in which we are all still held after the stalemate at Westminster, of not knowing how it is all going to turn out. Though it is scant consolation for the pain it inflicts, Brexit does rather poignantly bring together the knowledge provided by a long-term historical perspective with the sheer terrifying unknowability of the outcome. O\u2019Rourke may not have known the result of the vote on the withdrawal agreement, but his guess turns out to be a well-educated one. He predicts, accurately, that alongside that deal, \u201cthe only logical alternatives would appear to be no deal and no Brexit\u201d. And he points to a hard fact that some of those suggesting other plans at this very late stage seem not to grasp: \u201cThe Labour party hopes that a general election might in such circumstances return it to power, but even if that happened the country would still face the same three alternatives; the \u2018Norway plus\u2019 option requires leaving on the basis of the existing Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d As O\u2019Rourke acknowledges: \u201cThis is what history feels like when it is being made.\u201d It feels simultaneously like reliving the past and forgetting everything that might have been learned from it. \u2022 A Short History of Brexit: A Pelican Book by Kevin O\u2019Rourke is published by Pelican (RRP \u00a320).

We were told that our full names would be published on the <a href=\"https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/About-the-Citizens-Assembly/Who-are-the-Members/\" title=\"\">assembly\u2019s website</a> \u2013 some people were concerned that they would be targeted by abortion campaigners but to my knowledge this never happened.</p> <p>While the majority of our time was taken up with the abortion debate, we also examined other topics \u2013 including issues arising from an ageing population and Ireland\u2019s role in <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/ireland-must-listen-to-citizens-assembly-on-climate-change-1.3515211\" title=\"\">tackling climate change</a>.

      "bodyText": "In August 2016 there was a knock on my front door. A man from a polling company introduced himself \u2013 he was selecting people to take part in a national forum to discuss social issues in Ireland. One of the topics to be debated was our country\u2019s strict abortion laws. I said yes, not entirely sure what I was signing up for. A week later there was a phone call to verify that I was on the register to vote, and then my place as one of the 100 members of the Citizens\u2019 Assembly was confirmed. An explainer booklet came in the post along with an invitation to Dublin Castle for the inaugural meeting in October 2016. There were nerves in the room on the first day of the assembly. We were told that our full names would be published on the assembly\u2019s website \u2013 some people were concerned that they would be targeted by abortion campaigners but to my knowledge this never happened. While the majority of our time was taken up with the abortion debate, we also examined other topics \u2013 including issues arising from an ageing population and Ireland\u2019s role in tackling climate change. In 2013 the similarly styled Convention on the Constitution took place \u2013 the 2015 marriage equality referendum was a result of that assembly\u2019s recommendations. Some form of citizens\u2019 assembly has been talked up as a way to resolve Britain\u2019s seemingly intractable divisions over its decision to leave the EU. My experience shows that some of the most polarising issues can be tackled in this manner. During the process there was a lot of cynicism in the media and among pro-choice lobby groups.

      "bodyText": "Darkly comic and absurdly charming, this wild gothic ride has mischief at its heart. The French company Les Antliaclastes demonstrate masterful puppetry as they loosely weave together The Elves, a trio of short stories collected by the Brothers Grimm, in which beautifully grotesque creatures wreak havoc on humankind. A brass clock cracks at the stroke of 13, unleashing the elves and goblins living within. Slithering and scrabbling through one fairytale to the next, the string puppets run rings around a trio of masked actors (Josephine Biereye, Richard Penny and Patrick Sims). This Grimm world has little logic \u2013 few characters have clear plot or purpose \u2013 but it\u2019s easy to forgive when chaos looks this good. Ever more secret compartments are revealed as time dismantles itself. Some surprises are sweet, some sour: in here, beer brewing in an eggshell; under there, a baby\u2019s face melting to a pile of bones. Each fragment of design is noteworthy: a delicate deer distracted by a butterfly, a skeletal winged elf nosing a trail of thread, a rabbit\u2019s antlers protruding behind its soft ears.

Perhaps the sight of a drone flying above the back straight will eventually become as much a part of a day at the races as the white-gloved tic-tacs one were, in an age when mobile phones and the internet were unimaginable. Newbury offers some excellent action for both in-running and traditional punters, when Carlos Du Fruitier (2.50) could be the answer to the feature chase and Le Precieux (2.15) should perhaps be favourite to beat The Russian Doyen in the novice handicap chase. Kodiline (2.25) and Beleaguerment (3.00) both have solid chances at Lingfield while Mauna Kea (2.35) should go well at Plumpton.",

I didn\u2019t feel like I put my best game on the court. She played very well \u2013 it\u2019s very tough to read her serve.\u201d</p> <p>Boulter was being a little hard on herself, according to the former British No 1 Annabel Croft, watching the match for Eurosport. \u201cKatie should be very proud of what she put out there against a world No 11. Sabalenka is one of the most exciting prospects on the Tour. Katie came out striking the ball with authority, really big hitting from the back of the court.\u201d</p> <p>Jo Durie, a quarter-finalist here in 1983, agreed. \u201cKatie\u2019s run in the tournament will inspire her to get out there and work even harder on her game.\u201d</p> <p>Boulter has a recent win over Serena Williams \u2013 albeit in mixed doubles in the Hopman Cup. The Briton reckons any comparisons made between the 23-times grand slam champion and Sabalenka are premature, but may soon be valid: \u201cSerena is a great, she has won this tournament seven times, and many others. Sabalenka is someone who is coming up and it\u2019s very possible she could win any of [the slams]. They are two different players, though. She has got a really good future ahead of her. I am looking forward to being on the Tour with her.</p> <p>\u201cThis week has been massive. The past couple of weeks as well. My whole trip to Australia has been a learning experience. It has been really great for me. I have been surrounded by people I am not normally around. I have learned so much from just playing matches on big courts, which I haven\u2019t done before. I feel a lot more settled out there. And I will definitely use it for the rest of my year.\u201d</p> <p>Her two wins have added $180,000 to her earnings, but she will not be indulging herself. \u201cI will be putting the money towards my tennis. You have to invest in yourself to get the rewards.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>",

The New Jersey-born daughter of Russian parents \u2013 a former US Open junior champion \u2013 is being touted by the sports management group IMG as \u201cthe new Maria Sharapova\u201d. After beating Ekaterina Makarova in the first round, Boulter leaves the tournament disappointed but right to believe she can be in that mix. \u201cI thought I stuck with her pretty well,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging for me to play someone like that not playing my best tennis but still be in there with a chance to win a set or two. I didn\u2019t feel like I put my best game on the court. She played very well \u2013 it\u2019s very tough to read her serve.\u201d Boulter was being a little hard on herself, according to the former British No 1 Annabel Croft, watching the match for Eurosport. \u201cKatie should be very proud of what she put out there against a world No 11. Sabalenka is one of the most exciting prospects on the Tour. Katie came out striking the ball with authority, really big hitting from the back of the court.\u201d Jo Durie, a quarter-finalist here in 1983, agreed. \u201cKatie\u2019s run in the tournament will inspire her to get out there and work even harder on her game.\u201d Boulter has a recent win over Serena Williams \u2013 albeit in mixed doubles in the Hopman Cup. The Briton reckons any comparisons made between the 23-times grand slam champion and Sabalenka are premature, but may soon be valid: \u201cSerena is a great, she has won this tournament seven times, and many others. Sabalenka is someone who is coming up and it\u2019s very possible she could win any of [the slams]. They are two different players, though. She has got a really good future ahead of her. I am looking forward to being on the Tour with her. \u201cThis week has been massive. The past couple of weeks as well. My whole trip to Australia has been a learning experience. It has been really great for me. I have been surrounded by people I am not normally around. I have learned so much from just playing matches on big courts, which I haven\u2019t done before. I feel a lot more settled out there. And I will definitely use it for the rest of my year.\u201d Her two wins have added $180,000 to her earnings, but she will not be indulging herself. \u201cI will be putting the money towards my tennis. You have to invest in yourself to get the rewards.\u201d",

In a \u2018Questions you may have\u2019 section, Verizon offers further input against unions. The answers claim \u201cthe best way to secure jobs is to provide excellent products, services, and customer service,\u201d rather than join a labor union. Verizon also criticized a 2016 strike of workers at their Brooklyn retail stores and nearly 40,000 other unionized employees who work as network technicians and customer service reps, citing its impact on \u201cworking conditions for our employees and experience for our customers\u201d. The documents further explain Verizon\u2019s anti-union position. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe unions are necessary at Verizon Wireless or that you or your coworkers will be well served by electing a union as your collective voice.\u201d Verizon argues the only difference between unions and non-union-represented employees are the dues union members pay. Verizon defines a union as \u201can organization whose income comes from taking a portion of the wages from the employees it represents\u201d. Verizon added: \u201cInstead of treating employees as individuals, the company has to negotiate with the union on behalf of all employees collectively.\u201d The documents claim union representation has declined because state and federal labor laws protect workers free of charge. The internal Verizon website, marked \u201cfor Verizon Wireless management only, not for distribution to non-supervisory employees\u201d, offers leadership training on how to react to any employees who mention or discuss unionizing. The prompts resemble those offered to Amazon employees in an HR training video leaked in September 2018. The website includes union awareness refreshers and responses to any perceived CWA organizing and union activity, including responses to union flyers on call center closures and offshoring. Verizon has run into trouble for previous attempts to ward off union activity. In December 2018, Verizon finalized a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board after the CWA filed a unfair labor practice charge in response to a Verizon employee in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who experienced interrogation and surveillance by Verizon for engaging in union activity. \u201cWhen I noticed the change in structure at Verizon, that made me want to start unionizing and organizing two years ago when I took a different position to work at headquarters,\u201d said LaTasha French, an employee for 18 years at the Verizon headquarters in Irving, Texas. She claimed Verizon has sent union busters to harass her, give her misinformation and offer false promises, like the possibility to work from home. French added the way Verizon human resources had handled complaints of harassment she had made, which included a supervisor joyriding in the wheelchair the company provided for her, had also contributed to her involvement in union efforts. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to go up against them because I know I do my job. I know I\u2019m there and available,\u201d French said. \u201cBut what I won\u2019t stand for is you\u2019re making billions of dollars on our head and you treat us as modern-day slaves and uneducated. You\u2019re trying to consolidate other departments and you\u2019re not giving the people who take these additional duties any more pay.\u201d In July 2018, a Verizon retail store in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, successfully voted to unionize. Verizon\u2019s union-busting tactics stopped an effort to hold an election to unionize in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, around the same time. \u201cWe ended up pulling the petition,\u201d said Darryl Givens, a Verizon employee at the Wilkes-Barre store. \u201cIf we lost, we had to wait a year. It was initially five to four. Two people didn\u2019t want to be involved at all.\u201d He explained Verizon sent executives to the store in response to union activity. \u201cThe first thing they do is come and say how awful the union will be for us and if we go union, they can\u2019t do anything special for you. They would come out and, not directly, say \u2018unions, sometimes their stores sometimes get closed,\u2019 trying to entice us in any way to vote no,\u201d Givens said. \u201cThey would call us in, do forced meetings with us, and go over how awful unions are. Every few days we\u2019d get rotated back in.\u201d According to Tim Dubnau, an organizing coordinator for the CWA, this is the modus operandi of Verizon in response to any perceived union activity. \u201cThey distort the truth about unions, they imply union workers make less, they distort the truth about dues and strikes. That\u2019s the union busting 101 when you walk into the door,\u201d said Dubnau. \u201cThey have a jump team ready at a moment\u2019s notice to have a forced captive audience meeting to warn about the dangers of unions.\u201d Verizon did not respond to repeated requests for comment.",

According to a Reuters analysis, it had the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pipeline-nativeamericans-safety-i/sunoco-behind-protested-dakota-pipeline-tops-u-s-crude-spill-charts-idUSKCN11T1UW\">worst spill record</a> of all US pipeline companies between 2010 and 2016.</p> <p>In 2014, an ETP pipeline ruptured 160,000 gallons of crude into Caddo Lake, which flows into the Atchafalaya Basin. The incident devastated the local fishing season.</p> <h2><strong>Caddo Lake</strong></h2> <p>Some tribal stories say that Caddo Lake is the origin place of the indigenous Caddo Tribe, which occupied the region until Andrew Jackson\u2019s Indian Removal Act extirpated them in the 1800s.</p> <p>Caddo songs tell of an earthquake and flood that formed the lake. Unaware of the approaching danger, some of their ancestors were washed underneath the flood while dancing and singing, and were said to have become fantastic water creatures. Today, the lake is habitat for an abundance of fish and wildlife, including many alligators and snapping turtles \u2013 its resident relics of the Reptile Age.</p> <p>In 1910, an oil company worker discovered gas bubbles emerging from the lake \u2013 a sign of oil presence. The lake bottom, which was owned by the federal government, was quickly leased. Soon, the world\u2019s first overwater oil rigs were engineered to access the oil. The oil production which followed helped birth the Gulf Oil Company/Chevron.</p> <p>As colonial encroachment expanded, Houma people, the southern neighbors of the Caddo, moved further south into the remote swamps of the Atchafalaya near the Atakapaw, Choctaw and Chitimacha peoples. There, they evaded forced removals due to their inaccessible locations. Those conditions also brought escaped slaves into bayou communities, along with exiled Acadian French settlers from Canada. The amalgam of ethnicities and cultures led to what is known today as Cajun culture.</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother, who was born in 1910, told me stories about how the oil companies stole our land rights away, tricking elders to sign their X\u2019s on papers they were unable to read,\u201d says United Houma Nation tribal council member Monique Verdin. \u201cThey believed they were leasing land, but in the process they were evicted off their properties.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15b6725f33671e85d9d5ae2d26d34a1dd22ceae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b6725f33671e85d9d5ae2d26d34a1dd22ceae8/0_0_2419_1613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarice Friloux., a Houma resident, says: \u2018We had a tank explode right next to us, and where are we supposed to evacuate 300 people to?\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarice Friloux., a Houma resident, says: \u2018We had a tank explode right next to us, and where are we supposed to evacuate 300 people to?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Whittle/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1994, Exxon began <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-ethics-quarterly/article/exxon-at-grand-bois-louisiana-a-threelevel-analysis-of-management-decision-making-and-corporate-conduct/35EBC2F97B56B690FFF71B00D463A85D\">dumping sludge</a> in a waste dump installed next to the mostly Houma community of Grand Bois, Louisiana, making residents <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/13/us/louisiana-town-goes-to-trial-over-waste-pit.html\">sick</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe had only 100 women in our community, and probably 15 out that 100 had tumor hysterectomies,\u201d says Clarice Friloux, a Houma resident who helped file a lawsuit against Exxon at the time. \u201cWe had two babies born stillbirths with cysts.\u201d</p> <p>Friloux says she was followed and threatened many times during the lawsuit. \u201cOnce, someone called me and said: \u2018So, you\u2019re 20 minutes from home, you\u2019re alone, and you have to pass by our facility to get back home. Are you afraid?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Once at a gas station, she was accosted by a man she had never seen before. \u201cDo you get sponsored by Levi\u2019s?\u201d he asked.

I look for him in crowds sometimes,\u201d Friloux says. \u201cHe rattled me.\u201d</p> <p>After Louisiana state senator Michael Robichaux, a medical doctor, <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/a-year-after-the-disaster-curiousand-debilitating-illnesses-abound/\">took up</a> the community\u2019s cause, the state finally ordered a toxicology study in 1998.</p> <p>The state-appointed toxicologist demonstrated a litany of health issues affecting residents, such as breathing, kidney and eye problems, skin rashes, birth defects, learning disabilities, cancer and high lead levels. She <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/262865747\">cited</a> environmental contaminants as the likely culprit yet ultimately, she did not testify in court to a conclusive link to the site. (In 2015, after two decades of legal battle, Exxon was cleared of most charges in the lawsuit, but was ordered to pay a total of $30,000 to residents closest to the site.

It is estimated that 3.9m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf.</p> <p>\u201cThe BP spill was a disaster for our communities,\u201d says Friloux. \u201cIt shut down our livelihood and the ability to provide for our families.\u201d It destroyed the shrimping industry which is vital to the local economy.

The mostly African American community is surrounded by refineries, and reports many of the same health issues seen in Grand Bois. No evacuation route exists should disaster strike, and the only bridge across the river was recently damaged by a barge carrying oil industry construction equipment, which closed the bridge for two months. Hemmed in on all sides by industry and the Mississippi, residents were forced to drive 40 miles round-trip to get essential supplies and to commute across the river for work.</p> <p>\u201cForty-one percent of the United States\u2019 water drains through our mighty river,\u201d says Verdin. \u201cThe Mississippi Delta is a power point for the planet, a place where water comes to be purified. Yet we are a sacrifice zone.\u201d</p> <p>Eminent domain was used by ETP to seize numerous tracts of land from property owners. Unable to afford a legal battle against a petroleum giant, most acquiesced, but a few didn\u2019t.</p> <p>The common ETP practice when a landowner refuses a buyout is to file an expropriation claim, then begin construction on the assumption it will be approved. In one instance however, the claim was not filed before construction began.</p> <p>The landowners invited activists to set up camp on their property and mount resistance actions. Officers then arrested the activists, who were on land they had written permission to be on (trespassing on pipeline domain is a felony punishable by five years in prison according to a \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d law recently passed in Louisiana).</p> <p>Construction of the pipeline is now complete on the disputed property, and 18 felony charges remain pending. A lawsuit recently concluded wherein the landowners hoped to win redress. The judge ruled that ETP acted without lawful authority to be on the land. However, he approved the eminent domain claim post-construction, and ordered ETP to pay each landowner $150 for damages and land seizure compensation.</p> <p>The landowners intend to appeal the ruling to the Louisiana supreme court, and a challenge to the critical infrastructure law could go all the way to the US supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cThe critical infrastructure law infringes on the constitutional right to protest,\u201d says Bill Quigley, a law professor at Loyola University who\u2019s representing landowners and activists pro bono. \u201cThe statute also violates due process,\u201d he asserts. \u201cA further problem is that it was rammed through the legislature by the oil and gas lobby, who admitted they wrote it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"638fa5b120bec57450f9853fb2db3c467e3afc01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638fa5b120bec57450f9853fb2db3c467e3afc01/0_0_1905_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cherri Foytlin and Waniya Locke were arrested at an Energy Transfer Partners shareholders meeting on 18 October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cherri Foytlin and Waniya Locke were arrested at an Energy Transfer Partners shareholders meeting on 18 October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Whittle/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A resistance led by women</h2> <p>The strongest voice of resistance leadership belongs to Cherri Foytlin. She is a Din\u00e9 (Navajo) and Latina mother, and a longtime local of south Louisiana.</p> <p>Living within an hour of the main camp, Foytlin is there almost daily. In addition to being a movement leader, she\u2019s raising her six children to become the heart and success of the resistance. Her 15-year-old daughter Jayden is part of a group of youths suing the federal government over failing to take action on climate change. Their lawsuit alleges that the government has \u201cviolated the youngest generation\u2019s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as failed to protect essential public trust resources\u201d.</p> <p>At camp, Foytlin serves as the timeless Indigenous matriarch role of \u201caunty\u201d. Her guidance, leadership and wisdom are essential to the community; whether in helping to resolve day-to-day social dynamics, or strategizing the next course of action in their ongoing struggle.</p> <p>While activists from all backgrounds are welcome, the camp is led by Indigenous women like Foytlin, who guard the ethics guiding matriarchal care for land and water in the Americas since time immemorial.

      "bodyText": "Deep within the humid green heart of the largest river swamp in North America, a battle is being waged over the future of the most precious resource of all: water. On one side of the conflict is a small band of rugged and ragtag activists led by Indigenous matriarchs. On the other side is the relentless machinery of the fossil fuel industry and all of its might. And at the center of the struggle is the Atchafalaya river, a 135 mile-long distributary of the Mississippi river that empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The activists gather at L\u2019eau Est La Vie Camp, a resistance encampment set up to resist the Bayou Bridge pipeline, which will cross directly through the river basin to connect shale crude from the Dakota Access pipeline to a refinery in St James, Louisiana. From there, it will be shipped primarily to China. The \u201cwater protectors\u201d, as they call themselves, are camped near the path of the pipeline. Many live locally, but others come from afar, often hailing from tribes affected by similar issues, such as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Their efforts are focused on public protest to raise awareness, as well as direct actions to impede construction of the pipeline, which they say endangers the Atchafalaya hardwood forest and cypress-tupelo swamp, the largest in North America. This ecosystem supports half of the continent\u2019s migratory waterfowl and is one of the most important bird habitats in the western hemisphere. It\u2019s also considered to be one of the most productive swamps on the planet \u2013 roughly 90% of the wild crawfish sold in Louisiana are caught here, making it the last stronghold of bayou Cajun fishing culture. High on the activists\u2019 long list of concerns is the possibility of a devastating spill: data collected by Greenpeace from the US Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration indicates the pipeline\u2019s owners, Sunoco and its parent company Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) experienced 527 spills from 2002 to the end of 2017. According to a Reuters analysis, it had the worst spill record of all US pipeline companies between 2010 and 2016. In 2014, an ETP pipeline ruptured 160,000 gallons of crude into Caddo Lake, which flows into the Atchafalaya Basin. The incident devastated the local fishing season. Caddo Lake Some tribal stories say that Caddo Lake is the origin place of the indigenous Caddo Tribe, which occupied the region until Andrew Jackson\u2019s Indian Removal Act extirpated them in the 1800s. Caddo songs tell of an earthquake and flood that formed the lake. Unaware of the approaching danger, some of their ancestors were washed underneath the flood while dancing and singing, and were said to have become fantastic water creatures. Today, the lake is habitat for an abundance of fish and wildlife, including many alligators and snapping turtles \u2013 its resident relics of the Reptile Age. In 1910, an oil company worker discovered gas bubbles emerging from the lake \u2013 a sign of oil presence. The lake bottom, which was owned by the federal government, was quickly leased. Soon, the world\u2019s first overwater oil rigs were engineered to access the oil. The oil production which followed helped birth the Gulf Oil Company/Chevron. As colonial encroachment expanded, Houma people, the southern neighbors of the Caddo, moved further south into the remote swamps of the Atchafalaya near the Atakapaw, Choctaw and Chitimacha peoples. There, they evaded forced removals due to their inaccessible locations. Those conditions also brought escaped slaves into bayou communities, along with exiled Acadian French settlers from Canada. The amalgam of ethnicities and cultures led to what is known today as Cajun culture. \u201cMy grandmother, who was born in 1910, told me stories about how the oil companies stole our land rights away, tricking elders to sign their X\u2019s on papers they were unable to read,\u201d says United Houma Nation tribal council member Monique Verdin. \u201cThey believed they were leasing land, but in the process they were evicted off their properties.\u201d In 1994, Exxon began dumping sludge in a waste dump installed next to the mostly Houma community of Grand Bois, Louisiana, making residents sick. \u201cWe had only 100 women in our community, and probably 15 out that 100 had tumor hysterectomies,\u201d says Clarice Friloux, a Houma resident who helped file a lawsuit against Exxon at the time. \u201cWe had two babies born stillbirths with cysts.\u201d Friloux says she was followed and threatened many times during the lawsuit. \u201cOnce, someone called me and said: \u2018So, you\u2019re 20 minutes from home, you\u2019re alone, and you have to pass by our facility to get back home. Are you afraid?\u2019\u201d Once at a gas station, she was accosted by a man she had never seen before. \u201cDo you get sponsored by Levi\u2019s?\u201d he asked. When she said no, he replied: \u201cWell, if I remember correctly at the Monday meeting you wore green pants, and Tuesday beige, and Wednesday black,\u201d making it clear he had been keeping tabs on her. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget his face. I look for him in crowds sometimes,\u201d Friloux says. \u201cHe rattled me.\u201d After Louisiana state senator Michael Robichaux, a medical doctor, took up the community\u2019s cause, the state finally ordered a toxicology study in 1998. The state-appointed toxicologist demonstrated a litany of health issues affecting residents, such as breathing, kidney and eye problems, skin rashes, birth defects, learning disabilities, cancer and high lead levels. She cited environmental contaminants as the likely culprit yet ultimately, she did not testify in court to a conclusive link to the site. (In 2015, after two decades of legal battle, Exxon was cleared of most charges in the lawsuit, but was ordered to pay a total of $30,000 to residents closest to the site. The waste pits site owner, Campbell Wells, settled a separate lawsuit for a reported $7m.) And then, in 2010, the BP spill happened. It is estimated that 3.9m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf. \u201cThe BP spill was a disaster for our communities,\u201d says Friloux. \u201cIt shut down our livelihood and the ability to provide for our families.\u201d It destroyed the shrimping industry which is vital to the local economy. Similarly, clear-cutting ancient cypress forest and the disruption of sediment patterns by dredging canals and trenches to lay pipeline has choked out the crawfish population. \u2018Cancer alley\u2019 It is against this backdrop that people are organizing to fight the Bayou Bridge pipeline, demanding that alternative energy be aggressively pursued and fossil-based production be curbed. \u201cI know we are not getting off oil and gas anytime soon, but we have to start working towards it,\u201d says Verdin, who is on the Indigenous Women\u2019s Council of the L\u2019eau Est La Vie Camp. \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe clean energy is possible, then we\u2019ll continue to witness the fallout, from rising seas and black tides washing into our fishing grounds to toxic drinking water.\u201d The refinery corridor along the Mississippi river in St James \u2013 where the pipeline would end \u2013 is known as \u201ccancer alley\u201d. The mostly African American community is surrounded by refineries, and reports many of the same health issues seen in Grand Bois. No evacuation route exists should disaster strike, and the only bridge across the river was recently damaged by a barge carrying oil industry construction equipment, which closed the bridge for two months. Hemmed in on all sides by industry and the Mississippi, residents were forced to drive 40 miles round-trip to get essential supplies and to commute across the river for work. \u201cForty-one percent of the United States\u2019 water drains through our mighty river,\u201d says Verdin. \u201cThe Mississippi Delta is a power point for the planet, a place where water comes to be purified. Yet we are a sacrifice zone.\u201d Eminent domain was used by ETP to seize numerous tracts of land from property owners. Unable to afford a legal battle against a petroleum giant, most acquiesced, but a few didn\u2019t. The common ETP practice when a landowner refuses a buyout is to file an expropriation claim, then begin construction on the assumption it will be approved. In one instance however, the claim was not filed before construction began. The landowners invited activists to set up camp on their property and mount resistance actions. Officers then arrested the activists, who were on land they had written permission to be on (trespassing on pipeline domain is a felony punishable by five years in prison according to a \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d law recently passed in Louisiana). Construction of the pipeline is now complete on the disputed property, and 18 felony charges remain pending. A lawsuit recently concluded wherein the landowners hoped to win redress. The judge ruled that ETP acted without lawful authority to be on the land. However, he approved the eminent domain claim post-construction, and ordered ETP to pay each landowner $150 for damages and land seizure compensation. The landowners intend to appeal the ruling to the Louisiana supreme court, and a challenge to the critical infrastructure law could go all the way to the US supreme court. \u201cThe critical infrastructure law infringes on the constitutional right to protest,\u201d says Bill Quigley, a law professor at Loyola University who\u2019s representing landowners and activists pro bono. \u201cThe statute also violates due process,\u201d he asserts. \u201cA further problem is that it was rammed through the legislature by the oil and gas lobby, who admitted they wrote it.\u201d A resistance led by women The strongest voice of resistance leadership belongs to Cherri Foytlin. She is a Din\u00e9 (Navajo) and Latina mother, and a longtime local of south Louisiana. Living within an hour of the main camp, Foytlin is there almost daily. In addition to being a movement leader, she\u2019s raising her six children to become the heart and success of the resistance. Her 15-year-old daughter Jayden is part of a group of youths suing the federal government over failing to take action on climate change. Their lawsuit alleges that the government has \u201cviolated the youngest generation\u2019s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as failed to protect essential public trust resources\u201d. At camp, Foytlin serves as the timeless Indigenous matriarch role of \u201caunty\u201d. Her guidance, leadership and wisdom are essential to the community; whether in helping to resolve day-to-day social dynamics, or strategizing the next course of action in their ongoing struggle. While activists from all backgrounds are welcome, the camp is led by Indigenous women like Foytlin, who guard the ethics guiding matriarchal care for land and water in the Americas since time immemorial. Their bond is not dissimilar to that of any group of warriors on any page in time: they say they are a \u201cfrontline family\u201d tied together by intense experiences, some of which have nearly turned deadly. Foytlin became an environmentalist when she volunteered on the BP spill clean up. \u201cI remember pulling a dying pelican out of the water covered in oil, and thinking that pelican didn\u2019t have a voice and neither did the fisherfolk I was with \u2013 who were on their knees crying like children\u201d, she says. \u201cOur goal is to create space where justice can be found\u201d, she says. \u201cInitially, we had three objectives besides stopping the pipeline. First, to establish an evacuation route for St James (the state says it is evaluating options). Second, to lift up the needs of the Atchafalaya Basin.

That depends on whether MPs \u2013 and in particular her own backbenchers \u2013 are looking for ladders to climb down or crosses on which to crucify themselves. Having given the prime minister another political bloody nose, are her colleagues on the hunt for compromises or is the opposition within her Conservative party basically implacable?</p> <p>There\u2019s no single position, but there are hardliners on both sides of the Tory party. Many Conservatives could potentially be won round, having now registered their disapproval of the deal. But diehards are showing little interest in shifting position.

At the other end, kamikaze Eurosceptics seem prepared to bring down the entire temple to secure their ideal Brexit. \u201cBin the backstop,\u201d they demand, something that will inexorably lead to a no-deal exit. Brexit itself now risks being killed by this sort of supporter \u2013 by those who claim to love it the most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/brexit-crisis-fixed-writers-verdict-theresa-may-no-confidence-defeat\">How should this Brexit crisis be fixed? Our writers\u2019 verdicts | Matthew d\u2019Ancona and others</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of the opposition to the prime minister\u2019s deal is, frankly, based on personal or political problems rather than the policy of what she\u2019s actually agreed with the EU. Last month, May survived a confidence vote within the Conservative party in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-trigger-vote-of-no-confidence-in-may-amid-brexit-uncertainty-politics-live\" title=\"\">117 of her own MPs</a> opposed her in a secret ballot on her leadership. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jan/15/how-did-your-mp-vote-on-mays-brexit-deal-meaningful-vote\" title=\"\">118 of her MPs voted against her deal</a> \u2013 almost the exact same margin. A sizeable slice of her party has just fallen out of love with her. And with the race to succeed her becoming ever more open, too many Tory big beasts have their eyes on a future prize.</p> <p>Part of this political mess is the prime minister\u2019s fault. Even at the best of times, she is a wooden political performer. It\u2019s striking that the strongest speeches defending May\u2019s flagship policy \u2013 her Brexit deal \u2013 have been made by other ministers. Her divisive rhetoric after the EU referendum with talk of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-treads-the-brexit-path-of-empathy-and-righteousness\" title=\"\">citizens of nowhere</a>\u201d and her stubborn refusal to guarantee rights for EU nationals living in the UK (contra the commitments of colleagues who had actually campaigned for leave) helped exacerbate divisions in the country and the Conservative party, rather than bringing people together.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also the case that Brexit was always going to require challenging compromises. Campaigns can be conducted in poetry; governing requires prose. And negotiating, with a strong but wounded counter-party, which has its own interests, was always going to be difficult. Then again, May has made major mistakes, from triggering article 50 without an agreed plan, to accepting the concept of a backstop without locking down what it would mean.</p> <p>The biggest single factor shaping Brexit, though, is the result on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/08/live-uk-election-results-in-full-2017\" title=\"\">8 June 2017</a>. In calling a general election, in which she subsequently lost her already slim majority, May set the course for what was bound to be a softer Brexit. She lost the ability to stare down opponents in the Commons, and damaged the credibility at home and in Brussels of her prior claim that she would leave without a deal.</p> <p>Despite Tuesday\u2019s enormous defeat, little has ultimately changed. There are still just three options \u2013 Brexit with no deal (which a large majority of MPs are determined to prevent), stopping Brexit (probably via a second referendum), or leaving with a version of the prime minister\u2019s deal. All three seem largely impossible. Yet one of those paths will have to be followed.</p> <p>There are noisy calls for a plan B, but the truth is there is no negotiated alternative deal on the table. Some demand a pivot to Norway plus, but its advocates admit this would mean accepting the entire binding withdrawal agreement, while tweaking just the political declaration to narrow the range of future outcomes. Plan B is premised on accepting plan A in full.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat\">Brexit:  May's plan for cross-party talks under fire as MPs condemn her for sidelining Corbyn - Politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May remains in a parlous position. A harder Brexit is not on offer from Brussels, and so any significant move in that direction would mean no deal. Shifting to a softer Brexit would alienate more of her own backbenchers.

      "bodyText": "Can Theresa May save her deal? That depends on whether MPs \u2013 and in particular her own backbenchers \u2013 are looking for ladders to climb down or crosses on which to crucify themselves. Having given the prime minister another political bloody nose, are her colleagues on the hunt for compromises or is the opposition within her Conservative party basically implacable? There\u2019s no single position, but there are hardliners on both sides of the Tory party. Many Conservatives could potentially be won round, having now registered their disapproval of the deal. But diehards are showing little interest in shifting position. A few extreme remainers, are determined to rerun the referendum, and so reject any Brexit, even the softest possible so-called Norway plus form. At the other end, kamikaze Eurosceptics seem prepared to bring down the entire temple to secure their ideal Brexit. \u201cBin the backstop,\u201d they demand, something that will inexorably lead to a no-deal exit. Brexit itself now risks being killed by this sort of supporter \u2013 by those who claim to love it the most. Some of the opposition to the prime minister\u2019s deal is, frankly, based on personal or political problems rather than the policy of what she\u2019s actually agreed with the EU. Last month, May survived a confidence vote within the Conservative party in which 117 of her own MPs opposed her in a secret ballot on her leadership. On Tuesday, 118 of her MPs voted against her deal \u2013 almost the exact same margin. A sizeable slice of her party has just fallen out of love with her. And with the race to succeed her becoming ever more open, too many Tory big beasts have their eyes on a future prize. Part of this political mess is the prime minister\u2019s fault. Even at the best of times, she is a wooden political performer. It\u2019s striking that the strongest speeches defending May\u2019s flagship policy \u2013 her Brexit deal \u2013 have been made by other ministers. Her divisive rhetoric after the EU referendum with talk of \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d and her stubborn refusal to guarantee rights for EU nationals living in the UK (contra the commitments of colleagues who had actually campaigned for leave) helped exacerbate divisions in the country and the Conservative party, rather than bringing people together. But it\u2019s also the case that Brexit was always going to require challenging compromises. Campaigns can be conducted in poetry; governing requires prose. And negotiating, with a strong but wounded counter-party, which has its own interests, was always going to be difficult. Then again, May has made major mistakes, from triggering article 50 without an agreed plan, to accepting the concept of a backstop without locking down what it would mean. The biggest single factor shaping Brexit, though, is the result on 8 June 2017. In calling a general election, in which she subsequently lost her already slim majority, May set the course for what was bound to be a softer Brexit. She lost the ability to stare down opponents in the Commons, and damaged the credibility at home and in Brussels of her prior claim that she would leave without a deal. Despite Tuesday\u2019s enormous defeat, little has ultimately changed. There are still just three options \u2013 Brexit with no deal (which a large majority of MPs are determined to prevent), stopping Brexit (probably via a second referendum), or leaving with a version of the prime minister\u2019s deal. All three seem largely impossible. Yet one of those paths will have to be followed. There are noisy calls for a plan B, but the truth is there is no negotiated alternative deal on the table. Some demand a pivot to Norway plus, but its advocates admit this would mean accepting the entire binding withdrawal agreement, while tweaking just the political declaration to narrow the range of future outcomes. Plan B is premised on accepting plan A in full. May remains in a parlous position. A harder Brexit is not on offer from Brussels, and so any significant move in that direction would mean no deal. Shifting to a softer Brexit would alienate more of her own backbenchers. Although wounded, she is not yet politically finished, but she is fast running out of options. At some point, she may decide that she has one significant card left \u2013 committing to relinquish the party leadership after the end of article 50 to allow a new generation to lead the next stage of negotiations. Some critics of her deal have conceded to me, that this concession, combined with some further binding clarification of the backstop\u2019s exit mechanism, could prevent them standing in the way of the deal. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to try to trigger a general election may strengthen the prime minister. Firstly, it moves the political story on, away from whether she has a plan B. Second, she is almost certain to win the vote of confidence this evening, securing her own position. Third, if Labour\u2019s bid to topple the government fails, attention will quickly shift to whether they now back a second referendum or not. If they do, Theresa May can present herself as the only national party leader determined to defend Brexit. That may just help bring some of the Conservative party back together again.

He was two points from taking the first set in the tie-break but was over-eager in charging in behind his serve, dumped a difficult volley, shoved the next chance wide and the moment had gone. He saved two set points in the second, broke back with a brilliant backhand winner and forced a second shootout. The third was more straightforward but he tried all the way.

My thought going in was that I was playing myself, potentially. I had maybe a little more size.\u201d</p> <p>Evans laughed at that. \u201cI think he meant in game style rather than level.\u201d He was encouraged, though, by Federer\u2019s praise.</p> <p>Federer continued: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not surprised [at how well he played]. I have high regard for Dan. He\u2019s a good player. I\u2019ve seen him play some really good matches over the years. I see why he can cause difficulties to players. He\u2019s got a nice slice, defending the court well. He has the variation, which is always a hard thing to play against. It was very cat and mouse today. Very interesting. I liked the match.\u201d</p> <p>On Evans\u2019s prospects of ever returning to a career-high 41 in the world, Federer said: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know his ranking. For me he\u2019s a top 100 player. Once you\u2019re 80 or 60 or 40, you can be all those things, and beyond probably. I just think it\u2019s in the details at the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was in Evans\u2019s own hands how well he did from this point of a most interesting career. \u201cHow much can you give to the sport? How much are you willing? Can you stay injury-free? Get your ranking up, be really there for the crucial moments? I think he can be top 50 again, no problem.\u201d</p> <p>That was almost as good as a win.

      "bodyText": "A year after he found himself \u201cin a pretty bad place\u201d and contemplating retirement from tennis at 27, Dan Evans can smile again, bathed in accolades for three sets against Roger Federer that lit up day three of the Australian Open \u2013 and gave the loser much-needed heart. It took Federer two and a half hours to beat the world No 189 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3), 6-3 on the Rod Laver Arena, a place where he has celebrated victory in the first major of the year six times. None of that fazed the Solihull adventurer, a plainly gifted player who has survived the excesses of his own personality, including a nine-month ban for testing positive for cocaine. That pitched him towards the edge. This has dragged him back. As he said later, he was not remotely interested in his sport this time last year. He was still banned, and a nuisance to all around him, he admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t watch any of the matches,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in a pretty bad place. The nine months I had off were terrible \u2026 [long pause] \u2026 Yeah I was in a bad place and that\u2019s just how it is. A lot went on and a lot has gone on \u2013 a lot of shit, basically. \u201cI had a good amount of people around me telling me it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought, and you come out of it on the other side. Hopefully I can kick on and get back to where I was. \u201cI was at home in Cheltenham, just in the house \u2013 pretty much depressed, actually. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever play again. It\u2019s difficult times, like. I don\u2019t know how I end up still having the people around me who were there. I was difficult to be around. I owe them a lot. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve got family and friends for. Hopefully, they enjoyed this week as much as I did.\u201d Certainly the spectators rose to his heroics, even if, as ever, the majority were hoping Federer would not be dumped out of the tournament, or even mildly inconvenienced. Evans did more than that. Buoyed by three decent wins in qualifying, Evans played with freedom, \u201cnothing to lose\u201a\u201d as he said. He was two points from taking the first set in the tie-break but was over-eager in charging in behind his serve, dumped a difficult volley, shoved the next chance wide and the moment had gone. He saved two set points in the second, broke back with a brilliant backhand winner and forced a second shootout. The third was more straightforward but he tried all the way. Federer was impressed. In reference to the similarities in their method and tennis philosophy, from the one-handed backhands to the sliced returns, as well as their willingness to attack at every opportunity, he said: \u201cIt felt like playing in a mirror a little bit. My thought going in was that I was playing myself, potentially. I had maybe a little more size.\u201d Evans laughed at that. \u201cI think he meant in game style rather than level.\u201d He was encouraged, though, by Federer\u2019s praise. Federer continued: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not surprised [at how well he played]. I have high regard for Dan. He\u2019s a good player. I\u2019ve seen him play some really good matches over the years. I see why he can cause difficulties to players. He\u2019s got a nice slice, defending the court well. He has the variation, which is always a hard thing to play against. It was very cat and mouse today. Very interesting. I liked the match.\u201d On Evans\u2019s prospects of ever returning to a career-high 41 in the world, Federer said: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know his ranking. For me he\u2019s a top 100 player. Once you\u2019re 80 or 60 or 40, you can be all those things, and beyond probably. I just think it\u2019s in the details at the end of the day.\u201d He said it was in Evans\u2019s own hands how well he did from this point of a most interesting career. \u201cHow much can you give to the sport? How much are you willing? Can you stay injury-free? Get your ranking up, be really there for the crucial moments? I think he can be top 50 again, no problem.\u201d That was almost as good as a win. Almost.",

That decision had \u201cdivided the British people into two tribes that over time have become bitter enemies\u201d, Hansson said. \u201cA proud, once-great power is now dedicated to committing serious self-harm \u2013 which could also damage Sweden \u2026 And no one, I repeat no one, knows what will happen now.\u201d The German press was more constructive, Berliner Morgenpost saying the situation in the UK was now so desperate that the EU must adapt. \u201cThe bloc has negotiated hard, wanting to set an example, and has pushed May right up against the wall,\u201d it said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the EU heads to leap over their own shadows and offer a compromise. It is not yet too late to give May support.\u201d The Rheinische Post, however, asked what might happen if the British stayed. What sort of country would it be? A \u201ctraumatised partner \u2026 would be far harder to integrate than before,\u201d it said. \u201cA politically hopelessly divided and lame Britain could cause a great deal of harm within the EU. \u201cWhich is why, for both sides, it would actually be better if the British were to complete their exit. If they then notice in the next few years that the EU maybe wasn\u2019t the hell on earth they had thought it to be, they could gladly return.\u201d France\u2019s Les Echos said it was \u201cdifficult to say what will happen\u201d over the next few days, since \u201cthe rejection of the text by such a huge margin, 70 days from Brexit day, risks plunging the country into deep uncertainty\u201d. Le Monde had a portrait of May (\u201cShipwrecked by Brexit\u201d) saying the prime minister was \u201cvaliant, but without a clear vision on Europe \u2026 She has shown herself, for the last two years, incapable of implementing Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\u201d The paper said the rejection of the Brexit text \u201caggravates the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future.\u201d Europe1 radio said the defeat was \u201chumiliating\u201d for the British prime minister, while France Inter radio described the defeat as a \u201ccoup de Trafalgar\u201d, with the prime minister hit \u2013 though not necessarily knocked down altogether. In Italy, Enrico Franceschini said \u2013 with apologies to Winston Churchill \u2013 in La Repubblica that Brexit \u201chas revealed itself as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma: cancelling it would entail problems \u2013 but that could be the only way out of the labyrinth it has created.\u201d In La Stampa, Stefano Stefanini warned that, without an agreement, 29 March \u201cwill be chaos. The risks extend beyond the Channel, where emergency plans are already being made for medicines and food. Repercussions would also be felt on the continent.\u201d In Greece, the media was in rare agreement that the UK was in uncharted waters. \u201cThere is astonishment that a democracy as old as Britain has got itself into such a dead end,\u201d commentator Pantelis Kapsis said. \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of mess Greece would get itself into.\u201d The Efimerida Twn Syntaktwn paper, which often reflects the views of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist government, predicted that while May would likely survive tonight\u2019s confidence vote, the most likely scenario was an extension of the country\u2019s exit date until July \u201cin order to give London more time\u201d. The conservative Kathimerini, in particularly pessimistic mood, said prospects for an alternative solution were far from good.

The five-and-a-half-minute unskippable video was displayed before content relating to Brexit and British politics. It prominently displayed the Britain First logo and contained a link to the group\u2019s YouTube channel. The advert showed the group\u2019s leader, Paul Golding, and a number of supporters confronting volunteers at a Muslim outreach stall in Nuneaton in November 2018.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s plans for cross-party co-operation on Brexit were condemned after it emerged that she was not seeking to involve Jeremy Corbyn despite Tuesday\u2019s historic defeat of her plan. Andrea Leadsom admitted Labour\u2019s leader had not been invited to cross-party talks and indicated that Corbyn needed to say what he wanted from Brexit before being invited to speak to the prime minister. May offered cross-party talks after MPs rejected her deal by a majority of 230, with more than a third of Conservatives rebelling. With only 72 days to go before Britain leaves, however, Labour MPs demanded that she extend article 50 to give time for a consensus to be found. Leadsom told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Corbyn had not been invited because he was primarily interested in forcing a general election instead of striking a Brexit deal. \u201cLet us look at what Jeremy Corbyn is doing here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had the opportunity to put to the house what his proposals were. He clearly hasn\u2019t any and what he seeks to do is to disrupt government and the nation at a crucial time as he seeks a general election. \u201cThe PM will be engaging right across the house with people \u2026 who want to talk constructively.\u201d Labour has insisted it has a clear policy of seeking a customs union and maintaining workers\u2019 rights. Responding to Leadsom, the Labour MP Yvette Cooper wrote on Twitter: \u201cLeadsom making a mockery of Theresa May\u2019s proposal for cross-party talks this morning. Ludicrous &amp; unworkable if PM won\u2019t even talk to @jeremycorbyn &amp; other party leaders. PM has to accept she failed by 230 votes \u2013 she can\u2019t just keep digging in.\u201d Further criticism of the government\u2019s plan for cross-party talks came from Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister of Scotland, who said that May would have to review her \u201cred lines\u201d for cross-party talks to be successful. \u201cIf none of PM\u2019s red lines change, what progress can she possibly make?\u201d she wrote on Twitter. No 10 said on Tuesday, after the vote, that the same principles that governed May\u2019s Brexit deal would be applied to a future deal. \u201cWe want to deliver an orderly Brexit with a deal. One that protects our union, gives us control of our borders, laws and money, and means we have an independent trade policy,\u201d a Downing Street spokesman said. May offered to establish talks with \u201csenior parliamentarians\u201d after MPs rejected her deal by a majority of 230. The prime minister will face a vote of no confidence in parliament on Wednesday, which she is expected to survive with the support of the DUP and pro-Brexit Conservative MPs. Asked whether the government might accept an invitation by some EU leaders to delay Brexit, Leadsom told Today: \u201cWe are clear we won\u2019t be delaying article 50. We won\u2019t be revoking it.\u201d Labour confirmed on Wednesday morning that May\u2019s government had not yet reached out to the official opposition to establish talks over how to get a deal through parliament. Interviewed on the same programme, John McDonnell said the government had not approached Labour\u2019s leader to discuss how to draw up a new Brexit plan, despite the prime minister\u2019s pledge to hold talks. \u201cWhen the prime minister indicated she was likely to talk across the house, she said she would speak to leading MPs. We have not had any approach from the prime minister to Jeremy Corbyn and we don\u2019t think the other parties have either,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. McDonnell called on May to extend article 50 to give time for a consensus to be found. He also refused to rule out supporting a second referendum, or so-called people\u2019s vote. Corbyn is under increasing pressure from MPs to support a second referendum. David Lammy, the Tottenham MP, said he was one of nearly 100 Labour MPs who were urging Corbyn to spell out what the party wanted instead of leaving all options on the table. \u201cIf he [Corbyn] vacillates and sits on the fence I\u2019m afraid he is going to get splinters in a place he doesn\u2019t want,\u201d he said. Gus O\u2019Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, said senior civil servants across Whitehall would have the huge task of preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit, a possible softer Brexit and a possible general election as it waited for the government and parliament to decide how to proceed. \u201cYou have to be ready for a general election and asking the government if you can start preparing for a general election. Are we saying customs union, a softer Brexit or a harder Brexit?\u201d he said. \u201cAs we speak, there are a lot of civil servants being transferred across to work across all departments. They are going to have to work around the clock.\u201d Two hundred and two MPs voted in favour of May\u2019s deal, with 432 against. The previous biggest meaningful defeat of a prime minister was in 1924, when Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s short-lived minority Labour government lost by 166 votes. Among Tory MPs, 118 voted against May\u2019s deal, compared with 196 who backed it. Only three Labour MPs, along with three independents, supported the prime minister.",

The reality is that bonuses for average workers are up by just <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/bonuses-are-up-0-02-since-the-gop-tax-cuts-passed/\">two cents an hour</a> since Trump\u2019s tax plan was signed into law.</p> <p>Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by 1.2% \u2013 just $9.11 a week after adjusting for <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CWSR0000SA0\">inflation</a>. Meanwhile, while the very rich get richer, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. That is the economic reality under Trump and that is the economic reality of the past 40 years.</p> <p>The truth is that the average worker makes <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet\">less</a> today than he or she made 43 years ago after adjusting for inflation. In other words, as the price of healthcare, prescription drugs, housing, childcare and a college education continue to go through the roof, wages for the average worker have not kept pace.</p> <p>Further, while the official <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">unemployment rate</a> is relatively low at 3.9%, the real unemployment rate is much higher. If you include those who have given up looking for work and those who are working part-time when they need a full-time job, the real unemployment rate is not 3.9%. It is <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">7.6%</a>. Even worse, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12300060\">over 20%</a> of Americans in their prime working years (between the ages of 25-54) do not have a job \u2013 which is higher than was the case 11 years ago.</p> <p>And the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/class-of-2018-high-school-edition/\">real unemployment rate</a> for young adults is still off the charts.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump tells us the US economy is \u201cabsolutely booming\u201d, the \u201cstrongest we\u2019ve ever had\u201d and \u201cthe greatest in the history of America\u201d. Well, at his Mar-a-Lago country club where the price of admission has doubled to $200,000, he is right. The economy could not be better for the top 1% and corporate America. In 2017, the top 10 corporate executives in America saw their combined compensation skyrocket by over 60% from the year before soaring to $1.85bn. The top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street made over $15.3bn in compensation in 2017, up 40% from 2016 \u2013 the highest in four years. Incredibly, this $15.3bn is nearly double what all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America made last year. Not surprisingly, since Trump was elected, the five richest people in America have seen their wealth go up by over $100bn and corporations have announced over $1tn in stock buybacks in 2018 alone. Yes, under Trump, the economy is \u201cabsolutely booming\u201d for the billionaire class and corporate America. But for working families, the economy is not doing so great. Remember when Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families? Well, it didn\u2019t quite happen that way. The reality is that bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since Trump\u2019s tax plan was signed into law. Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by 1.2% \u2013 just $9.11 a week after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, while the very rich get richer, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. That is the economic reality under Trump and that is the economic reality of the past 40 years. The truth is that the average worker makes less today than he or she made 43 years ago after adjusting for inflation. In other words, as the price of healthcare, prescription drugs, housing, childcare and a college education continue to go through the roof, wages for the average worker have not kept pace. Further, while the official unemployment rate is relatively low at 3.9%, the real unemployment rate is much higher. If you include those who have given up looking for work and those who are working part-time when they need a full-time job, the real unemployment rate is not 3.9%. It is 7.6%. Even worse, over 20% of Americans in their prime working years (between the ages of 25-54) do not have a job \u2013 which is higher than was the case 11 years ago. And the real unemployment rate for young adults is still off the charts. According to the most recent data from the Economic Policy Institute, over 25% of young white Americans between the ages of 18 and 21 who have graduated high school are unemployed or underemployed. For Hispanic people in the same age group it is nearly 27%. And young African American adults are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 40%. No, Donald Trump, the economy is not \u201cabsolutely booming\u201d when nearly 80% of workers live paycheck to paycheck \u2013 hoping that they don\u2019t get sick or that their car doesn\u2019t break down. It\u2019s not the \u201cgreatest\u201d economy in \u201cthe history of America\u201d when 43% of households can\u2019t afford to pay for housing, food, childcare, healthcare, transportation and a cellphone without going into debt. The economy is not \u201cbooming\u201d when Americans are reaching retirement age in worse financial shape than their parents and when about half of older Americans have no retirement savings and no idea how they will be able to retire in dignity. It\u2019s not the \u201cstrongest\u201d economy \u201cwe\u2019ve ever had\u201d when hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to go to college because of the cost, over 30 million Americans have no health insurance, one out of five Americans can\u2019t afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors and over 40 million Americans are living in poverty. This is not an economy we should be proud of when we have the highest childhood poverty rate in the developed world and life expectancy in the US has gone down for the third year in a row. While working families continue to struggle, the US now has more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the 1920s. Since the Wall Street crash, 46% of all new income that has been created in the US has gone to the top 1%. Corporate CEOs have seen their incomes go up by 937% over the past 40 years and now make over 360 times more than their average workers. While corporate profits are near an all-time high, wages as a percentage of the economy are near an all-time low. The most important economic reality of our time is that over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income and wealth from the middle class to the wealthiest people in America. Since 1979, the bottom 90% of Americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58 % to just 46% costing them nearly $11,000 per household. As bad as income inequality is, the inequality in wealth is even worse. In America today, the top 0.1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. The three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans \u2013 160 million people. Meanwhile, the median household in America has less wealth today than it did 35 years ago after adjusting for inflation, and the average wealth of those in the bottom 40% is virtually zero. While low-income workers at Walmart are forced to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive, the Walton family is now worth nearly $170bn. Shockingly, the wealth gap between white Americans and African Americans has more than tripled over the past 50 years. Today, the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, Trump\u2019s policies are moving this country in exactly the wrong direction. Over 83% of the benefits of Trump\u2019s tax plan is going to the top 1%. The morally bankrupt budget Trump released last year would have made massive cuts to programs desperately needed by working families, the elderly, the sick, the children and the poor. That is unacceptable. Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, we must demand that they pay their fair share in taxes. Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations. Instead of throwing millions of Americans off of the healthcare they have, we must join every other major country on earth and guarantee healthcare as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All system. Instead of cutting social security and nutrition assistance for seniors, we should expand those programs so that every American can retire with dignity and respect. Instead of gutting the social safety net, we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. Instead of cutting Pell grants and increasing interest rates on student loans, we should make public colleges and universities tuition free and substantially lower student debt. Instead of privatizing our infrastructure, we should rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges, transit and rail, water systems and electric grid, and create up to 15m good jobs in the process. Together, we must fight for a society that works for the many, not the few. We must fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice, not unbridled greed.",

Oklahoma\u2019s Kyler Murray has done a masterful job pitting two sporting giants, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, against each other.</p> <p>Let\u2019s rewind for a moment to explain what\u2019s happened. Murray was a brilliant two-sport athlete in high school, which is little surprise given that his father was once a star quarterback at Texas A&amp;M and his uncle played professionally for the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs. Murray started off his college career playing both sports, but the Oakland A\u2019s were excited enough by his talent that they picked Murray in the 2018 first-year player draft and signed him to a deal that guaranteed the outfielder $4.6m. This despite the fact that Murray was still playing football.</p> <p>The rest, as they say, is history. Murray, who had been a fringe college football player prior to the 2018 season, strolled into the Sooner\u2019s QB-friendly offense and exploded. Murray threw for 4,361 yards, ran for another 1,001 and accounted for 54 total touchdowns (42 passing, 12 rushing), leading Oklahoma to the College Football Playoff. He capped the year off by winning the Heisman Trophy, the sport\u2019s most prestigious individual honor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/09/trevor-lawrence-clemson-draft-nfl-college-football\">Trevor Lawrence is already great at 19.

On Monday, Murray revealed his choice with a simple tweet:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheKylerMurray/status/1084908931007348737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have declared for the NFL Draft.</p>&mdash; Kyler Murray (@TheKylerMurray) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheKylerMurray/status/1084908931007348737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 14, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But that\u2019s not the end of the discussion. Monday was the deadline for Murray to declare himself eligible for April\u2019s NFL draft, not the fail-safe point before his final decision. He hasn\u2019t signed a deal with an NFL team, and could still report for spring training with the A\u2019s at the end of February. If he does choose football, he will forfeit his $4.6m bonus with the A\u2019s.</p> <p>That gives Murray, his family and representatives a month to figure out how much he\u2019s worth to an NFL team, but the general feeling is that he\u2019s a star in the making even if, at 5ft 10in, he is very small for an NFL quarterback. For example, the new Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/2019/1/10/18176792/kliff-kingsbury-kyler-murray-2019-nfl-draft-no-1-overall-good-news-kliff\">said in October</a> he would take Murray with the first overall pick in this year\u2019s draft if he had the chance.</p> <p>If Murray is confident he will be a first-round selection, and his first love is football, this should be an easy decision: the NFL wins every time. Let\u2019s start with the money. The average annual MLB salary is around $4.5m compared to $2.9m in the NFL. What\u2019s more, baseball players\u2019 careers are longer and every cent of their contracts are fully guaranteed.</p> <p>But quarterbacks selected in the first round aren\u2019t average players. Last year\u2019s top overall pick, Baker Mayfield, <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cleveland-browns/baker-mayfield-25096/cash-earnings/\">landed a $21.8m signing bonus</a> and will earn $32m during his four-year rookie deal. Even at the tail end of the first round, NFL signal-callers do well for themselves. Lamar Jackson, selected 32nd overall in the 2018 draft, the final pick of the opening round, commanded a signing bonus a hair above $4.9m, more than Murray\u2019s current deal with the A\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"281f4959d4547ab62af3eaa33063ac56b5d85a05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281f4959d4547ab62af3eaa33063ac56b5d85a05/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyler Murray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyler Murray takes batting practice after signing his contract with the Oakland A\u2019s in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Zagaris/Oakland Athletics/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dynamics of long-term quarterback deals are changing, too. Many NFL contracts sound huge but much of the money is not guaranteed. That paradigm appears to be shifting. Kirk Cousins\u2019 agent made sure the $90m contract his client signed with the Vikings last offseason was wholly guaranteed. Aaron Rodgers worked out a <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/green-bay-packers/aaron-rodgers-3745/\">similar deal</a> in which close to $100m of his new deal is non-refundable.</p> <p>Off the field, football has the edge, too.<em><strong> </strong></em>Cam Newton, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees all earn more money in endorsements than they do from their NFL salaries. To reach that level of fame in MLB, and therefore command that kind of money, is a long, arduous road. After all, baseball has failed spectacularly to market Mike Trout, arguably the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jul/12/mike-trout-los-angeles-angels-mlb-baseball\">most gifted player</a> in the game\u2019s rich history.</p> <p>Last year a market research firm <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fsports%2fbaseballs-dilemma-mike-trout-is-mlbs-ultimate-all-star-and-yet-he-is-not-a-star%2f2018%2f07%2f16%2fbc17e36c-8490-11e8-8f6c-46cb43e3f306_story.html%3futm_term%3d.e97c7a9b7c74&amp;utm_term=.09d9a9b9b5e3\">told the Washington Post</a> that only 22% of Americans know who Trout is. Only LeBron James, Lionel Messi and Aaron Rodgers compare to Trout on the field: all-time greats doing all-time great things in the social media age. But according to the Post report, Trout\u2019s recognition level was equal with NBA bench player Kenneth Faried. Only one baseball player ranks in the 100 most followed athletes on Twitter: Tim Tebow, a former college football star, whose baseball career is stuck in the New York Mets\u2019 minor-league system.</p> <p>There\u2019s a slight chance the financial discrepancy won\u2019t be so great if Murray does choose baseball. ESPN <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1084596020783271937\">reported on Sunday</a> that MLB had given the A\u2019s approval to offer Murray a major league deal with significant guaranteed money \u2013 Murray wants $15m \u2013 in an effort to convince him to stick to baseball. MLB rules prevent teams from signing players right out of the draft to major league deals, but Murray\u2019s situation is considered unique given his post-draft success and national relevancy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jun/13/john-elway-dan-marino-1979-mlb-draft-kansas-city-royals\">It could have changed NFL forever: the day the Royals drafted Elway and Marino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a lifestyle question here, too. Murray was a superstar before he turned 18: he may have been the best high school football player in Texas history. At Oklahoma, he won the biggest award college sports has to offer. But getting to the big leagues in baseball is <em>hard. </em>Top draft picks are routinely sent down to the minors to develop their games: the average player spends anywhere from three to five years in the farm system, sometimes longer, and the flameout rate even among touted prospects is high. Minor-league lifers <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2018/04/05/business/minor-league-baseball-draws-fans-and-dispute-over-pay\">earn below a living wage</a> thanks to a spending bill that exempts baseball teams from having to pay minor-league players minimum wage and overtime for all hours worked. A life of luxury it is not.</p> <p>NFL players, by contrast, are thrown directly into action. There is no minor league or developmental structure you must work through before seeing the field, since college serves that purpose. Murray may not start right away in the NFL, or have overnight success, but he\u2019ll at least get to enjoy all the trappings of being a professional athlete, and a star one at that.</p> <p>MLB does have one thing going for it, however: long-term health. Baseball is unquestionably easier on the body than football. The NFL has never been safer but it is not <em>safe. </em>Even with all the rule changes meant to protect the health of quarterbacks, playing pro football is asking for a lifetime of health concerns, and the dangers of brain trauma in the NFL are never far from the national conversation. Retired baseball players, meanwhile, still suffer the aches of pains of anyone who has devoted their life to sports, but the incidence of serious brain injury relative to football is infinitesimal. And, besides, any MLB player who spends 41 days on a big-league roster is granted a pension and access to MLB\u2019s healthcare program for life.</p> <p>Ultimately, Murray will soon be a very rich young man, whichever sport he chooses. He has played his hand perfectly so far, leveraging the NFL and MLB against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jun/13/john-elway-dan-marino-1979-mlb-draft-kansas-city-royals\">one another in a way no athlete has since John Elway</a>. Now he gets to follow his heart and pick the sport he grew up dreaming of playing. Only he knows which one that is.</p>",

For example, the new Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury said in October he would take Murray with the first overall pick in this year\u2019s draft if he had the chance. If Murray is confident he will be a first-round selection, and his first love is football, this should be an easy decision: the NFL wins every time. Let\u2019s start with the money. The average annual MLB salary is around $4.5m compared to $2.9m in the NFL. What\u2019s more, baseball players\u2019 careers are longer and every cent of their contracts are fully guaranteed. But quarterbacks selected in the first round aren\u2019t average players. Last year\u2019s top overall pick, Baker Mayfield, landed a $21.8m signing bonus and will earn $32m during his four-year rookie deal. Even at the tail end of the first round, NFL signal-callers do well for themselves. Lamar Jackson, selected 32nd overall in the 2018 draft, the final pick of the opening round, commanded a signing bonus a hair above $4.9m, more than Murray\u2019s current deal with the A\u2019s. The dynamics of long-term quarterback deals are changing, too. Many NFL contracts sound huge but much of the money is not guaranteed. That paradigm appears to be shifting. Kirk Cousins\u2019 agent made sure the $90m contract his client signed with the Vikings last offseason was wholly guaranteed. Aaron Rodgers worked out a similar deal in which close to $100m of his new deal is non-refundable. Off the field, football has the edge, too. Cam Newton, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees all earn more money in endorsements than they do from their NFL salaries. To reach that level of fame in MLB, and therefore command that kind of money, is a long, arduous road. After all, baseball has failed spectacularly to market Mike Trout, arguably the most gifted player in the game\u2019s rich history. Last year a market research firm told the Washington Post that only 22% of Americans know who Trout is. Only LeBron James, Lionel Messi and Aaron Rodgers compare to Trout on the field: all-time greats doing all-time great things in the social media age. But according to the Post report, Trout\u2019s recognition level was equal with NBA bench player Kenneth Faried. Only one baseball player ranks in the 100 most followed athletes on Twitter: Tim Tebow, a former college football star, whose baseball career is stuck in the New York Mets\u2019 minor-league system. There\u2019s a slight chance the financial discrepancy won\u2019t be so great if Murray does choose baseball. ESPN reported on Sunday that MLB had given the A\u2019s approval to offer Murray a major league deal with significant guaranteed money \u2013 Murray wants $15m \u2013 in an effort to convince him to stick to baseball. MLB rules prevent teams from signing players right out of the draft to major league deals, but Murray\u2019s situation is considered unique given his post-draft success and national relevancy. There\u2019s a lifestyle question here, too. Murray was a superstar before he turned 18: he may have been the best high school football player in Texas history. At Oklahoma, he won the biggest award college sports has to offer. But getting to the big leagues in baseball is hard. Top draft picks are routinely sent down to the minors to develop their games: the average player spends anywhere from three to five years in the farm system, sometimes longer, and the flameout rate even among touted prospects is high. Minor-league lifers earn below a living wage thanks to a spending bill that exempts baseball teams from having to pay minor-league players minimum wage and overtime for all hours worked. A life of luxury it is not. NFL players, by contrast, are thrown directly into action. There is no minor league or developmental structure you must work through before seeing the field, since college serves that purpose. Murray may not start right away in the NFL, or have overnight success, but he\u2019ll at least get to enjoy all the trappings of being a professional athlete, and a star one at that. MLB does have one thing going for it, however: long-term health. Baseball is unquestionably easier on the body than football. The NFL has never been safer but it is not safe. Even with all the rule changes meant to protect the health of quarterbacks, playing pro football is asking for a lifetime of health concerns, and the dangers of brain trauma in the NFL are never far from the national conversation. Retired baseball players, meanwhile, still suffer the aches of pains of anyone who has devoted their life to sports, but the incidence of serious brain injury relative to football is infinitesimal. And, besides, any MLB player who spends 41 days on a big-league roster is granted a pension and access to MLB\u2019s healthcare program for life. Ultimately, Murray will soon be a very rich young man, whichever sport he chooses. He has played his hand perfectly so far, leveraging the NFL and MLB against one another in a way no athlete has since John Elway. Now he gets to follow his heart and pick the sport he grew up dreaming of playing. Only he knows which one that is.",

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier has said Brexit is at a standstill after the crushing rejection of Theresa May\u2019s deal by MPs but offered to return to the negotiating table if parliament forces Theresa May to shift her \u201cred lines\u201d. The motivations of the MPs who delivered the rebuff \u2013 a defeat by 230 votes, the largest ever for a sitting government \u2013 were described by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator as \u201ccontradictory\u201d. Barnier said parliament had failed to offer an alternative vision on Tuesday evening, warning May that nothing could progress until she found a Commons majority for a deal. His comments were echoed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who said there was still time to negotiate, but \u201cwe believe it is up to the British side, as the prime minister has announced, to tell us what happens next.\u201d Barnier told the European parliament in Strasbourg that statements from MPs during the Commons debate had \u201cmade us sad\u201d.

Critics of May\u2019s deal have called for a time limit or unilateral right to exit the arrangements.

The backstop must remain a backstop.\u201d With only 10 weeks to go until 29 March, when the UK is due to leave the EU, Barnier said the risk of a no-deal Brexit was greater than ever and the European commission was \u201cstepping up\u201d its preparations. Brussels is waiting on the UK parliament to take control of the Brexit talks next Monday, when the prime minister will put forward a motion detailing her plans, which will be liable to be amended by MPs. The first expected step is for MPs to seek an extension of the two-year negotiating period. Peter Altmaier, Germany\u2019s economics minister, who is close to Angela Merkel, suggested a request would be endorsed by the 27 member states. He said: \u201cWhen parliament needs more time, then this is something that will have to be considered by the European council, and personally I would see that as a reasonable request.\u201d Asked about delaying Brexit, France\u2019s EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, nodded, however, to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s concerns about such a prolongation. \u201cIt\u2019s a hypothesis \u2026 juridically and hypothetically it\u2019s possible but Theresa May has not asked and it needs the agreement of the other 27 European nations,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to do what?

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.royalmint.com/rare-edward-viii-gold-sovereign/\" title=\"\">Edward VIII gold sovereign</a> has legendary status among coin enthusiasts for two reasons. Firstly, the infamously vain king broke with protocol by refusing to be depicted facing towards the right, believing his left to be his better side. Then due to his abdication, the coin never actually entered into circulation, becoming known as \u201cthe coinage that never was\u201d. In 2014 an Edward VIII sovereign broke records for a British coin, selling at auction for \u00a3516,000.</p> <p>It is not clear how many of these sovereigns were actually minted, though one of them \u2013 of rather shady provenance \u2013 turns up in Anne Griffin\u2019s impressively confident debut novel, in the unlikely environs of a dairy farm in the Irish village of Rainsford, County Meath. Reputedly won in a poker game from one of Edward VIII\u2019s footmen, the coin has become the prized possession of the local landowner, Hugh Dollard, a notorious drunkard and bully.</p> <p>Young farm labourer Maurice Hannigan has suffered repeated violence and abuse at the hands of his employer and his equally vindictive son, Thomas. When the precious coin is mislaid in a family argument, Maurice unthinkingly pockets it. \u201cIf I\u2019d known back then how that decision of mine ruined the lives inside that house for generations to come,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI wonder would I have walked on, stepping over its pull, its power? But all I knew then was revenge.\u201d</p> <p>The legacy of the coin, and its curse, is related by the now 84-year-old Maurice, sitting at the bar of the former Dollard residence, which has since been converted into a hotel. Over the course of a single evening in 2014, Maurice lines up five drinks and proposes a toast for each, instigating extended internal monologues dedicated to the five individuals who have most closely shaped his life and experience.</p> <p>The first toast is raised to Maurice\u2019s elder brother Tony, whom he idolised but who died of consumption at an early age. The second monologue is dedicated to Maurice\u2019s stillborn daughter Molly, and the third to his disturbed sister-in-law Noreen, considered in the language of the time to be suffering from \u201cmelancholy\u201d and committed to an asylum. The fourth toast goes to Maurice\u2019s only surviving child, Kevin, who left rural Meath to pursue a journalistic career in America; before he finally raises a glass to his beloved wife Sadie, whose death two years ago is still raw in his memory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The structure is pleasingly clear \u2013 successive libations give rise to five fully realised individual works of fiction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Griffin\u2019s novel was apparently inspired by a chance encounter in a hotel bar with an elderly man who confided that he worked in the building as a boy and that he expected the night to be his last. As a novel whose central themes are grief, separation and mental illness it would be very easy for the writing to become bogged down in self-pity. Yet Maurice Hannigan emerges as an engaging, compassionate creation who seems fully aware that he conforms to a stereotype: \u201cAs for Irish men, I\u2019ve news for you.

      "bodyText": "The Edward VIII gold sovereign has legendary status among coin enthusiasts for two reasons. Firstly, the infamously vain king broke with protocol by refusing to be depicted facing towards the right, believing his left to be his better side. Then due to his abdication, the coin never actually entered into circulation, becoming known as \u201cthe coinage that never was\u201d. In 2014 an Edward VIII sovereign broke records for a British coin, selling at auction for \u00a3516,000. It is not clear how many of these sovereigns were actually minted, though one of them \u2013 of rather shady provenance \u2013 turns up in Anne Griffin\u2019s impressively confident debut novel, in the unlikely environs of a dairy farm in the Irish village of Rainsford, County Meath. Reputedly won in a poker game from one of Edward VIII\u2019s footmen, the coin has become the prized possession of the local landowner, Hugh Dollard, a notorious drunkard and bully. Young farm labourer Maurice Hannigan has suffered repeated violence and abuse at the hands of his employer and his equally vindictive son, Thomas. When the precious coin is mislaid in a family argument, Maurice unthinkingly pockets it. \u201cIf I\u2019d known back then how that decision of mine ruined the lives inside that house for generations to come,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI wonder would I have walked on, stepping over its pull, its power? But all I knew then was revenge.\u201d The legacy of the coin, and its curse, is related by the now 84-year-old Maurice, sitting at the bar of the former Dollard residence, which has since been converted into a hotel. Over the course of a single evening in 2014, Maurice lines up five drinks and proposes a toast for each, instigating extended internal monologues dedicated to the five individuals who have most closely shaped his life and experience. The first toast is raised to Maurice\u2019s elder brother Tony, whom he idolised but who died of consumption at an early age. The second monologue is dedicated to Maurice\u2019s stillborn daughter Molly, and the third to his disturbed sister-in-law Noreen, considered in the language of the time to be suffering from \u201cmelancholy\u201d and committed to an asylum. The fourth toast goes to Maurice\u2019s only surviving child, Kevin, who left rural Meath to pursue a journalistic career in America; before he finally raises a glass to his beloved wife Sadie, whose death two years ago is still raw in his memory. Griffin\u2019s novel was apparently inspired by a chance encounter in a hotel bar with an elderly man who confided that he worked in the building as a boy and that he expected the night to be his last. As a novel whose central themes are grief, separation and mental illness it would be very easy for the writing to become bogged down in self-pity. Yet Maurice Hannigan emerges as an engaging, compassionate creation who seems fully aware that he conforms to a stereotype: \u201cAs for Irish men, I\u2019ve news for you. It\u2019s worse as you get older. It\u2019s like we tunnel ourselves deeper into our aloneness. Solving our problems on our own. Men, sitting alone at bars going over and over the same old territory in their heads.\u201d There is a pleasing clarity to Griffin\u2019s five-act structure, in which the successive libations give rise to five fully realised individual works of fiction. Particularly affecting is the gulf of separation that opens up between the barely literate Maurice and his journalist son, divided both by education and the Atlantic.

Thomas Dollard\u2019s monomaniacal obsession with recovering his missing treasure culminates in a deliciously absurd encounter in the hotel bar with the childlike Noreen, whose kleptomaniac attraction towards shiny objects makes no discrimination between a couple of shillings and a numismatic marvel worth over half a million pounds.

In October 2017, an al-Shabaab truck bomb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/truck-bomb-mogadishu-kills-people-somalia\">killed more than 500 people</a> in the capital, Mogadishu. The group often attacks restaurants and hotels, using tactics similar to those employed in Nairobi.</p> \n<p>Experts said Wednesday\u2019s attack was designed to attract media attention.</p> \n<p>\u201cA terror attack is \u2026 purely media theatre. The number of casualties is not the primary objective. It is to attack a high-profile target, especially where westerners are going to be so the west is interested,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baaraandag?lang=en\">Hussein Sheikh-Ali</a>, a former national security adviser in Somalia and chairman of the Hiraal Institute, a Mogadishu-based research centre.</p> \n<p>In the last year, al-Shabaab has been the target of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/11/us-airstrikes-fail-to-weaken-al-shabaab-grip-on-somalia\">an intense campaign of US airstrikes. </a>These have inflicted significant casualties and killed several senior leaders.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis [recent] Nairobi attack is a response first and foremost to the airstrikes. They are sending a message that the US strikes have not degraded them as the US military and some media have claimed. They are saying \u2018we are in business\u2019,\u201d Ali said.</p> \n<p>A second factor may be to influence public opinion in Kenya.

      "bodyText": "Intelligence services in Kenya were warned that al-Shabaab was planning terrorist attacks on high-profile targets in the east African country around Christmas and the new year, western and regional security officials have said. Officials and other sources told the Guardian the warnings had been passed on several times in recent months, adding that they had been frustrated not to see a greater response from Kenyan authorities. Security forces cleared the hotel, restaurant and office complex in Nairobi on Wednesday morning after it was attacked the previous day by four gunmen from al-Shabaab, an Islamic extremist organisation based in neighbouring Somalia. The Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said 14 civilians were confirmed dead. Al-Shabaab, which has said its mujahideen were responsible for the assault, has launched a series of terrorist operations in Kenya in recent years. In 2013, the al-Qaida affiliate took over a luxury mall in Nairobi, killing 67 people. The news of the warnings will embarrass authorities in Kenya, which is seen as a key local counter-terrorist player by the US, UK and other western powers. One Kenyan intelligence official said information passed on by security partners about planned attacks lacked detail but that the country had been on high alert since November. Another security source told Associated Press the extremists had confused security officials by changing target locations. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to reporters. Al-Shabaab has waged a decade-long insurgency to impose its rigorous version of Islamic law on Somalia and, though it has been forced out of major cities, controls much of the anarchic failed state\u2019s southern and central rural areas. In October 2017, an al-Shabaab truck bomb killed more than 500 people in the capital, Mogadishu. The group often attacks restaurants and hotels, using tactics similar to those employed in Nairobi. Experts said Wednesday\u2019s attack was designed to attract media attention. \u201cA terror attack is \u2026 purely media theatre. The number of casualties is not the primary objective. It is to attack a high-profile target, especially where westerners are going to be so the west is interested,\u201d said Hussein Sheikh-Ali, a former national security adviser in Somalia and chairman of the Hiraal Institute, a Mogadishu-based research centre. In the last year, al-Shabaab has been the target of an intense campaign of US airstrikes. These have inflicted significant casualties and killed several senior leaders. \u201cThis [recent] Nairobi attack is a response first and foremost to the airstrikes. They are sending a message that the US strikes have not degraded them as the US military and some media have claimed. They are saying \u2018we are in business\u2019,\u201d Ali said. A second factor may be to influence public opinion in Kenya. Kenyan forces are deployed in Somalia as part of multinational efforts to fight al-Shabaab. The Nairobi attack took place on the third anniversary of a huge assault on a Kenyan base in Somalia by militants in which as many as 180 Kenyan soldiers may have died. Rashid Abdi, a Nairobi-based expert on al-Shabaab with the NGO International Crisis Group, said the terror group\u2019s propaganda consistently highlighted the Kenyan presence in Somalia, but pointed out that international links meant there was a wider agenda driving the extremists too. \u201cIf the Kenyans withdrew it would remove a big reason why al-Shabaab like to strike Kenya but if you have a group like al-Shabaab which is part of a global jihad movement then they would still find another reason. They see Nairobi with its big western presence as a bastion of the west,\u201d Abdi said. Kenyan police have foiled several similar al-Shabaab attacks over recent years, though several investigations have shown corruption has allowed extremists to move with ease across the border with Somalia. The group has some networks in Kenya itself, mainly providing logistic support and recruits. However, attackers are often brought in from Somalia. Al-Shabaab has its own internal problems, suffering from a lack of funds and manpower that have forced it to impose unpopular taxes on local communities. The movement is riven by factional feuding and faces competition from Islamic State. Earlier this week, al-Shabaab media reported the group had executed an Isis commander in Somalia.",

In truth, she has little choice in the matter. There are plenty of Conservative MPs willing to vote against the government in whatever way necessary to secure a softer exit from the EU and, crucially, avoid a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<p>The issue is that it\u2019s hard to see what path to a Brexit deal May can now take which doesn\u2019t involve permanently fracturing the Tory party in two. In order to win bulk Labour votes, May could need to commit to a permanent customs union \u2013 an act that would dismay a bulk of Tory MPs.</p> \n<p>At cabinet this week, Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis warned the prime minister of the dangers of such a manoeuvre \u2013 making clear the party would not take well to the government cosying up with Labour. It\u2019s for this reason that the chance of an early general election has increased significantly.

Last night\u2019s historic, humiliating defeat is her just deserts.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, it is a mess that the rest of us will first have to stew in and then clean up.

      "bodyText": "Matthew d\u2019Ancona: The only escape hatch from this horror show is a fresh public vote The sound you heard immediately after MPs\u2019 gasps of astonishment at the scale of last night\u2019s Commons defeat was a herd of unicorns being released from their paddock. Reality bit \u2013 and then fled the scene. According to the prime minister, some amicable discussions with senior parliamentarians, a bit of leeway from Brussels and a few tweaks to her EU deal will end the logjam. According to Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit is only a secondary issue, subordinate to the higher goal of securing a Labour government: once he is in Downing Street, everything will be fixed. The hardline Brexiteers say that a free trade agreement or a no-deal exit is the answer. Other factions call for the UK\u2019s continued membership of the customs union, or the single market, or both. They must know that none of these constitutional configurations will command a Commons majority \u2013 mustn\u2019t they? In principle at least, this evening\u2019s no-confidence motion is the final obstacle to a full debate about Brexit itself rather than the prime minister\u2019s personal merits (we know she\u2019s useless \u2013 but, odd as it may seem, that\u2019s not the most important issue facing the country today). The question is whether MPs have the courage and honesty to conduct this collective inquiry and to confront its inevitable conclusion: that there is no magical Brexit tree to be shaken, that the 2016 referendum was a colossal exercise in political mis-selling, and that there is no form of departure that also delivers the best features of EU membership. The only escape hatch from this horror show is a fresh public vote. But who dares lead our political tribe of unicorn-worshippers towards this inconvenient truth? \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: A general election could break the deadlock After suffering the worst Commons defeat by any British prime minister in modern history, Theresa May faces an agonising choice: tack to a softer Brexit and risk fracturing her party for good \u2013 or hold firm on her Brexit red lines and risk remain Tories turning on her in a confidence vote. The prime minister has a few days at least to work out which is the least worst option. Although Jeremy Corbyn moved to table a no-confidence vote in the government after the deal was defeated by an eye-watering 230 votes, May ought to win this comfortably. The DUP, European Research Group and Tory remainers all say they are sticking with May while she plans her next move. Of that next move, May has told MPs she will move to seek consensus with figures from across the main parties on the best way forward. In truth, she has little choice in the matter. There are plenty of Conservative MPs willing to vote against the government in whatever way necessary to secure a softer exit from the EU and, crucially, avoid a no-deal Brexit. The issue is that it\u2019s hard to see what path to a Brexit deal May can now take which doesn\u2019t involve permanently fracturing the Tory party in two. In order to win bulk Labour votes, May could need to commit to a permanent customs union \u2013 an act that would dismay a bulk of Tory MPs. At cabinet this week, Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis warned the prime minister of the dangers of such a manoeuvre \u2013 making clear the party would not take well to the government cosying up with Labour. It\u2019s for this reason that the chance of an early general election has increased significantly. If May can\u2019t find a way forward for her party an election could be seen as the best way to break the deadlock. As one government aide put it last night: \u201cGet your holidays in now.\u201d \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor Aditya Chakrabortty: Labour must call for a second referendum Amid the breathlessness and hurly-burly of the next few days, remember one essential fact: this entire fiasco was dreamed, planned and executed by the Tories. David Cameron imposed the vote in order to quell backbenchers worried that Ukip would take their seats. Peacocking around international summits, he assured other leaders that remain had it in the bag. Theresa May summarily triggered article 50, and started the clock running with neither game plan nor allies. To placate Jacob Rees-Mogg and the other headbangers, she spent two years denouncing any attempt at a Brexit compromise as a betrayal \u2026 then the last six months trying to sell a compromise. Last night\u2019s historic, humiliating defeat is her just deserts. Nevertheless, it is a mess that the rest of us will first have to stew in and then clean up. Certainly, hardly anyone who voted leave in 2016 can be beaming into their cornflakes over the current chaos. Plunged deep into a political quagmire, the country could soon also enter a full-blown constitutional crisis from which we cannot find a way out. To avoid that, we need a complete change of mandate and plan. May\u2019s plan is dead and if the prime minister tries to enlist Jean-Claude Juncker or Donald Tusk to resuscitate it, she will get short shrift \u2013 as both men signalled last night. The trouble is, if any prime minister had the nimbleness to change course it is certainly not the Dancing Queen. Yet she is not inching towards any exit, and the men behind her jostling to take over appear quite happy for her to do their dirty work. Hence the hypocrisy you will see later today, where Tory and DUP MPs who last night stabbed their leader in the back will vote to show they have complete confidence in her. Westminster will never so closely resemble a swamp of crocodiles. Yet as long May keeps doing the job, nothing is workable. The obvious compromises, such as a Norway agreement, were effectively shut down by her in 2016 with her red line over freedom of movement. She will not call a general election or a second referendum.

The artist, Allison Adams, will present about 40 selected portraits of influential women through history in an exhibit opening 1 February. \u201cWhen I start saying to myself \u2018I can\u2019t do this single parenting thing, I can\u2019t make it as an artist, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t,\u2019 these women\u2019s stories helped me,\u201d said Adams. \u201cI wanted to educate people to that spirit, which is what we have access to as humans and as women.\u201d It all started in 2016, when Adams\u2019s husband died tragically after surviving a car crash. \u201cI was in a place where I felt the need to find inspiration,\u201d said Adams, \u201cso I started reading more about Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s life and I had this vision of sharing stories like hers to remind people we come from this legacy of amazing people we aren\u2019t taught about very much.\u201d She painted her first portrait of Roosevelt, who is remembered as the longest-serving first lady of the US and is recognized for drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. \u201cEleanor had a remarkable spirit of confidence and helping others,\u201d she said. \u201cIt lifted me out of my funk, I thought \u2018I\u2019m going to paint her, I want that voice in my life.\u2019\u201d Adams continued to paint portraits of women \u2013 all of whom had something in common: \u201cI started looking for stories of women who overcame things,\u201d she said. Painting the series was a cathartic process for Adams, who was grieving. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about it without getting personal,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in a pretty dark place after losing my husband, it was shortly after the election in 2016 and everything was falling apart for me.\u201d The series features a portrait of the Maryland abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was born into slavery and saved thousands of slaves by pioneering the Underground Railroad. \u201cI knew her from history class, but I never noticed the courage she had,\u201d said Adams. \u201cShe is a voice in my mind when I\u2019m feeling insecure, she overcame so much and didn\u2019t let anything stop her.\u201d She has also painted Ida B Wells, an African American civil rights pioneer and suffragist who helped establish early women\u2019s organizations, as well as Nancy Ward, an 18th-century Cherokee political leader and peace activist who defended her tribe\u2019s land. \u201cThese women, whether we know about them or not, all had to overcome something major; for me, that was life-changing and what I wanted to share,\u201d said Adams. \u201cA lot of them came from a hard place. I gathered strength from that.\u201d \u201cI feel like they want to have their stories told and I am lucky enough to share them,\u201d she adds. She has also painted portraits of American artist Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, a 20th-century pioneer of feminist art, as well as Lee Krasner, a painter who was the wife of Jackson Pollock, the alcoholic artist who had highly publicized love affairs with several women including Peggy Guggenheim. \u201cWhen her husband died, she protected his estate and sold his work to museums and got more money for his pieces than any other abstract expressionist,\u201d said Adams. \u201cShe did a lot for the art world.\u201d As New York City works towards getting more monuments to women up in a city that has just five statues of women in a city of 150 monuments, and with the ongoing sexual assault allegations as a result of the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, now is the appropriate time to host this exhibit. \u201cWomen\u2019s stories and justice are important now,\u201d said the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to make it during this time.\u201d When she paints them, Adams \u2013 a former actor \u2013 says she gets into their character, much like an actor would. \u201cThere is a sense of trying to get into their heads,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir spirits are not gone, we can live by their words.\u201d It\u2019s also a critical time to show these paintings given the eradication of certain women from some history classes. In the fall, the Texas board of education voted to remove former first lady Hillary Clinton and deaf-blind activist Helen Keller, both of whom ranked low for their historical significance, from the school curriculum. \u201cThat worries me,\u201d said Adams. \u201cI have a duty to share and protect these stories.\u201d As the mother of a young daughter, Adams is concerned for the next generation of young women, and future generations to come. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pushback of people trying to put women back in their place,\u201d she said. \u201cI am trying to keep these stories alive longer.\u201d",

He completed a doctorate on the economics of the slave trade and then returned to Trinidad with a mission. He gave fiery open-air lectures in public squares, formed his own political party, steered the nation to independence in 1962 and became its first prime minister.

      "bodyText": "As the sun dips below the horizon, young lovers make themselves more comfortable on benches overlooking the Sabarmati river. Walkers stroll along the concrete promenades, and mothers enjoy a moment of respite under newly planted saplings while their children play in the adjoining gardens. Few Ahmedabad residents could have imagined this scene a couple of decades ago. Back then the Gujarati city\u2019s tidal river banks were lined with slum housing \u2013 precariously constructed on land polluted by industrial effluent and untreated sewage, and home to some of the most marginalised communities in the city. Over the coming years this central location will transform yet further. Retaining walls have been built on both sides to narrow the river to stop it from flooding low-lying developments and eroding the riverbank, in a project likened to Joseph Bazalgette\u2019s embankments along the Thames in London, or those along the Seine in Paris and Hudson in New York. The newly created land will be home to shopping malls, luxury hotels, floating restaurants, museums and sprawling parks. \u201cThe worst part of the city, with flowing gutters and illegal constructions, has been converted into an iconic infrastructure project,\u201d says Vijay Nehra, the commissioner of Ahmedabad, whose municipal corporation has spent more than 15bn rupees (\u00a3170m) on the scheme. The riverfront redevelopment model is being copied by several other Indian cities, from New Delhi to Mumbai, but as Ahmedabad\u2019s population nears 10 million, not everyone is happy with the changes taking place \u2013 least of all the slum dwellers who have been relocated away from the city centre, the upstream farmers worried about their water supply and the environmentalists concerned the Sabarmati remains one of the country\u2019s 15 most polluted rivers. Before: the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad in the 1980s. After: the same spot today. A self-financing model The idea of a public riverfront was first proposed in the 1960s by the French architect Bernard Kohn, who was living in Ahmedabad at the time, as part of a vision for an ecological valley. Lack of funds meant it was shelved for the next 30 years. It was given new life in a different form in the mid-90s when the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) took charge of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. (The BJP\u2019s Narendra Modi, a local politician, is now India\u2019s prime minister.) Bimal Patel \u2013 son of the late Hasmukh Patel, an influential architect whose buildings dot the city\u2019s skyline \u2013 and his HCP Design and Project Management firm were hired to draw up a masterplan. Bimal Patel\u2019s proposal was on a much larger scale than its forerunners, but differed by proposing to sell 14% of the new 200 hectares of riverfront land to recover costs. \u201cMine was for the first time a self-financing model,\u201d says Patel, 57, \u201cwithout which the riverfront would never have seen the light of day.\u201d But before the first concrete could be poured, the tens of thousands of people who called the area home, many for three generations or more, had to be removed. The riverbed had become a dumping ground for the city\u2019s waste and the area was rampant with disease, while floods frequently led to deaths and the destruction of dwellings. The clothes washers and small-scale farmers were dependent on the river directly, while others such as domestic workers and ragpickers relied on its central location. Government surveys conducted before the construction began in 2005 identified 11,000 families who would be displaced \u2013 although activists believe the actual number was three times higher. The Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation spent some 11bn rupees (\u00a3124m) building new housing for those who would lose their homes, but Beena Jadhav, director of the Ahmedabad-based housing rights NGO Rahethan Adhikar Manch, says the process was mismanaged. \u201cNot a single family walked from their houses by the river to the ones given by the government without a phase of being homeless,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were many demolitions without an eviction notice.\u201d Even those who left voluntarily found themselves unable to get work in the new location.

      "body": "<p>Apparently one of our most pervasive fantasies when sitting next to a stranger on the bus or in a bar is not that they are having more sex than we are, but that they are doing more admin. In our deepest shame about our inability to pay a bill before it turns red or book a six-monthly dental hygienist appointment more than once a year, we assume that everyone else is performing at peak efficiency. So says Elizabeth Emens who is a professor of law at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/07/amal-clooney-columbia-university-new-york\" title=\"\">Columbia University in New York</a>, and has made a study of the way that \u201clife admin\u201d \u2013 best defined as \u201cthe office work of life\u201d \u2013 sucks the joy out of daily existence and leaves us feeling as if Something Terrible is about to happen and, worse still, that it is All Our Fault for failing to return a form on time.</p> <p>Before we can start to dissolve this toxic cloud, Emens argues, we must first acknowledge life admin for the major burden that it is. Indeed, she argues that we should think of it as a \u201cparallel shift\u201d, a whole extra job that we do alongside the one we get paid for.</p> <p>The problem with life admin is that we are expected to accomplish it without any of the resources that we take for granted at work. When our printer breaks down at the office we call a person from IT; when it happens at home we have to fish out the manual (good luck with that) and start banging the printer\u2019s drawers noisily in order to teach it a lesson. And then there\u2019s all that \u201csoft\u201d life admin, which is even less legible: fixing your ageing father\u2019s iPad (Dadmin); arranging a child\u2019s party (Kidmin); ordering a running buffet of hard-to-source hypoallergenic petfood (Catmin). Not until we recognise these tasks for what they are \u2013 a daily tax on our resources \u2013 can we start taking steps to reduce them.</p> <p>The first stage, Emens writes, is to work out which of four \u201cadmin personalities\u201d you fall into. Category one is the Super Doer, which describes the sort of people who can think of nothing nicer than a quiet night in with their filing cabinet. Admittedly it\u2019s a pretty small group: Emens reports stumbling across a website called \u201cI Love Filling in Forms\u201d, which has only seven followers.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the Reluctant Doer, which includes all those people who just about get their admin done, but feel huffy and a bit sick about it all the same.</p> <p>Next comes the Admin Avoider, the sort of person who stuffs credit card statements down the back of the sofa and feels horribly guilty about it all, not least because they know that a partner or a colleague will have to step in to pick up the slack.</p> <p>Finally, there is the Admin Denier, who honestly doesn\u2019t notice admin, still less do it. One can only assume that the admin denier lives in some kind of institution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f9f95590996dde7ff5df9df0822c7dd4e2417f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f9f95590996dde7ff5df9df0822c7dd4e2417f1/69_0_1075_1344/800.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth emens\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Privatised solutions to rich peoples\u2019 problems \u2026 Elizabeth Emens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the initial clarity that comes with wearing the admin sorting hat is somewhat undercut when Emens goes on to announce that \u201cmost of us are really hybrids\u201d. It\u2019s at this point that the whole admin personality exercise starts to feel like just another bit of life admin \u2013 an annoying imposition akin to paying a parking ticket that you have to endure in order to get back to the place from where you started.</p> <p>In contrast, Emens\u2019s solutions to reducing the admin mountain come with a certain dash and swagger. She suggests adding \u201cNNR\u201d \u2013 No Need to Reply \u2013 to the bottom of your emails. This seems sensible enough, a way of shortening an exchange that is in danger of becoming like a polite snake, with \u201cgreat\u201d, \u201cthank you\u201d, \u201cwill do\u201d pinging back and forth for longer than is strictly necessary. But then the professor explains bafflingly that she sometimes also appends a poem to her emails. This sounds so time-sucky for both parties that you begin to wonder if it isn\u2019t actually a cunning way of scything through the number of people who can be bothered to correspond with her.</p> <p>Emens\u2019s next solution turns out to be even more niche. She suggests setting up something called Admin Study Hall with your similarly admin avoider friends. The idea is that you all meet, either in person (but who books the room I\u2019d like to know?) or online (again, who juggles the electronic diaries?). Then you commit to spending the next 30 minutes or so tackling something truly unpleasant \u2013 tax stuff, researching a nursing home for ageing parents, writing a stern letter to your ex about the mortgage. There\u2019s something about knowing that you are staring into the admin abyss alongside other people doing exactly the same thing that is meant to be cheering.</p> <p>Honestly, it all sounds more trouble than it\u2019s worth. As does Emens\u2019s revelation that one of the benefits of converting to Judaism is that observing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jan/06/judaism-religion-finchley-synagogue\" title=\"\">Shabbat</a> means that she can take an email holiday every seven days. Where her book does start to move beyond the memoir-with-benefits genre and into something original and interesting is when she tackles the issue of admin \u201cacross the privilege divide\u201d. She is informed and eloquent on the way that poor people\u2019s admin differs from hers.</p> <p>People with means typically do admin that involves private entities, choice and influence over others. People without means mostly do admin that involves public entities, obligations and submission to authorities.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just that it is humiliating to have to jig around to other people\u2019s tune, it\u2019s that the penalties for non-compliance are so very severe. If you\u2019re on means-tested benefits and you avoid opening an official letter for just a week then you could end up missing a deadline that leads to losing your home. If you\u2019re rich then stuffing a bossy looking communication to the back of the desk drawer might result merely in your kids failing to get into the school of your choice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/04/josh-cohen-psychology-slacker-work-burnout\">Back to work blues? What we can learn from slackers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This mapping out of the \u201cbureaucracy of poverty\u201d is important stuff, so it\u2019s a shame that Emens fails to follow through with some sustained suggestions about what might be done to bridge the admin privilege divide. There is talk of the system in Sweden, where each citizen has one number to use for everything from the bank to the doctor. Or Chile where, surprisingly, they have a really slim system whereby the government sends you a draft of your tax return and, assuming you agree with their calculations, you simply sign it and send it back. These, though, sound like solutions for the time-poor rather than the poor-poor.</p> <p>Indeed, most of Emens\u2019s suggestions involve privatised solutions to rich people\u2019s problems. One idea is for harassed friends to give each other admin coupons as presents along the lines of \u201cfor your birthday I will research and shortlist bathroom towels that best match your new colour scheme\u201d, or \u201cfor our upcoming wedding anniversary I will delve into the bottom drawer of what you optimistically refer to as your filing cabinet\u201d.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have any friends, or at least any friends daft enough to play along, then you could employ an admin coach to phone you up at regular intervals to nag about your forthcoming VAT return. If this sounds even more unlikely, then Emens suggests finding a romantic partner who loves nothing more than getting on your case about the mountain of unopened snail mail piling up on your desk. Apparently \u2013 and Emens has an academic study on hand to prove it \u2013 people who are good at admin are also good in bed.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The Art of Life Admin: How to Do Less, Do It Better, and Live More is published by Viking.

So says Elizabeth Emens who is a professor of law at Columbia University in New York, and has made a study of the way that \u201clife admin\u201d \u2013 best defined as \u201cthe office work of life\u201d \u2013 sucks the joy out of daily existence and leaves us feeling as if Something Terrible is about to happen and, worse still, that it is All Our Fault for failing to return a form on time. Before we can start to dissolve this toxic cloud, Emens argues, we must first acknowledge life admin for the major burden that it is. Indeed, she argues that we should think of it as a \u201cparallel shift\u201d, a whole extra job that we do alongside the one we get paid for. The problem with life admin is that we are expected to accomplish it without any of the resources that we take for granted at work. When our printer breaks down at the office we call a person from IT; when it happens at home we have to fish out the manual (good luck with that) and start banging the printer\u2019s drawers noisily in order to teach it a lesson. And then there\u2019s all that \u201csoft\u201d life admin, which is even less legible: fixing your ageing father\u2019s iPad (Dadmin); arranging a child\u2019s party (Kidmin); ordering a running buffet of hard-to-source hypoallergenic petfood (Catmin). Not until we recognise these tasks for what they are \u2013 a daily tax on our resources \u2013 can we start taking steps to reduce them. The first stage, Emens writes, is to work out which of four \u201cadmin personalities\u201d you fall into. Category one is the Super Doer, which describes the sort of people who can think of nothing nicer than a quiet night in with their filing cabinet. Admittedly it\u2019s a pretty small group: Emens reports stumbling across a website called \u201cI Love Filling in Forms\u201d, which has only seven followers. Then there\u2019s the Reluctant Doer, which includes all those people who just about get their admin done, but feel huffy and a bit sick about it all the same. Next comes the Admin Avoider, the sort of person who stuffs credit card statements down the back of the sofa and feels horribly guilty about it all, not least because they know that a partner or a colleague will have to step in to pick up the slack. Finally, there is the Admin Denier, who honestly doesn\u2019t notice admin, still less do it. One can only assume that the admin denier lives in some kind of institution. However, the initial clarity that comes with wearing the admin sorting hat is somewhat undercut when Emens goes on to announce that \u201cmost of us are really hybrids\u201d. It\u2019s at this point that the whole admin personality exercise starts to feel like just another bit of life admin \u2013 an annoying imposition akin to paying a parking ticket that you have to endure in order to get back to the place from where you started. In contrast, Emens\u2019s solutions to reducing the admin mountain come with a certain dash and swagger. She suggests adding \u201cNNR\u201d \u2013 No Need to Reply \u2013 to the bottom of your emails. This seems sensible enough, a way of shortening an exchange that is in danger of becoming like a polite snake, with \u201cgreat\u201d, \u201cthank you\u201d, \u201cwill do\u201d pinging back and forth for longer than is strictly necessary. But then the professor explains bafflingly that she sometimes also appends a poem to her emails. This sounds so time-sucky for both parties that you begin to wonder if it isn\u2019t actually a cunning way of scything through the number of people who can be bothered to correspond with her. Emens\u2019s next solution turns out to be even more niche. She suggests setting up something called Admin Study Hall with your similarly admin avoider friends. The idea is that you all meet, either in person (but who books the room I\u2019d like to know?) or online (again, who juggles the electronic diaries?). Then you commit to spending the next 30 minutes or so tackling something truly unpleasant \u2013 tax stuff, researching a nursing home for ageing parents, writing a stern letter to your ex about the mortgage. There\u2019s something about knowing that you are staring into the admin abyss alongside other people doing exactly the same thing that is meant to be cheering. Honestly, it all sounds more trouble than it\u2019s worth. As does Emens\u2019s revelation that one of the benefits of converting to Judaism is that observing Shabbat means that she can take an email holiday every seven days. Where her book does start to move beyond the memoir-with-benefits genre and into something original and interesting is when she tackles the issue of admin \u201cacross the privilege divide\u201d. She is informed and eloquent on the way that poor people\u2019s admin differs from hers. People with means typically do admin that involves private entities, choice and influence over others. People without means mostly do admin that involves public entities, obligations and submission to authorities. It\u2019s not just that it is humiliating to have to jig around to other people\u2019s tune, it\u2019s that the penalties for non-compliance are so very severe. If you\u2019re on means-tested benefits and you avoid opening an official letter for just a week then you could end up missing a deadline that leads to losing your home. If you\u2019re rich then stuffing a bossy looking communication to the back of the desk drawer might result merely in your kids failing to get into the school of your choice. This mapping out of the \u201cbureaucracy of poverty\u201d is important stuff, so it\u2019s a shame that Emens fails to follow through with some sustained suggestions about what might be done to bridge the admin privilege divide. There is talk of the system in Sweden, where each citizen has one number to use for everything from the bank to the doctor. Or Chile where, surprisingly, they have a really slim system whereby the government sends you a draft of your tax return and, assuming you agree with their calculations, you simply sign it and send it back. These, though, sound like solutions for the time-poor rather than the poor-poor. Indeed, most of Emens\u2019s suggestions involve privatised solutions to rich people\u2019s problems. One idea is for harassed friends to give each other admin coupons as presents along the lines of \u201cfor your birthday I will research and shortlist bathroom towels that best match your new colour scheme\u201d, or \u201cfor our upcoming wedding anniversary I will delve into the bottom drawer of what you optimistically refer to as your filing cabinet\u201d. If you don\u2019t have any friends, or at least any friends daft enough to play along, then you could employ an admin coach to phone you up at regular intervals to nag about your forthcoming VAT return. If this sounds even more unlikely, then Emens suggests finding a romantic partner who loves nothing more than getting on your case about the mountain of unopened snail mail piling up on your desk. Apparently \u2013 and Emens has an academic study on hand to prove it \u2013 people who are good at admin are also good in bed. \u2022 The Art of Life Admin: How to Do Less, Do It Better, and Live More is published by Viking.

On a day of extraordinary drama at Westminster, the House of Commons delivered a devastating verdict on the prime minister\u2019s deal, voting against it by 432 to 202. The scale of defeat, by a majority of 230, was greater than any seen in the past century, with ardent Brexiters such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson walking through a packed division lobby cheek-by-jowl alongside passionate remainers. As noisy protesters from both sides of the Brexit divide massed outside in Parliament Square, the prime minister immediately rose to accept the verdict of MPs \u2013 saying she would welcome a vote of no confidence in the government. \u201cThe house has spoken and the government will listen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is clear that the house does not support this deal, but tonight\u2019s vote tells us nothing about what it does support.\u201d In a raucous Commons, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed he had tabled a formal motion of confidence in the government, backed by other opposition leaders, which MPs would vote on on Wednesday. Corbyn told MPs: \u201cThis is a catastrophic defeat. The house has delivered its verdict on her deal. Delay and denial has reached the end of the line.\u201d The Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG) and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) later announced that they would support the prime minister, making it unlikely Labour could succeed in triggering a general election. May said that if she survived the vote on Wednesday, she would hold meetings with senior parliamentarians from all parties to \u201cidentify what would be required to secure the backing of the house\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman later said May would be contacting Conservative and DUP MPs among others , but declined to say whether or not she would meet with Corbyn or the SNP leader, Ian Blackford. He cited the example of May\u2019s meetings with Labour MPs such as Caroline Flint and Gareth Snell about an amendment on workers\u2019 rights, although both of those MPs eventually voted against the government. \u201cWe will approach it in a constructive spirit,\u201d the spokesman said. May had no plans to head to Brussels immediately, No 10 said, implying that the prime minister first needed to test what would be acceptable to MPs. Downing Street said May would approach the talks wanting to find a solution to deliver a Brexit deal that would honour the result of the referendum \u2013 suggesting she would not countenance talks with those pushing for a second referendum, or even a full customs union, which Labour has backed.

On Tuesday night Johnson was joined by other prominent Brexiter MPs, including John Redwood and Bill Cash, at a champagne celebration party at Rees-Mogg\u2019s house. Hammond moved quickly after the vote to quell business anger over the failure of May to get her deal ratified. The chancellor expressed his \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the result in a conference call at 9pm with main business groups, including the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce, as well as dozens of chief executives. One source on the call said it was constructive and that Hammond\u2019s tone was \u201crealistic\u201d about the damage prolonged uncertainty around Brexit was inflicting on the economy. However, Hammond was hammered by business leaders over parliament\u2019s refusal to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. \u201cThis was the single biggest question he was asked,\u201d said the source. May said any plan that emerged from the talks would have to be \u201cnegotiable\u201d with the EU27. She earlier rejected an amendment from the Tory backbencher Edward Leigh calling for the Irish backstop to be temporary, saying it was not compatible with the UK\u2019s legal obligations. In Brussels, Donald Tusk, the European council president, appeared to back a second referendum soon after the crushing result for the prime minister was announced, and urged her to offer a way forward. May was expected to return to Brussels within days to consult with Tusk and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Officials said the EU was now in listening mode. In a statement, Juncker urged the British government to \u201cclarify its intentions as soon as possible\u201d, and warned that \u201ctime is almost up\u201d. \u201cI take note with regret the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening\u201d, he said. \u201cOn the EU side, the process of ratification of the withdrawal agreement continues\u201d. In a defence of Brussels\u2019 role in the negotiations, Juncker said that the EU and the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had shown \u201ccreativity and flexibility throughout\u201d and \u201cdemonstrated goodwill again by offering additional clarifications and reassurances\u201d in recent days. He said: \u201cThe risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening\u2019s vote. While we do not want this to happen, the European commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared.\u201d May, in Westminster earlier knowing that she faced a heavy defeat, made a heartfelt plea to MPs to support her, calling it \u201cthe most significant vote that any of us will ever be part of in our political careers\u201d. \u201cTogether we can show the people we serve that their voices have been heard, that their trust was not misplaced,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, as one Conservative backbencher after another stood up to attack her painstakingly negotiated withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons, it became clear that few had changed their mind. May had embarked on a last-ditch charm offensive on Tuesday, holding meetings with MPs including the ERG\u2019s Steve Baker, who said the pair had held a \u201cconstructive and substantial conversation about the future\u201d. Corbyn, speaking just before the vote , saidMay had \u201ctreated Brexit as a matter for the Conservative party, rather than the good of the whole country\u201d. He called the government\u2019s efforts to steer Brexit through parliament \u201cone of the most chaotic and extraordinary parliamentary processes\u201d he had experienced in 35 years as an MP. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, told his colleagues that if they did not accept the prime minister\u2019s deal, they risked condemning the UK to the chaos of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt would be the height of irresponsibility for any legislator to contemplate with equanimity such a situation,\u201d he said. Corbyn would come under intense pressure to throw his weight behind a second Brexit referendum if May wins on Wednesday; but his spokesman said Labour did not rule out tabling another no-confidence motion at a later stage. Labour MPs were joined by 118 Conservative rebels in voting down the prime minister\u2019s deal, including erstwhile loyalists such as the chair of the backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady. That was one more than the number who had backed a no-confidence vote in May\u2019s leadership of the Conservatives in December. Under party rules, the prime minister\u2019s victory in that vote means she cannot be challenged for party leadership again within the next 12 months.",

Not only were they the dominant footwear on both catwalk and high street, but you might not want to play basketball in them either.</p> <p>By contrast, you can do anything in a pair of sensible trainers. Shoes that are unremarkable but functional, one colour and washable. Not exactly pretty, but an inversion of ugly trainers. Alongside Allbirds, see also <a href=\"https://www.colehaan.com/zerogrand-perforated-trainer-ironstone-perf-nubuck-optic-white/W03206.html\" title=\"\">Cole Haan\u2019s Zerogrand trainer</a> (so comfortable you can sleep in them, one imagines) and <a href=\"https://www.camper.com/en_GB/women/shoes/pelotas/camper-pelotas_xlite-K200292-999-C022\" title=\"\">Camper\u2019s Pelotas</a>, an annual bestseller. Trainers themselves are going nowhere \u2013 in the past year or so, global sales of high heels dropped 12%, while sales of women\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/high-heels-are-on-the-out-thank-goodness-20190114-p50r9s.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed\" title=\"\">sneakers</a> rose 37% \u2013 but the sort of trainers we wear is shifting.</p> <p>Allbirds launched in 2016 with a single pair of lace-ups, designed for men and women, which came in soft merino wool. They now have six styles and a UK shop. According to Brown, they benefitted from the \u201ccasualisation of fashion, which just hadn\u2019t come to footwear\u201d. They describe their anti-style as \u201cthe right amount of nothing\u201d.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, they are most popular in Silicon Valley, where looking remarkable is frowned upon. Fans include Google\u2019s Larry Page and the former Twitter chief Dick Costolo. Speaking from his San Francisco headquarters, Brown is unclear why they\u2019re popular with tech types, but says that \u201cSan Francisco is struggling with its own identity, so maybe that\u2019s why?\u201d Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest disruptor, whistleblower Christopher Wylie, wears fashion\u2019s original ugly trainer \u2013 the Balenciaga Triple S in dove grey.</p> <p>Their popularity makes cultural sense, if nothing else. Designed to be worn 24 hours a day and, in the case of Allbirds, without socks, these are trainers for the hygge generation, for whom cosiness is a mindset. They are also, arguably, Kondo-pleasingly neat. While the sensible shoe is not quite an act of civil dissent, this sort of protest is still two fingers up to an industry that thinks it can control the narrative. Even if comfy shoes represent their own kind of ugliness.</p>",

Still, by the end of 2018, ugly trainers had reached critical mass. Low points included Jimmy Choo\u2019s Diamond trainers or the candy-pink Escada basketball sneakers. Not only were they the dominant footwear on both catwalk and high street, but you might not want to play basketball in them either. By contrast, you can do anything in a pair of sensible trainers. Shoes that are unremarkable but functional, one colour and washable. Not exactly pretty, but an inversion of ugly trainers. Alongside Allbirds, see also Cole Haan\u2019s Zerogrand trainer (so comfortable you can sleep in them, one imagines) and Camper\u2019s Pelotas, an annual bestseller. Trainers themselves are going nowhere \u2013 in the past year or so, global sales of high heels dropped 12%, while sales of women\u2019s sneakers rose 37% \u2013 but the sort of trainers we wear is shifting. Allbirds launched in 2016 with a single pair of lace-ups, designed for men and women, which came in soft merino wool. They now have six styles and a UK shop. According to Brown, they benefitted from the \u201ccasualisation of fashion, which just hadn\u2019t come to footwear\u201d. They describe their anti-style as \u201cthe right amount of nothing\u201d. Unsurprisingly, they are most popular in Silicon Valley, where looking remarkable is frowned upon. Fans include Google\u2019s Larry Page and the former Twitter chief Dick Costolo. Speaking from his San Francisco headquarters, Brown is unclear why they\u2019re popular with tech types, but says that \u201cSan Francisco is struggling with its own identity, so maybe that\u2019s why?\u201d Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest disruptor, whistleblower Christopher Wylie, wears fashion\u2019s original ugly trainer \u2013 the Balenciaga Triple S in dove grey. Their popularity makes cultural sense, if nothing else. Designed to be worn 24 hours a day and, in the case of Allbirds, without socks, these are trainers for the hygge generation, for whom cosiness is a mindset. They are also, arguably, Kondo-pleasingly neat. While the sensible shoe is not quite an act of civil dissent, this sort of protest is still two fingers up to an industry that thinks it can control the narrative. Even if comfy shoes represent their own kind of ugliness.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLand sparing\u201d could lead to dramatic increases in wild bird populations, according to research that bolsters the case for rewilding.</p> <p>Farming intensively to increase yields while turning over much larger areas of farmland to wildlife could \u2013 if combined with measures to cut food waste and meat consumption \u2013 would meet Britain\u2019s food needs and more than double the populations of breeding birds.</p> <p>It has been calculated that farmed land in Britain must increase by 28% if it is to supply the growing demand for food by 2050. Andrew Balmford, a professor of conservation science at the University of Cambridge, said this conundrum could not be solved by just reducing demand for food \u2013 yields must be raised too.</p> <p>Increasing yields is controversial among some conservationists who argue that intensive farming is unsustainable. Upland farmers also object because they fear land sparing will force them to give up farming and rewild their hillsides, while the fertile lowlands are intensively farmed.</p> <p>In research presented to a <a href=\"https://rewilding-uk.org/\">rewilding conference</a> organised by the Cambridge Conservation Forum, Balmford and a team of researchers studied food production and birdlife on the Cambridgeshire Fens to model how a far greater area of farmland could be devoted to wildlife.</p> <p>By halving food waste and meat consumption, the UK could farm less intensively \u2013 in a more wildlife-friendly way \u2013 on the current farmed area while retaining the 5% of land \u201cspared\u201d from farming and given over to nature reserves.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLand sparing\u201d could lead to dramatic increases in wild bird populations, according to research that bolsters the case for rewilding. Farming intensively to increase yields while turning over much larger areas of farmland to wildlife could \u2013 if combined with measures to cut food waste and meat consumption \u2013 would meet Britain\u2019s food needs and more than double the populations of breeding birds. It has been calculated that farmed land in Britain must increase by 28% if it is to supply the growing demand for food by 2050. Andrew Balmford, a professor of conservation science at the University of Cambridge, said this conundrum could not be solved by just reducing demand for food \u2013 yields must be raised too. Increasing yields is controversial among some conservationists who argue that intensive farming is unsustainable. Upland farmers also object because they fear land sparing will force them to give up farming and rewild their hillsides, while the fertile lowlands are intensively farmed. In research presented to a rewilding conference organised by the Cambridge Conservation Forum, Balmford and a team of researchers studied food production and birdlife on the Cambridgeshire Fens to model how a far greater area of farmland could be devoted to wildlife. By halving food waste and meat consumption, the UK could farm less intensively \u2013 in a more wildlife-friendly way \u2013 on the current farmed area while retaining the 5% of land \u201cspared\u201d from farming and given over to nature reserves. If this was done, the populations of 101 British bird species would on average increase by just under half. But if yields were increased on a quarter of farmland to the highest levels presently found on the Fens and, alongside demand-reduction measures,another 25% was farmed in a nature-friendly way, this could also meet future food demand. This would allow half the remaining land to be devoted to wild nature. By dramatically increasing spared land from 5% to 50%, bird populations soared on average by approximately 250%, with species such as bitterns and bearded tits prospering on rewilded fenland. The quarter of land cultivated by traditional, low-intensity farming was important for conservation too: this helped bolster farmland species such as the grey partridge and yellowhammer. \u201cWe\u2019re not arguing for business-as-usual industrial farming but we have to be mindful of yield,\u201d said Balmford. He said there was a risk that post-Brexit payments for farmers could improve Britain\u2019s landscape but reduce food production, leading to more food being imported from countries where the environment is being destroyed. He said: \u201cWe need a twin-track where we get serious about using some of our landscape in a way that\u2019s much better for biodiversity and ecosystem services but that must be linked to incentives enabling some farmers to be productive in sustainable ways on remaining farmland. If we don\u2019t, it\u2019s a sleight of hand \u2013 we\u2019ll just buy our food from somewhere else and offshore the problem.\u201d While organic farmers and most conservationists fear raising yields would lead to more environmental damage such as greenhouse gas emissions and increased nitrate pollution, recent research by Balmford and colleagues found that in four types of farming, including European dairy farming and wheat production, intensive systems were often less polluting per unit of production than organic and low-intensity agriculture.

      "bodyText": "An official audit has criticised the Australian government and the environment department for applying \u201cinsufficient scrutiny\u201d to numerous aspects of a controversial proposal to award $443.3m to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. In a report tabled on Wednesday, the Australian National Audit Office said the department was given just 11 business days by the government to find a private organisation to deliver the record grant, announced in April last year. The department decided the foundation was the \u201cobvious\u201d partner after just three days. The report also finds that the administration costs associated with the grant could be as high as $86.41m. The audit was begun last year after the grant was awarded to the small not-for-profit foundation without a tender process. While it finds all decisions associated with the grant were informed by departmental advice, it identifies \u201cshortcomings in aspects of the department\u2019s advice, partly as a result of non-compliance with elements of the grants administration framework\u201d. The report says the government directed the department on 6 March last year to find a private partner that would receive the funds in full in the 2017-18 financial year so as not to impact on the forward estimates. The department selected the foundation on 9 March and prepared draft advice for the government in seven days. The ANAO identified numerous failings in the department\u2019s approach including: \u2022 insufficient scrutiny of the \u201ccapacity and capability of the foundation\u2019s delivery partners to scale-up their activities\u201d, \u2022 insufficient scrutiny of the \u201cfoundation\u2019s past fundraising performance\u201d, despite the foundation\u2019s fundraising efforts being a factor in the decision to award it the grant, and \u2022 insufficient scrutiny of the \u201ctotal administration costs of the partnership model\u201d. The audit finds the department focused on the foundation\u2019s costs and did no evaluation of the likely administration costs for delivery partners that worked with the foundation. It says that, once these costs were factored in, the total administration costs associated with the grant could be $86.41m. In a letter of reply to the ANAO, the foundation said $26.3m would be \u201callocated to conventional administration costs\u201d and $17.9m to \u201cproject management\u201d. The report finds that the department did not properly consider the risks or potential conflicts of interest that could arise when it assisted the foundation to develop its grant proposal. It says the approach taken by the department failed to set clear targets for what the grant was to achieve, did not allow for a proper assessment of whether it was value for money and gave \u201cno consideration\u201d to the financial cost to the commonwealth of paying the full grant amount in one year. The report also states that \u201copportunities to introduce some competition into the grant-giving process were not explored and reasons for not employing a competitive, merit-based selection process to identify the partner were not documented\u201d. It makes six recommendations, including development of clear assessment criteria for grants being assessed without a competitive tender process, inclusion of performance targets in program guidelines for Reef Trust grants and a \u201cprobity framework\u201d to manage risks associated with helping potential grant recipients to prepare their proposals. Labor\u2019s environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said the findings were \u201cdamning\u201d. \u201cThis is a government that is reckless with other people\u2019s money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe simple message to Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg is: it\u2019s not your money, it\u2019s not your money to throw away to your corporate friends. \u201cThe reef belongs to all of us.\u201d Burke said that if Labor was elected it would stick to its plan to demand the remaining grant funds be returned. In a statement on Wednesday, the environment minister, Melissa Price, said the report \u201cconfirms that the establishment of the partnership with the Reef Foundation was based on comprehensive policy development and detailed advice\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Theresa May asks \u2018what this house supports\u2019 Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray, here to give you a confident notion of what\u2019s going on. Theresa May will face a vote of no confidence today after sustaining the heaviest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister in the democratic era, with MPs rejecting her Brexit deal by a resounding majority of 230. The prime minister is to begin urgent cross-party talks about a new approach but has not said what this might involve. Jeremy Corbyn will table his no-confidence motion in the government, due to be voted on this evening. The backing of both the DUP and Tory MPs means May is almost certain to win and, unable to secure a general election, Corbyn will face intense pressure to commit Labour to supporting a second referendum. The Tory MP Dominic Grieve will present two bills to the House seeking a people\u2019s vote. Our live coverage of another dramatic day is under way. So far the markets have been subdued and the pound is expected to remain volatile. Both Brexiters and pro-Europeans are treating the vote as a victory but there is no consensus about its impact. Campaigners for a second referendum are thrilled because they believe it is now more likely. But as May put it: \u201cIt is clear that the house does not support this deal, but tonight\u2019s vote tells us nothing about what it does support.\u201d In her statement to MPs after the result, May implied that she was leaning towards a Norway-style soft Brexit by saying she wanted \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with Labour MPs. But she also said any proposals must be \u201cgenuinely negotiable\u201d and she was committed to delivering on the result of the referendum. Her cabinet is deeply divided on the idea of a softer Brexit, and her party split between dealers and no-dealers. Our editorial argues the PM has no option but to reach across party lines. Jonathan Freedland laments \u201cthe sight of a parliament paralysed by indecision \u2026 and the spectacle of a country lost and adrift\u201d. After May\u2019s defeat, Donald Tusk, the European council president, effectively called for the UK to stay in the EU, saying that a departure deal looked \u201cimpossible\u201d.

Angus Macpherson, the Wiltshire police commissioner, said: \u201cHe will be given all the support he needs.\u201d &gt; The New Zealander charged with murdering British backpacker Grace Millane has pleaded not guilty.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Mitchell\u2019s match report from Melbourne Park: And with that, I\u2019ll take my leave. Federer was simply too good for Evans, despite a gutsy display from the Briton. The Swiss maestro moves into the third round, where he will play either Taylor Fritz or Gael Monfils. Bye for now. Federer speaks to Jim Courier on court: \u201cI couldn\u2019t pull away early in the match. If I was able to close that second set things would have gone smoother.\u201d He says playing the day session, with a bit of a breeze and with Evans playing well, meant the margins were slim. Asked about his Hopman Cup appearance earlier this Australian summer, against Serena Williams: \u201cYes it was fun. The city was talking about it, the country was talking about it. That was nice for tennis. It was also nice for me and Serena, Francis and Belinda. I was looking forward to it since the draw came out. She\u2019s a wonderful player.\u201d What a fight from Evans though. Dare I say, a typically British, dogged performance? Andy Murray would have been proud. Third set: Evans 3-6, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): There it is! Two excellent serves from Federer, followed by a textbook serve and volley puts the Swiss at match point. And he delivers with a backhand winner! Third set: Evans* 3-5, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): Evans is rolling over yet. He races to a 40-0 lead before sealing the game. Over to you Roger. Can you serve out the match? Let\u2019s find out. Third set: Evans 2-5, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): \u201cThink, think!\u201d a frustrated Evans shouts at himself after a loose backhand. Federer doesn\u2019t have to think too much about his serve, it\u2019s like clockwork for him now and he holds to edge closer to the third round. Third set: Evans* 2-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): Evans delivers probably his easiest service game now, and this time he doesn\u2019t blow it at 40-0 up as Federer returns into the net. He\u2019s still alive. But barely. Third set: Evans 1-4, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): An ace. A leaping backhand smash. A strong serve Evans can\u2019t return. A backhand winner. Great stuff. Game to Federer. Third set: Evans* 1-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): Federer breaks! Evans opens up a 40-o lead before Federer delivers a reminder just why he is one of the greatest tennis players of all time with a delightful drop shot from an angle that he shouldn\u2019t have even thought playing such a shot was possible. The Swiss uses that moment of magic as a springboard to come back to deuce, Evans making a poor shot decision at 40-30 to allow Federer back into the point. And from there he makes the first breakthrough of this match. You wouldn\u2019t bet on him allowing this one to go to a fourth set now. Would you? Third set: Evans 1-2, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): Likewise for Federer. You feel a couple of early exchanged service games will merely be building to some drama soon enough. Third set: Evans* 1-1, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): No real dramas here for Evans, who holds easily enough to get on the scoreboard this third set. Third set: Evans 0-1, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): Rain clouds loom large on the horizon as Federer picks up the ball to kick off the third set. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it. That\u2019s an easy hold for Federer, and a great way to start. Second set tie break: Evans 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (5-7) Federer: Federer aces and he\u2019s nearly there! A shanked service return later keeps Evans in it \u2013 for now \u2013 but Federer soon has three set points and he only needs one of them to secure the second set! At two sets to love to Federer, the scoreboard is unsurprising, but credit to Evans \u2013 he\u2019s pushed the third seed in both sets and this is far, far from a walkover. Second set tie break: Evans 6-6, 6-7 (5-7) Federer: Evans begins his fight back, taking the next two points before Federer opens up a two-point lead again. The players change ends with the Swiss 4-2 up. Second set tie break: Evans 6-6, 6-7 (5-7) Federer: Evans flunks a volley at the net on the first point before he returns Federer\u2019s first serve into the net. 3-0 swiftly follows and it\u2019s looking good for the former world No 1 at this point. Second set: Evans 6-6, 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): Cometh the hour, cometh the GOAT. Federer serves into a 40-0 lead and then forces Evans to fire one way out. Tie-break time. Second set: Evans* 6-5, 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): Oh my goodness, Evans was right earlier \u2013 he\u2019s doing a LOT of running out there. In particular at 15-15 when Federer has him chasing all over the court. Imperious from the Swiss, but those points are all a bit sporadic at the moment. Evans holds after winning this third game on the bounce. And now the pressure is on the No 3 seed. Second set: Evans 5-5, 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): Evans is wild on the first return of serve but he allows himself a clenched fist and internal \u201cc\u2019,mon\u201d as he gets his nose in front at 30-15. Federer then double faults and you\u2019d never believe it, it\u2019s break point! Two of them! Federer saves the first one but Evans monsters a backhand on the second and he breaks back to keep alive his chances of winning the second set! Tremendous effort from the Brit! He\u2019s pumped now. Second set: Evans* 4-5, 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): A huge hold for Evans, who saves two set points! It begins with a sensational backhand volley from Federer \u2013 an incredible stretch sees him not only reach the ball but get it back over the net and in. As a bonus it puts him two points from the second set. Evans pulls back to 30-30 but the Brit can\u2019t get near a backhand on the next point and the Swiss has the first set point. Evans punches a backhand down the line to save it, but Federer responds with a massive forehand winner to bring up a second chance to take the set. Evans again gets out of jail, this time with a forehand winner of his own before he goes on to hold. Phew. But he now has to face Federer\u2019s serve. Second set: Evans 3-5, 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): At 30-0 Federer aces but Evans fights back to deuce and forces the Swiss to regather. He does so, aces, and then closes it out with a forehand winner. Evans will now serve to stay in the second set. Second set: Evans* 3-4, 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): No bother for Evans in this one. But we\u2019re approaching do or die time this second set and Evans needs to make his move on Federer\u2019s serve sharpish, or he\u2019ll be chasing the Swiss\u2019 coattails before long. Second set: Evans 2-4, 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): Federer is forced to wait for some fans to take their seats at the beginning of this game. He doesn\u2019t let the delay distract him though and, one shot that lands long at the baseline apart, he\u2019s pretty much perfect. Second set: Evans* 2-3, 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): Evans is holding his own here and opens up a bit this game. He wins it to 30, but it looks like he\u2019ll still have to find a way to break Federer if he\u2019s to stay in this set. That has so far proved elusive for the Brit. Second set: Evans 1-3, 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): Over an hour and 20 minutes on the board and Federer finds it difficult to put this game to bed as a decent return of serve from Evans midway through and then a wayward overhead from Federer brings up deuce. A successful challenge by Evans keeps it at deuce before he brings up his first break point chance of the match. But he can\u2019t capitalise on a superb point involving numerous net cords before Federer dispatches the ball at the net. A nice verbal exchange ensues \u2013 Evans, with a smile on his face, says he\u2019s the one doing all the running \u2013 before Federer does eventually hold. A big one, that. Second set: Evans* 1-2, 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): Evans steadies himself though and this is a much better service game from him. \u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon\u201d is his cry as he serves out to love. Just what he needed at that point of the match, you\u2019d think. Second set: Evans 0-2, 6-7 (5-7) Federer* (*denotes server): With that first set in the bag, Federer is now playing a lot more freely. For example, an outrageously spinning drop shot that nearly bounces back into the net here seals his service game. You fear for Evans now. Second set: Evans* 0-1, 6-7 (5-7) Federer (*denotes server): A few first set stats to start off with: Federer had 22 winners to Evans\u2019 12, but the Swiss had eight unforced errors to Evans\u2019 three. To the second set! Evans serves, Federer lashes a backhand back past him, Evans makes two unforced errors, Federer breaks! That was all a bit too easy for the Swiss. A great start and just what Evans fans would have been fearing so early in the second set. First set tie break: Evans 6-7 (5-7) Federer: Evans\u2019 radar fails him at a crucial point to bring up set point for Federer and the Swiss makes no mistake, as he sends Evans chasing the ball all over the court before sealing the first set! A fine effort from the Brit though \u2013 he pushed Federer all the way there. You just feel it\u2019s going to be difficult for Evans to come back from a set down now though. First set tie break: Evans 6-6 Federer: And Evans takes a 5-3 lead with a sumptuous crosscourt forehand winner! Federer\u2019s on the ropes here, but he keeps his cool to force Evans into a mistake at the net \u2013 twice \u2013 to level at 5-5. First set tie break: Evans 6-6 Federer: Well, well, well. Federer finds the net, at the net, as the fifth straight point goes against serve and Evans opens up a 3-2 lead. A sixth mini-break follows as Federer levels things up before Evans, finally, manages to hold. The Brit leads 4-3... First set tie break: Evans 6-6 Federer: In the breaker, Evans kicks things off with a great forehand winner to win a mini-break, only for Federer to hit straight back with two mini-breaks of his own, the second sealed with a monster smash. First set: Evans* 6-6 Federer (*denotes server): Oohs and aahs from the crowd as Federer challenges a call but, as is often the case with Federer challenges, it\u2019s a bad one. Evans reaches game point but Federer gets back to deuce with a move to the net. Will we see a first break point chance of the match? Not yet. But we do a couple of points later when Evans challenges a point at the baseline and is proved wrong. Federer can\u2019t capitalise though and Evans brings up game point with a superb effort, eventually smashing past Federer, who had done well to keep the point alive. A strong serve later and we\u2019re heading to a tie breaker! First set: Evans 5-6 Federer* (*denotes server): A lovely volley at the net from Federer kicks off this game and there\u2019s no looking back from there on in. Evans stretches to reach a ball at the baseline on game point, but his return in long and Federer holds again \u2013 and heaps the pressure on Evans once more. To be fair though, he\u2019s handled it well so far today. First set: Evans* 5-5 Federer (*denotes server): The pressure ramps up on Evans, who falls to 15-30. But the Brit shows his mettle, levelling at 30-30 before forcing Federer into an off-target backhand to bring up game point. Federer\u2019s long again and Evans holds. That\u2019s his best hold so far today. First set: Evans 4-5 Federer* (*denotes server): The players return to the court after that briefest of rain delays, and he quickly secures the game. Evans will now have to hold serve to stay in the first set. First set: Evans 4-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Oof! What a backhand by Federer, who fools Evans with a sliced backhand up the line on his way to a opening up a 40-15 lead. Then the rain (RAIN!) begins to fall on Rod Laver Arena. The chair umpire asks the players for their thoughts; they head off and sit down although there\u2019s still some discussion as to how heavy it is and whether the roof needs to be closed. First set: Evans* 4-4 Federer (*denotes server): Federer opens up his body and flashes a forehand winner to win the first point of Evans\u2019 next service game but he then marks his card by finding the net on a regulation shot. Evans makes it to 40-15, but then tries a drop shot during a lengthy-ish rally. Mate, not against Roger. Federer gets to it and punishes the Brit. Evans regrets another poor decision to move to the net but he manages to compose himself at deuce and goes on to hold. Still on serve in this first set. First set: Evans 3-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Much better from Federer this game. A lot more solid hitting from the Swiss as he edges ahead once more, for the loss of just one point. First set: Evans* 3-3 Federer (*denotes server): Have to say I\u2019m a fan of Evans\u2019 outfit. A bit like a short-sleeved dentist\u2019s smock. But in a good way. He holds serve once again as Federer again shanks a shot off the frame of his racket on game point. We\u2019re yet to see the No 3 seed in full flow today. First set: Evans 2-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer wastes no time in game No 5, sealing the deal as Evans can only find the net after being forced slightly wide before playing a backhand return. An email! \u201cMike I\u2019m in Ncal and my power is out no WiFi you are my link to Raja tonite,\u201d writes Steven Montez. Thoughts and prayers Steven. First set: Evans* 2-2 Federer (*denotes server): Another good opening service point from Evans, who draw Federer out wide before moving to the net and finishing with a delicate smash (if that\u2019s possible). He finds the net cord on the next point \u2013 and is unlucky on which side of the court the ball falls on. A point later Federer unleashes his trademark backhand, such a beautiful sight, but he\u2019s not quite so accurate with a couple of forehands afterwards, and Evans stays in touch at two games apiece. First set: Evans 1-2 Federer* (*denotes server): Hello, hello, what\u2019s this then? A ball finds the frame of Federer\u2019s racket and he finds himself 30-0 down on his own serve. Time to panic? Of course not. This is Roger. His first ace of the game, down the T, gets him back into business before he closes out with another strong serve that Evans cannot return. First set: Evans* 1-1 Federer (*denotes server): Evans, in all white, opens with an ace. Nice one Dan. Federer\u2019s off target with a regulation backhand and then the Swiss can\u2019t control a service return. A second ace seals the game in style. Evans not overawed in the slightest and that\u2019s a superb start by the British qualifier. First set: Evans 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): OK, here we go. The Swiss maestro, looking cool in a crisp white shirt, blue shorts and matching headband, serves first. A decisive move towards the net on the second point of the match sets the tone for the rest of the game, and Federer gets on the board without any trouble. Weather update: amid the heatwave engulfing the nation, it\u2019s much cooler in Melbourne today, currently overcast with a breeze in effect to help keep the players cool. Federer and Evans are out on court, a little later than the \u201cnot before 2pm\u201d time previously advertised. That slight delay was due to the preceding women\u2019s matches, in which fifth seed Sloane Stephens beat Timea Babos in straight sets first up and then Australia\u2019s Ash Barty won safely through to the third round! Barty, tipped to go deep at this year\u2019s tournament, was comfortable in beating China\u2019s Yafan Wang 6-2, 6-3 in just over an hour. On paper this one\u2019s not a contest. It is, after all, Roger Federer. The great Roger Federer, six-times winner at Melbourne Park, 20-times grand slam winner and widely-acknowledged GOAT. He\u2019s seeded three at this year\u2019s tournament and wasted little time in booking his place in this second round with a straight-sets win over Denis Istomin on the opening day of play. The unlucky soul facing him is Dan Evans of Britain, who won his first grand slam match since returning from a drugs ban earlier this week \u2013 in three sets against fellow qualifier Tatsuma Ito. He will have taken great heart from that victory, but... Federer. Anyway, Evans\u2019 job is to prove everyone (but mostly me) wrong this afternoon in Melbourne, when he takes to Rod Laver Arena. Stick with us, the players will be on court shortly.",

A security source in Nairobi said the operation to clear the complex was \u201cslow and cautious\u201d because of fears that attackers were wearing suicide belts. The assault on the dusitD2 compound in the Kenyan capital, which includes a luxury hotel, restaurants, a spa and several office buildings housing international companies, was the most high-profile by terrorists in the country for many years. The sounds of what appeared to be further exchanges of fire and a blast at the complex come after the the interior minister, Fred Matiang\u2019i, said security forces had secured all of the buildings affected. \u201cThe security teams have evacuated scores of Kenyans and [people of] other nationalities from the buildings,\u201d he said in a brief televised statement on Wednesday evening. \u201cWe are now in the final stages of mopping up the area and securing evidence and documenting the consequences of this unfortunate event.\u201d The attack was claimed by al-Shabaab, the militant Islamist organisation based in neighbouring Somalia, on its in-house radio network and online.

Remarkable answers were modestly given; most people there had three instruments minimum, plus voice; all were also songwriters and composers.

I had something of that shabby curate feeling in the Lakes that weekend. It didn\u2019t help that I was sleeping in a room that had once been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/samuel-taylor-coleridge\">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>\u2019s study; no pressure for a writer, then. But it also thrilled me to be around musicians to whom I\u2019d been listening for years, and to hear them responding to work of mine.</p> <p>For the Avengers had assembled to develop a project called Spell Songs \u2013 a folk-musical adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/02/the-lost-words-robert-macfarlane-jackie-morris-review\">The Lost Words, by me and the artist Jackie Morris</a>. The subtitle of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lost-words.html\">The Lost Words</a> is A Spell Book; it was our attempt to make what Jackie calls \u201ca beautiful protest\u201d against the depletion of the natural world that is under way quietly and hourly all around us. The \u201clost\u201d words of the book\u2019s title are 20 of the names for everyday nature that are slipping from daily speech and knowledge, to the extent that they were dropped from a widely read children\u2019s dictionary due to under-use. Those words form a crooked almost A-to-Z, from \u201cAcorn\u201d through to \u201cWren\u201d by way of \u201cBluebell\u201d, \u201cKingfisher\u201d, \u201cLark\u201d and \u201cOtter\u201d, among others.</p> <p>For each word, I wrote a summoning spell-poem to be spoken aloud by the reader, seeking to conjure these common names back into the mouth and the mind\u2019s eye. \u201cOtter enters water without falter \u2013 what a supple slider out of holt and into water\u201d, starts the Otter spell. \u201cThis shape-shifter\u2019s a sheer breath-taker, a sure heart-stopper, but you\u2019ll only ever spot a shadow-flutter, bubble-skein, and never (almost never) actual otter.\u201d Jackie, a magician of watercolour and pencil, painted first the creature or plant\u2019s absence, then its reappearance as an icon set glowingly on gold leaf, and lastly its full restoration to the habitat of which it is part.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd48dedf33e23ba24b14b8d99396cf16baaee05d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd48dedf33e23ba24b14b8d99396cf16baaee05d/484_905_5094_3056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hare and goldfinches.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hare and goldfinches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jackie Morris, 2017</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first I thought we were making The Lost Words <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/30/robert-macfarlane-lost-words-children-nature\">for children</a>, but early on Jackie told me (she brooks little dispute) that it was a book for people of all ages \u2013 and she has, as usual, been proved right. The wild life of The Lost Words continues to amaze us daily. Grassroots campaigns have so far raised money <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/10/the-lost-words-campaign-delivers-nature-spellbook-to-scottish-schools\">to place copies of the book in every primary and special school</a> in all of Scotland, half of England and a quarter of Wales. The book is used by charities and carers working with dementia sufferers, with refugees, with survivors of domestic abuse, with childhood cancer patients, and with people in terminal care. It has been adapted for dance, outdoor theatre, avant-garde classical music, and thousands of school projects. A copy is now in every hospice in the country, and the new Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore has four levels decorated floor to ceiling with Jackie\u2019s art \u2013 the book become a building. The Lost Words<em> </em>has also been spray-painted by graffiti artists all over a substation in woods near Cardiff; book-as-building in a rather different way.</p> <p>And as Spell Songs it is shifting shape again \u2013 into a folk music concert and album. Though I myself possess all the musical abilities of a deckchair, I love collaborating as a writer with musicians. I worked with the Australian Chamber Orchestra on the 2017 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/13/mountain-documentary-movie-willem-dafoe-robert-macfarlane-book\">Mountain</a>, and I am finishing a project called Upstream with the German composer <a href=\"https://www.hauschka-music.com/\">Hauschka</a>, tracing the course of a river against the flow of current, up to its source on a mountain\u2019s summit. A protest ballad called Heartwood that I wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/sheffield-council-pauses-tree-felling-scheme-after-criticism\">in defence of Sheffield\u2019s street trees</a> was recently set and sung by a community choir under an ancient Sheffield elm threatened with felling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d2227bfdbeb5b1c277d71c0646b762076ca77c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d2227bfdbeb5b1c277d71c0646b762076ca77c9/0_136_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lost and found \u2026 the musicians gather at the table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lost and found \u2026 the musicians gather at the table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elly Lucas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It makes sense to me that folk music might arise from The Lost Words. Jackie\u2019s art hums, flickers and buzzes with the movements and noises of nature. I wrote the spells above all to be sounded out. And the folk tradition\u2019s long double allegiance to landscape and protest aligns precisely with the book\u2019s own purposes. There\u2019s nothing nostalgic or \u201chey nonny nonny\u201d about the musicians involved in Spell Songs. Karine Polwart\u2019s 2016 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/16/karine-polwart-a-pocket-of-wind-resistance-review-stunning-re-created-stage-work-on-nature-and-human-pain\">A Pocket of Wind Resistance</a> is a genre-breaking, form-crossing, beautiful-furious minor masterpiece that exists also as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/12/wind-resistance-karine-polwart-review-poignant-paean-to-the-peatbogs-of-scotland\">dramatic performance</a> and a Faber &amp; Faber play text. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/29/catrin-finch-seckou-keita-soar-review-senegal-wales\">Catrin Finch and Seckou Keita</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnm8Aync5s\">Clarach</a>, played on the kora, evokes the flight pattern of a bird \u2013 the osprey \u2013 that migrates from central southern Africa to Britain and back.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The response is about more than a book \u2013it\u2019s about what Michael McCarthy chillingly calls \u2018the great thinning\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been troubled as well as heartened by the way our unassuming acorn of a book should have grown into such a wildwood. It is clear to me that the response is about far greater forces and feelings than just a book. We are living through an age of loss, for which we are only just starting to find a language of grief. Extinction and extirpation are under way at frightening speed in the landscapes on our doorsteps. What Michael McCarthy chillingly calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/nature-studies-our-generation-has-seen-a-great-thinning-that-we-can-t-quite-name-8426019.html\">the great thinning</a>\u201d is accelerating. Loss \u2013 of language, species, loved places \u2013 is the tune of the times.</p> <p>After we\u2019d finished that first planning session around the kitchen in Keswick, we sat round an open fire, and the musicians took out their instruments and began \u2013 surprisingly shyly \u2013 to play. It was a hell of a private concert; Kris Drever\u2019s storytelling Scapa Flow, Rachel Newton shimmering away on her harp, Julie Fowlis singing eerie selkie songs in Gaelic \u2026 I\u2019d crept out to the kitchen when the high notes of Beth Porter\u2019s cello began to curl through the house. They wrapped around my heart and drew me back to the room. I sat on the floor and listened to her sing a song called Room for Thre\u2019, about two parents and a baby afloat in a vessel on turbulent water, her voice soaring and swooping to weave a fragile song of fear for what might be lost, and a strong song of hope for what might be kept safe.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.thelostwords.org/live/\">Spell Songs Live is at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Suffolk</a>, 8 February; Birmingham Town Hall, 9 February; Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, 10 February; and Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 12 February.</p>",

Last September, I found myself sitting at a wooden dining table in the Lake District with multiple superheroes of British folk. Karine Polwart, Kris Drever, Julie Fowlis, Beth Porter, Rachel Newton, Kerry Andrew, Jim Molyneux \u2013 could they really all exist in the same room together? Or would their convergence in a confined space cause a small black hole to open somewhere near the Keswick Tesco? Karine, trying to find the beginnings of a shape for the performance we were planning, pulled out a notebook and asked people to say what they could play or do. Remarkable answers were modestly given; most people there had three instruments minimum, plus voice; all were also songwriters and composers. Rachel and Julie were bilingual in Gaelic and English; Karine and Kris sang in Scots. It came round to me. \u201cUm \u2026 grade-one recorder? Backing kazoo? Also, I once sat on my brother\u2019s oboe and broke it in half.\u201d WH Auden once compared being a poet in the company of scientists to being \u201ca shabby curate in a roomful of bishops\u201d. I had something of that shabby curate feeling in the Lakes that weekend. It didn\u2019t help that I was sleeping in a room that had once been Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s study; no pressure for a writer, then. But it also thrilled me to be around musicians to whom I\u2019d been listening for years, and to hear them responding to work of mine. For the Avengers had assembled to develop a project called Spell Songs \u2013 a folk-musical adaptation of The Lost Words, by me and the artist Jackie Morris. The subtitle of The Lost Words is A Spell Book; it was our attempt to make what Jackie calls \u201ca beautiful protest\u201d against the depletion of the natural world that is under way quietly and hourly all around us. The \u201clost\u201d words of the book\u2019s title are 20 of the names for everyday nature that are slipping from daily speech and knowledge, to the extent that they were dropped from a widely read children\u2019s dictionary due to under-use. Those words form a crooked almost A-to-Z, from \u201cAcorn\u201d through to \u201cWren\u201d by way of \u201cBluebell\u201d, \u201cKingfisher\u201d, \u201cLark\u201d and \u201cOtter\u201d, among others. For each word, I wrote a summoning spell-poem to be spoken aloud by the reader, seeking to conjure these common names back into the mouth and the mind\u2019s eye. \u201cOtter enters water without falter \u2013 what a supple slider out of holt and into water\u201d, starts the Otter spell. \u201cThis shape-shifter\u2019s a sheer breath-taker, a sure heart-stopper, but you\u2019ll only ever spot a shadow-flutter, bubble-skein, and never (almost never) actual otter.\u201d Jackie, a magician of watercolour and pencil, painted first the creature or plant\u2019s absence, then its reappearance as an icon set glowingly on gold leaf, and lastly its full restoration to the habitat of which it is part. At first I thought we were making The Lost Words for children, but early on Jackie told me (she brooks little dispute) that it was a book for people of all ages \u2013 and she has, as usual, been proved right. The wild life of The Lost Words continues to amaze us daily. Grassroots campaigns have so far raised money to place copies of the book in every primary and special school in all of Scotland, half of England and a quarter of Wales. The book is used by charities and carers working with dementia sufferers, with refugees, with survivors of domestic abuse, with childhood cancer patients, and with people in terminal care. It has been adapted for dance, outdoor theatre, avant-garde classical music, and thousands of school projects. A copy is now in every hospice in the country, and the new Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore has four levels decorated floor to ceiling with Jackie\u2019s art \u2013 the book become a building. The Lost Words has also been spray-painted by graffiti artists all over a substation in woods near Cardiff; book-as-building in a rather different way. And as Spell Songs it is shifting shape again \u2013 into a folk music concert and album. Though I myself possess all the musical abilities of a deckchair, I love collaborating as a writer with musicians. I worked with the Australian Chamber Orchestra on the 2017 film Mountain, and I am finishing a project called Upstream with the German composer Hauschka, tracing the course of a river against the flow of current, up to its source on a mountain\u2019s summit. A protest ballad called Heartwood that I wrote in defence of Sheffield\u2019s street trees was recently set and sung by a community choir under an ancient Sheffield elm threatened with felling. It makes sense to me that folk music might arise from The Lost Words. Jackie\u2019s art hums, flickers and buzzes with the movements and noises of nature. I wrote the spells above all to be sounded out. And the folk tradition\u2019s long double allegiance to landscape and protest aligns precisely with the book\u2019s own purposes. There\u2019s nothing nostalgic or \u201chey nonny nonny\u201d about the musicians involved in Spell Songs. Karine Polwart\u2019s 2016 album A Pocket of Wind Resistance is a genre-breaking, form-crossing, beautiful-furious minor masterpiece that exists also as a dramatic performance and a Faber &amp; Faber play text. Catrin Finch and Seckou Keita\u2019s Clarach, played on the kora, evokes the flight pattern of a bird \u2013 the osprey \u2013 that migrates from central southern Africa to Britain and back. I\u2019ve been troubled as well as heartened by the way our unassuming acorn of a book should have grown into such a wildwood. It is clear to me that the response is about far greater forces and feelings than just a book. We are living through an age of loss, for which we are only just starting to find a language of grief. Extinction and extirpation are under way at frightening speed in the landscapes on our doorsteps. What Michael McCarthy chillingly calls \u201cthe great thinning\u201d is accelerating. Loss \u2013 of language, species, loved places \u2013 is the tune of the times. After we\u2019d finished that first planning session around the kitchen in Keswick, we sat round an open fire, and the musicians took out their instruments and began \u2013 surprisingly shyly \u2013 to play. It was a hell of a private concert; Kris Drever\u2019s storytelling Scapa Flow, Rachel Newton shimmering away on her harp, Julie Fowlis singing eerie selkie songs in Gaelic \u2026 I\u2019d crept out to the kitchen when the high notes of Beth Porter\u2019s cello began to curl through the house. They wrapped around my heart and drew me back to the room. I sat on the floor and listened to her sing a song called Room for Thre\u2019, about two parents and a baby afloat in a vessel on turbulent water, her voice soaring and swooping to weave a fragile song of fear for what might be lost, and a strong song of hope for what might be kept safe. \u2022 Spell Songs Live is at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Suffolk, 8 February; Birmingham Town Hall, 9 February; Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, 10 February; and Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 12 February.",

All that remain in the elongated mask are two wide round eyes with dots for pupils, a pair of black nostrils and a mouth open in an oval scream. We\u2019ve all been there.</p> <p>The Scream was created by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893 but it has become a masterpiece \u2013 the masterpiece \u2013 for our time. There are comparably \u201ciconic\u201d works of art \u2013 the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers \u2013 but they exist in a world of art and beauty. The Scream is ugly and brutal and belongs in the here and now. It is a symbol we reach for as we might for a strong word, to express what we\u2019re feeling this minute.</p> <p>The cartoonist Peter Brookes called on it to sum up what so many were feeling when Donald J Trump was elected president of the United States. In Brookes\u2019s depiction of Trump\u2019s inauguration, every single person in the crowd has metamorphosed into the wraith-like figure from The Scream.

Chapman says the museum has not been surprised by the shrieks of excitement. \u201cWe have hit at a time of maximum anxiety that all of us feel incredibly strongly,\u201d he told me on the eve of the meaningful vote in the House of Commons on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal.</p> <p>It is also a time of sardonic laughter, and surely part of the resonance of The Scream in these strange times is its comic hyperbole. A huge part of the global population was transfixed in the silent pose of Munch\u2019s screamer on Trump\u2019s inauguration day \u2013 and we still are \u2013 but there is also a blackly comic release in recognising our plight in this late-Romantic image. In fact, many appropriations of The Scream by popular culture are a howl. A chain of self-consciously youthful and riotous pubs called It\u2019s A Scream used Munch\u2019s painting as an advert for booze and bad behaviour. An artist called Robert Fishbone found a new sideline when he created an inflatable version of The Scream that became a must-have novelty for art students and existentialists everywhere. And in Wes Craven\u2019s 1996 film Scream, which is at once a satire on slasher horror movies and a highly effective resurrection of the genre, the killer wears a white Halloween mask version of Munch\u2019s screaming face. It is both ridiculous and gruesome.</p> <p>These examples of The Scream\u2019s irresistible rise in the shattered modern mind originated in the 1990s, which seems to have been the decade that saw Munch\u2019s picture start its final ascent from a famous masterpiece of modern art to the most recognised, quoted and gazed-at icon of all. As a matter of fact, its triumph can be dated exactly. Today\u2019s cult of The Scream started 25 years ago, on 12 February 1994. That was when thieves stole the original 1893 painting from Norway\u2019s National Gallery. Detective Charles Hill, who was sent to Oslo from Scotland Yard\u2019s specialist art squad to help get it back, remembers that it was not a very impressive heist: \u201cIt was two men and a ladder.\u201d Detectives got in touch with the criminals and, astonishingly, convinced them that California\u2019s Getty Museum was prepared to buy this piece of toxic contraband.</p> <p>\u201cI appeared as the man from the Getty,\u201d says Hill. He negotiated with the crooks, refusing an offer to go somewhere unspecified with them, purportedly to see it, by dead of night, and ultimately helping to secure it just three months after it was stolen. Art crime may be ugly, but it is also popular recognition of a kind. You know you\u2019ve made it when the criminal community rates your works theft-worthy. Although the Mona Lisa was always renowned, its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and recovery two years later catapulted it from genteel totem to pop icon. The theft of The Scream had a similar electrifying effect. It even started a gangland fashion. In 2004, masked gunmen seized Munch\u2019s second painted version of The Scream, which dates from 1910, from the Munch Museum in Oslo. This time it took longer to get back, and suffered some nasty damage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fe5f9bb0ee616e87de4691f5a50d07aab1479b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fe5f9bb0ee616e87de4691f5a50d07aab1479b7/0_150_2912_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wes Craven\u2019s Scream 2, 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wes Craven\u2019s Scream 2, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimension Films/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1990s also saw The Scream mirror a wider cultural mood. The end of the brash yuppy era brought a new emotional openness. Munch\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle masterpiece suited another fin de si\u00e8cle a century after its creation. Contemporary artists were returning to his themes of inner darkness with installations that used thick black crude oil, preserved animal bodies or a cast of a house. One Young British Artist, Tracey Emin, was consciously inspired by Munch in her confessional work My Bed, which is a kind of scream expressed through full ashtrays and empty bottles. Emin is now working on a seven-metre nude statue in homage to Munch that has been commissioned for the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour, due to open next year.</p> <p>If The Scream spoke in a new key to the late 20th century, the anxieties of this century, which started on 11 September 2001, have made it seem the most contemporary of all masterpieces. Its translation into an emoji is truly significant. The Scream emoji makes explicit the striking fact that it is getting hard to say the word \u201cscream\u201d without seeing The Scream. This painting is becoming part of the language. The Scream has become part of a shift to reconnect idea and images, to express ourselves in the internet age by direct visual icons. It is not just a painting that makes a good emoji. It is the original emoji.</p> <p>To see the revolutionary nature of Munch\u2019s achievement, you only have to see how he first rendered into art the experience that The Scream records. In 1892, he painted Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. It shows a man leaning on the wooden railing of a bridge, looking out on to a darkling blot of a fjord beneath a yellow sky smeared with red clouds of apocalyptic fire. Two other figures parade the boardwalk, leaving him to his depressed thoughts. The railings and walkway rushing away in steep perspective to the left of the scene, the paranoia-inducing figures walking away, the curve of the fjord \u2013 this is unmistakably the landscape of The Scream. For both paintings depict a real experience, a transforming, unforgettable moment of revelation. Was it an artistic ecstasy, like the visions of Romantic poets including Blake and Coleridge, or an episode of mental illness? In 1908, Munch wrote it down. He tells of how he was walking with two friends near Kristiania \u2013 as Oslo was then called \u2013 when the sun went down over the fjord. At the time, he writes, \u201clife had ripped open my soul\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eaec7525b9cb96c0c7f4933161aed580035948e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaec7525b9cb96c0c7f4933161aed580035948e3/0_0_1500_2064/727.jpg\" alt=\"Munch\u2019s Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair.\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Munch\u2019s Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edvard Munch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in \u00c5dalsbruk in 1863, Munch grew up in Kristiania amid poverty, puritanism and illness. One of his first paintings, The Sick Child, is a memory of seeing his sister die. As a young artist, he had to struggle with frequent illnesses, rejection, alcoholism and a tempestuous relationship in which he got shot. He was also witness to a murderous love affair among his bohemian friends. So as he looked at the sunset that evening, the sky split open not just in clouds of red but a bloody, volcanic, atomic rupture in the fabric of reality itself: \u201cThen it seemed as if a flaming sword of blood slashed through the heavens\u2019 vault \u2013 The air became like blood \u2013 with piercing strands of fire \u2013 The fjord \u2013 glared in cold blue \u2013 yellow and red colours \u2013 bloody red screeched \u2013 on the road \u2013 and on the railing \u2013 My friends\u2019 faces turned glaring yellow-white \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>This is the moment he depicts in Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. In this painting, we see his anguish from the outside. The sky is gory, but it is in the closed mind of the man brooding with his face turned away from us that it feels like the end of the world. We see his despair, but it is not ours. We are like the audience watching Hamlet: involved yet outside his tragedy.</p> <p>The following year, Munch obliterated that gap between actor and audience, artwork and onlooker. In 1893, he created his first two versions of The Scream. The one that is in Oslo\u2019s National Gallery is done with tempera, that is, egg-based paints and crayon on cardboard. The other, in crayon alone, also on cardboard, belongs to the Munch Museum. In both of them, he simplifies his vision of the nightmare sunset into bands and nodules of colour, almost like the flow of woodgrain. More radically, he replaces his brooding man with a figure who has no identifiable sex and may even be a ghost or ghoul. Clad in a dark dress or tight robe, its face reduced to that caricature of dread beyond words, the screamer does not look at the mad sky but directly at us. It is us.</p> <p>By removing all individuality from this being, Munch allows anyone to inhabit it. He draws a glove puppet for the soul. Absurd and empty, it is filled by the scream its mouth shapes \u2013 and that scream, claimed Munch, comes from the landscape itself. He testified that he truly heard a scream pierce the sky and fjord as he gazed on the terrible fiery sunset: \u201cI felt a great scream \u2013 and I actually heard a great scream \u2013 The colours of nature broke up \u2013 the lines of nature \u2013 the lines and the colours \u2013 quivered in motion \u2013 These oscillations of light not only caused my eye to vibrate \u2013 they also brought my ear into vibration \u2013 so that I truly heard a scream \u2013 I then painted the picture Scream.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbc8969137094da7ba399776b74461cac899a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbc8969137094da7ba399776b74461cac899a9e4/0_0_2090_3500/597.jpg\" alt=\"The 1895 lithograph of The Scream.\" width=\"597\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1895 lithograph of The Scream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Norwegian it is \u201cskrik\u201d, whose jarring note sounds more like the English \u201cshriek\u201d than \u201cscream\u201d. The resemblance is no coincidence but clearly reflects the Viking infuence on our language. So Munch felt nature shriek. The imagery he uses is telling: as he watched, the light seemed to shake, the colours of nature to warp before or, rather, within his eyes. As his visual sense shook, it set off something in his ears. This is an instance of synesthesia, when experiences ramify through more than one of our senses. Munch was undergoing the kind of hallucinatory, multi-sensory, almost out-of-body adventure associated with visionary episodes from shamanism to psychedelia. It was part of a dangerous descent to the edge of madness that would eventually lead to him being hospitalised. And in The Scream, by creating a figure anyone can identify with, a pure embodiment of feeling, he lets us enter that same extreme state.</p> <p>The Scream is so much more than a receptacle for the anxiety we\u2019re feeling right now. It can rescue us. It offers a means of release from the grind and banality of politics, money and work. The true purpose of the greatest modern art is to reconnect us with demonic, ecstatic experiences that defy the boredom of modern industrial capitalism. Maybe Munch was possessed by the Vikings when he heard the world scream. For The Scream seems pagan and primitive in its shudder at the iciness of the empty north. It is a painting of Ragnar\u00f6k \u2013 the Norse apocalypse. Which makes it even more the masterpiece for our time. Play Led Zeppelin\u2019s Immigrant Song and stare at The Scream. You\u2019ll soon forget all about the things that make you want to \u2026 you know.</p> <p><em>Edvard Munch: Love and Angst is at the British Museum from 11 April to 21 July, <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/munch.aspx\" title=\"\">britishmuseum.org</a></em></p>",

A huge part of the global population was transfixed in the silent pose of Munch\u2019s screamer on Trump\u2019s inauguration day \u2013 and we still are \u2013 but there is also a blackly comic release in recognising our plight in this late-Romantic image. In fact, many appropriations of The Scream by popular culture are a howl. A chain of self-consciously youthful and riotous pubs called It\u2019s A Scream used Munch\u2019s painting as an advert for booze and bad behaviour. An artist called Robert Fishbone found a new sideline when he created an inflatable version of The Scream that became a must-have novelty for art students and existentialists everywhere. And in Wes Craven\u2019s 1996 film Scream, which is at once a satire on slasher horror movies and a highly effective resurrection of the genre, the killer wears a white Halloween mask version of Munch\u2019s screaming face. It is both ridiculous and gruesome. These examples of The Scream\u2019s irresistible rise in the shattered modern mind originated in the 1990s, which seems to have been the decade that saw Munch\u2019s picture start its final ascent from a famous masterpiece of modern art to the most recognised, quoted and gazed-at icon of all. As a matter of fact, its triumph can be dated exactly. Today\u2019s cult of The Scream started 25 years ago, on 12 February 1994. That was when thieves stole the original 1893 painting from Norway\u2019s National Gallery. Detective Charles Hill, who was sent to Oslo from Scotland Yard\u2019s specialist art squad to help get it back, remembers that it was not a very impressive heist: \u201cIt was two men and a ladder.\u201d Detectives got in touch with the criminals and, astonishingly, convinced them that California\u2019s Getty Museum was prepared to buy this piece of toxic contraband. \u201cI appeared as the man from the Getty,\u201d says Hill. He negotiated with the crooks, refusing an offer to go somewhere unspecified with them, purportedly to see it, by dead of night, and ultimately helping to secure it just three months after it was stolen. Art crime may be ugly, but it is also popular recognition of a kind. You know you\u2019ve made it when the criminal community rates your works theft-worthy. Although the Mona Lisa was always renowned, its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and recovery two years later catapulted it from genteel totem to pop icon. The theft of The Scream had a similar electrifying effect. It even started a gangland fashion. In 2004, masked gunmen seized Munch\u2019s second painted version of The Scream, which dates from 1910, from the Munch Museum in Oslo. This time it took longer to get back, and suffered some nasty damage. The 1990s also saw The Scream mirror a wider cultural mood. The end of the brash yuppy era brought a new emotional openness. Munch\u2019s fin-de-si\u00e8cle masterpiece suited another fin de si\u00e8cle a century after its creation. Contemporary artists were returning to his themes of inner darkness with installations that used thick black crude oil, preserved animal bodies or a cast of a house. One Young British Artist, Tracey Emin, was consciously inspired by Munch in her confessional work My Bed, which is a kind of scream expressed through full ashtrays and empty bottles. Emin is now working on a seven-metre nude statue in homage to Munch that has been commissioned for the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour, due to open next year. If The Scream spoke in a new key to the late 20th century, the anxieties of this century, which started on 11 September 2001, have made it seem the most contemporary of all masterpieces. Its translation into an emoji is truly significant. The Scream emoji makes explicit the striking fact that it is getting hard to say the word \u201cscream\u201d without seeing The Scream. This painting is becoming part of the language. The Scream has become part of a shift to reconnect idea and images, to express ourselves in the internet age by direct visual icons. It is not just a painting that makes a good emoji. It is the original emoji. To see the revolutionary nature of Munch\u2019s achievement, you only have to see how he first rendered into art the experience that The Scream records. In 1892, he painted Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. It shows a man leaning on the wooden railing of a bridge, looking out on to a darkling blot of a fjord beneath a yellow sky smeared with red clouds of apocalyptic fire. Two other figures parade the boardwalk, leaving him to his depressed thoughts. The railings and walkway rushing away in steep perspective to the left of the scene, the paranoia-inducing figures walking away, the curve of the fjord \u2013 this is unmistakably the landscape of The Scream. For both paintings depict a real experience, a transforming, unforgettable moment of revelation. Was it an artistic ecstasy, like the visions of Romantic poets including Blake and Coleridge, or an episode of mental illness? In 1908, Munch wrote it down. He tells of how he was walking with two friends near Kristiania \u2013 as Oslo was then called \u2013 when the sun went down over the fjord. At the time, he writes, \u201clife had ripped open my soul\u201d. Born in \u00c5dalsbruk in 1863, Munch grew up in Kristiania amid poverty, puritanism and illness. One of his first paintings, The Sick Child, is a memory of seeing his sister die. As a young artist, he had to struggle with frequent illnesses, rejection, alcoholism and a tempestuous relationship in which he got shot. He was also witness to a murderous love affair among his bohemian friends. So as he looked at the sunset that evening, the sky split open not just in clouds of red but a bloody, volcanic, atomic rupture in the fabric of reality itself: \u201cThen it seemed as if a flaming sword of blood slashed through the heavens\u2019 vault \u2013 The air became like blood \u2013 with piercing strands of fire \u2013 The fjord \u2013 glared in cold blue \u2013 yellow and red colours \u2013 bloody red screeched \u2013 on the road \u2013 and on the railing \u2013 My friends\u2019 faces turned glaring yellow-white \u2026 \u201d This is the moment he depicts in Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. In this painting, we see his anguish from the outside. The sky is gory, but it is in the closed mind of the man brooding with his face turned away from us that it feels like the end of the world. We see his despair, but it is not ours. We are like the audience watching Hamlet: involved yet outside his tragedy. The following year, Munch obliterated that gap between actor and audience, artwork and onlooker. In 1893, he created his first two versions of The Scream. The one that is in Oslo\u2019s National Gallery is done with tempera, that is, egg-based paints and crayon on cardboard. The other, in crayon alone, also on cardboard, belongs to the Munch Museum. In both of them, he simplifies his vision of the nightmare sunset into bands and nodules of colour, almost like the flow of woodgrain. More radically, he replaces his brooding man with a figure who has no identifiable sex and may even be a ghost or ghoul. Clad in a dark dress or tight robe, its face reduced to that caricature of dread beyond words, the screamer does not look at the mad sky but directly at us. It is us. By removing all individuality from this being, Munch allows anyone to inhabit it. He draws a glove puppet for the soul. Absurd and empty, it is filled by the scream its mouth shapes \u2013 and that scream, claimed Munch, comes from the landscape itself. He testified that he truly heard a scream pierce the sky and fjord as he gazed on the terrible fiery sunset: \u201cI felt a great scream \u2013 and I actually heard a great scream \u2013 The colours of nature broke up \u2013 the lines of nature \u2013 the lines and the colours \u2013 quivered in motion \u2013 These oscillations of light not only caused my eye to vibrate \u2013 they also brought my ear into vibration \u2013 so that I truly heard a scream \u2013 I then painted the picture Scream.\u201d In Norwegian it is \u201cskrik\u201d, whose jarring note sounds more like the English \u201cshriek\u201d than \u201cscream\u201d. The resemblance is no coincidence but clearly reflects the Viking infuence on our language. So Munch felt nature shriek. The imagery he uses is telling: as he watched, the light seemed to shake, the colours of nature to warp before or, rather, within his eyes. As his visual sense shook, it set off something in his ears. This is an instance of synesthesia, when experiences ramify through more than one of our senses. Munch was undergoing the kind of hallucinatory, multi-sensory, almost out-of-body adventure associated with visionary episodes from shamanism to psychedelia. It was part of a dangerous descent to the edge of madness that would eventually lead to him being hospitalised. And in The Scream, by creating a figure anyone can identify with, a pure embodiment of feeling, he lets us enter that same extreme state. The Scream is so much more than a receptacle for the anxiety we\u2019re feeling right now. It can rescue us. It offers a means of release from the grind and banality of politics, money and work. The true purpose of the greatest modern art is to reconnect us with demonic, ecstatic experiences that defy the boredom of modern industrial capitalism. Maybe Munch was possessed by the Vikings when he heard the world scream. For The Scream seems pagan and primitive in its shudder at the iciness of the empty north. It is a painting of Ragnar\u00f6k \u2013 the Norse apocalypse. Which makes it even more the masterpiece for our time. Play Led Zeppelin\u2019s Immigrant Song and stare at The Scream. You\u2019ll soon forget all about the things that make you want to \u2026 you know. Edvard Munch: Love and Angst is at the British Museum from 11 April to 21 July, britishmuseum.org",

He can fix broken limbs, amputate, remove tumours and replace organs. As a general surgeon he has had plenty of practice with a scalpel and stitches, both in Syria and while <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/06/615762704/your-children-are-safe-a-town-in-wales-welcomes-refugees-from-syria\" title=\"\">in a refugee camp in Italy</a>.</p> \n<p>In short, he\u2019d be a useful addition to a health service anywhere. Only, in his new adopted home of Cardiff, Allahham, 36, cannot practise. He has tried to regain his standing as a surgeon but prohibitively expensive language tests and requalification exams have prevented him.</p> \n<p>His story is one that is commonly retold in different forms among the refugee population: <a href=\"https://breaking-barriers.co.uk/the-cause/refugee-employment-crisis/#grid-gallery-3\" title=\"\">38% of the 10,000-plus Syrian refugees in the UK</a> have a university education, yet 70% of all refugees are unemployed and 20% have had to change their careers to take any available job.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The jobcentre didn\u2019t care that I am a doctor and can contribute to the country, I had to find any work</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Hussam Allahham</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Theresa May\u2019s government has pledged to resettle <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/syrian-vulnerable-person-resettlement-programme-fact-sheet\" title=\"\">20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020</a> \u2013 supposedly the largest single response to a humanitarian crisis by a British government. But a large section of this refugee population is being denied the ability to work to their full potential. Just as underemployment, the imbalance between skills and job roles, has reached <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ons-underemployment-double-unemployment-rate-2017-9?r=UK&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">double the rate of unemployment</a> for British citizens, the same issues are affecting Britain\u2019s refugees. And despite May\u2019s stated intention being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/uk-immigration-what-is-the-government-proposing\" title=\"\">to prioritise immigration for the highly skilled</a> after Brexit, here is an underutilised source of skilled people who are already in the country.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, a cluster of social enterprises have formed to help address these worrying statistics. With many based in London, and some even sharing the same co-working spaces, these startups help refugee talent move from unemployment or underemployment into meaningful work.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I first arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker, I wasn\u2019t allowed to work at all and it was very hard for me to accept benefits,\u201d Allahham says. These benefits of \u00a35 per day had to sustain Allahham for the four months it took for his application to be approved. \u201cI used to be a doctor, with a high standing in Syria,\u201d he continues, \u201cso it was humiliating to go to the jobcentre and ask for money. They didn\u2019t care that I am a doctor and can contribute to the country. I had to find any work.\u201d Allahham took their advice. \u201cEven cleaning was better than seeking benefits,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>After volunteering at a local community centre, Allahham secured a full-time role as a support worker for asylum seekers. With this stability, he could focus on passing the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam to requalify as a surgeon. Nine attempts and \u00a33,500 in exam fees later, Allahham still works at the community centre.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe main problem is that I had to work full-time while studying for the language test,\u201d he says, \u201cand the free classes, which it took over an hour to walk to each day, weren\u2019t going to help me to get the high scores I needed.\u201d This high score of <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/immigration/english-testing\" title=\"\">level 7.5 for medicine</a> \u2013 where an average native speaker would likely reach 5 \u2013 requires intensive coaching, with one term costing <a href=\"https://www.wimbledon-school.ac.uk/fees-and-dates.php\" title=\"\">upwards of \u00a33,000</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/23/the-syrian-refugee-aiming-to-become-an-olympic-swimmer\">The Syrian refugee aiming to become an Olympic swimmer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trapped in this cycle, Allahham found help through the charity <a href=\"https://refuaid.org/\" title=\"\">RefuAid</a>.

She says that means there are \u201cthousands of qualified refugees available who are misjudged and misused\u201d.</p> \n<p>With RefuAid\u2019s help, Allahham is now focusing on passing a new language test, the medically focused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/27/ielts-immigration\" title=\"\">Occupational English Test</a>, and once he does he will apply for a loan to take the \u00a32,500 exam to requalify as a surgeon. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road ahead, but I\u2019m sure I will work again as a doctor and help my community,\u201d he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4c121174-8ee7-4fee-a84b-64e7248de9ca\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>How many people apply for asylum?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2016, there were 30,747 applications for asylum in the UK. Of the applications decided in 2016, 34% were initially granted asylum or another protection visa.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the process?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Firstly, a short, screening interview is conducted with the applicant, to obtain basic details about the person and their claim.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Next, the person will have their main interview with the Home Office, which tries to deal with straightforward cases within six months, although some people wait for more than a year.</p>\n    <p>Finally, a caseworker will decide on the person's need for protection based on their interview, supporting documents, and the Home Office's country guidance about the applicant's country of origin.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the main interview like?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The asylum seeker will usually be interviewed at one of 12 regional casework units by a Home Office representative, with an interpreter present if needed.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>During the interview, the applicant will be asked why they are seeking asylum and about their journey to&nbsp; the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How important is the interview?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Incredibly so. The transcript, which is written by the Home Office representative during the interview, becomes the main record of the claim. People are often refused asylum on the basis that there were inconsistencies in their interview, or between their main and screening interviews, which the Home Office will say undermines the person's credibility. The transcript is also used heavily if the claim is refused and goes to appeal.</p>\n    <p>Miranda Butler, a barrister at 3 Hare Court Chambers in London, calls the interview a \"totemic piece of evidence. It\u2019s their chance to tell their story.

In 2016, 41% of appeals that were determined resulted in people being granted asylum.

The 31-year-old was forced to apply for asylum in 2013 after his student visa expired and the Syrian embassy in the UK shut down, leaving him and his young family stranded. It then took two years for Alhomsi\u2019s refugee status to be processed. \u201cDuring that time I broke down,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a strong man, but the way I was dealt with was undignified, like a criminal on probation. Me, my wife and my newborn baby had the bare minimum to survive on and we were scared that we would be deported. We lived an ongoing nightmare for two years.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although Alhomsi already had his language qualification from having studied in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.gdc-uk.org/professionals/ore\" title=\"\">the \u00a34,000 cost to requalify as a dentist</a> meant taking any job to save money, as with Allahham. \u201cI had to work many different jobs on temporary contracts,\u201d he says, \u201clike for British Gas, and even selling secondhand books, since the jobcentre doesn\u2019t care about you getting back to your career, just that you have some sort of employment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Exhausted from the low pay and long hours, Alhomsi was persuaded by a Syrian friend to contact RefuAid. \u201cAnna gave me hope in my life. She got me an interest-free loan that I used to pay for exam fees and preparations, which I\u2019m forever grateful for,\u201d he says. \u201cRefuAid gave me a belief that I would be able to do what I\u2019ve spent one third of my life learning, and be able to live again.\u201d</p> \n<p>RefuAid is just one of a number of refugee startup charities that have flourished in the capital in the past three years.

Chief executive officer Matthew Powell, 28, says: \u201cUnderemployment is perhaps a bigger issue than unemployment for refugees, as most don\u2019t want to go on benefits, but they have families to support.

      "bodyText": "Hussam Allahham knows how to save a life on the operating table. He has done it many times in his home city of Damascus. He can fix broken limbs, amputate, remove tumours and replace organs. As a general surgeon he has had plenty of practice with a scalpel and stitches, both in Syria and while in a refugee camp in Italy. In short, he\u2019d be a useful addition to a health service anywhere. Only, in his new adopted home of Cardiff, Allahham, 36, cannot practise. He has tried to regain his standing as a surgeon but prohibitively expensive language tests and requalification exams have prevented him. His story is one that is commonly retold in different forms among the refugee population: 38% of the 10,000-plus Syrian refugees in the UK have a university education, yet 70% of all refugees are unemployed and 20% have had to change their careers to take any available job. Theresa May\u2019s government has pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020 \u2013 supposedly the largest single response to a humanitarian crisis by a British government. But a large section of this refugee population is being denied the ability to work to their full potential. Just as underemployment, the imbalance between skills and job roles, has reached double the rate of unemployment for British citizens, the same issues are affecting Britain\u2019s refugees. And despite May\u2019s stated intention being to prioritise immigration for the highly skilled after Brexit, here is an underutilised source of skilled people who are already in the country. Fortunately, a cluster of social enterprises have formed to help address these worrying statistics. With many based in London, and some even sharing the same co-working spaces, these startups help refugee talent move from unemployment or underemployment into meaningful work. \u201cWhen I first arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker, I wasn\u2019t allowed to work at all and it was very hard for me to accept benefits,\u201d Allahham says. These benefits of \u00a35 per day had to sustain Allahham for the four months it took for his application to be approved. \u201cI used to be a doctor, with a high standing in Syria,\u201d he continues, \u201cso it was humiliating to go to the jobcentre and ask for money. They didn\u2019t care that I am a doctor and can contribute to the country. I had to find any work.\u201d Allahham took their advice. \u201cEven cleaning was better than seeking benefits,\u201d he says. After volunteering at a local community centre, Allahham secured a full-time role as a support worker for asylum seekers. With this stability, he could focus on passing the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam to requalify as a surgeon. Nine attempts and \u00a33,500 in exam fees later, Allahham still works at the community centre. \u201cThe main problem is that I had to work full-time while studying for the language test,\u201d he says, \u201cand the free classes, which it took over an hour to walk to each day, weren\u2019t going to help me to get the high scores I needed.\u201d This high score of level 7.5 for medicine \u2013 where an average native speaker would likely reach 5 \u2013 requires intensive coaching, with one term costing upwards of \u00a33,000. Trapped in this cycle, Allahham found help through the charity RefuAid. Started in 2015 by ex-law trainee Anna Jones and consultant Tamsyn Brewster, RefuAid provides free language courses at 74 partner schools in the UK, as well as interest-free loans of up to \u00a310,000 for refugees to requalify. \u201cLanguage is the absolute first step to integration,\u201d Jones says, \u201cand since we started we haven\u2019t had a single default on the \u00a3215,000 we\u2019ve loaned, while we\u2019ve also placed 143 refugees into language schools.\u201d Jones estimates it takes at least a year of full-time study to pass the IELTS, since \u201cthe level of language they need is absurd\u201d. She says that means there are \u201cthousands of qualified refugees available who are misjudged and misused\u201d. With RefuAid\u2019s help, Allahham is now focusing on passing a new language test, the medically focused Occupational English Test, and once he does he will apply for a loan to take the \u00a32,500 exam to requalify as a surgeon. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road ahead, but I\u2019m sure I will work again as a doctor and help my community,\u201d he says. Another refugee helped by RefuAid to requalify is Syrian dentist Mohammad Alhomsi. The 31-year-old was forced to apply for asylum in 2013 after his student visa expired and the Syrian embassy in the UK shut down, leaving him and his young family stranded. It then took two years for Alhomsi\u2019s refugee status to be processed. \u201cDuring that time I broke down,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a strong man, but the way I was dealt with was undignified, like a criminal on probation. Me, my wife and my newborn baby had the bare minimum to survive on and we were scared that we would be deported. We lived an ongoing nightmare for two years.\u201d Although Alhomsi already had his language qualification from having studied in the UK, the \u00a34,000 cost to requalify as a dentist meant taking any job to save money, as with Allahham. \u201cI had to work many different jobs on temporary contracts,\u201d he says, \u201clike for British Gas, and even selling secondhand books, since the jobcentre doesn\u2019t care about you getting back to your career, just that you have some sort of employment.\u201d Exhausted from the low pay and long hours, Alhomsi was persuaded by a Syrian friend to contact RefuAid. \u201cAnna gave me hope in my life. She got me an interest-free loan that I used to pay for exam fees and preparations, which I\u2019m forever grateful for,\u201d he says. \u201cRefuAid gave me a belief that I would be able to do what I\u2019ve spent one third of my life learning, and be able to live again.\u201d RefuAid is just one of a number of refugee startup charities that have flourished in the capital in the past three years. Staffed almost entirely by under-30s \u2013 Jones is 28 \u2013 they refer refugees to one another, based on their needs. Breaking Barriers, an organisation focused on refugee employment and reskilling, helped Syrian fashion merchandiser Ammar Alsaker, 23, to get back to university and gain employment at a high-street brand. \u201cBreaking Barriers helped me kickstart my new life,\u201d Alsaker says. \u201cThanks to them, I finished first in my class at university. I have never been the first at anything, and I\u2019ve got to experience what that feels like despite all the challenges my family are going through and me being away from them for three years now.\u201d Since its founding in 2015, Breaking Barriers has helped more than 600 refugees get back into the workplace. Chief executive officer Matthew Powell, 28, says: \u201cUnderemployment is perhaps a bigger issue than unemployment for refugees, as most don\u2019t want to go on benefits, but they have families to support. The asylum process is also lengthy and you can\u2019t work during that time, so combine the two and you have a big gap on your CV that is very hard to articulate to employers.\u201d One organisation specifically targeting this asylum \u201cgap\u201d is Timepeace. An app designed to encourage skill-sharing among refugees and the public, it combats the isolation and dejection that Alhomsi found during his two-year asylum process. Co-founder Alexandra Simmons, 27, says: \u201cWe recognised that a lot of refugees were lonely once they arrived in the UK. They are dealing with a lot of trauma and being part of a community can have a hugely positive effect and help their language skills too.\u201d Timepeace is a means for refugees to meet up with others in their local area to either teach skills or to learn them, and aims to place refugees on an equal footing with the rest of society. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges around the perception of refugees is that they don\u2019t contribute, that they just want to take benefits,\u201d says Simmons, \u201cbut a lot of people aren\u2019t aware that they\u2019re either not allowed to work or they don\u2019t have the means to be adequately employed.\u201d And if there are no adequate jobs available, the Entrepreneurial Refugee Network helps people start their own businesses. \u201cWe want to reclaim the negative connotations of the word \u2018refugee\u2019,\u201d says co-founder Charlie Fraser, 25. \u201cThat\u2019s why we kept the word \u2018refugee\u2019 in our name and combined it with entrepreneurship, which is such a positive concept. We want to launch 1,000 refugee businesses by 2025, since at the moment the majority of refugee entrepreneur talent is being lost because they\u2019re in too vulnerable a position in terms of mindset, money and time.\u201d Once they have requalified, Allahham and Alhomsi plan to stay in the UK. \u201cI want to get back to the standing of the profession I had in Syria,\u201d Allahham says. \u201cJust as I helped those in the Red Cross who saved me, I want to give back to my community here.

Life expectancy began to fall after 2014, the city says. For men, it was 72.4 in 2017, down from 73.2 in 2013. Women had a longer life expectancy at 79.7, but that number has stopped improving.</p> <p>The city counts the years of its citizens\u2019 lives lost to early death, before the age of 75. The number hit a low of 9,004 years in 2014 and then reversed course \u2013 rising to 9,901 years in 2017.</p> <p>Life expectancy has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/29/americans-life-expectancy-down-drug-overdoses-suicides-rise-report\">fallen</a> across the nation as opioid overdoses claimed more and more lives, but the drug epidemic has hit Philadelphia harder than any other large city. In 2017, there were 1,217 overdose deaths in the city \u2013 the third highest cause of death, trailing only heart disease and cancer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge crisis that has really affected the health of the entire city,\u201d the health commissioner, Tom Farley, told the Guardian. The last time life expectancy dropped like this was during the Aids epidemic.</p> <p>Elise Schiller\u2019s daughter Giana became addicted to painkillers she was prescribed for injuries she suffered as an athlete and a veterinary nurse, before turning to heroin.</p> <p>\u201cI was so blindsided,\u201d said Schiller, 67, of Germantown. \u201cI became increasingly confused and disturbed by the way in which they were treating her.\u201d</p> <p>Schiller has become an advocate for better treatment, the kind her daughter did not get \u2013 using medications like methadone and buprenorphine, which research shows are more likely to succeed in combating opioid addiction. Treatment programs also neglected her mental health problems.</p> <p>\u201cIn her case, it was fatal,\u201d Schiller said.</p> <p>Philadelphia\u2019s crisis is especially bad because it lies at the intersection of two trends, Farley said. The city has long been a hub for the distribution of heroin around the east coast, most of it now mixed with the more deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl. Add to that doctors overprescribing opioids for pain. One in three Philadelphians report taking a prescription opioid in the last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9458bef33ddef5b7bfd4c501eff033e2f145bf7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9458bef33ddef5b7bfd4c501eff033e2f145bf7d/475_650_4997_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The most notorious public face of Philadelphia\u2019s overdose crisis is the Kensington neighborhood, where drugs are sold openly, and the city has cleared out encampments of homeless people addicted to heroin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The most notorious public face of Philadelphia\u2019s overdose crisis is the Kensington neighborhood, where drugs are sold openly, and the city has cleared out encampments of homeless people addicted to heroin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most notorious public face of Philadelphia\u2019s overdose crisis is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/27/its-all-fentanyl-opioid-crisis-takes-shape-in-philadelphia-as-overdoses-surge\">Kensington neighborhood</a>, where drugs are sold openly, and the city has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/01/philadelphia-homeless-heroin-bridge-camps\">cleared out</a> encampments of homeless people addicted to heroin.</p> <p>One still remains on Emerald Street \u2013 entrenched enough that its nickname, Emerald City, pops up as a destination in Google Maps. People live in tents under a bridge, but orange notices warn residents that they must clear out or be cleared out by 31 January.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an open-air drug market. The city let that happen,\u201d said Carol Rostucher, who founded the group Angels in Motion to help people living on the street with addictions after seeing her son, who is now in recovery, go through the same experience.</p> <p>Highly potent fentanyl factored in 84% of deaths in 2017, according to the city\u2019s report. Its effects wear off faster than heroin, which leads people to use more of it, which leads to more deaths. \u201cYou\u2019re using every couple hours so you\u2019re not sick,\u201d Rostucher said. \u201cEvery single time, it\u2019s a gamble.\u201d</p> <p>At a town hall meeting in the basement of Kensington\u2019s Mother of Divine Grace church, Farley told neighbors the city is laser-focused on one goal: \u201cTo keep people from dying.\u201d</p> <p>Philadelphia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/18/philadelphia-opioid-safe-injection-site-plan\">looking to open</a> a supervised injection site, where people addicted to heroin would inject the drug with medical help immediately on hand to prevent overdoses. But there\u2019s no timeline for it to open and the idea faces fierce opposition from the Trump administration.</p> <p>Over the last year and a half, the city has distributed 70,000 doses of naloxone, which can reverse an overdose.</p> <p>Destinie Campanella carries three of those doses with her at all times. Around her neck hangs a locket reminding her of the reason why: her uncle Christian, who was her best friend, died of a heroin overdose six years ago.</p> <p>\u201cI give it out like water,\u201d said Campanella, 28.</p> <p>While the crisis may be most visible in Kensington, it is killing people in neighborhoods around the city. Most people who die of overdoses die in their homes.</p> <p>There were 8,065 visits to the emergency room for overdoses in 2017, according to the city\u2019s report.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no poster child for the opioid epidemic,\u201d said Dr Priya Mammen, an emergency room physician at Methodist Hospital-Jefferson Health. Her South Philadelphia hospital deals with the third highest number of overdoses in the city.</p> <p>Many of the overdose victims in South Philadelphia are construction workers or manual laborers. They\u2019re often reluctant to look for treatment because of the stigma.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have homes, who have jobs, who have a family are like, \u2018Eh, I\u2019m not that bad,\u2019\u201d Mammen said. \u201cThey feel like they have control over their use \u2026 Except fentanyl is a game changer. None of us have control.\u201d</p> <p>As part of her job at Mental Health Partnerships, Campanella does homeless outreach on the streets of Kensington. On her own time, she does the same in South Philadelphia, where she has lived her whole life.</p> <p>\u201cIn South Philly, it\u2019s more hidden. People are using behind closed doors,\u201d she said, adding that people are reluctant to take the anti-overdose drug because they can\u2019t accept that their loved ones may need it. \u201cThey live at home. They have jobs. They\u2019re working. A lot of people might go to the gym, go to the tanning salon, even do steroids to make their appearance look better.\u201d</p> <p>While overdoses remain at crisis levels, there\u2019s a hint of good news: deaths began to tick down for the first half of 2018. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll be able to look back and say this is the year we turned the tide,\u201d Farley said.</p> <p>The murder rate, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/12/31/police-351-murders-in-philadelphia-in-2018-the-most-since-2007/\">only got worse</a> .</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17578a905c897c75c4a700a374b8a9ff37803cc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17578a905c897c75c4a700a374b8a9ff37803cc6/0_184_2176_1306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homicide was the tenth leading cause of death in 2017, with 322 Philadelphians slain, according to the Health Department report.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homicide was the tenth leading cause of death in 2017, with 322 Philadelphians slain, according to a health department report.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Kaczmarek/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Homicide was the tenth leading cause of death in 2017, with 322 Philadelphians slain, according to the health department report.

      "bodyText": "Trina Singleton\u2019s son died a day before his 25th birthday, gunned down on the same day 10 people were shot in Philadelphia. Elise Schiller\u2019s daughter died of a heroin overdose at the treatment center where she had gone to seek help breaking her addiction. They were victims of two tragedies \u2013 drug overdoses and homicides \u2013 now so prevalent in Philadelphia that they\u2019ve helped drive down life expectancy in the nation\u2019s sixth largest city. Premature deaths have been increasing since 2015, according to the report released this month by the Philadelphia department of public health. Life expectancy began to fall after 2014, the city says. For men, it was 72.4 in 2017, down from 73.2 in 2013. Women had a longer life expectancy at 79.7, but that number has stopped improving. The city counts the years of its citizens\u2019 lives lost to early death, before the age of 75. The number hit a low of 9,004 years in 2014 and then reversed course \u2013 rising to 9,901 years in 2017. Life expectancy has also fallen across the nation as opioid overdoses claimed more and more lives, but the drug epidemic has hit Philadelphia harder than any other large city. In 2017, there were 1,217 overdose deaths in the city \u2013 the third highest cause of death, trailing only heart disease and cancer. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge crisis that has really affected the health of the entire city,\u201d the health commissioner, Tom Farley, told the Guardian. The last time life expectancy dropped like this was during the Aids epidemic. Elise Schiller\u2019s daughter Giana became addicted to painkillers she was prescribed for injuries she suffered as an athlete and a veterinary nurse, before turning to heroin. \u201cI was so blindsided,\u201d said Schiller, 67, of Germantown. \u201cI became increasingly confused and disturbed by the way in which they were treating her.\u201d Schiller has become an advocate for better treatment, the kind her daughter did not get \u2013 using medications like methadone and buprenorphine, which research shows are more likely to succeed in combating opioid addiction. Treatment programs also neglected her mental health problems. \u201cIn her case, it was fatal,\u201d Schiller said. Philadelphia\u2019s crisis is especially bad because it lies at the intersection of two trends, Farley said. The city has long been a hub for the distribution of heroin around the east coast, most of it now mixed with the more deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl. Add to that doctors overprescribing opioids for pain. One in three Philadelphians report taking a prescription opioid in the last year. The most notorious public face of Philadelphia\u2019s overdose crisis is the Kensington neighborhood, where drugs are sold openly, and the city has cleared out encampments of homeless people addicted to heroin. One still remains on Emerald Street \u2013 entrenched enough that its nickname, Emerald City, pops up as a destination in Google Maps. People live in tents under a bridge, but orange notices warn residents that they must clear out or be cleared out by 31 January. \u201cIt\u2019s an open-air drug market. The city let that happen,\u201d said Carol Rostucher, who founded the group Angels in Motion to help people living on the street with addictions after seeing her son, who is now in recovery, go through the same experience. Highly potent fentanyl factored in 84% of deaths in 2017, according to the city\u2019s report. Its effects wear off faster than heroin, which leads people to use more of it, which leads to more deaths. \u201cYou\u2019re using every couple hours so you\u2019re not sick,\u201d Rostucher said. \u201cEvery single time, it\u2019s a gamble.\u201d At a town hall meeting in the basement of Kensington\u2019s Mother of Divine Grace church, Farley told neighbors the city is laser-focused on one goal: \u201cTo keep people from dying.\u201d Philadelphia is looking to open a supervised injection site, where people addicted to heroin would inject the drug with medical help immediately on hand to prevent overdoses. But there\u2019s no timeline for it to open and the idea faces fierce opposition from the Trump administration. Over the last year and a half, the city has distributed 70,000 doses of naloxone, which can reverse an overdose. Destinie Campanella carries three of those doses with her at all times. Around her neck hangs a locket reminding her of the reason why: her uncle Christian, who was her best friend, died of a heroin overdose six years ago. \u201cI give it out like water,\u201d said Campanella, 28. While the crisis may be most visible in Kensington, it is killing people in neighborhoods around the city. Most people who die of overdoses die in their homes. There were 8,065 visits to the emergency room for overdoses in 2017, according to the city\u2019s report. \u201cThere\u2019s no poster child for the opioid epidemic,\u201d said Dr Priya Mammen, an emergency room physician at Methodist Hospital-Jefferson Health. Her South Philadelphia hospital deals with the third highest number of overdoses in the city. Many of the overdose victims in South Philadelphia are construction workers or manual laborers. They\u2019re often reluctant to look for treatment because of the stigma. \u201cPeople who have homes, who have jobs, who have a family are like, \u2018Eh, I\u2019m not that bad,\u2019\u201d Mammen said. \u201cThey feel like they have control over their use \u2026 Except fentanyl is a game changer. None of us have control.\u201d As part of her job at Mental Health Partnerships, Campanella does homeless outreach on the streets of Kensington. On her own time, she does the same in South Philadelphia, where she has lived her whole life. \u201cIn South Philly, it\u2019s more hidden. People are using behind closed doors,\u201d she said, adding that people are reluctant to take the anti-overdose drug because they can\u2019t accept that their loved ones may need it. \u201cThey live at home. They have jobs. They\u2019re working. A lot of people might go to the gym, go to the tanning salon, even do steroids to make their appearance look better.\u201d While overdoses remain at crisis levels, there\u2019s a hint of good news: deaths began to tick down for the first half of 2018. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll be able to look back and say this is the year we turned the tide,\u201d Farley said. The murder rate, on the other hand, only got worse . Homicide was the tenth leading cause of death in 2017, with 322 Philadelphians slain, according to the health department report. The murder rate was nearly 10 times higher for black Philadelphians than whites. It helps explain why black men have the lowest life expectancy of any group in the city, at 69.1 years. \u201cA black boy is shot and killed, and that\u2019s that,\u201d said Singleton, whose son Darryl was shot and killed in 2016 near his childhood home. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same story: no motive, no suspects.\u201d But Singleton, 47, remembers her son as an outgoing young man who was going to school to be an EMT, loved spending summers with his grandmothers in Georgia and South Carolina, and doted on his youngest brother, who was just five when Darryl was killed. The younger boy made a card that sits on a corner table in Singleton\u2019s home next to a photo of Darryl: \u201cI hope you feel good in heaven. Love you.\u201d After Darryl\u2019s murder, his mother discovered a poem he had written for her but never gave her, expressing appreciation for the way his parents raised him. \u201cI just wanted my sons to be better,\u201d said Singleton, a real estate agent. Darryl Singleton\u2019s life is now remembered in an obituary written by the Philadelphia Obituary Project. So are murder victims like Paris Wright, 21, who died before he could meet his newborn daughter, and Dominique Oglesby, 23, a student at Penn State who had overcome a health condition to become a talented singer. Attorney Cletus Lyman started the project, distressed that victims\u2019 lives were getting lost in the sheer number of murders, most of them by gun. \u201cI didn\u2019t think people should just become statistics,\u201d he said. Many of the murders are never solved. That\u2019s true for Darryl Singleton, whose killer has not been arrested. \u201cThese young people think they can get away with murder. They know they can get away with murder,\u201d Trina Singleton said. Philadelphia\u2019s mayor has asked for a new plan to tackle gun violence, treating it as a public health problem. \u201cLaw enforcement is important, but it\u2019s not alone going to solve this problem,\u201d Farley said. Carmen Pagan, 41, became an advocate against gun violence after her brother was caught in the crossfire and shot to death three years ago. \u201cI could have chosen to stay in bed and be depressed and just let him be another number,\u201d said Pagan, who founded the group Somber (Sisters of Murdered Brothers Emerging and Revolutionizing). \u201cI wanted to take a stand.\u201d From her home in West Kensington, she sees the gun violence and drug crises collide. Her 13-year-old daughter designed a gun out of bullet casings on a canvas with the words: \u201cOur zip codes define our life expectancy.\u201d There\u2019s truth to that: there\u2019s a gap of more than two decades between the part of the city with the lowest life expectancy, 64, and the highest, 87. Her seven-year-old daughter has already learned to look out for needles in the street. \u201cWe have to help ourselves because nobody\u2019s going to come help us,\u201d Pagan said.",

And they warn the consequences could continue long into the future. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s as egregious as I\u2019ve ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests,\u201d said the former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who testified to Congress that the George W Bush administration pushed him to weaken or suppress public health findings.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s high-profile denial of manmade climate change has occasionally overshadowed the many other ways his agencies are contradicting established research.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The administration is really not using science. It is using ideology</p> <footer> <cite>Sara Flowers, Planned Parenthood</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The agriculture department last month rolled back standards for schools to serve more whole grains, less salt and non-fat flavored milk. Department officials claimed schools struggled with the programs because students wouldn\u2019t eat healthier foods.</p> <p>But research found the food changes<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161063\"> didn\u2019t deter students from getting lunch</a> and<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25734372\"> didn\u2019t cause more plate waste</a>.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s administration is cutting programs scientists say are proven to protect Americans, from pollution safeguards to teen pregnancy prevention and healthier school lunches, with effects that could last for years. Experts who have worked in the federal government under Republicans and Democrats say both have sometimes put politics ahead of science but none have done so as blatantly as Trump. And they warn the consequences could continue long into the future. \u201cIt\u2019s as egregious as I\u2019ve ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests,\u201d said the former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who testified to Congress that the George W Bush administration pushed him to weaken or suppress public health findings. Trump\u2019s high-profile denial of manmade climate change has occasionally overshadowed the many other ways his agencies are contradicting established research. The agriculture department last month rolled back standards for schools to serve more whole grains, less salt and non-fat flavored milk. Department officials claimed schools struggled with the programs because students wouldn\u2019t eat healthier foods. But research found the food changes didn\u2019t deter students from getting lunch and didn\u2019t cause more plate waste. And the healthier food requirements were projected to be effective: one study estimated they could prevent 1.8 million cases of childhood obesity over a decade. \u201cI do think it\u2019s pretty clear that these standards are working and that given more time, they will work better,\u201d said Karen Perry Stillerman, a food policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The Trump administration is also cutting short evidence-based grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs, favoring curriculum focused on abstinence instead, despite a large body of research that shows abstinence-only programs don\u2019t work. A 2007 evaluation of four federal abstinence programs found that they had no impact on sexual activity or rates of unprotected sex among teens. Sara Flowers, the vice-president of education for Planned Parenthood, said the majority of the programs previously funded demonstrated young people changed their behavior in at least one of five categories: delaying sex, reducing sexual partners, increasing contraceptive use, reducing rates of sexually transmitted infections or reducing rates of pregnancy. \u201cThe administration is really not using science. The administration is really using ideology, and those are very different,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cThis [program] has been rigorously tested by experts and vetted and analyzed.\u201d The Trump administration has also erroneously questioned the effectiveness of contraceptives in rules expanding exemptions for employers that don\u2019t want to cover them under insurance plans. Climate change and environmental science have also been at the forefront of the battle between science and the Trump administration. Power plant and car standards are being rolled back, as are pesticide restrictions and wildlife protections. The Trump administration has ignored climate scientists\u2019 warnings that rising temperatures and more extreme weather will hurt the US economy and risk lives. The interior department initially sought to remove references to manmade climate change in a report about how sea-level rise might flood national parks. \u201cThe notion of there being political appointees who try to impose their political agenda in a way that is contrary to scientific evidence is not a new thing, but it has reached an entirely new level in the Trump administration,\u201d said the Obama science adviser John Holdren. One of the first major decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was to forego a ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which is associated with developmental delays and health problems in children and has sickened farm workers. Judges ordered the EPA to bar the substance, citing the science that shows it is dangerous. The agency is appealing the case. Agency officials have also made fundamental changes to how the federal government weighs environmental and health research. The former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt barred scientists working with EPA grants from serving on the science advisory panels that help shape policies. Instead, industries and states now have more sway over those boards. The agency also plans to limit what science it will consider, requiring any studies used in the regulatory process to publish confidential participant data. A Democratic staffer for the House science committee, which plans to investigate the administration\u2019s science cuts, said it\u2019s been hard to even track all the agency changes. John Bachmann, who advised the controversial Reagan-era EPA appointee Anne Gorsuch Burford on air pollution science, said she would listen to briefings on peer-reviewed data, even as she slashed budgets and eased enforcement. \u201cThat was the most comparable period,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cThat was nothing compared to what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The longstanding perception that British tennis wasted Andy Murray\u2019s ascent to the upper reaches of the game over the past decade was given further substance by the Scot\u2019s older brother, Jamie, at the Australian Open on Wednesday. \u201cMy greatest worry was that he would stop one day, which obviously feels like it\u2019s been probably accelerated,\u201d he said, \u201cand you would look around the country, whether that\u2019s Scotland or the whole of the UK, and there wouldn\u2019t be much to show for everything he\u2019s put into his career and the success that he\u2019s had and the interest that he\u2019s created around tennis. \u201cIf you go around the country, you probably see that. And that is sad because how on earth are you going to grow a sport if you can\u2019t do it when you\u2019ve got one of the biggest stars in tennis for the last 10 years, and one of Britain\u2019s most prominent sportspeople?\u201d The question was as pointed as it was rhetorical. As the younger Murray said after losing in the first round on Monday\u2013 probably his farewell appearance \u2013 it is remarkable that playing numbers have dropped during his time in the game. The root causes of how the Lawn Tennis Association has failed to capitalise on the former world No 1\u2019s success \u2013 as well as that of his brother and a handful of other highly ranked players \u2013 are complicated. But funding is at the heart of the problem. As Jamie Murray pointed out before his first doubles match of the 2019 Australian Open on Thursday, much depends still on circumstances, personal sacrifice and access to facilities. Describing their early years in Dunblane, he said: \u201cIt is an amazing story. We\u2019ve come from a small town in Scotland, 8,000 people max.

Helping us to win Davis Cup for the first time in however many years, it\u2019s a pretty decent achievement.\u201d Murray said his most memorable moment alongside his brother was playing Davis Cup doubles against Australia in Glasgow in 2015. \u201cThere have been so many amazing moments.

On this windless afternoon, the sound of traffic along the nearby A30 trunk road is muffled by the thick stands of Sitka spruce.

The Canadian prime minister should \u201crespect the rule of law, respect China\u2019s judicial sovereignty, correct mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks\u201d, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said on Tuesday. A day earlier, Trudeau said that the death sentence had been applied \u201carbitrarily\u201d in the case of Robert Lloyd Schellenberg when it was upped from a 15-year prison sentence on appeal. \u201cWe express our strong dissatisfaction with this,\u201d Hua said.

On Tuesday, hours after Ottawa issued a travel warning for Canadians in China, Beijing published a similar advisory telling its citizens to \u201cfully evaluate the risks\u201d of traveling in Canada and detailed the \u201carbitrary detention\u201d of a Chinese national.

So it was no surprise when the wagons circled after Bernard Tomic embarrassed the tennis community with a withering attack on Lleyton Hewitt (whose own rebellious streak once was legendary).</p> \n<p>Tomic has always been an outsider and is determinedly so now, claiming Hewitt has frozen him out of the Davis Cup team. Thus freed from the mates\u2019 code of loyalty, he has lashed out, and those still close to the captain have turned their back on him, even Nick Kyrgios.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all Lleyton. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/14/bernard-tomic-attack-lleyton-hewitt-no-one-likes-him-australian-open-tennis\">I\u2019m going to say it honestly, no-one likes him anymore,\u201d Tomic said</a> after going out in the first round here on Monday.</p> \n<p>Surely Kyrgios, once a partner in youthful swagger with Tomic, would back him? Not quite. After he fell in a sweary heap on Tuesday night, dazzled by the power of Milos Raonic\u2019s serve and burdened by a sore knee, he preferred to train his frustration on his inquisitors.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s worth looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/jan/16/i-didnt-see-it-nick-kyrgios-bats-off-questions-over-bernard-tomic-claims-video\">his exchange with one reporter</a> in full.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"84b225ab-8ef0-402b-8ac6-22cc2daf1ab3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bpiCywUfSRY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kokkinakis \u2013 Kyrgios\u2019s mate \u2013 was similarly dismissive. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to answer that stuff right now,\u201d he said when it was put to him on Tuesday that he and Kyrgios were in conflict with Hewitt, as well. \u201cI\u2019m just pissed off I lost tonight, retired [having to quit with a sore shoulder against Taro Daniel]. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hewitt also had laughed off the Tomic broadside. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of Bernie being Bernie,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially after a loss last night and going in and complaining about a few things.

Bernie, guided by his father, didn\u2019t want to be part of that club, though. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/24/i-havent-really-tried-bernard-tomic-amazed-hes-done-well-at-tennis\">They were immigrants. They\u2019d do it their way</a>.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Tomic could play a bit. He and Hewitt resolved their differences, and were even close for a while. Tomic rose to No17 in the world and all looked well from the outside.</p> \n<p>But Tomic was miffed two years ago when asked to play for a wildcard at the Australian Open. The subtext was that, if he did so, his place was assured, regardless of the result. All he had to do was toe the line. He did not do so.</p> \n<p>Without central funding and now an outcast, he drifted further away from the mates\u2019 club. When he lost on day one, he exploded. The secret was out. There was trouble in paradise, it seemed \u2013 although strongly denied by those still basking in the sun.</p> \n<p>Australian cricket has just been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/31/steve-smith-david-warner-darren-lehmann-ball-tampering-australia\">through a similar charade with sandpapergate</a>, everyone shuffling their feet as the truth eked out, followed by tears, promises of a clean-up and then the ritual public rehab of battered reputations.

So it was no surprise when the wagons circled after Bernard Tomic embarrassed the tennis community with a withering attack on Lleyton Hewitt (whose own rebellious streak once was legendary). Tomic has always been an outsider and is determinedly so now, claiming Hewitt has frozen him out of the Davis Cup team. Thus freed from the mates\u2019 code of loyalty, he has lashed out, and those still close to the captain have turned their back on him, even Nick Kyrgios. \u201cIt\u2019s all Lleyton. I\u2019m going to say it honestly, no-one likes him anymore,\u201d Tomic said after going out in the first round here on Monday. Surely Kyrgios, once a partner in youthful swagger with Tomic, would back him? Not quite. After he fell in a sweary heap on Tuesday night, dazzled by the power of Milos Raonic\u2019s serve and burdened by a sore knee, he preferred to train his frustration on his inquisitors. It\u2019s worth looking at his exchange with one reporter in full. Kokkinakis \u2013 Kyrgios\u2019s mate \u2013 was similarly dismissive. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to answer that stuff right now,\u201d he said when it was put to him on Tuesday that he and Kyrgios were in conflict with Hewitt, as well. \u201cI\u2019m just pissed off I lost tonight, retired [having to quit with a sore shoulder against Taro Daniel]. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying for that.\u201d Hewitt also had laughed off the Tomic broadside. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of Bernie being Bernie,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially after a loss last night and going in and complaining about a few things. So, for me, I kind of just laugh it off and move forward.\u201d Which is the old formula. Move on. They do so because it is easy to \u201claugh it off\u201d when Bernie is being Bernie. But, while he will never have a career in diplomacy, he is entitled to his opinion, and there seems to be a grain of justification there. The source of it all is that Tomic a long time ago snubbed Hewitt, refusing to hit with the legend who, alone and for years, was the \u201clittle Aussie battler\u201d, a sunburnt hero from central casting, taking on the world and winning. Bernie, guided by his father, didn\u2019t want to be part of that club, though. They were immigrants. They\u2019d do it their way. Nevertheless, Tomic could play a bit. He and Hewitt resolved their differences, and were even close for a while. Tomic rose to No17 in the world and all looked well from the outside. But Tomic was miffed two years ago when asked to play for a wildcard at the Australian Open. The subtext was that, if he did so, his place was assured, regardless of the result. All he had to do was toe the line. He did not do so. Without central funding and now an outcast, he drifted further away from the mates\u2019 club. When he lost on day one, he exploded. The secret was out. There was trouble in paradise, it seemed \u2013 although strongly denied by those still basking in the sun. Australian cricket has just been through a similar charade with sandpapergate, everyone shuffling their feet as the truth eked out, followed by tears, promises of a clean-up and then the ritual public rehab of battered reputations. Moving on. But you have to know how to play the game. Tomic swings a racket as sweetly as anyone in tennis, but he doesn\u2019t know how to play the game the way his former mates do.",

The department submitted that removing both those thresholds with retrospective application will \u201cbolster the minister\u2019s ability to cease an individual\u2019s Australian citizenship where they have been convicted of a relevant terrorism offence, regardless of length of sentence\u201d. \u201cThis includes persons who have been released into the community, but either continue to prescribe to a violent extremist ideology or subsequently re-adopt such an ideology, and are thus of concern to authorities,\u201d it said. The department said the amendments \u201cmay give the minister the power to cease the Australian citizenship of a further 18 individuals\u201d, but did not say how many of those have dual citizenship. The proposed changes also lower the bar by requiring that the minister only be \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d the person would not become stateless. The department argued that lowering the threshold for revocation of citizenship may \u201cprovide additional deterrence\u201d to would-be offenders and that the number of people eligible for revocation may increase over time. The UNHCR submitted that the minister could revoke Australian citizenship on the basis a person is eligible to become a citizen of another country \u201crather than in fact being a national of another country at the time of the determination, as is currently the case\u201d. \u201cStatelessness could result if the minister takes the view that an individual would not become stateless provided they take steps to confirm or claim an entitlement to another nationality,\u201d it said. The UNHCR said the proposed amendments \u201ccreate a heightened risk that an individual could be rendered stateless\u201d contrary to Australia\u2019s obligations under the 1961 statelessness convention. The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils submitted the government had failed to show the proposal will make Australia safer. It argued the case of 27-year-old Isis fighter Neil Prakash \u2013 who was disowned by both Australia and Fiji \u2013 \u201chighlights very clearly how problematic\u201d the proposal to require only the minister\u2019s \u201csatisfaction\u201d of dual citizenship would be. Professor Helen Irving, from the University of Sydney law school, warned the law could be struck down by the high court, on the same grounds it found removing the vote from people convicted of offences carrying a sentence of less than three years prison to be unconstitutional.",

      "bodyText": "The vote arrived in time for editors to fashion their front pages and the results are not good for Theresa May. The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic. \u201cBrextinct\u201d, is its headline and they have pasted May\u2019s face onto a dodo. Presumably the headline intends to speak to the prime minister\u2019s tenure as much as her deal. The Guardian features a rare picture of the No lobby, which is packed with MPs walking through it to vote against May\u2019s Brexit deal. The headline is \u201cMay suffers historic defeat as Tories turn against her\u201d and the paper paints a picture of how the remarkable day unfolded, saying: \u201cOn a day of extraordinary drama at Westminster, the House of Commons delivered a devastating verdict on May\u2019s deal, voting against it by 432 to 202. The scale of the defeat, by a majority of 230, was unprecedented in the modern parliamentary era and saw ardent Brexiters such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson walk through a packed division lobby cheek-by-jowl with passionate remainers.\u201d The Daily Mirror focuses on the no-confidence motion launched by Jeremy Corbyn, with the splash: \u201cNo deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence.\u201d \u201cA complete humiliation,\u201d says the Telegraph, which reports her Brexit deal has \u201cturned to dust\u201d. The paper is happily sticking the knife in to May, running a front page comment piece saying \u201cIt takes a special kind of skill to get that many people to unite against you\u201d. \u201cMay suffers historic defeat,\u201d is the Times\u2019 headline. Its front page story says \u201cTheresa May was under mounting pressure last night to delay Brexit after she suffered the largest Commons defeat in political history\u201d. The Daily Express\u2019s splash is \u201cDismay\u201d. But the paper, which is pro-Brexit, is not angry with May, whom the paper says \u201cvaliantly fought for her deal\u201d. The Express also has a lengthy directive to MPs on its front page: \u201cThis nation is crying out for unity, but all Jeremy Corbyn wants is to oust the PM. Now it\u2019s time for the MPs to do their duty and work with Theresa May for a deal that satisfies the 17.4m who voted Brexit \u2026 Don\u2019t fail us!\u201d Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: \u201cFighting for her life\u201d. Still keen to show its support for May, the Mail says: \u201cThe prime minister called on mutinous Tory MPs to back her in a confidence vote tonight. Another defeat could trigger an election and put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.\u201d The Financial Times\u2019 headline is \u201cMay\u2019s Brexit deal crushed by Commons\u201d and its story tries to convey the scale of the defeat, saying \u201cTheresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, the product of two years of torturous negotiations in Brussels, was last night overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Commons.\u201d The i calls the day\u2019s events a \u201chistoric humiliation\u201d, pointing out that Tory backbenchers voted \u201csix to one against her Brexit deal\u201d and the Scotsman runs the simple headline \u201cCrushed\u201d.",

In detail. Do you know the names? Do you know the sacred sites and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/05/map-of-massacres-of-indigenous-people-reveal-untold-history-of-australia-painted-in-blood\">the massacre sites</a>?</p> <p>How can we acknowledge what we don\u2019t even know?</p> <p>That is not to say there aren\u2019t amazing and beautiful people, places and actions all across Australia that are worthy of celebration, but most of those things for me exist in spite of the colonial project, not because of it.</p> <p>We have wonderful slogans of a fair go for all, or of being a lucky country. For years we have had politicians ignore racism by calling Australia \u201cthe most successful multicultural country on Earth\u201d, but now that they are trying to move away from the spirit of multiculturalism to a more open admittance that the Australianness of any non-white migrant is always conditional, and that their citizenship can and will be withdrawn at a minute\u2019s notice. In this environment even the lie of being multicultural has needed to be downgraded to \u201cthe most successful migrant nation\u201d.</p> <p>These are the lies Australia tells itself, not to aspire to a greater future, but to deny our past and our present. This is why we changed the International Day of the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and made it Harmony Day instead. Not because we had eliminated racial discrimination, but because we wanted to pretend that it doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>This is what Australia does with its symbolic gestures. It uses them to pretend that no further changes are required.</p> <p>And that is why I cannot in good conscience support #changethedate anymore. If public pressure for changing the date grows to sufficient level I don\u2019t doubt that the major parties would do a 180 to support it. But because it would be a responsive vote-grab rather than reflecting any sincerely belief or aspirations for a better country, they would continue to dismiss and undermine Indigenous aspirations and to avoid the tough questions of Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination.</p> <p>So, change the country first, and then we can talk about a date.</p> <p>Show me a country with a treaty or treaties that are robust. A country with meaningful Indigenous representation in decision-making that affects us, at the local and the national level.</p> <p>Show a me a country where the greatest areas for Indigenous representation aren\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/11/indigenous-leaders-crisis-talks-scott-morrison-closing-gap\">in prisons, child removal and suicide</a>.</p> <p>Show me a country that acknowledges not just its white supremacist origins, but it\u2019s current state. A country that fights to eradicate racism and understands that we must be eternally vigilant against its resurgence once it is removed.</p> <p>Show me a country that I can be proud of, that I can teach my children to be proud of, where they can grow up confident in the knowledge that this country doesn\u2019t see their very existence as a problem to be solved, and then I will talk about what could be a good date in the calendar year to throw a party for how awesome the country is. Because right now, I just don\u2019t see a country worth celebrating, and I\u2019m not willing to change the date in the hopes that it might come next year, or the year after that.</p> <p>Every year more and media organisations play #changethedate for clicks and sensationalism rather than to highlight issues or foster dialogue. Political parties pounce on it with such breathtaking hypocrisy that in the same breath they talk about being a free country and in the next about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/13/scott-morrison-forces-councils-to-hold-citizenship-ceremonies-on-australia-day\">forcing local councils to hold celebrations</a> and about dress codes for citizenship ceremonies. They hide behind a faux support of migrants to mask their support for white nationalism.</p> <p>So starting next week, <a href=\"https://indigenousx.com.au/\">IndigenousX</a> will be publishing an article a day in the lead-up to Invasion Day that will help paint a picture of what needs to change, and what that future could look like.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/14/councils-ask-scott-morrison-pay-citizenship-ceremonies-on-26-january-australia-day\">Councils ask Morrison to pay for citizenship ceremonies on 26 January</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And for the record, the 26 January will always remain Invasion Day, and Survival Day, and a Day of Mourning, because #LestWeForget.</p> <p>Hopefully though, one day, Australia might become a country that I could celebrate, but only if we name the changes that need to occur, and we work towards achieving them. Changing the date is one of the final steps on that list, not one of the first.</p> <p>But even then, the goal should not be so that we can \u201creconcile\u201d, or that we can all have a party together some day on a given date. It needs to be less about appeasing white guilt and more about supporting Indigenous empowerment.</p> <p>The goal is a country that does not treat Indigenous people as a threat but instead recognises and respects the unique status of Indigenous peoples in Australia, and strives to weave that in to the national identity, decision making processes, and day-to-day life of the colony \u2013 even where that means some Indigenous people choose to withdraw from the communities and institutions that have so long rejected and disenfranchised us and create our own instead.</p> <p>\u2022 Luke Pearson is the founder and director of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndigenousX\">@IndigenousX</a> and IndigenousX.

Until recently, when you searched \u201cchange the date\u201d on Google in Australia, the first entry was even an article I wrote a few years back titled \u201cWhy we should change the date of Australia Day\u201d. It is still the most successful article on IndigenousX, by far. I had hoped there were enough Australians who would agree that celebrating Invasion is a pretty shit thing to do, and that changing the date could provide a catalyst for creating a country worthy of celebration. However, after seeing the rise of the #changethedate campaign I have come to the opinion that there are too many people who seem to think the problem with Australia Day rests solely on the day we celebrate it, not with what we are celebrating. I don\u2019t really feel that Australia, where we sit right now, is worth celebrating. Not just the actions of 230 years ago, or a century ago, or 50, or even 15 years ago that are problematic.

A lot of that is tied up in our denial of history and our collective refusal to make any meaningful steps to reconcile it, but it extends beyond that too. A simple observation would be to point out there are only two events where we can be guaranteed to see white people wearing flag capes \u2013 on Australia Day and at neo-Nazi rallies. Moving an overly politicised and problematic day to another date won\u2019t change that. A country that is content with Indigenous incarceration rates going up to as high as 100% in individual prisons, even though we represent 3% of the population, is not one I really want to celebrate anyway, regardless of what date it is on. Especially not when you look at those incarcerated often dealing with issues of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), severe hearing loss, intergenerational trauma or abuse at the hands of the state. Many people whose only real crime is being poor; poor in a country made wealthy by Indigenous peoples\u2019 dispossession, exploitation and exclusion from the opportunities created within that colony. A country that refuses to ever hold authorities to account for the deaths of Indigenous people in custody is one that does not deserve a party. And that\u2019s just scratching the surface of issues to do with incarceration. There are countless other issues in countless other areas across the colony in health, education, media, housing \u2026 you name it. We have people homeless on their homelands while billions have been ripped out of those same lands through mining. We have communities whose water is poisoned. People who are routinely punished for not applying for jobs that don\u2019t exist. We have people whose languages were stolen from their parents and grandparents and today we act like teaching people their languages in school would somehow be doing them a disservice. We have corporations we applaud for hiring Indigenous people, even if the government has to pay them to do it. We acknowledge the traditional owners at events, but we don\u2019t acknowledge what happened to change them from \u201cowners\u201d to \u201ctraditional owners\u201d. How many of us even know what happened right under our feet to make that change? In detail. Do you know the names? Do you know the sacred sites and the massacre sites? How can we acknowledge what we don\u2019t even know? That is not to say there aren\u2019t amazing and beautiful people, places and actions all across Australia that are worthy of celebration, but most of those things for me exist in spite of the colonial project, not because of it. We have wonderful slogans of a fair go for all, or of being a lucky country. For years we have had politicians ignore racism by calling Australia \u201cthe most successful multicultural country on Earth\u201d, but now that they are trying to move away from the spirit of multiculturalism to a more open admittance that the Australianness of any non-white migrant is always conditional, and that their citizenship can and will be withdrawn at a minute\u2019s notice. In this environment even the lie of being multicultural has needed to be downgraded to \u201cthe most successful migrant nation\u201d. These are the lies Australia tells itself, not to aspire to a greater future, but to deny our past and our present. This is why we changed the International Day of the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and made it Harmony Day instead. Not because we had eliminated racial discrimination, but because we wanted to pretend that it doesn\u2019t exist. This is what Australia does with its symbolic gestures. It uses them to pretend that no further changes are required. And that is why I cannot in good conscience support #changethedate anymore. If public pressure for changing the date grows to sufficient level I don\u2019t doubt that the major parties would do a 180 to support it. But because it would be a responsive vote-grab rather than reflecting any sincerely belief or aspirations for a better country, they would continue to dismiss and undermine Indigenous aspirations and to avoid the tough questions of Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination. So, change the country first, and then we can talk about a date. Show me a country with a treaty or treaties that are robust. A country with meaningful Indigenous representation in decision-making that affects us, at the local and the national level. Show a me a country where the greatest areas for Indigenous representation aren\u2019t in prisons, child removal and suicide. Show me a country that acknowledges not just its white supremacist origins, but it\u2019s current state. A country that fights to eradicate racism and understands that we must be eternally vigilant against its resurgence once it is removed. Show me a country that I can be proud of, that I can teach my children to be proud of, where they can grow up confident in the knowledge that this country doesn\u2019t see their very existence as a problem to be solved, and then I will talk about what could be a good date in the calendar year to throw a party for how awesome the country is. Because right now, I just don\u2019t see a country worth celebrating, and I\u2019m not willing to change the date in the hopes that it might come next year, or the year after that. Every year more and media organisations play #changethedate for clicks and sensationalism rather than to highlight issues or foster dialogue. Political parties pounce on it with such breathtaking hypocrisy that in the same breath they talk about being a free country and in the next about forcing local councils to hold celebrations and about dress codes for citizenship ceremonies. They hide behind a faux support of migrants to mask their support for white nationalism. So starting next week, IndigenousX will be publishing an article a day in the lead-up to Invasion Day that will help paint a picture of what needs to change, and what that future could look like. And for the record, the 26 January will always remain Invasion Day, and Survival Day, and a Day of Mourning, because #LestWeForget. Hopefully though, one day, Australia might become a country that I could celebrate, but only if we name the changes that need to occur, and we work towards achieving them. Changing the date is one of the final steps on that list, not one of the first. But even then, the goal should not be so that we can \u201creconcile\u201d, or that we can all have a party together some day on a given date. It needs to be less about appeasing white guilt and more about supporting Indigenous empowerment. The goal is a country that does not treat Indigenous people as a threat but instead recognises and respects the unique status of Indigenous peoples in Australia, and strives to weave that in to the national identity, decision making processes, and day-to-day life of the colony \u2013 even where that means some Indigenous people choose to withdraw from the communities and institutions that have so long rejected and disenfranchised us and create our own instead. \u2022 Luke Pearson is the founder and director of @IndigenousX and IndigenousX.

      "bodyText": "Shutting down for today, thanks for following along! In case you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s a Tuesday breakdown: New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand officially announced her bid for the presidency on Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show. Dubbed the \u201c#MeToo\u201d Senator, Gillibrand was an advocate for women and long before the movement began, and she has framed her campaign around \u201crestoring power to people\u201d. The GOP issued a quick response, in a video that frames her as an opportunist. Bill Barr, the president\u2019s attorney general nominee, faced the Senate judiciary committee and pledged that he would not interfere with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The House voted to admonish white supremacy following the fallout over Iowa Republican Steve King\u2019s racist remarks. King was removed from high-powered committees by his own party, but has refused to resign. Meanwhile, NBC was caught in their own controversy, after telling staffers not to refer to King\u2019s comments as \u201cracist\u201d. The shutdown stalemate continued today, as Congress announced it would not be breaking for a scheduled week-long recess. Federal employees will soon miss their second paycheck of the year. See you tomorrow! It didn\u2019t take long for the Republican National Committee to issue a takedown on the newly-announced 2020 candidacy of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Mere hours after she shared with Stephen Colbert that she was assembling an exploratory committee, the GOP published a video featuring the NY Democrat apologizing over a backing track of Bryan Adam\u2019s \u201cPlease Forgive Me\u201d. Echoing criticisms from her own party, in a statement sent to The Guardian Republican Spokesman Michael Ahrens called Gillibrand an opportunist. \u201cIf you looked up \u2018political opportunism\u2019 in the dictionary, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s photo would be next to it\u201d, he said. \u201cFrom jumping on the \u2018abolish ICE\u2019 bandwagon to turning on the Clintons, Gillibrand always goes where the political wind blows. Democrats know it, which is why she\u2019s barely registering in the polls.\u201d He paired the statement with the video, claiming it was preview of what\u2019s to come from her campaign. Gillibrand meanwhile, has released a video of her own: After being rebuked for racist comments and removed from committee assignments, today Rep. Steve King pushed back against Republicans for their criticism and said he had no intention of resigning. As a guest on a conservative radio show King admonished House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, for \u201c[deciding] he\u2019s going to believe The New York Times over Steve King\u201d, referring to himself in third-person. He also went after Liz Cheney who called for him to step down, saying \u201cif there\u2019s support out there for Liz Cheney after this, you can\u2019t ever put her in the category of being a conservative again. She called for my resignation. She\u2019s been here two years. What would give her the moral authority or the intellectual judgement to do something like that?\u201d House and Senate leaders announced today that Congress will work through the upcoming week-long recess and stay in session until there is a solution to the shutdown, which is now the longest in US history. Roughly 800,000 federal workers have gone without pay over the last four weeks and with no end to the impasse in sight, will likely soon miss their second paychecks of the year. In a letter to members of the United States Coast Guard published today, Admiral Karl L. Schultz expressed his apologies that they would not be receiving their mid-month paychecks, marking \u201cthe first time in our Nation\u2019s history that servicemembers in a US Armed Force have not been paid during a lapse in government appropriations\u201d. An official from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) also warned that soon no workers would be left. \u201cI, for one, could not sustain six months, a year without a paycheck \u2014 I don\u2019t know too many people that could, so you\u2019re looking at an air controller here that would resign,\u201d regional NATCA vice president Eddie DeLisle told The Hill. Still, both sides dug their heels in this week, and high-level talks have been at a standstill. A group of House Democrats declined a lunch invitation from Trump today, which was seen as an attempt to undermine party leadership but, according to reporting by the Associated Press, Trump told supporters that things were going smoothly and expressed no desire to bend. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay out for a long time, if we have to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out for a long time\u201d. He added that \u201cpeople are very impressed with how well government is working with the circumstances that we\u2019re under\u201d. As the UK grapples with the turmoil following the sweeping defeat of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, US politicians have begun to weigh in. In a statement to The Guardian today, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi emphasized the international concern over the future of global institutions, and compared the political divisions abroad to those at home: \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing to see such an important ally as politically divided as the United Kingdom is by the issue of Brexit. While domestic concerns are central to any political issue, the Brexit movement is clearly one form of the global retrenchment from international institutions. We\u2019ve seen a domestic parallel in the Trump administration\u2019s rumored flirtation with withdrawing the United States from NATO. It would be a horrible mistake for any nation, including the United States, to abandon the economic and military alliances that have brought such prosperity and security since the Second World War.\u201d The office of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, submitted a new court filing on Tuesday detailing communications between former Trump aid Paul Manafort and alleged Russian intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik. At a taping for \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d this evening, Sen. Gillibrand shared that she was officially joining the race for the white house. Announcing that she was assembling an exploratory committee and will soon be on her way to Iowa, she told Colbert she was running as a mom as she outlined key parts of her platform: \u201cAs a young mom, I\u2019m going to fight for other people\u2019s kids as hard as I\u2019d fight for my own, which is why I believe health care should be a right, not a privilege; it\u2019s why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn\u2019t matter what block you grew up on; and I believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class\u201d she said. Gillibrand is a strong critic of President Trump and has worked to block many of his priorities. She was also an early advocate for abolishing ICE and has been vocal about advancing women\u2019s rights \u2014 earning a title from 60 Minutes as the \u201c#MeToo Senator\u201d. But, she hasn\u2019t always been as committed to progressive priorities. Per the New York Times: Ms. Gillibrand, a 52-year-old former corporate lawyer, has been criticized by opponents as a politician without a firm ideological bearing of her own, having transformed from a pro-gun, conservative upstate congresswoman with deep ties to Wall Street financiers to a crusading liberal who rails against guns and refuses corporate political action committee money.\u201d NBC News staffers were sent an email Tuesday directing them to \u201cBe careful to avoid characterizing [King\u2019s] remarks as racist\u201d HuffPost reports, when covering the fallout from the Republican congressman\u2019s interview with the New York Times where he questioned why white nationalism and white supremacy were offensive during an interview with the New York Times. After Huffpost published the standards, NBC issued a revise allowing reporters to point out that the Iowa representative has a history of racist rhetoric: \u2018We revised our guidance on Rep. Steve King\u2019s comments\u2019 reads an email from NBC News\u2019 standards department that was shared with HuffPost. \u2018It is fair to characterize King\u2019s comments as \u2018racist,\u2019 and point out that he has a history of racist comments, and the context can be shared that others hold that view as well\u2019\u201d. Pressed by Sen. Cory Booker on his views on LGBTQ rights, Barr responded that he thinks \u201cin a pluralistic society there has to be a live and let live attitude\u201d and added that while he at one time believed marriage should be regulated by the states he is against discrimination for any reason. \u201cI am perfectly fine with gay marriage\u201d, he said, \u201cbut I also want accommodation for religion\u201d. After Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was resoundingly defeated with a 230 majority today \u2014 the largest loss in the modern democratic era \u2014 a Democratic candidate for the US 2020 presidential election was the first to weigh in. Former Maryland congressman John Delaney said in a statement to the Guardian that \u201cBrexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now. Leaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second\u201d. Per my colleague Ben Jacobs: Delaney, who has focused his campaign on responding to the challenges of globalization and automation, added: \u2018The Brexit chaos shows that the answer to globalization isn\u2019t to turn inward or to play into the politics of fear \u2013 which happened with Trump and the Leave campaign \u2013 but to create new policies that make capitalism more just and create meaningful public and private investment in areas and communities left behind\u2019\u201d. Questioned by Democratic Sen. Chris Coons about whether Barr believes the President can pardon himself or pardon a member of his family, the AG nominee responded that Trump has the power to do both, but depending on the circumstances that action might be viewed as an abuse of that power. Asked by Coons how the President might be held accountable for an abuse of power Barr replied \u201che would be accountable politically\u201d. Hi, this is Gabrielle on the west coast taking over for Ben Jacobs. The Senate confirmation hearing for AG nominee William Barr has resumed and Barr has circled back to his opening statement emphasizing that he would seek to \u201cdeter and punish\u201d foreign entities from interfering in elections. \u201cI would like to build on that experience to sharpen our legal tools to go after Russian nationals or nationals of any country interfering in our elections\u201d he said. The Senate voted to move ahead on legislation to block efforts by Steven Mnuchin to end sanctions on Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch with close links to Putin and Paul Manafort. Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on February 8, the day after Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony. By a vote of 424-1, the House of Representatives voted to disapprove of white supremacy in a resolution intended as a rebuke of Iowa Republican Steve King. While King voted for the resolution, the only dissenter was Democrat Bobby Rush who has pushed for a formal censure of King and believed that the resolution did not go far enough. After Sheldon Whitehouse asks Barr what the DOJ should know about the foreign business entanglements of senior government officials, Barr remains silent for a few seconds. Barr is now criticizing federal district courts for issuing injunctions to block Trump\u2019s travel ban nationally. Barr says \u201cvoter turnout shouldn\u2019t be artificially driven up without dealing with the underlying issue of an informed citizenry\u201d when asked about voter ID. Barr says \u201cI don\u2019t think we should ever do torture\u201d and says the McCain legislation to codify the Army field manual was important. In response to a question from Feinstein, Barr is \u201ctorture is never lawful.\u201d When asked if waterboarding is torture, he says \u201cright now, it is prohibited.\u201d The second round of questioning now begins as Thom Tillis finishes his questions for Barr. Barr said after his initial meeting with Trump in 2017, that he didn\u2019t meet with the president until November, 2018. That meeting was about the attorney general nomination and Barr says there was no discussion of Mueller. Kamala Harris is now pushing Barr on whether he supports a border wall. Barr backs away a little bit from his support for mass incarceration in the 1990s in response to questioning from Cory Booker but agrees to meeting with the New Jersey senator about the issue. Barr says \u201cwe either should have a federal law which would prohibit marijuana everywhere . . .however if we want states to have their own laws, we should get there the right way.\u201d On marijuana, Barr says his concerns would be not upset settled expectations and reliance interests, however he describes \u201cbackdoor nullification\u201d of federal law on marijuana policy right now. The hearing has now resumed and Barr is now being questioned by John Kennedy of Louisiana. As the Senate Judiciary Committee has been meeting, President Donald Trump has had members of Congress at the White House for lunch. All the Democrats invited have declined to attend, leading press secretary Sarah Sanders to put out the following statement: As Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi refuse to negotiate, President Donald J. Trump and his team are working hard to find solutions to solve the humanitarian and national security crisis at the border and reopen the government. The President has a proposal on the table that includes additional technology at ports of entry, allows minors from Central America to seek asylum in their home country, and physical barriers between ports of entry made of steel instead of concrete. Today, the President offered both Democrats and Republicans the chance to meet for lunch at the White House. Unfortunately, no Democrats will attend. The President looks forward to having a working lunch with House Republicans to solve the border crisis and reopen the government. It\u2019s time for the Democrats to come to the table and make a deal. The hearing is now taking a break. In other news related to Mueller, prosecutors are seeking yet another delay in the sentencing of Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort\u2019s longtime deputy and has been cooperating with the special counsel. When asked about what information he would allow to be released from Mueller, Barr says that he intends to \u201cget as much information out as I can, consistent with the regulations.\u201d Barr says he still believes Roe v Wade was wrongly decided but indicates that he views it as established precedent at this point. Barr says that he would resign rather than do something unlawful but notes that he thinks every government official should step down if ordered to do something against the law. Barr describes his view of the Mueller investigation: I think there were allegations made of Russian attempts to interfere in the election and allegations made that some Americans were in cahoots with the Russians and the word being used now is collusion and as I understand it Mueller is now looking into those allegations. When Chris Coons asks Barr if he would fire Mueller if ordered to by Trump without good cause, Barr says \u201cI would not carry out that instruction.\u201d Barr leaves open the possibility of overruling Mueller, though under limited circumstances Special counsel has broad discretion but acting attorney general, in this case, Rod Rosenstein, can ask about major decisions and if they disagree and after giving great weight to special counsel\u2019s position, the acting attorney general felt it was so unwarranted under established policies to notify this committee Barr says \u201cI think a lot of our current tensions in society are because we are turning our back on the federalist model.\u201d When asked how he describes the rule of law by Ted Cruz, Barr says \u201cthe rule of law is exactly that that we don\u2019t allow a special rule for a particular individual.\u201d Barr is asked if the Justice Department will jail reporters for doing their jobs, he pauses \u201cI can conceive of situations where as a last resort and where a news organization has run through a red flag, knows they are putting out stuff that is hurting the country, there is a situation where they can be held in contempt.\u201d Barr has been avoiding committing himself in discussing acting attorney general Matt Whitaker\u2019s decision not to recuse himself in the ongoing special counsel investigation. Barr is now getting questioning on immigration policy from Amy Klobuchar and for his views on the ongoing government shutdown. \u201cWe need a barrier system across the border\u201d says Barr. Barr striking a hawkish note on immigration: \u201cOne of the problems as the president says is that the immigration laws need to be changed.\u201d Bill Barr doesn\u2019t seem to have the most thrilling hobbies. Barr says he has done nothing to encourage Rod Rosenstein to leave the Justice Department and says that, if confirmed, he\u2019d encourage Rosenstein to stay on through a transition period. The confirmation hearing for Bill Barr has now resumed Liz Cheney, the number three Republican in the House of Representatives, has called for Steve King to resign. King was removed from all committee assignments last night after yet another inflammatory, racially charged comment. In his new book, Chris Christie reveals why Donald Trump is so enamored with a long tie as a fashion choice. The hearing is taking a break for lunch after Barr offered a strong defense of Mueller so far this morning, insisting that the investigation would not be a witch hunt and that the special counsel is \u201ca straight shooter.\u201d Barr says that his views on sentencing has changed. \u201cI understand things have changed since 1992.\u201d He credits his reluctance to support sentencing reform to being in private practice and away from law enforcement. Barr\u2019s full answer on being bullied can be watched in this clip. Barr says \u201cI will not be bullied into doing anything that I think is wrong.\u201d When asked why he wants what seems to be a thankless job by Dick Durbin, Barr says \u201cbecause I love the department\u201d and adds that he feels that he is \u201cat a position in life where he can protect the independence of this department and serve in this administration.\u201d Barr says he can\u2019t answer if Trump has the authority to use the Department of Defense to build a border wall. Barr on Russian interference in the 2016 election: \u201cI believe the Russians interfered, or attempted to interfere, with the election, and we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Barr says that in June, 2017 that Ambassador David Friedman approached him about possibly representing Trump as a client. Barr says he declined but Friedman, the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, still asked him to meet with Trump. Barr says his meeting with Trump was \u201cbrief\u201d and that Trump asked him questions about Mueller. Barr says that he told Trump \u201cBob is a straight shooter and should be dealt with as such.\u201d Barr doesn\u2019t commit to releasing all of Mueller\u2019s report to the public. Barr says \u201cI don\u2019t believe Mr. Mueller to be involved in a witch hunt\u201d and adds that he believes Sessions \u201cprobably did the right thing\u201d in recusing himself. Lindsey Graham is starting his questions by asking Barr about Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and reading text messages between the two. Barr is pledging that he will not interfere with Mueller\u2019s probe. \u201cI believe it is in best interest of everyone, the president, Congress and the American people that this matter be resolved by allowing the special counsel to complete his work. The country needs a credible resolution to these issues.\u201d He adds: \u201cOn my watch Bob will be allowed to finish his work.\u201d Barr says he has not promised Trump anything other than that \u201che will run the department with professionalism and integrity.\u201d Barr is now giving his opening statement and referencing his previous confirmation process when he was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. He references past comments saying that political interference in the Department of Justice should never be tolerated and that \u201cthe American people need to know that there are places in government where rule of law and not politics must hold sway.\u201d Orrin Hatch of Utah, who served seven terms in the U.S. Senate before not seeking re-election in 2018, is now introducing Barr. Hatch served as the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993-2005 and continued to sit on the committee until his retirement. After Lindsey Graham opens the hearing by running through Barr\u2019s qualifications, Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, now raises the Mueller investigation. She says \u201cthe attorney general must resist political pressure and be committed to defending this investigation.\u201d She does note ongoing concerns about the memo Barr wrote to the Justice Department last year that was critical of Mueller\u2019s view of obstruction of justice and his robust view of executive power. The hearing on Bill Barr\u2019s nomination to be Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general has now begun. Barr previously served as attorney general under George H.W. Bush from 1991-1993. It will be the first meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee under its new chairman, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. President Donald Trump has drawn attention on Twitter this morning for yet another one of his unique typos. This time, for spelling \u201chamburger\u201d as \u201chamberder\u201d when boasting about his fast food feast with the national champion Clemson Tigers last night. Republican governor Kim Reynolds has proposed a constitutional amendment in Iowa to end the state\u2019s ban on felon voting. Iowa is currently one of two remaining states that permanently bans anyone convicted of a felony from voting. The other is Kentucky. Currently, the only way anyone can have their rights restored is through directly petitioning the governor for clemency. Good morning. The partial government shutdown has reached day 25, Republican Steve King has been stripped of committee assignments after yet another inflammatory and racially charged comment and the confirmation hearings for Bill Barr to be attorney general are set to begin. It\u2019s Tuesday in American politics.",

She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, the house has spoken and the government will listen.</p> \n   <p>It is clear that the house does not support this deal. But tonight\u2019s vote tells us nothing about what it does support. Nothing about how \u2013 or even if \u2013 it intends to honour the decision the British people took in a referendum parliament decided to hold.</p> \n   <p>People, particularly EU citizens who have made their home here and UK citizens living in the EU, deserve clarity on these questions as soon as possible. Those whose jobs rely on our trade with the EU need that clarity. So with your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to set out briefly how the government intends to proceed.</p> \n   <p>First, we need to confirm whether this government still enjoys the confidence of the house. I believe that it does, but given the scale and importance of tonight\u2019s vote it is right that others have the chance to test that question if they wish to do so. I can therefore confirm that if the official opposition table a confidence motion this evening in the form required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the government will make time to debate that motion tomorrow. And if, as happened before Christmas, the official opposition decline to do so, we will \u2013 on this occasion - consider making time tomorrow to debate any motion in the form required from the other opposition parties, should they put one forward.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>Second, if the house confirms its confidence in this government I will then hold meetings with my colleagues, our confidence and supply partner the DUP and senior parliamentarians from across the house to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the house. The government will approach these meetings in a constructive spirit, but given the urgent need to make progress, we must focus on ideas that are genuinely negotiable and have sufficient support in this house.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>Third, if these meetings yield such ideas, the government will then explore them with the European Union.</p> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, I want to end by offering two reassurances.</p> \n   <p>The first is to those who fear that the government\u2019s strategy is to run down the clock to 29 March. That is not our strategy. I have always believed that the best way forward is to leave in an orderly way with a good deal and have devoted much of the last two years negotiating such a deal. As you confirmed, Mr Speaker, the amendment to the business motion tabled last week by [Dominic Grieve] is not legally binding, but the government respects the will of the house. We will therefore make a statement about the way forward and table an amendable motion by Monday.</p> \n   <p>The second reassurance is to the British people, who voted to leave the European Union in the referendum two and a half years ago. I became prime minister immediately after that referendum. I believe it is my duty to deliver on their instruction and I intend to do so. </p> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancour. The government has heard what the house has said tonight, but I ask members on all sides of the house to listen to the British people, who want this issue settled, and to work with the government to do just that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-15T20:16:57.213Z\">at 8.16pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c3e3cabe4b0649df24d23dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-15T20:04:39.829Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from<strong> Jean-Claude Juncker</strong>, president of the European commission.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JunckerEU/status/1085263377411145728\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HouseofCommons?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HouseofCommons</a> this evening.

But tonight we expected to find that what parliament chooses doesn\u2019t match what the government has already chosen. And both the legislature and the executive are trying implement what the public chose in a crude, binary referendum that subverted the normal system of parliamentary democracy. It\u2019s all a horrible mess, and quite where it will end up remains anyone\u2019s guess.</p> \n  <p><strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the Brexiter environment secretary, was on the Today programme earlier making a last-minute bid to persuade MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and he argued that, if it passes, there will be an opportunity to \u201cimprove\u201d Brexit in the next stage of the talks (the trade negotiations due to start after the EU has left). He told the programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m saying [to MPs] look fairly at this deal. This is the door through which we can walk in order to ensure that we are outside the European Union and we can determine our future ... This deal is stage one. We can improve this process because in stage two, as we negotiate the final status of our trade and other relationships with the European Union, we can choose, and we are in a stronger position. That is the critical question which faces the House of Commons today. Do we walk through that door? Or do we lock it? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also invoked the Game of Thrones to convey a sense of how awful it would be if May\u2019s deal were voted down.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think if we don\u2019t vote for the deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow, \u201cwinter is coming.\u201d I think if we don\u2019t vote for the deal tonight we will do damage to our democracy by saying to people that we are not going to implement Brexit, and the opportunity that all of us have to live up to our democratic obligations is clear. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(If you\u2019re not familiar with it, Game of Thrones is an epic TV drama in which a bunch of mostly sociopathic members of the ruling class constantly feud with each other, resulting in them wrecking havoc on a country loosely modelled on the UK.

      "bodyText": "This blog continues with Wednesday\u2019s developments here: We\u2019re going to close the live blog for the day. Tomorrow is shaping up to be another dramatic day in the crazy world that is UK politics, as MPs vote on the no confidence motion proposed by Jeremy Corbyn. We will be back with all the news and updates. I\u2019ll be launching an early-morning blog at about 5:30am, so get some rest, and see you back here in a few hours. As always, thanks for following on. Press Association has this helpful guide to the motion of no-confidence, tabled by Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to force a general election, which is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. It is the first time the procedure has been used under the provisions of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act passed by the coalition government under David Cameron. This is how it will work: Mr Corbyn will move the motion tabled in his name as Leader of the Opposition and will speak first in the debate scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The Prime Minister will then speak for the government and at the end of proceedings at 7pm MPs will vote. If the government wins there will not be a general election and ministers will carry on in office. If the government loses, the Act states there must be an \u201cearly\u201d election unless the government can regain the confidence of the House by winning a confidence vote within 14 days. During that two-week period there is no statutory limit on how many times a confidence motion can be brought forward and voted on. In the course of that period the opposition may seek to form alliances within the Commons to demonstrate they are the party most likely to command the confidence of the House and therefore should be given the opportunity to form a government. The front page of the papers are in and they are not good for Theresa May. The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic Sun front page. \u201cBrextinct\u201d, is their headline, as they paste May\u2019s face onto a dodo. \u201cDismay,\u201d says the Express. \u201cA complete humiliation,\u201d says the Telegraph. \u201cNo deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence,\u201d says the Mirror. Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: \u201cFighting for her life\u201d. And while we\u2019re on the subject, the agenda for parliamentary business in the House of Commons tomorrow is quite remarkable. Dominic Grieve, former attorney-general and advocate of a second referendum, will present two bills to parliament tomorrow regarding another referendum on the subject of \u201cthe United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union\u201d. This will happen sometime after 12:30pm. Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who has said he will do what it takes to stop a no-deal Brexit, has this dire diagnosis of what went down today. In a long thread, Boles \u2013 who earlier today tweeted that someone had threatened to burn down his house \u2013 said May \u201chas approached the Brexit negotiation as if she commanded a majority of 150 in the Commons. She has conducted the argument as if this was a party political matter rather than a question of profound national importance of legitimate concern to all MPs.\u201d He urged her to work with opposition MPs to reach a \u201csoft Brexit like that offered by Common Market 2.0 \u2013 or what Michel Barnier calls Norway Plus\u201d. Earlier tonight, thousands of people in favour of a second referendum marched on Parliament Square, where they watching the thumping defeat of Theresa May\u2019s deal broadcast on large screens. The former Maryland congressman John Delaney has become the first 2020 presidential candidate to weigh in on Theresa May\u2019s resounding Brexit defeat in parliament on Tuesday. In a statement to the Guardian, Delaney, a former businessman and centrist Democrat mounting a dark horse bid for the White House in 2020, said: \u201cThe truth is Brexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now. \u201cLeaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second.\u201d Read the full story here: Good evening politics fans, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. After such a dramatic day and with so much about Britain\u2019s future up in the air, I think Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, speaks for us all when she says: Huq has since confirmed the post was \u201cunintentionally tweeted\u201d, but intended or not, it feels like a tweet that speaks to the moment. The chairman and vice chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting Leave Means Leave group, John Longworth and Richard Tice, have released this statement: Quite rightly, MPs have rejected the worst deal in history. The PM should accept this was a bad deal and stick to her words: No deal is better than a bad deal. Let\u2019s go to WTO and save \u00a339billion and be free. The figure they refer to is that which the UK and EU have agreed the former should pay in part in order to honour commitments it made while still a member of the bloc. Earlier, we made brief mention of the reaction of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Here\u2019s his full statement: I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening. On the EU side, the process of ratification of the withdrawal agreement continues. The withdrawal agreement is a fair compromise and the best possible deal. It reduces the damage caused by Brexit for citizens and businesses across Europe. It is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The European commission and, notably, our chief negotiator Michel Barnier [have]has invested enormous time and effort to negotiate the withdrawal agreement. We have shown creativity and flexibility throughout. I, together with president Tusk, have demonstrated goodwill again by offering additional clarifications and reassurances in an exchange of letters with Prime Minister May earlier this week. The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening\u2019s vote. While we do not want this to happen, the European commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared. I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has moved quickly to quell business anger over the failure of May to get the deal ratified. All the main business groups, including the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and dozens of chief executives, were on the conference call at 9pm, in which Hammond expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the result. One source on the call said it was \u201cconstructive\u201d; that the \u201ctone was realistic\u201d about the damage this was inflicting on the economy. However, he was hammered by business leaders over parliament\u2019s refusal to take no deal off the table. \u201cThis was the single biggest question he was asked,\u201d said the source just hours after the CBI, the BCC, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses called on the government to urgently remove that option for the sake of Britain. Also on the call were the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. A source said: They were also asked about the extension of article 50 but immediately took that out of the conversation by saying that can only happen if we put forward an alternative. The majority of questions were round no deal. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is following the Labour party line that a second referendum should follow any failure to secure a general election: MPs have done the right thing tonight by rejecting the government\u2019s bad Brexit deal. MPs from all political parties realised that this deal would worsen life chances and reduce opportunities for future generations in London and across the UK. What happens next will define our future for decades to come. It is absolutely vital that the prime minister acts immediately to take any prospect of a no-deal Brexit off the table for good. That means withdrawing article 50. We then need a fundamental rethink about how we take this crucial decision. The politicians have failed and, in the absence of a general election, the British public must be allowed to decide what happens next. We\u2019re getting some more reaction to this evening\u2019s vote and where it leaves us from senior figures in Westminster. The Conservative backbencher and former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has told BBC Radio 5 Live: It\u2019s a very strange experience to be a backbench MP and participate in a huge rebellion against the government that defeats it by such a substantial margin. But that\u2019s a reflection of the fact that the House of Commons collectively looked at the deal the government has negotiated and concluded that it\u2019s a deal which is not in the national interest. Now that\u2019s not the prime minister\u2019s fault in my view \u2013 we would have had a different leader and a different prime minister and we\u2019d have still ended up with the same deal \u2013 the problem is the direct result and consequence of the Brexit decision. Any deal, I believe, is going to be an unsatisfactory one as viewed by the Commons. Either my ERG colleagues say that it doesn\u2019t fulfil their dreams of what Brexit was supposed to be about, or people like me look at it and say: \u2018But this is a third-rate future for our country and frankly we would be much better staying in\u2019. I have always argued for a further referendum because I believe that it is the only way out and, in doing that, I am respectful of the fact that the electorate might turn around and say: \u2018Oh no, we want to leave on the prime minister\u2019s deal\u2019. Many are looking ahead to tomorrow\u2019s debate on the no-confidence motion tabled by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, following the vote. His party colleague and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has tweeted: The Tory chancellor, Philip Hammond, posted: Also speaking to 5 Live, the Labour MP, Stephen Doughty, backed a second referendum if the party fails to secure a general election, saying: Labour has a very clear position that was set out in our conference and agreed unanimously by our Labour members and backed by Labour voters as well, which is that we were going to vote down the deal if it didn\u2019t meet the tests, call for a general election and remove the government. If that doesn\u2019t go through, it is very clear that we would have to put this to a public vote. I actually think that is a much bigger thing than Labour policy. I think it\u2019s the right thing to do because ... the reality is that people have changed their minds and have a right in a democracy to look at something, to look at facts and then to make a different decision. And Tory backbencher Paul Scully told the station: Clearly, it didn\u2019t exactly go that well. The only good news is that it didn\u2019t take me that long to vote. At the end of the day, what we need to do now is get through the no-confidence motion tomorrow, which I don\u2019t expect to succeed. The prime minister has said that she\u2019s going to speak to senior parliamentarians, to the DUP, to the Conservative party and see what will fly. Then she needs to go back to the EU and say: \u2018Look, see, I told you so. There\u2019s your benchmark, now you\u2019ve got to actually shift\u2019. The problem with speaking to Jeremy Corbyn is that, frankly, if Jeremy Corbyn actually had a plan, given it to the prime minister and put it to a vote, he would have still voted against. That all he is interested in is this general election. As Macron has hinted, however, sympathy among senior political figures on the continent for the view that the EU needs, for its own good, to accommodate the UK\u2019s internal politics may be running short. Prior to the vote, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders\u2019 chief executive, Mike Hawes, urged MPs to take no-deal off the table. After parliamentarians rejected May\u2019s deal, he added: The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the no-deal cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry. Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk. No-deal must be avoided at all costs. Business needs certainty so we now need politicians to do everything to prevent irreversible damage to this vital sector. Earlier, we noted that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had repeated the EU had gone \u201cas far as it could\u201d on the Brexit negotiations. Here\u2019s some more detail on his reaction to this evening\u2019s vote: First option, they go towards a no deal ... That\u2019s scary for everybody. The first losers in this would be the British. Second option, they tell us \u2013 in my view, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do, I know them a bit \u2013 \u2018We\u2019ll try to improve what we can get from the Europeans and we\u2019ll go back for a vote\u2019. In that case, we\u2019ll look into it. Maybe we\u2019ll make improvements on one or two things but I don\u2019t really think so because we\u2019ve reached the maximum of what we could do with the deal and we won\u2019t, just to solve Britain\u2019s domestic political issues, stop defending European interests. Of an eventual third option, he said: In my view, they\u2019ll start with the second option and then we\u2019ll eventually end up with the third: \u2018Actually, we\u2019re going to take more time to renegotiate something\u2019 ... It creates a great deal of uncertainty and worries. Theresa May has sustained the heaviest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister in the democratic era after MPs rejected her Brexit deal by a resounding majority of 230. You can read details of how MPs voted here. May has said she will hold cross-party talks with MPs about a new approach \u2013 but she has not said what this might involve, and Brexiters and pro-Europeans both seem to think that tonight\u2019s result could increase their chances of securing the sort of Brexit they want. They can\u2019t both be right, and at this point there is no consensus at all about what impact the vote will have on the Brexit outcome. Campaigners for a second referendum were thrilled by the result, because they believe a people\u2019s vote now more likely. But the constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor thinks a no-deal Brexit is now more probable (see 9.35pm), and the DUP and Brexiters such as Boris Johnson (see 9.17pm) think the Commons decision will enable May to take a tougher line in talks with Brussels. May must decide whether she wants to tack towards those Tories who favour a harder Brexit or a \u201cmanaged no deal\u201d, perhaps cushioned by an extension to article 50 that would allow more time for no-deal planning, or towards a softer Brexit in the form of a Norwegian-style deal. In her statement to MPs after the result (see 8.11pm) she said nothing about her Brexit red lines, and implied that she was leaning towards Norway by saying she wanted \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with Labour MPs. But she also said that any proposals must be \u201cgenuinely negotiable\u201d, and that she was committed to delivering on the result of the referendum. Given that any move towards a softer Brexit could provoke a further backlash from her own party, it is not obvious that these talks will succeed. Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a no-confidence motion in the government that will be debated tomorrow. But the DUP has said it will back the government, and not one Tory has said publicly that he or she will vote against May, meaning the government is almost certain to win. If that happens, Corbyn will come under intense pressure to commit Labour to voting for a second referendum, although there is little evidence that he is keen to move in that direction in a hurry. Donald Tusk has made a thinly veiled call for the UK to stay in the European Union. The European council president suggested on Twitter that the prime minister\u2019s historic loss in parliament left a deal looking \u201cimpossible\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. Germany\u2019s vice chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the vote was a \u201cbitter day for Europe\u201d. \u201cWe are well prepared - but a hard Brexit would be the least attractive choice, for the EU and [Great Britain],\u201d said Scholz, who is also finance minister. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU party and her likely successor, tweeted that she \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d the British decision. \u201cA disorderly no-deal Brexit will be the worst of all options,\u201d she said, urging the British people to \u201cnot rush\u201d into anything. In France, President Emmanuel Macron repeated that the EU had gone \u201cas far as it could\u201d, while the Spanish government said in a statement it regretted \u201cthe negative result\u201d but it still hoped the deal would win approval, adding that a no-deal exit would hit the EU but be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the UK. These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Vernon Bogdanor, the politics professor and constitutional expert, has told Sky News that he thinks tonight\u2019s vote make a no-deal Brexit more likely than a second referendum. He pointed out that the Commons has already passed legislation saying the UK will be leaving the EU on 29 March. Holding a second referendum would be very difficult, he said, because the government would have to pass legislation, and Brexiters would \u201cfight it tooth and nail\u201d. He went on: There are about 40 odd sitting days left till March 29. If no other statute is passed, we leave without a deal. I take the view ... that the vote tonight makes a no-deal departure more likely than a second referendum. My colleague Joseph Harker has written a column saying that Theresa May has turned the UK into a laughing stock and that she should go. Here is an extract: After her devastating defeat, Theresa May tried gamely to set out her agenda for the next few weeks. Right now, for Britain\u2019s sake, May\u2019s only plan should be to leave office. To unblock the political gridlock, there has to be another leader: one who can negotiate afresh with Europe and who can call an election to try to win a majority for whatever they agree. May\u2019s reputation is shot. Regardless of whether she cobbles together enough support to see off Labour\u2019s vote of no confidence tomorrow, she must go. Business leaders are unanimous in their dismay at the vote and the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal. The Federation of Small Businesses said many of its members would struggle to survive should deadlock in parliament lead to the country crashing out of the EU. \u201cIt is vital that there is a transition period, to give smaller firms time to adapt to whatever the final outcome turns out to be,\u201d said Mike Cherry, the head of the FSB. He went on: Small business confidence has plummeted to its lowest point since the wake of the financial crash. Four in 10 expect performance to worsen over this quarter, two thirds are not planning to increase capital investment, and a third see lack of the right skills as a barrier to growth. That\u2019s what political uncertainty does to business: it makes it impossible to plan, innovate and expand. He was joined by the leader of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn and the boss of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, along with leaders of the retail industry and the City in condemning the failure to secure a compromise agreement that allows firms access to the EU customs union. Echoing the line taken by the DUP (see 8.44pm), Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, told the BBC that the result of the vote gave Theresa May a \u201cmassive mandate\u201d to go back to Brussels and renegotiate. He insisted that no-deal was \u201cnot at all\u201d off the table, saying: We should not only be keeping the good bits of the deal, getting rid of the backstop, but we should also be actively preparing for no-deal with ever more enthusiasm. And he claimed May\u2019s leadership was not an issue. Asked if she was the right person to lead the party and the country, he said: The Tory party had a go at all that, we all had a go at all that in December. That is not the issue. The issue is not who does it, the issue is what to do. Downing Street said the cross-party talks on how to take Brexit forward promised by Theresa May in her statement to MPs (see 8.11am) should start as \u201cswiftly as possible\u201d once the vote of confidence was out of the way. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We want to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the house consistent with what we believe to be the result of the referendum. We want to leave with a deal and we want to work with others who share that. The spokesman declined to be drawn on whether the talks would include Jeremy Corbyn. On this point, he said: Let\u2019s not pre-empt talks before they have happened. We will look to engage widely with people we believe share our objectives. Here is a rare picture of MPs in the no lobby voting against the government tonight. Photography is not normally allowed in the division lobbies, but several MPs have been tweeting pictures this evening. I flagged up some earlier. Here are some more. From Labour\u2019s Debbie Abrahams From Labour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle From the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas Tom Pursglove has said he resigned as a Conservative party vice-chair in order to vote against the Brexit deal. Lord Mandelson, the Labour pro-European, former cabinet minister and former European commissioner, has just told Sky News he is taking it for granted that article 50 will have to be extended. Here is my colleague Jonathan Freedland\u2019s verdict on the result. This has been Britain\u2019s European story, repeatedly seeing what was a project of peace, designed to end centuries of bloodshed, as a scam designed to swindle the Brits of their money. You can go further back, to repeated wars against the French, the Spanish and the Germans. Or you can go further back still to the first Brexit nearly five centuries ago, when Henry VIII sought to take back control by breaking from Rome. Wherever you choose the starting point, the end point is clear enough. It ends like this, in the sight of a parliament paralysed by indecision, still unable to embrace Europe \u2013 but just as unable to break away. And in the spectacle of an island lost and adrift. This is from RTE\u2019s Jon Williams. Currency traders are making the same assessment about the impact of this result as the People\u2019s Vote campaigners. (See 8.35pm.) Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has welcomed the result of tonight\u2019s vote. In a statment she said: By rejecting the withdrawal agreement, parliament has acted in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom. The House of Commons has sent an unmistakable message to the prime minister and the European Union that this deal is rejected. Mrs May will now be able to demonstrate to the Brussels\u2019 negotiators that changes are required if any deal is to command the support of parliament ... Reassurances whether in the form of letters or warm words, will not be enough. The prime minister must now go back to the European Union and seek fundamental change to the withdrawal agreement. A source from the European Research Group, which is chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg and which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, says of course they will vote for Theresa May in the confidence motion \u2013 even though they were prominent in voting against the deal tonight. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the SNP supports Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s confidence motion. Describing the vote as \u201ca defeat of historic proportions for the prime minister and her government\u201d, Sturgeon said: It has been crystal clear for months that the prime minister\u2019s approach was heading for a crushing defeat. Instead of facing up to that fact, she wasted valuable time with her postponement of the meaningful vote in December. There is no more time to waste. She went on to call for the article 50 process to be halted \u201curgently\u201d and that legislation be brought to hold a second referendum on EU membership. Sturgeon added: The SNP supports the tabled vote of no-confidence in the government \u2013 but regardless of who leads the government, the reality is that a second EU referendum, with the option of remain on the ballot paper, is now the only credible option to avoid untold damage to the economy and the prospects of future generations. It is also the only option, within the UK, that would allow Scotland\u2019s democratic wish to remain in Europe to be respected. Here is some footage from the People\u2019s Vote rally at Westminster, showing what happened when the result of the vote was announced. Campaigners are cheering because they think the result increases the chances of Brexit being cancelled, or at least being made much softer. That is probably a fair assessment, although it would be a mistake to think that this vote comes anything close to settling the issue, and what will happen next remains very uncertain. UPDATE: Reading this a couple of hours later, I think it would be more accurate to say that this might turn out to be a fair assessment. Equally, it might turn out be be premature optimism. Basically, no one knows, and I don\u2019t think you can call it either way with confidence. Here are the figures for how the parties voted on Theresa May\u2019s deal: For the deal \u2013 202 Conservatives: 196 Labour: 3 (Ian Austin, Sir Kevin Barron and John Mann) Independents: 3 (Frank Field, Lady Hermon, and Stephen Lloyd) Against the deal \u2013 432 Labour: 248 Conservatives: 118 SNP: 35 Lib Dems: 11 DUP: 10 Independents: 5 (Kelvin Hopkins, Ivan Lewis, Jared O\u2019Mara, Fiona Onasanya, and John Woodcock) Plaid Cymru: 4 Greens: 1 Majority against \u2013 230 Tonight\u2019s defeat is the biggest government defeat in the democratic era. This graphic shows some of the others, for comparison. The DUP has confirmed that it will vote for the government in the no-confidence motion, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s statement to MPs about 20 minutes ago about what will happen next. She said: Mr Speaker, the house has spoken and the government will listen. It is clear that the house does not support this deal. But tonight\u2019s vote tells us nothing about what it does support. Nothing about how \u2013 or even if \u2013 it intends to honour the decision the British people took in a referendum parliament decided to hold. People, particularly EU citizens who have made their home here and UK citizens living in the EU, deserve clarity on these questions as soon as possible. Those whose jobs rely on our trade with the EU need that clarity. So with your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to set out briefly how the government intends to proceed. First, we need to confirm whether this government still enjoys the confidence of the house. I believe that it does, but given the scale and importance of tonight\u2019s vote it is right that others have the chance to test that question if they wish to do so. I can therefore confirm that if the official opposition table a confidence motion this evening in the form required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the government will make time to debate that motion tomorrow. And if, as happened before Christmas, the official opposition decline to do so, we will \u2013 on this occasion - consider making time tomorrow to debate any motion in the form required from the other opposition parties, should they put one forward. Second, if the house confirms its confidence in this government I will then hold meetings with my colleagues, our confidence and supply partner the DUP and senior parliamentarians from across the house to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the house. The government will approach these meetings in a constructive spirit, but given the urgent need to make progress, we must focus on ideas that are genuinely negotiable and have sufficient support in this house. Third, if these meetings yield such ideas, the government will then explore them with the European Union. Mr Speaker, I want to end by offering two reassurances. The first is to those who fear that the government\u2019s strategy is to run down the clock to 29 March. That is not our strategy. I have always believed that the best way forward is to leave in an orderly way with a good deal and have devoted much of the last two years negotiating such a deal. As you confirmed, Mr Speaker, the amendment to the business motion tabled last week by [Dominic Grieve] is not legally binding, but the government respects the will of the house. We will therefore make a statement about the way forward and table an amendable motion by Monday. The second reassurance is to the British people, who voted to leave the European Union in the referendum two and a half years ago. I became prime minister immediately after that referendum. I believe it is my duty to deliver on their instruction and I intend to do so. Mr Speaker, every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancour. The government has heard what the house has said tonight, but I ask members on all sides of the house to listen to the British people, who want this issue settled, and to work with the government to do just that. This is from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission. A spokesman for the European council president, Donald Tusk, said: We regret the outcome of the vote, and urge the UK government to clarify its intentions with respect to next steps as soon as possible. The EU27 will remain united and responsible as we have been throughout the entire process and will seek to reduce the damage caused by Brexit. We will continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. The risk of a disorderly exit has increased with this vote, and while we do not want this to happen, we will be prepared for it. We will continue the EU\u2019s process of ratification of the agreement reached with the UK government. This agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just told MPs that the Commons will vote on the no confidence motion at 7pm tomorrow. One hundred and 18 Conservatives voted against the government on Brexit. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has the figures, from the CommonsVotes app. In the Commons, the Labour MP Yvette Cooper asks John Bercow what MPs can be done to ensure article 50 is extended. Bercow says, if MPs call for a vote, he will ensure it happens. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has posted this on Twitter. He seems to be urging the UK to consider cancelling Brexit. Philippa Whitford, the SNP MP, and a doctor, says it is \u201cshocking\u201d that Tulip Siddiq had to delay a caesarean section today, against the advice of her doctors, because the Commons does not allow proxy voting for MPs in her position. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he said yesterday that that was \u201clamentable\u201d, and that he is happy to say that again. Here is the no-confidence motion. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, tries to make a business statement, but John Bercow, the Speaker, wants to take points of order first. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the SNP will support the no-confidence motion. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says this was the biggest defeat for a government since the 1920s. He says the government has consistently failed to reach out to other parties. He says the government should accept that the UK will stay in the customs union for good, that a no-deal Brexit is not an option and that the rights of EU nationals will be accepted. He says he has tabled a motion of no confidence. It will be debated tomorrow, he says, so MPs can express their views about the incompetence of the government. Theresa May is making a statement to MPs now. She says the result tells us what MPs do not want, but not what they want. She says she will first ensure MPs can see if they still have confidence in the government. If Jeremy Corbyn tables a no-confidence motion, it will get debated tomorrow. And if he does not, the government will allow other opposition parties to table a motion. May says MPs will get the chance to debate a motion of no-confidence tomorrow. She says she will then hold talks with the other parties to see what solution might be acceptable. And she says she will go back to the EU to consider new plans. May says she will hold talks with the opposition parties about an alternative Brexit approach. Theresa May\u2019s plan has been rejected by votes to 432 votes to 202 \u2013 a majority of 230. And these are from Labour\u2019s Ellie Reeves. These are from Labour\u2019s Faisal Rashid. And this is from Labour\u2019s Khalid Mahmood. And this is from Labour\u2019s Thelma Walker. The SNP\u2019s Carol Monaghan has tweeted this from the no lobby. The size of the government victory on the John Baron amendment (see 7.24pm) should not be read as an indication that only 24 MPs are worried about the backstop. Instead, it is probably better to view it a sign that many MPs were unhappy with Baron for pushing his amendment to a vote when there seems to be a clear desire in the house to get on with the vote on the main motion. MPs are now voting on the main motion. For the record, this is what it says. That this House approves for the purposes of section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, the negotiated withdrawal agreement laid before the House on Monday 26 November 2018 with the title \u2018Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\u2019 and the framework for the future relationship laid before the House on Monday 26 November 2018 with the title \u2018Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom\u2019. MPs have voted down the John Baron amendment saying the UK should have a unilateral right to terminate the backstop by 600 votes to 24 \u2013 a majority of 576. Here is a picture of the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq voting in a wheelchair. She has postponed giving birth by caesarean section to vote. The most significant thing Theresa May said in her speech was what she said to Edward Leigh. (See 6.52pm.) This is what she told him when he asked if she would be supporting his amendment, which would set a deadline for the backstop. (See 2.47pm.) The government isn\u2019t able to to accept the amendment that has been selected tonight, because we have a different opinion and a different interpretation of the Vienna convention. But I note that my right honourable friend has put down alternative proposals in relation to this issue. The government is willing to look at creative solutions and it will be happy to carry on working with [Leigh] in relation to that particular issue. By \u201calternative proposals\u201d, May was referring to Leigh\u2019s amendment r on the order paper (pdf), which has not been called. I won\u2019t post it in full here, because it is very long, but you can read it on the order paper. Jeremy Corbyn is not the biggest fan of the Fleet Street press, but another consequence of his decision to pull his votes, and accelerating the voting process tonight, is that it will be a lot easier for London newspapers to get stories about the result of the main vote into their first editions. May has finished. John Bercow invites Jeremy Corbyn to move his amendment. He does not move it. He turns to Ian Blackford. He also decides not to move his amendment. He turns to Edward Leigh. Leigh says, in the light of the positive response he got from May (see 6.52pm), he will not move it. He turns to John Baron and invites him to press his amendment. Baron says he does want a vote. Bercow takes the vote by acclamation (asking MPs to cry \u201caye\u201d and \u201cno\u201d.) At first he says the noes have it. But Baron and his supporters persist, and Bercow calls a division. MPs are now voting on the Baron amendment. Labour, the SNP and Edward Leigh have all pulled their amendments \u2013 meaning voting tonight will be speeded up. The main vote will now come at 7.15pm, with the result at about 7.30pm. This will save us all 45 minutes, and will have no effect on the overall result. Corbyn may have decided to pull his vote perhaps because he realises there will be a lot more interest in what happens next. May says MPs are there to serve the people who queued up to vote in the referendum and who put their faith in politicians. She says they have a sacred right to see MPs act in their best interests. She says, with a solemn heart, MPs must discharge their responsibilities. May says a vote against her deal is a vote for \u201cuncertainty, division and the very real risk of no deal\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford intervenes. He says all the studies show Brexit will make the UK poorer. Will the government extend article 50 and give the people a choice? May says MPs were clear that the result of the referendum would be respected. She repeats the line about a vote against the deal being a vote for \u201cuncertainty, division and the very real risk of no deal\u201d. May says Corbyn\u2019s speech was like his whole approach to Brexit, \u201clong on critcism, short on coherence\u201d. She mocks the idea that he would be able to get a renegotiation in weeks. She says that in its 2017 election manifesto, Labour said free movement would end. Yet at the weekend, Corbyn said he was not against free movement. She says he is against no deal. But he is also against the backstop, without which there is no deal, she says. She says Corbyn has pursued a cynical course. He has forfeited the right to demand loyalty from Labour MPs who take a more pragmatic view. She says she hopes that MPs opposed to no deal, whose constituents rely on manufacturing jobs, should think hard about rejecting her deal. May appeals to Labour MPs to abandon their loyalty to Corbyn and back her deal for the sake of their constituents. Sir Edward Leigh intervenes. He says MPs are worried about the backstop. Will the government support his amendment? May says the government is not able to support this amendment. But she praises Leigh for the work he has done on this issue and says the government is willing to look at alternative, \u201ccreative solutions\u201d to this problem. She suggests a second Leigh amendment on the order paper, which is not being put to a vote tonight (amendment r) could provide a guide to the way forward. May says, having rejected all the other options, only one remains: voting for this deal. She says if the UK leaves with this deal, it can build a better future. She says as PM she would not recommend a course of action not in the country\u2019s best interest. May goes on: The government will work harder at taking parliament with us. This provokes loud jeering. In the next phase of the talks, it will work with parliament on its plans. May says some people think that, by voting down this deal, they can get the government to go back to Brussels to get a better one. But the EU is not going to reopen talks, she says. May refers to Corbyn\u2019s call for a general election. But this is about what is best for the country, not what is best for Labour. And she says that, after an election, the choices facing the country would remain the same. She says people could show their support for a second referendum in the 2017 general election by voting Lib Dem. But only 7% of people did. May says the Commons voted to give the public the right to decide if the UK stayed in the EU. Four hundred and 30 current MPs voted to hold that referendum; only 32 voted against. The turnout in the referendum was high, and the result was clear, she says. And then 436 MPs voted to trigger article 50. Only 85 MPs voted against, she says. She says MPs have a duty to deliver on the democratic wishes of the British people. A second referendum would create further disunity. There would be no agreement on the question, let alone on the answer, she says. And she rejects a no-deal. There would be no implementation period, with no reciprocal protection for the rights of citizens. No-deal would mean no security partnership with the EU. She says her deal provides the basis for a long-term economic partnership with the EU. It would be more ambitious than any other the EU has. A no-deal Brexit would put that at risk. She says, while the UK could manage with a no-deal Brexit, it would be wrong to describe this as the best outcome. Theresa May stands up, to loud and sustained applause from Conservatives. (Note to readers unfamiliar with the loyalty of British parliamentarians: this does not mean she is going to win the vote.) Corbyn says under this government more people are living in poverty. Some Tories seem to protest, presumably because Corbyn is moving off the topic of Brexit, but he pushes back, saying they should not respond like that to half a million more children being in poverty. We need to keep in mind that the vast majority of people in our country don\u2019t think of themselves remainers or leavers. Whether they voted leave or remain two and a half years ago, they are concerned about their future. So Mr Speaker, I hope tonight that this house votes down this deal and then we move to a general election. Corbyn says a general election would give a new government a mandate to break the deadlock in the Brexit talks. Corbyn has a message for the EU. The overwhelming majority of this house voted to respect the result of the referendum, and therefore to trigger article 50. So I say this to our negotiating partners in the EU: if parliament votes down this deal, then reopening negotiations should not, and cannot, be ruled out. Corbyn says the EU should agree to reopen Brexit talks if MPs vote down Theresa May\u2019s deal. Corbyn say many Tories will vote with Labour against the deal. And he is glad a majority of MPs are against a no-deal Brexit. But it is not enough for this house to vote against the deal before us and against no-deal. We also have to be for something. So, Mr Speaker, in the coming days it is vital that this house has the opportunity to debate and vote on the way forward, to consider all the options available. Corbyn says there is no clarity about the future in the future partnership document. The former Brexit secretary \u2013 one of the former Brexit secretaries \u2013 promised a \u201cdetailed\u201d, \u201cprecise\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d document. The government spectacularly failed to deliver it. So I confirm that Labour will vote against this deal tonight because it is a bad deal for the country. Corbyn says jobs are at risk. He says the withdrawal agreement is \u201ca reckless leap in the dark\u201d. Under this deal, in December 2020 we will be faced with a choice: either pay more and extend the transition period, or lock us into the backstop. At that point, the UK would be over a barrel. We would have left the EU, have lost the UK rebate, and be forced to pay whatever was demanded. Alternatively, the backstop would come into force; an arrangement for which there is no time limit or end point. It locks Britain into a deal from which it cannot leave without the agreement of the EU. This is unprecedented in British history. The last two years gives us no confidence that this government can do a deal in under two years. So, at some point before December 2020, the focus would then inevitably shift from negotiations on the future relationship, to negotiations on an extension to the transition period including negotiating what further payments we should make to the EU. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now, winding up for the opposition. He says this has been one of the most chaotic times he has experienced as an MP. The government has been held in contempt by parliament. It has lost a vote on the finance bill for the first time since the 1970s. And Theresa May pulled a vote on her Brexit deal, meaning they are voting almost a month after the debate started. May is so desperate she has now discovered the importance of trade unions, he says. He says the problem is that May has treated this as a Conservative party problem. After the 2017 election, May could have reached out to trade unions and to the opposition. And she could have listened to business. They would have told her it was best to keep the UK in the customs union for good (Labour\u2019s policy). From ITV\u2019s Angus Walker Matt Warman, the Tory MP for Boston and Skegness, says his was the most pro-Brexit constituency. If Brexit is not delivered, it will be hard to argue that the UK is a democracy, he claims. He will vote with the PM tonight, because he is committed to Brexit. He says voting against the deal will \u201cput winds in the sails of those who are seeking to stop it\u201d. He says the risk of being stuck in the backstop is smaller than the risk of Brexit not happening. Advance warning that he is going to table a no confidence motion? From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Mike Wood, a Conservative, tells the Commons he expected to resign as a PPS today so he could vote against the deal. But he now fears Brexit could be stopped if the deal is defeated. So he will be voting with the government, he says. He says he does not want to see Brexit \u201cstolen\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry says it is clear that Scotland was lied to during the 2014 independence referendum. Scotland was told it would be an equal partner with England, and that if it stayed in the UK, it would stay in the EU. Both were not true. Now she wants a second referendum on Brexit, and on Scottish independence, she says. My colleague Peter Walker thinks some of the pro-Brexit campaigners outside the Houses of Parliament need to learn their history. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. Caroline Johnson, a Conservative, said she would be supporting the deal. She said those in favour of Brexit had the odds against them; it was like being one player down, 10 against 11, with a referee who was taking sides. After she finished, John Bercow, the Speaker, intervened angrily to say that he was not biased, that he had chaired every hour of the debate, and that he had done his best to ensure every MP had their say. Sir Hugo Swire, a Conservative, told MPs in the debate that he would be voting against Theresa May\u2019s deal. He says he cannot accept the idea of the UK being trapped in the backstop. Speaking at the rally outside the Houses of Parliament, David Lammy, the Labour MP who is a pro-European figurehead, raised the spectre of racism and Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment immigration regime as he condemned the entire move towards leaving of the European Union. He said: It\u2019s on Westminster. We are going to get this and it\u2019s down to you. Are you listening in there, Theresa May? Are you listening, Jeremy Corbyn? We want a people\u2019s vote and we want it now, yes? Friends, in just a few hours this disastrous deal will be voted down and it will be voted down largely because after the referendum two and a half years ago people in this square and beyond, they didn\u2019t go home and mourn, they organised to take back their country, and I thank you for that. This is not a deal that gains sovereignty; it\u2019s a deal that gives up sovereignty. And that\u2019s why parliament will reject it. This is not a deal that opens us up to the world; this is a deal that will make us subservient to Donald Trump\u2019s USA, and that\u2019s why we reject it. This is a deal that harks back to those days of empire when people were shackled and ... black and brown people were subjugated. Leaving the European Union put the lives of foreign-born residents under threat, Lammy said. People like my parents who came to this country and took so little and gave so much. We reject this small-minded vision of our country, that would create a hostile environment for our friends from the European Union and charge them for the right to alongside their partners, their children, their loved ones and their friends \u2013 we reject that. Andrew Murrison, a Conservative, says he will be supporting the government because he is worried that, with all the \u201cchicanery\u201d going on in parliament, he thinks there is a risk Brexit might not happen. He says his amendment (the one not called by the Speaker, to some surprise) would have provided an assurance on the backstop. But he says the Leigh and Baron amendments (that will be put to a vote) achieve much the same effect. Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey says a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cutterly catastrophic\u201d for Britain. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says the only democratic, peaceful and consensual way through this \u201cappalling mess\u201d is to hold another referendum. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown tells MPs that, as a Brexiter, he will be voting for the deal. He is worried about Brexit being halted if Theresa May\u2019s deal is defeated, he says. But in return for voting for the deal, he wants the government to come back with a better deal. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. In the Commons debate, Crispin Blunt, a Tory Brexiter, is speaking now. He quotes from a Telegraph article (paywall) written by an anonymous civil servant saying the government is much better prepared for a no-deal Brexit than it admits. The civil servant said: An enormous effort by thousands of hardworking civil servants has been made to ensure that if we leave the EU without a deal, \u201ccrashing out\u201d over a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d is simply not going to be an option, and it is purely a political decision not to make this clear to the public and nervous backbench MPs. This is from the Times\u2019 Sam Coates. Here are two of the clearer and more comprehensible \u201cwhat happens next\u201d graphics available. This one\u2019s from the BBC. And this one\u2019s from Bloomberg. This is from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. The Conservative MP John Baron is speaking now, moving his amendment. (See 2.47pm.) He says that he accepts the need for compromise, but that he finds the backstop unacceptable. He says if the EU knows it cannot keep the UK in the backstop, it is more likely to offer the UK a good trade deal. If his amendment is not passed, he will vote against the government, he says. The SNP\u2019s Hannah Bardell says she studied alongside Erasmus students at university. She says what is happening to EU students under Brexit is a disgrace. Back in the debate, the Conservative MP Richard Bacon has just told MPs that he will vote against Theresa May\u2019s deal because it does not deliver Brexit. By 5pm, thousands had gathered in Parliament Square in front of a stage and two huge video screens for the live broadcast of the debate and vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. No-deal supporters were nowhere to be seen as Caroline Lucas made the first speech. She said: We\u2019ve got a really clear message for the prime minister and I hope she\u2019s listening, because our message is that we will not be blackmailed into accepting her dangerous blindfold Brexit deal. Our message is we reject her vision of a mean-minded little Britain with our borders closed. Our message is that we are going to stand up in particular for our young people who voted overwhelmingly to remain and who believe our future is in Europe. Across the road there are still far too many MPs who are playing political games, who are playing parlour games, and they are forgetting what\u2019s at stake: people\u2019s lives and people\u2019s livelihoods. One of the reasons we opposed Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is because we know that every single deal will make this country poorer. I have beefed up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes from the debate from the Press Association. But to get them to show up, you may need to refresh the page. The time limit on speeches is now down to three minutes. But the Tory Brexiter Julian Lewis needed only about 20 seconds. Asked to deliver his speech, he said because Brexit should mean Brexit, and because no deal was better than a bad deal, he would vote \u201cno, no, no\u201d. He was probably channelling Margaret Thatcher. UPDATE: Here is the Julian Lewis version. Nick Boles, the Conservative who has said he will do what it takes to stop a no-deal Brexit, has recorded another threat he has received. You can read the debate online here on the Hansard website. Transcripts go up about three hours after they have been delivered in the chamber. The whole of the Geoffrey Cox speech is now up, but nothing after that yet. Sir Edward Leigh, a Tory Brexiter, is speaking in the debate. He explains what his amendment would do. (See 2.47pm.) He says he does not accept that it would be counter to international law. The government could agree the withdrawal agreement, subject to a letter of reservation, he says. He says he has tried to cooperate with the government, and says he was disappointed by the way Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, slapped him down. (See 1.46pm.) Leigh says, if his amendment fails, he reserves the right to vote against the government. But he stresses that he does not want to be voting with people opposed to Brexit. He urges the government instead to back his plan. If it does, the Conservative party can unite behind that position, he says. I believe that what my amendment is trying to do is to achieve a compromise, to try and unite as many people as possible around a deal. I have to say that having done my level best to try and help the government to achieve this compromise. I am somewhat disappointed that the attorney general appears to have slapped it down following my intervention on him and therefore I do reserve the right if the government are not prepared to support this amendment in fact to vote against the main motion. Frank Field, the former Labour MP who sits as an independent, tells MPs that he has changed his mind, and that he will be supporting the deal. Field, who voted leave, says he is worried that if this deal gets voted down, Brexit could be lost. But he says he still believes there is a need for a Dardanelles-type inquiry into how the Brexit process has been handled so badly. I\u2019ve changed my mind because for all the weaknesses of this agreement the government has put forward to us, for all of its failings, I believe we now risk losing Brexit. That doesn\u2019t excuse the government for their incredible incompetence, it doesn\u2019t mean that some of us when this stage is over won\u2019t push for a Dardanelles type inquiry to find out why we landed at this late hour in this desperate position that we are. But I do not wish to live my time as an MP for Birkenhead aiding and abetting those whose real aim is to destroy Brexit. Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, says the Brexit deal is a terrible deal. And MPs should not be blackmailed into voting for it because of the threat of no deal as an alternative, she says. I would not for one moment say to... any of the other people with whom I have such huge disagreements on this side, that anybody is being in any way undemocratic tonight in voting against this deal. I know, although I don\u2019t agree with many of their reasons, that they are voting because they feel it\u2019s the right thing to do, they believe it\u2019s in the national interest and that must be right, Mr Speaker. It must also be wrong for anyone to vote in favour of this vote because they have in effect been blackmailed into thinking that the alternative is no deal - that is simply not the case. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy says it beggars belief that the government does not know what it wants. She proposes using a citizens\u2019 assembly to establish a plan acceptable to the public. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, says a no-deal Brexit is unacceptable. The EU will not re-open negotiations, he says. So the only option is a people\u2019s vote. Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, goes next. He starts by pointing out that it was the Lib Dems as a party who first demanded an in/out referendum on Europe, at the time of the Lisbon treaty. (Paterson is right. The Lib Dems, like the Conservatives, had been in favour of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. But when it looked as if the Labour government might actually lose a vote on a call for a referendum on the treaty, the then Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said there should be an in/out referendum on the EU instead. Clegg, a pro-European, managed through this ruse to sabotage the proposed Lisbon treaty referendum, but the Lib Dem support for an in/out referendum became a policy liability for the party.) UPDATE: A reader has been in touch to say the Lib Dems first backed an in/out referendum under Sir Menzies Campbell\u2019s leadership in 2007. But Nick Clegg did stick with the policy when he became leader, and he promoted it in early 2008 when it provided a reason for the Lib Dems not backing a Tory amendment calling for a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. I\u2019ve amended the paragraph above to reflect the fact that the policy changed under Campbell, not Clegg. This is from Alex Wickham, who has been counting potential Tory rebels for BuzzFeed. Justine Greening, the Conservative former education secretary, says it has been obvious since last summer that Theresa May would lose this vote. She says she thinks Brexit will have to be delayed, and calls for the people to get a vote. Turning away from the debate for a moment, the Vote Leave campaign group has lost its bid to bring a high court challenge against the Electoral Commission. As the Press Association reports, the group wanted to challenge the commission\u2019s decision to publish a report in July last year, following an investigation into spending by leave-supporting groups during the EU referendum campaign. The report said Vote Leave broke electoral law. Lawyers for Vote Leave argued there had been \u201creputational damage\u201d suffered by the group\u2019s officials as a result of the report being issued. But, following a hearing today, Mr Justice Swift refused permission for a judicial review, saying the publication of the report was within the commission\u2019s powers. In the debate, Ben Bradshaw, the Labour former cabinet minister, says he might have been willing to back a Norway option a year ago,but Theresa May has wasted time. Now he thinks the country needs a general election or a referendum. He says the country is facing an economic and constitutional crisis, and says he hopes that there will be a no-confidence vote tomorrow. The Press Association has more on the decision by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to return to Brussels for possible emergency talks tomorrow. (See 3.27pm.) The PA reports: Jean-Claude Juncker has pulled out of an event in Strasbourg on Wednesday because the Brexit vote in the Commons means he has to remain in Brussels, a European commissioner has said. The commission president had been due to take part in a debate on the future of Europe with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez but has been replaced by his deputy Frans Timmermans. Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, told a press conference today: \u201cPresident Juncker would have liked to have attended the debate, but the circumstances of it, which I am sure you are aware of, the vote in another country \u2026 I\u2019m talking about Brexit. \u201cPresident Juncker needed to be in Brussels and that is why Vice President Timmermans is standing in.\u201d The Daily Mirror is reporting that an RAF plane is on standby to take Theresa May to Brussels tomorrow for emergency talks. (Cynics point out that RAF planes are always on standby, for anything.) Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern says offering the public a choice as to whether the Brexit they are being offered matches the Brexit they were promised in the referendum is probably the only way forward. This is from the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins. Shailesh Vara, a Conservative, says he resigned as minister because of his opposition to Theresa May\u2019s deal. It is not a compromise, he says, it\u2019s a cave-in. And here is another line from Dominic Grieve. People\u2019s Vote and no-deal Brexit supporters were demonstrating side-by-side outside parliament as they joined forces to oppose Theresa May\u2019s apparently doomed deal to leave the European Union. Hundreds of demonstrators were standing in Parliament Square, outside the gates of the Palace of Westminster and by the College Garden, flying European flags and union flags, and placards calling for every kind of possible permutation of a deal, except the one arranged by the prime minister. Cars beeped their horns as they passed the groups standing on pavements. At one point, a phalanx of no-deal Brexit supporters marched into the middle of a group of remain campaigners and burned an EU flag. The scene was animated but peaceful. Alex Kay, 60, the mayor of Bradford on Avon, who stood with two friends on the green behind Westminster Abbey, said she hoped tonight\u2019s vote on whether to accept the deal would be \u201cthe beginning of the end of Brexit\u201d. Her friend Maria af Sanderberg, 47, a Swede who has lived in the UK for 20 years, said: It\u2019s astonishing that with this bad deal \u2013 which is much worse than staying in the EU \u2013 [May] has managed to unite the remainers and the brexiters against her, which is actually an irony of perfection. Closer to the gates of the palace, Philip Hodson, 60, from Newmarket in Suffolk, stood holding a placard reading: \u201cUphold our English constitution.\u201d \u201cI hope the outcome will be no deal, and that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should leave straight away and then Europe will come looking for us for a deal. The reason this deal should be thrown out is it\u2019s offering \u00a339bn to the EU for nothing. It\u2019s taking away our right to vote in the EU and our veto, while leaving us subject to its rules. That\u2019s why most remainers and leavers are together \u2026 Everybody recognises this is a terrible, terrible deal. A child could get a better deal. Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European who has been leading attempts to get parliament to block a no-deal Brexit, is speaking now. He says Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, referred to the withdrawal agreement as an \u201cairlock\u201d for the UK before it entered \u201cthe fields of ambrosia\u201d. Grieve says that he thinks, once the UK leaves the airlock, it is more likely the the UK will \u201cchoke to death\u201d. The analogy of the airlock in which we were assured that if we placed ourselves for a period of time in an uncomfortable position we find that door would open to the fields of ambrosia beyond, whereas I\u2019m afraid my own view is that we will either choke to death in the airlock as a nation or when the door finally opens we will find the landscape little to our liking. He says the UK has been living in a \u201cfools\u2019 paradise\u201d since the referendum. Where was the reference to the backstop during the referendum, he asks. He says that it is no surprise that only 20% of the public now favour Theresa May\u2019s deal. And he accuses Downing Street of briefing against him at the end of last week. No 10 claimed that Grieve was involved in a scheme promoted by Sir Oliver Letwin to change Commons procedural rules, despite the fact that he had no involvement, Grieve says. He restates his support for a second referendum and says that he is still getting death threats as a result of his stance against Brexit. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative pro-European, told MPs in her speech in the debate that, if Theresa May loses, she should abandon her plan. This is from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. Here is the Conservative MP Nick Boles having a dig at Dominic Raab. John Bercow, the speaker, has now imposed a five-minute time limit on speech. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is speaking now. He says Theresa May\u2019s deal would lead to the UK giving up control, and would precipitate a \u201cdemocratic cliff-edge\u201d. I\u2019ve always understood the case for compromise but compromise cannot come at any price. The deal before us involves the most severe and enduring risk for our economy our democracy, while stifling the opportunities of Brexit that fired up over 17m with optimism and hope to vote in June 2016. This deal is so demeaning to our country it would inevitably invite, no demand, reversal by the British people from the moment the ink was dry. It would torment us for the foreseeable future. If this deal is voted down we should make our best final offer, including an ability to exit the backstop and transition to a best in class free trade agreement and at the same time we must accelerate our preparations for leaving on WTO terms in case all reasonable offers are rebuffed in Brussels. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, has just finished his speech in the debate. He said he was willing to consider backing Theresa May until she published the details of her Chequers plan. He ended his speech saying if May lost she should consider her position. I would strongly urge the government, therefore, after this vote is cast tonight to conclude that enough is enough and that we have reached the journey\u2019s end. Now is the time to walk away from the intransigence of the EU and our failed policy of seeking to supplicate their guidelines, their terms and their paymasters. We witnessed similar events in May 1940 when the then prime minister actually won the vote on the Norway debate but on reflection concluded that he had to resign because he had lost the confidence of parliament as a whole. I believe,therefore, there are lessons in this for the prime minister to consider her position and to do so with dignity and without rancour. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, is speaking now. He says he thinks article 50 will have to be extended. He says the government should allow a series of votes to see if the Commons can agree a way forward. If that does not happen, then the only way forward will be to allow the public a vote, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, has just finished speaking. He said the SNP amendment (see 2.47pm) to the motion calls for article 50 to be extended. There is no such thing as a good Brexit. The government\u2019s own analysis and the analysis of the Scottish Government demonstrates in any of the Brexit scenarios that this country - the countries of Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales, will all be poorer under any of the Brexit scenarios than they would be under the status quo. This government stands accused of putting workers on the dole and putting workers on the dole as a function of ideology. Much of his speech was devoted to attacking Labour, and he criticised the party for not explicitly backing a second referendum. The party should \u201cget off the fence\u201d, he said. (Actually, the SNP amendment does not call for a second referendum either \u2013 even though the party now favours one. That is in line with the wishes of the People\u2019s Vote campaign. If the SNP amendment did not mention a second referendum, then the vote on it would become a second referendum vote. The People\u2019s Vote campaign does not want this matter to come to the floor of the Commons until it has the best chance of winning, and that would come after a decision by Labour to formally back the idea. That is why the Lib Dems are not making a fuss about their second referendum amendment not being called.) Blackford ended his speech by saying that the day would soon come when Scotland would vote to declare independence from the rest of the UK. Here is the full text of the amendments that will be put to a vote later. The Labour amendment (Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s) Line 1, leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and insert \u201cdeclines to approve the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and strong single market deal and would therefore lead to increased barriers to trade in goods and services, would not protect workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards, allows for the diminution of the United Kingdom\u2019s internal and external security and is likely to lead to the implementation of a backstop provision in Northern Ireland that is neither politically nor economically sustainable; declines to approve the United Kingdom\u2019s leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement; and therefore resolves to pursue every option that prevents the United Kingdom\u2019s either leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement or leaving on the basis of the negotiated withdrawal agreement laid before the House.\u201d The SNP amendment (Ian Blackford\u2019s) Line 1, leave out from \u201cHouse\u201d to end and insert \u201cdeclines to approve the negotiated withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship in line with the views of the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly that they would be damaging for Scotland, Wales and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole; notes the legal opinion of the advocate general of the European Court of Justice that the United Kingdom has the right to unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded; therefore calls on the UK government to request an extension to the period of negotiation under article 50 of the treaty on European Union so that the UK does not leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement or on the basis of the negotiated agreement laid before the House on Monday 26 November 2018; and calls on the UK government to respect the will of the Scottish parliament in its vote on 5 December 2018 and the Welsh assembly in its vote on 4 December 2018, which both rejected the withdrawal agreement as it now stands.\u201d Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh\u2019s amendment At end, add \u201cnotes that the Northern Ireland backstop is intended to be temporary; notes that the Vienna convention on the law of treaties makes it absolutely clear that a sovereign state can abrogate any part of a treaty with an international body in case of a fundamental change of circumstances since the Treaty was agreed; notes that making the Northern Ireland backstop permanent would constitute such a fundamental change of circumstances; and therefore calls for an assurance from the government that, if it becomes clear by the end of 2021 that the European Union will not agree to remove the Northern Ireland backstop, the United Kingdom will treat the indefinite continuation of the backstop as a fundamental change of circumstances and will accordingly give notice on 1 January 2022 to terminate the withdrawal treaty so that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall become an independent country once again.\u201d Tory MP Sir John Baron\u2019s amendment At end, add \u201csubject to changes being made in the withdrawal agreement and in the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol so that the UK has the right to terminate the protocol without having to secure the agreement of the EU.\u201d You can read the full list of amendments tabled, including the names of MPs who have signed each amendment, here (pdf). Clarke says the UK should revoke article 50 as a means of delay. Having revoked it, it could then trigger it again, he says. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, intervenes. He says Clarke is wrong. He says if the UK wants to revoke article 50, it would have to provide \u201csatisfactory evidence to the EU that we are cancelling our departure form the EU\u201d. Clarke does not push his point. If Cox is right, then the UK needs to ask for an extension of article 50, he says. Cox says the UK cannot revoke article 50 unilaterally just to buy further time for negotiation. The difference between revoking article 50 and extending it is important. The UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally. But to extend it it needs the unanimous support of the EU27. The European court of justice ruling (pdf) before Christmas confirmed that the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally. But the court said the UK\u2019s decision would have to be \u201cunequivocal and unconditional\u201d, and an earlier opinion (pdf) from the court\u2019s advocate general said the UK would be bound by conditions of \u201cgood faith and sincere cooperation\u201d \u2013 implying revocation as a negotiating tactic would not be allowed. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solictor general, opens the debate for Labour. As he set out the party\u2019s policy, he was challenged by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who said the opposition wanted to be in a customs union with the EU, but also to have a say in its trade deals, and that this amounted to a \u201cunicorn\u201d. Thomas-Symonds rejected this, suggesting Turkey had some influence in EU trade policy. Ken Clarke, the Conservative pro-European and the father of the Commons, is speaking now. The vote on invoking article 50 revealed to me there is not the slightest chance of persuading the present House of Commons to give up leaving the EU because they\u2019re terrified of denying the EU referendum. To be fair to my friends, who are hardline Brexiteers and always have been, none of them had the slightest intention of taking any notice of the referendum. But it is now a kind of religiously binding commitment it seems to the majority of this House that we must leave, so we are leaving. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Here are the main points from the opening of the debate, and other Brexit developments so far. John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, has refused to call a backbench amendment to the Brexit motion deemed helpful to the government. Officially, the government was not supporting the Andrew Murrison amendment, which backed Theresa May\u2019s deal \u201csubject to the withdrawal agreement treaty being amended to specify that the backstop solution shall expire on 31 December 2021\u201d. But if it had passed, then potentially the vote on the main motion, as amended, would have been much closer than it is now expected to be. The Labour MP Hilary Benn has bowed to pressure from party colleagues and pulled his amendment to the motion. Benn\u2019s amendment, which opposed May\u2019s deal and also opposed a no-deal Brexit, may well have been passed if it had been put to a vote, and that would have also disguised the scale of the opposition to May\u2019s deal \u2013 because that would have meant no vote on the main motion as unamended. Bercow has called four amendments \u2013 including two other Tory backbench ones relating to the backstop. But he has not called the Lib Dem amendment, and there will be no vote on a second referendum. (See 1.09pm.) May\u2019s EU emissary, Olly Robbins, has been working up secret contingency plans for cross-party talks aimed at testing MPs\u2019 backing for up to six different Brexit options were the prime minister to lose Tuesday\u2019s vote by a significant margin, the Guardian has learned. Opponents of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal have seized on a suggestion by Germany\u2019s foreign minister that further negotiations could be opened with the EU should MPs reject the prime minister\u2019s agreement on Tuesday evening. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has told MPs that the choice between accepting or rejecting May\u2019s deal amounts to a choice between order or \u201cchaos\u201d. In his speech opening this afternoon\u2019s debate, he said: [May\u2019s deal] provides for the orderly and predictable and legally certain winding down of our obligations and involvement in the legal systems of the EU. If we do not legislate for that legal certainty as a matter of law alone, thousands of contracts, thousands of transactions, thousands of administrative proceedings, of judicial proceedings in the European Union and this country, will be plunged into legal uncertainty. It would be the height of irresponsibility for any legislator to contemplate with equanimity such a situation. If you were a litigant in a court, if you were dependent upon having concluded a contract on the basis of EU law and you found yourself suddenly with the rug pulled from under you, not knowing what your legal obligations would be, you would say to this house: \u2018What are you playing at? What are you doing? You are not children in the playground, you are legislators.\u2019 We are playing with people\u2019s lives ... Whether it can be done by 29 March or whether it can\u2019t does not affect the decision we have to take today - which is: do we opt for order, or do we choose chaos? Cox said an amendment from the Tory MP Edward Leigh, which will be put to a vote tonight and which would give the UK the right to abandon the withdrawal agreement if it is still in the backstop by the end of 2021 (see 1.46pm), would not be compatible with the UK\u2019s international legal obligations. If it were passed, it could lead to the EU deciding the UK had not ratified the agreement, he said. Cox says passing this deal would be the first step towards leaving the EU. If the Commons did not take this step, it would plunge the country into uncertainty. And people who want to stop Brexit want MPs to vote down this deal, because they know this deal is the only path to Brexit. Vote it down, and Brexit could be stopped, he argues. He says if MPs vote it down history will record that MPs voted against the possibility of the UK regaining independence, all because of the backstop. If we do not take that first step then history will judge us harshly because we will be plunged into uncertainty and those who wish to prevent our departure if this vote fails today will seek to promote the conclusion that it is all too difficult and that the government should ask the electorate to think again. That is why former prime ministers and their spin doctors and all their great panjandrums of the past are joining the chorus to condemn this deal for they know this deal is the key, there is no other, destroy it in some form or other, the only practicable deal and the path to Brexit becomes shrouded in obscurity. And that\u2019s it. Cox has finally finished. Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business committee, intervenes. She says Cox has been speaking for almost an hour, and almost everything he has said is aimed at addressing concerns of Tories. But, as the two votes from MPs in the Commons showed last week, what other MPs are worried about is the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Will Cox rule that out? Cox says the way to avoid a no-deal Brexit is to vote for this deal. Cox say Labour wants to stay in the customs union, provided the UK could have a say in EU trade deals. But that would be the first time the EU had ever given that right to a third country, he says. He says the Labour policy is a \u201cfantasy\u201d. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, intervenes to ask Cox about the report from the Lords EU committee (pdf), saying the UK would not have to pay anything to the EU after Brexit. Cox says Bone is wrong. The UK might not have any financial obligations to the EU after Brexit under EU law, he says. But under public international law the UK would have financial obligations, he says. He says the argument that the UK would not have financial obligations under international public law \u201cis flimsy at best\u201d. Sir Edward Leigh intervenes. He says many Tory MPs want an end date to the backstop. He asks the government to agree to accept amendments on this. Cox said Leigh\u2019s amendment would not be compatible with the UK\u2019s international law obligations. Cox confirms the government will not accept the amendment from the Tory MP Edward Leigh saying the UK should have the right to abandon the withdrawal agreement if it is still in the backstop by the end of 2021. Here, for the record, is the full text of the Leigh amendment. At end, add \u201cnotes that the Northern Ireland backstop is intended to be temporary; notes that the Vienna convention on the law of treaties makes it absolutely clear that a sovereign state can abrogate any part of a treaty with an international body in case of a fundamental change of circumstances since the treaty was agreed; notes that making the Northern Ireland backstop permanent would constitute such a fundamental change of circumstances; and therefore calls for an assurance from the government that, if it becomes clear by the end of 2021 that the European Union will not agree to remove the Northern Ireland backstop, the United Kingdom will treat the indefinite continuation of the backstop as a fundamental change of circumstances and will accordingly give notice on 1 January 2022 to terminate the Withdrawal Treaty so that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall become an independent country once again.\u201d If you want more information about what the Vienna convention on the law of treaties says, and whether it could be used by the UK to exit the withdrawal agreement, this House of Commons library briefing (pdf) should answer all your questions. Cox says the regulatory provisions in the backstop are standard non-regression clauses of the kind you get in free trade agreements. The UK will have regulatory flexibility, \u201cif we wish to avail ourselves of it\u201d, he says. Cox says, once EU fishermen realise they cannot get \u201ca single cod or plaice\u201d from UK waters under the backstop, they will put great pressure on their governments to ensure the backstop does not continue. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, says the EU has made it clear that the backstop cannot be permanent. He says no Danish, Dutch or Belgian fisherman will be allowed to point the prow of their boat one metre into British waters under the backstop. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, who has been speaking to a minister about the speaker\u2019s decision not to select the Murrison amendment. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, intervenes. She says Cox previously described the backstop as \u201can instrument of pain\u201d for the EU. Will he elaborate? Cox says he wants to move on to that. He says most of what is in the withdrawal agreements is entirely sensible. It allows matters to be settled orderly. There are misconceptions about the withdrawal agreement, he says. People claim it allows the ECJ to have jurisdiction over UK law. \u201cIt does not,\u201d he bellows. He repeats the phrase several times. Once the clauses relating to the ECJ have wound out, it will no longer have jurisdiction, he says. And he says the same applies to the argument about EU rules continuing to have force after Brexit. Cox explains what the withdrawal agreement achieves. It settles the bills, and allows legal agreements to continue. He says the transition will be like an \u201cairlock\u201d. An airlock allows the human body to adopt to a new environment, he says. And this deal will allow the UK to adapt to the bright new world on offer after Brexit. It will create a bridge for the departure from the EU, he says. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, intervenes to say that Theresa May failed to get legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. Cox says Dodds is right to say that the EU has not changed the withdrawal agreement. But the assurances offered have legal force, he says. The main thrust of Cox\u2019s speech so far has been that leaving the EU without a deal would cause chaos. I will post full quote shortly. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is now opening the debate. And his speech is first-rate \u2013 on the basis of what I\u2019ve heard so far, quite easily the best rhetorical performance we\u2019ve had since MPs embarked on this enterprise on Wednesday last week. It is probably a bit OTT for some people\u2019s tastes. But not the Speaker\u2019s; John Bercow has just described Cox as having \u201cthe intellect of Einstein and the eloquence of Demosthenes\u201d. Here is some Twitter comment on John Bercow\u2019s decision not to call the Andrew Murrison amendment. From my colleague Paul Johnson From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the Independent\u2019s Jon Stone From the Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova John Bercow, the Speaker, now turns to the debate. He says, under the business motion, he can now select amendments. He has selected four he says: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford\u2019s, and the Tory MPs Sir Edward Leigh\u2019s and John Baron\u2019s. If amendment b) (Leigh\u2019s) is agreed to, amendment f) (Baron\u2019s) falls, he says. He now sets out what will happen at the end of the debate. He says at 7pm Corbyn will be invited to move his amendment. If that is passed, the original question will be put. Then Blackford\u2019s amendment will be put to a vote. If it is passed, the original question will be put. Then Leigh\u2019s amendment will be put to a vote. If it is passed, the original question will be put. Then Baron\u2019s amendment will be put to a vote. If it is passed, the original question will be put. Then the main vote will take place. Bercow refuses to call the Andrew Murrison amendment. (See 12.54pm.) This is significant because, although the Murrison amendment was not formally backed by government, some in government favoured it because, if it were passed, it would enable the government to present the EU with an ultimatum. He also refuses to call the Hugo Swire amendment and the John Mann amendment \u2013 two amendments the government said it would back. (But the fact that the government has said it accepts them means it is still theoretically committed to accept what they say, even though MPs will not vote on this.) MPs will vote on two amendments specifically dealing with the backstop, Edward Leigh\u2019s and John Baron\u2019s, as well as a Labour one and an SNP one. There will be no vote on a second referendum amendment. The Lib Dems tabled on on this topic, but Bercow has not called it. There should be five votes in total, with the result of the final vote, yes/no on Theresa May\u2019s deal, coming at about 8.15pm. From my colleague Dan Sabbagh The DUP has put out a statement saying the Andrew Murrison amendment, which says the withdrawal agreement should be amended \u201cto specify that the backstop solution shall expire on 31 December 2021\u201d, is not enough to make the deal acceptable to them. A DUP spokesman said: Parliament is today being asked to vote on the legally binding withdrawal agreement negotiated by the prime minister. That does not contain an end date on the backstop. The prime minister has known for many weeks what we require. Amendments tabled in parliament will have no bearing on the legal status of what has been negotiated. What is required is for the prime minister is to go and secure legally binding changes as she promised. Today\u2019s very belated amendments are part of the internal parliamentary games and do not change the need to secure legally binding changes. In the Commons the Conservative MP Nick Boles has just move his EU withdrawal (no 2) bill. He explained on the Today programme yesterday how this would work. In the Commons, health questions are over. John Bercow, the Speaker, is taking points of order. Then we will get a 10-minute rule bill (which, confusingly, can go on for 20 minutes, even though is normally over in about five minutes). After that the debate will start. At that point Bercow will announce what amendments are being taken. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has more on what happened at cabinet. Some useful benchmarks for later. The Press Association has revised its projection of how the vote will go from the figures I quoted earlier. (See 11.53am.) It now says Theresa May seems to be heading for defeat by about 160 votes. Here is some briefing from today\u2019s cabinet. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Another question from BTL. If May lost a confidence motion, a general election would not be inevitable. It would only happen if no alternative PM was able to win a confidence motion within 14 days. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act does not say who should get a chance at forming a government, or in what order, but in practice May would stay as PM until she was able to recommend a successor to the Queen, and she would only do that when she had an assurance that someone - Boris Johnson? Jeremy Corbyn? Someone else entirely? - had the numbers to win a confidence motion. Here is Nikki da Costa, who until recently was director of legislative affairs at Downing Street, on the possible significance of John Bercow\u2019s decision not to give people in the Commons advance warning of the decision he will announce about what amendments he will call. (See 11.55am.) Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, has said it is up to the UK to come up with a Brexit back-up plan, not the EU, the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports. There is much attention focused on which of the dozen or so amendments to the deal will be accepted by the speaker, John Bercow to be voted on from 7pm. However, it seems we\u2019re going to have to wait for the start of today\u2019s debate at about 12.45pm. News on what amendments have been accepted usually leak out in advance, But today, I\u2019m told Bercow is keeping his plans close to his chest. Everyone at Westminster is agreed that Theresa May will lose tonight by a wide margin. But there is no consensus as to quite huge her defeat will be, partly because we don\u2019t know yet what amendments will be put to a vote, partly because some MPs change their mind at the last moment, and partly because Tory MPs who have said publicly that they will not support May\u2019s deal can either vote against or abstain - making a big difference to the size of the overall defeat. But the Guardian, and other news organisations, have been crunching the numbers, and trying to predict what might happen. Here is a summary of the main forecasts available. The Guardian Our tally has 426 MPs committed to voting against the deal and 213 committed to voting in favour. That points to a government defeat by 213 votes, but these figures don\u2019t include several dozen unconfirmed MPs who may well back May. Sky News Sky News has May heading for a potential defeat by 200 votes or more. They have counted 423 MPs planning to vote against, and 185 MPs planning to vote in favour - which would point to a defeat by 238 votes - but, again, these figures do not include MPs who have not declared their intention. The magic number that the prime minister needs to win the crucial Commons vote on 11 December is 318. ConservativeHome The ConservativeHome website, a specialist website for Tory members, says 75 Conservative MP will definitely vote against May\u2019s deal, another 26 will probably oppose it, and a further 10 May support it. The Press Association The Press Association has 256 MPs planning to vote in favour of the deal, and 383 planning to vote against. Those numbers would deliver a defeat by 127 votes. The Telegraph The Telegraph has counted 114 Tory MPs who will vote against the deal. BuzzFeed BuzzFeed also come up with 114 Tory MPs planning to vote against the deal, although their list does not seem to have been updated recently. Business leaders have given a last minute warning to MPs about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, saying the future of hundreds of thousands of jobs is in their hands, the Press Association reports. Industry groups have been calling for clarity over the UK leaving the EU, making it clear that the years of uncertainty have already affected investment plans. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: As MPs prepare to vote on the government\u2019s Brexit deal, we urge them to remember they hold the future of the British automotive industry - and the hundreds and thousands of jobs it supports - in their hands. Brexit is already causing us damage, in output, costs and jobs, but this does not compare with the catastrophic consequences of being cut adrift from our biggest trading partner overnight. The just-in-time nature of automotive means the impact of \u2018no deal\u2019 will be felt, not in months or weeks, but hours. A managed \u2018no deal\u2019 is a fantasy - we would face immediate delivery shortages, disruption, additional costs and uncertainty. Both government and parliament have a responsibility to take \u2018no deal\u2019 off the table or risk destroying this vital UK industry. And Colin Stanbridge, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, said: It is staggering that we are now weeks away from leaving the EU and businesses still don\u2019t know the terms of that departure and what preparations they require. We simply should not be at this point this late in the day. Our most recent survey of over 500 London businesses showed all business confidence and economic indicators falling, some to their lowest recorded levels. Businesses in the capital are seeing measurable damage from this uncertainty. Parliament must provide clarity on the terms of our exit from the EU. The German government has denied a report in the Sun that chancellor Angela Merkel offered concessions to Theresa May after Tuesday\u2019s vote. (See 10.40am.) \u201cThe German chancellor has given no assurances beyond those that were discussed by the European council in December and what is set out in the letter from [European commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker and [European council president] Donald Tusk,\u201d a government spokesman said. Here is the Conservative MP Nick Boles, who is now leading parliamentary efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit, on his colleagues from the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit. This, from Reuters, comes as no great surprise ... Another question from BTL. So we could solve the election/referendum dilemma by holding both - thereby satisfying both Jeremy Corbyn and Chuka Umunna? In theory parliament can legislate for whatever it wants, but the Electoral Commission has always strongly opposed the idea of holding referendums on the same day as other elections, because the different issues might get muddled. So that\u2019s not going to happen. Also, the timetables don\u2019t overlap. An election can be held relatively quickly, but referendum campaigns take longer, mainly because a minimum of 10 weeks is allocated under legislation to enable the Electoral Commission to designate lead campaign groups on either side. The German government has denied a story in today\u2019s Sun claiming that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has given Theresa May an assurance that the EU will offer the UK new assurances if May loses the vote. The paper says: It has emerged that the PM has been given fresh hope of eventual success from a last minute offer of help from Angela Merkel ... A senior Government figure said the PM and Mrs Merkel agreed there needs to be \u201ca blood-letting moment\u201d first. Dubbing the pair\u2019s phone call on Sunday morning as \u201cvery positive\u201d, the source added: \u201cMerkel believes there is more the EU can do once the vote is over as no deal would be a disaster for everyone, and they agreed to talk after it\u201d. This is from the BBC\u2019s Berlin correspondent, Jenny Hill. This is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader. A question from BTL, from JohnnyTheSailor. No one is suggesting that, not least because royal commissions go on for ever (or \u201ctake minutes and last years\u201d, as Harold Wilson put it). But Gordon Brown and Sir John Major are both among those arguing that deliberative democracy - ie, some form of citizens\u2019 assembly - should be used to come up with a compromise proposal acceptable to the country as a whole. (The Guardian has also backed the idea in its main Brexit leader.) Citizens\u2019 assemblies are probably the 21st century equivalent of royal commissions - ie preferred solutions to problems that party politics cannot solve. But neither Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn are interested at the moment, and without one or both of them coming out in favour, the idea is probably a non-starter. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, told the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that, if the government loses the vote, MPs should be asked to consider the matter again. He said: My feeling now is that there\u2019s a significant number of MPs who feel that they need to - in this initial vote - vote against the deal. Asked what should happen if the government lost, he went on: I think that everybody has to reflect on the outcome of the vote. I\u2019ve said before, and I\u2019m still very clear, that the obvious option following this vote - if it wasn\u2019t to go through - is to revisit the vote. I don\u2019t want to see a situation where there are repeat votes. I do see that there are a number of people who clearly want in the vote tonight to register their position and view on the deal, but I hope that if there is another vote on this their actual thought process will be one of: \u2018What are the alternatives?\u2019 Fourteen amendments to the government\u2019s main Brexit motion are on the order paper this morning. You can read them all here (pdf). John Bercow, the speaker, will announce at the start of the debate which ones he will put to a vote, although we will probably learn about his decision before the debate starts at around 12.45pm, because the whips do get warning about what he has decided. One of the most important ones is the amendment tabled by the Conservative Sir Hugo Swire. This is intended to impose conditions on the operation of the backstop, and the government is backing it, although there is a debate about how much impact some of its clauses would have in practice. On the Today programme this morning Swire explained why he thought his amendment was needed. The fact is that I think without movement on this part of the withdrawal bill, the chances of it getting through this evening are nil. Despite the EU\u2019s insistence that it will not accept a time limit on the backstop, Swire said his amendment and a similar one tabled by Andrew Murrison would give Theresa May \u201celbow room to go back to Brussels and say, \u2018It is in this area that there can be movement\u2019.\u201d On Sky\u2019s All Out Politics Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said that if Theresa May lost the vote tonight, Labour should table a motion of no confidence in the government tonight or tomorrow. Many people think Jeremy Corbyn will announce one tonight, but Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, told the same programme that it would happen \u201csoon\u201d. Here are some more lines from Michael Gove\u2019s interview on Today. Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, refused to say that he expected Theresa May to win tonight\u2019s vote. He said there were MPs in the Commons determined to prevent Brexit. He said: The real danger is if people do not vote for the government this evening, we face either a no-deal Brexit, with the short-term economic damage that would bring, or worse: no Brexit at all. We know there are people in the House of Commons and outside who have never made their peace with this decision, who want to overturn it. He said the backstop amounted to \u201ca trap for the EU\u201d and \u201ca whole bowl of glistening cherries\u201d for the UK. He explained: I think the whole point about the backstop is that it\u2019s deeply uncomfortable for the EU. If it is a trap for anyone, it\u2019s a trap for the EU. Why? Because the European Union said at the very beginning of this process that there would be no cherry-picking, the four freedoms of the single market were indivisible. But we have picked a whole bowl of glistening cherries, we have free access to the European market with no tariffs and no quotas but at the same time we say that European citizens have no freedom of movement. We don\u2019t pay a penny for that access, if we are worried about money after we leave and when we are in the backstop, and at the same time we can say to European nations, \u2018Do you know what? Access to our territorial waters for fishing, access to our exclusive economic zone, forget about it\u2019. We are in a stronger position in the backstop. This, of course, begs the question, if the backstop really amounts to such a positive outcome for the UK, why Gove and his cabinet colleagues also insist that they hope it will never be needed. The Press Association has also filed its own explanation of what the Game of Thrones \u201cwinter is coming\u201d catchphrase, that Gove also quoted in his interview (see 9.11am), refers to. It is a warning about how \u201ccold weather heralds the arrival of an apocalyptic army of the frozen undead on the borders of the fictional land of Westeros\u201d, the Press Association says. They are led by this chap, the Night King. My colleague Patrick Wintour just thinks Gove has got his seasons muddled. \u201cTo govern is to choose,\u201d the French prime minister Pierre Mendes-France once famously said, and today the UK faces the most important choice moment since it voted to leave the European Union almost three years ago. But tonight we expected to find that what parliament chooses doesn\u2019t match what the government has already chosen. And both the legislature and the executive are trying implement what the public chose in a crude, binary referendum that subverted the normal system of parliamentary democracy. It\u2019s all a horrible mess, and quite where it will end up remains anyone\u2019s guess. Michael Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, was on the Today programme earlier making a last-minute bid to persuade MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and he argued that, if it passes, there will be an opportunity to \u201cimprove\u201d Brexit in the next stage of the talks (the trade negotiations due to start after the EU has left). He told the programme: I\u2019m saying [to MPs] look fairly at this deal. This is the door through which we can walk in order to ensure that we are outside the European Union and we can determine our future ... This deal is stage one. We can improve this process because in stage two, as we negotiate the final status of our trade and other relationships with the European Union, we can choose, and we are in a stronger position. That is the critical question which faces the House of Commons today. Do we walk through that door? Or do we lock it? He also invoked the Game of Thrones to convey a sense of how awful it would be if May\u2019s deal were voted down. I think if we don\u2019t vote for the deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow, \u201cwinter is coming.\u201d I think if we don\u2019t vote for the deal tonight we will do damage to our democracy by saying to people that we are not going to implement Brexit, and the opportunity that all of us have to live up to our democratic obligations is clear. (If you\u2019re not familiar with it, Game of Thrones is an epic TV drama in which a bunch of mostly sociopathic members of the ruling class constantly feud with each other, resulting in them wrecking havoc on a country loosely modelled on the UK. Comparisons with Brexit are, of course, coincidental, but Gove is a big fan.) Gove\u2019s intervention is unlikely to help May much. As we report in our overnight preview, she is facing a crushing defeat. And her position has not been helped by the fact that the Labour MP Hilary Benn has this morning announced that he has withdrawn an amendment that, had it been put to a vote, might have minimised the apparent scale of May\u2019s defeat. My colleague Jessica Elgot explains all here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. After 12.45pm: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, opens the final day of the Brexit debate. After 6pm: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May wind up the Brexit debate. 7pm: MPs start voting. Quite how long the process takes depends on how many amendments John Bercow, the speaker, calls, but with each vote taking 15 minutes, and there being a good chance there could be half a dozen or more votes, it is possible that the final vote on the main motion may not come until nearer 9pm. If, as expected, May loses, MPs will expect her to give some sort of immediate response in the Commons chamber, as a point of order. At this point Corbyn could also use a point of order to announce that he will be tabling a motion of no confidence in the government. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here.

      "body": "<p>There were less visitors when the Pacific Highway was a deadly single, split carriageway that ribboned up and down mountainsides, arched wide around prime grazing pastures and seemingly ambled through every small town it could possibly find. In those times, it took up to nine hours by car to travel from the sandstone country of Sydney city to the casuarina and banksia-blanketed narrow strip of land and sudden trachyte dikes of Diamond Head.</p> <p>A violent cleft on the northern side of the headland remains a defining feature; certainly it\u2019s most striking upon first entering Diamond Head beach. Beyond lustrous red and yellow smooth hull-shaped rocks that sprawl from the foot of the promontory into the water, a vertical-walled gorge between the point proper and its gnarled, disjointed tip brims with sky.</p> <p>From one of these ocean-worn, limpet-stippled backs I fished as a boy, catching platter-sized bream and, occasionally, smaller whiting, always elatedly losing all sense of time and my actual location in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/14/wet-and-wild-why-australia-must-learn-to-love-the-animals-on-its-beaches\">Wet and wild: why Australia must learn to love the animals on its beaches | John Pickrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across the rocks and through the corridor of the gorge brings you to the heaving sea, where the swell bursts into salt spray and cunjevoi glistens erotically inches above the low tide line.</p> <p>Renowned local fisherman landed massive mulloway and tailor out there, but I only ever caught dog-sharks, or lost my lines to the submerged caverns and big kelp stands. If a gale wasn\u2019t blustering it was easy to lose the world out there too, clambering around rocks and exploring glassy rock pools until the afternoon sun slipped below the curtain of the headland\u2019s cliff face.</p> <p>Sailing past in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook aboard the Endeavour noted in his journal the sighting of my ancestors on the southern slopes of the headland. This likely prompted him to imperiously name the place Indian Head. No doubt the old people were telling him to bugger off, but the south side of the promontory retains that misnomer to this day.</p> <p>Cook also noted in his ship\u2019s journal three mountains located some distance behind the headland that were so similar in shape he named them the Three Brothers. For millennia before Cook\u2019s tool up the east coast, the mountains always were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 regarded as significant to the Birpai peoples as the embodiment of three spirit-creator brothers.</p> <p>In the early decades of the next century, more invaders intruded on this country. In the final weeks of John Oxley\u2019s 1818 expedition, which set out six months earlier to explore the upper reaches of the Macquarie River, the interlopers were desperate to reach the established penal colony of Newcastle, situated over 200km along the coast to the south.</p> <p>In order to ford what is presently named the Camden Haven River, Oxley\u2019s marauding white gang robbed a local man of his canoe. Shortly afterward, the New South Wales surveyor general described in his journal the view from the back of Diamond-Indian head: \u201cWe saw the large lake under the Brothers from a high point on the coast very clearly, and found that on the north it was bounded by the North Brother, and separated from the sea by a strip of low marshy land about three quarters of a mile wide. This lake I think is a freshwater one: it was named Watson Taylor\u2019s Lake\u201d.</p> <p>Resuming their hapless journey, the expedition team soon discovered they weren\u2019t even the first whitefellas to set foot on the country. A small boat was discovered partially buried in the sand on the beach. Oxley identified it as belonging \u201cto a Hawkesbury vessel\u201d, owned \u201cby one Mills, which had been lost some time ago\u201d. Its missing crew had presumably been swiftly dispatched by my forebears.</p> <p>In the days immediately following the discovery of the boat, my old people almost picked off another invader when a member of the expedition was twice speared for attempting to fell a cabbage-tree palm without obtaining the requisite local permit.</p> <p>Later accounts by colonists describe the richness of the surrounding country before the environmental decimation that accompanied European incursion into our coast.</p> <p>In 1830, a guest visiting the 1,039-hectare estate of Captain Archibald Clunes Innes \u2013 located around 30km north of Diamond Head on the western side of a similar sandy strip of land separating the Pacific Ocean from a low, reed-fringed lake \u2013 described forests of trees \u201cembraced with creepers forming a vast canopy\u201d, with 20-foot high tree ferns and large stag and elkhorn ferns growing in the forks of the older trees. \u201cIn no part of the world did I ever see such absolute midday darkness,\u201d wrote the visitor. \u201cHere was midnight with the Australian sun at its meridian.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1770, Lieutenant James Cook aboard the Endeavour noted in his journal the sighting of my ancestors on the southern slopes of the headland</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That habitat is now largely cleared. Only remnants of it can be found in protected pockets in Port Macquarie\u2019s eastern suburbs.</p> <p>In the campground on the southern side of the headland there is a reproduction of a wooden hut known as \u201cKylies Hut\u201d, named in honour and memory of the Australian author Kathleen \u201cKylie\u201d Tennant. In the early 1940s, Tennant lived locally in nearby Laurieton and returned to the area later for a period, intermittently residing in the hut while writing her social realist-historical novel, The Man On the Headland.</p> <p>The book is set in Camden Haven, with a focus on Diamond Head and its landowner during those years, Ernie Metcalfe \u2013 known locally as the mad hermit of \u201cDimandead\u201d. Metcalfe built the original hut especially for Tennant to write in.</p> <p>Four hundred metres of beach below Indian Head\u2019s southern slopes is likewise named \u201cKylies\u201d. As is a lookout that provides a panorama of \u201cscalloped surf\u201d including Mermaid Reef, the blue-olive haze of the distant south-western dividing range and a 20km arc of golden sand running down to Crowdy Head. More recently, a walking trail over the back of the promontory has also been named in Tennant\u2019s honour.</p> <p>In the novel, the habitat at the start of the track leading to Diamond Head is still \u201cjungle country with stag horns and orchids in the tree crotches\u201d. Like Captain Innes\u2019s guest, Tennant writes that the forest was \u201cdark and shady \u2026 with lawyer vines tangled in the trees\u201d, while across on the open slender plain which the track traversed \u201cChristmas bells flickered a rush of small flames\u201d.</p> <p>But in the book, Metcalfe (and his brothers) make repeated attempts to transform the natural landscape. They plant strawberries, oranges, cabbages, corn fields, tomatoes, passionfruit and bananas (\u201cFlying-foxes came over in clouds and tore them off the trees\u201d). Finally the mad hermit resigns himself to pumpkins, before setting about draining Watson Taylor\u2019s Lake, supposedly just for a folly.</p> <p>Yet, throughout the novel Tennant rails against the introduction of rutile mining in the area and frequently laments its impact on the immediate environment around Diamond Head. Mining plant chewed out the sand dunes for rutile, zircon and gold, she writes, silting up the promontory\u2019s natural freshwater creeks in the process. Presently, Tennant describes the mine\u2019s dam as \u201cstagnant and scummed with oily sludge\u201d, and then the head\u2019s southern freshwater lagoon becomes filled with \u201cold motor tyres, rusted oil drums, jutting iron and timber\u201d.<br><br>Tennant was undeniably progressive for the era. In the novel she reveals herself as an avowed and active feminist in the early 1940s. Later she would serve as an editor for Overland, a leftwing literary and cultural journal that was founded in 1954. However, like many white liberals today, her progressive principles seemed to be perfused with contradiction.</p> <p>Like other whitefellas since invasion, for Tennant, Australia\u2019s \u201cforeign\u201d landscape was deeply threatening, usually more so than it was beautiful. Her depiction of life in Diamond Head is imbued with this apprehension. The landscape has an unsettling presence about it: \u201cYou are living in the same cage as something uncanny and of unearthly strength. It is not the loneliness, the wild storms, the feeling of being cut off from humanity. It is the sense that Diamond Head is waiting to break you. It waits. \u2026 it seems to study out how to deal with men, find out their weaknesses.\u201d</p> <p>She describes Diamond Head as a state of mind, as though there lingers about it something unreconciled that Tennant, and the town, prefers to turn from. Her account of the headland\u2019s history was singularly memorialised throughout the 70s and 80s. In contrast, its black history was peripheral, merely incidental to the domestication of the country by a procession of revered local pioneers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/jan/14/australias-best-beaches-poll-vote-for-your-top-seaside-spots\">Australia's best beaches poll: vote for your top seaside spots #BestBeaches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Likewise, there are other illuminating descriptions in the novel: kangaroos are a scourge, swamp wallabies are only good for bait in fish traps.

      "bodyText": "There were less visitors when the Pacific Highway was a deadly single, split carriageway that ribboned up and down mountainsides, arched wide around prime grazing pastures and seemingly ambled through every small town it could possibly find. In those times, it took up to nine hours by car to travel from the sandstone country of Sydney city to the casuarina and banksia-blanketed narrow strip of land and sudden trachyte dikes of Diamond Head. A violent cleft on the northern side of the headland remains a defining feature; certainly it\u2019s most striking upon first entering Diamond Head beach. Beyond lustrous red and yellow smooth hull-shaped rocks that sprawl from the foot of the promontory into the water, a vertical-walled gorge between the point proper and its gnarled, disjointed tip brims with sky. From one of these ocean-worn, limpet-stippled backs I fished as a boy, catching platter-sized bream and, occasionally, smaller whiting, always elatedly losing all sense of time and my actual location in the world. Across the rocks and through the corridor of the gorge brings you to the heaving sea, where the swell bursts into salt spray and cunjevoi glistens erotically inches above the low tide line. Renowned local fisherman landed massive mulloway and tailor out there, but I only ever caught dog-sharks, or lost my lines to the submerged caverns and big kelp stands. If a gale wasn\u2019t blustering it was easy to lose the world out there too, clambering around rocks and exploring glassy rock pools until the afternoon sun slipped below the curtain of the headland\u2019s cliff face. Sailing past in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook aboard the Endeavour noted in his journal the sighting of my ancestors on the southern slopes of the headland. This likely prompted him to imperiously name the place Indian Head. No doubt the old people were telling him to bugger off, but the south side of the promontory retains that misnomer to this day. Cook also noted in his ship\u2019s journal three mountains located some distance behind the headland that were so similar in shape he named them the Three Brothers. For millennia before Cook\u2019s tool up the east coast, the mountains always were \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 regarded as significant to the Birpai peoples as the embodiment of three spirit-creator brothers. In the early decades of the next century, more invaders intruded on this country. In the final weeks of John Oxley\u2019s 1818 expedition, which set out six months earlier to explore the upper reaches of the Macquarie River, the interlopers were desperate to reach the established penal colony of Newcastle, situated over 200km along the coast to the south. In order to ford what is presently named the Camden Haven River, Oxley\u2019s marauding white gang robbed a local man of his canoe. Shortly afterward, the New South Wales surveyor general described in his journal the view from the back of Diamond-Indian head: \u201cWe saw the large lake under the Brothers from a high point on the coast very clearly, and found that on the north it was bounded by the North Brother, and separated from the sea by a strip of low marshy land about three quarters of a mile wide. This lake I think is a freshwater one: it was named Watson Taylor\u2019s Lake\u201d. Resuming their hapless journey, the expedition team soon discovered they weren\u2019t even the first whitefellas to set foot on the country. A small boat was discovered partially buried in the sand on the beach. Oxley identified it as belonging \u201cto a Hawkesbury vessel\u201d, owned \u201cby one Mills, which had been lost some time ago\u201d. Its missing crew had presumably been swiftly dispatched by my forebears. In the days immediately following the discovery of the boat, my old people almost picked off another invader when a member of the expedition was twice speared for attempting to fell a cabbage-tree palm without obtaining the requisite local permit. Later accounts by colonists describe the richness of the surrounding country before the environmental decimation that accompanied European incursion into our coast. In 1830, a guest visiting the 1,039-hectare estate of Captain Archibald Clunes Innes \u2013 located around 30km north of Diamond Head on the western side of a similar sandy strip of land separating the Pacific Ocean from a low, reed-fringed lake \u2013 described forests of trees \u201cembraced with creepers forming a vast canopy\u201d, with 20-foot high tree ferns and large stag and elkhorn ferns growing in the forks of the older trees. \u201cIn no part of the world did I ever see such absolute midday darkness,\u201d wrote the visitor. \u201cHere was midnight with the Australian sun at its meridian.\u201d That habitat is now largely cleared. Only remnants of it can be found in protected pockets in Port Macquarie\u2019s eastern suburbs. In the campground on the southern side of the headland there is a reproduction of a wooden hut known as \u201cKylies Hut\u201d, named in honour and memory of the Australian author Kathleen \u201cKylie\u201d Tennant. In the early 1940s, Tennant lived locally in nearby Laurieton and returned to the area later for a period, intermittently residing in the hut while writing her social realist-historical novel, The Man On the Headland. The book is set in Camden Haven, with a focus on Diamond Head and its landowner during those years, Ernie Metcalfe \u2013 known locally as the mad hermit of \u201cDimandead\u201d. Metcalfe built the original hut especially for Tennant to write in. Four hundred metres of beach below Indian Head\u2019s southern slopes is likewise named \u201cKylies\u201d. As is a lookout that provides a panorama of \u201cscalloped surf\u201d including Mermaid Reef, the blue-olive haze of the distant south-western dividing range and a 20km arc of golden sand running down to Crowdy Head. More recently, a walking trail over the back of the promontory has also been named in Tennant\u2019s honour. In the novel, the habitat at the start of the track leading to Diamond Head is still \u201cjungle country with stag horns and orchids in the tree crotches\u201d. Like Captain Innes\u2019s guest, Tennant writes that the forest was \u201cdark and shady \u2026 with lawyer vines tangled in the trees\u201d, while across on the open slender plain which the track traversed \u201cChristmas bells flickered a rush of small flames\u201d. But in the book, Metcalfe (and his brothers) make repeated attempts to transform the natural landscape. They plant strawberries, oranges, cabbages, corn fields, tomatoes, passionfruit and bananas (\u201cFlying-foxes came over in clouds and tore them off the trees\u201d). Finally the mad hermit resigns himself to pumpkins, before setting about draining Watson Taylor\u2019s Lake, supposedly just for a folly. Yet, throughout the novel Tennant rails against the introduction of rutile mining in the area and frequently laments its impact on the immediate environment around Diamond Head. Mining plant chewed out the sand dunes for rutile, zircon and gold, she writes, silting up the promontory\u2019s natural freshwater creeks in the process. Presently, Tennant describes the mine\u2019s dam as \u201cstagnant and scummed with oily sludge\u201d, and then the head\u2019s southern freshwater lagoon becomes filled with \u201cold motor tyres, rusted oil drums, jutting iron and timber\u201d.

He added: \u201cOn my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work.\u201d And if the president asked him to fire Mueller without good cause, Barr told the Democratic senator Chris Coons: \u201cI would not carry out that instruction.\u201d Directly contradicting a claim Trump has made many times, Barr said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe Mr Mueller would be involved in a witch-hunt.\u201d He also endorsed the view of intelligence agencies, often questioned by Trump, by testifying: \u201cI believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interfere with the election, and I think we have to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Barr even took issue with one of the lines chanted at Trump\u2019s rallies, saying that he does not \u201csubscribe to this \u2018lock her up\u2019 stuff\u201d as he distanced himself from politically motivated prosecutions. Nevertheless, Barr was not able to allay all the concerns of Democrats and other critics. He was questioned about an unsolicited memo he wrote last year that called Mueller\u2019s case \u201cfatally misconceived\u201d for examining whether Trump obstructed justice by firing the FBI director James Comey. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the committee, told Barr the memo showed \u201ca determined effort, I thought, to undermine Bob Mueller\u201d. Barr replied his memo did not question the legitimacy of the investigation as a whole but merely expressed concerns that the special counsel might be improperly interpreting one aspect of the law. He repeatedly refused to commit to recusing himself from an investigation, even if recommended by ethics officials. \u201cAt the end of the day I would make a decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not going to surrender the responsibilities of the attorney general.\u201d This contrasted with the former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who said he would defer to the recommendation of ethics officials after it emerged he had met with Russian officials while working on Trump\u2019s election campaign. But Barr said Sessions \u201cdid the right thing\u201d because he faced a conflict due to his political activities. Barr also spoke in favour of many of the hardline immigration policies ushered in by the Trump administration. He said he believed in the use of border walls and condemned \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that shield unauthorised immigrants from deportation. \u201cWe need money right now for border security, including walls and barriers,\u201d he said. And he raised eyebrows on the issue of freedom of the press. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a potential candidate in the 2020 election, asked: \u201cIf you\u2019re confirmed, will the justice department jail reporters for doing their jobs?\u201d Barr answered: \u201cI know there are guidelines in place, and I can conceive of situations where as a last resort and where a news organization has run through a red flag or something like that, knows that they\u2019re putting out stuff that will hurt the country, there might be a \u2013 there could be a situation where someone would be held in contempt.\u201d",

But an exhibit included with the heavily redacted court filing showed that Manafort worked on a Microsoft Word document titled \u201cnew initiative for peace\u201d in February 2018 as part of his continuing discussions with Kilimnik.

Mueller has said Kilimnik was described as \u201ca former Russian intelligence officer with the GRU\u201d by Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s deputy on the Trump campaign. Kilimnik denies that he worked for Russian intelligence. Manafort and Gates were indicted on financial crimes in October 2017 in Washington and for further offences in Virginia in February 2018. Gates struck a plea deal with Mueller\u2019s team. Manafort was convicted in Virginia on eight counts and later pleaded guilty to charges in Washington. The filing by Mueller\u2019s team on Tuesday was intended to support its allegations that Manafort lied about several subjects even after he pleaded guilty and began cooperating with the investigation. The alleged lies prompted Mueller to tear up a deal that promised Manafort favourable treatment when he is sentenced. Manafort\u2019s attorneys deny that he intentionally lied. They blamed his false statements on a failure to recall certain details and his lack of access in jail to records that could jog his memory. Mueller alleges that Manafort lied when he said he had no communication with members of Trump\u2019s administration after they entered office in January 2017. Tuesday\u2019s filing said Gates told investigators Manafort boasted that month that he was getting people \u201cappointed in the administration\u201d via an intermediary. On 28 May 2018, according to Tuesday\u2019s filing, Manafort was sent a text message by an associate, who asked: \u201cIf I see POTUS one on one next week am I ok to remind him of our relationship?\u201d Manafort allegedly replied: \u201cYes\u201d and \u201ceven if not one on one\u201d. Manafort joined Trump\u2019s campaign at the end of March 2016 and was promoted to campaign chairman that May. Following revelations that he received millions of dollars in illicit funds from Ukraine\u2019s pro-Kremlin former president, the campaign announced on 19 August 2016 that Manafort was leaving. Mueller\u2019s team said on Tuesday that Manafort and Kilimnik discussed the Ukraine peace plan in person and in messages from 2 August 2016. Kilimnik has previously said the pair met in New York around that date.",

      "bodyText": "Fashion has been integral to music festivals since Woodstock, and festival dressing around the world tends to exemplify the trends of the times. When I started going to festivals, it was all petticoat dresses, Pennywise T-shirts and seasonally inappropriate velvet. These days it\u2019s short shorts, floral playsuits and culturally appropriated tribal headwear. This cultural codependence peaks annually at Coachella, as the world\u2019s biggest music artists frolic with fashion\u2019s biggest influencers and everyone else tries to get a look-in. I\u2019ve heard some women start planning their Coachella outfits as soon as tickets go on sale. I can barely plan my outfit for tomorrow. This summer, at music festivals across Australia, an even stranger sartorial phenomenon has emerged. It seems hundreds of male punters have been rocking up to festivals in exactly. The same. Shirt. The fashion fiasco was first spotted by Instagram user/fashion detective @ohhellocalum, and witnessed at Falls, Fomo Adelaide and Lost Paradise. It was soon discovered that the garment in question \u2013 a short-sleeved button-down that could clothe a competitive bowling team \u2013 can be yours too, for just $29.99. And because sometimes life is beautiful, it\u2019s actually called Festival Shirt. The Festival Shirt is currently available in 12 colourways, most of them featuring vertical stripes. There\u2019s a subdued cream, blue and orange style that says, \u201cI\u2019m ready to meet your parents,\u201d and a bold red, white and black stripe that screams, \u201cI drive a sedan.\u201d Cotton On confirmed to Guardian Australia that the shirt has been \u201cone of our most popular styles for the season\u201d. The Festival Shirt has gone viral and, after more were spotted by pop culture site Junkee at Fomo Sydney last weekend \u2013 potentially thanks to the first stories, which have led to some kind of hideous shirt snowball effect even among women \u2013 it appears to be gaining momentum. So, some questions: was this \u2013 at least initially \u2013 a simple coincidence, or did all these people all buy the same shirt on purpose, as a joke? Or did they all simply Google \u201cfestival shirt\u201d, and click on the first thing they saw? Is Cotton On running an aggressive ad campaign that is only visible to dudes who like Peking Duk? Are dark forces at play here? Why the yellow one? But seriously, why the yellow one? I have theories. Firstly, yellow is very on-point right now. I myself currently have three tabs open with shopping baskets filled with yellow clothes (I probably won\u2019t buy). It\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s not going anywhere. According to retail data company Edited, yellow will continue dominating men\u2019s and women\u2019s fashion in 2019 with its buddies pink and green by its side. Without getting philosophical about capitalism and class, high fashion has long been flirting with non-fashion brands. From Jeremy Scott\u2019s McDonald\u2019s accessories for Moschino, to Vetements\u2019 DHL T-shirts and Balenciaga\u2019s $2.5K bag that\u2019s basically just an Ikea tote, lines have been blurred between pushing creative boundaries and just being arseholes. And as we know, the survival of fast fashion brands is partly based on how well they emulate high fashion trends \u2013 so it should come as no surprise that, as the Daily Mail noted, the most popular iteration of the Festival Shirt could pass as an Ikea uniform, which could pass as a shirt by French label Vetements, which is now being made by Cotton On. Celebrated costume designer Edith Head once said: \u201cYou can have anything you want in life if you dress for it.\u201d Apparently hundreds of festival bros want to sell flat-packed furniture. (Of course, it\u2019s likely hundreds of women at these festivals were also wearing the exact same thing, such as a $29.99 pair of denim cut-offs or a crochet crop top.

Wider research is needed to try to explain Wales\u2019 high rate of imprisonment. While this will undoubtedly include further analysis of sentencing outcomes including the use of community sentences, fines and suspended sentences, attention should also be drawn to the significance of wider socioeconomic factors in Wales.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, the data should be considered in light of Wales\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/wales-poverty-report-joseph-rowntree-uk-eu\">status as one of the poorest parts of the UK</a>. Previous research has identified the symbiosis between poverty, marginalisation and imprisonment.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lizsavilleroberts.org/\">Liz Saville Roberts</a>, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, said the figures showed the prison system was not fit for purpose.</p> <p>\u201cJust locking people up does not solve the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a genuinely rehabilitative prison system to break the vicious reoffending cycle that many inmates fall into. For the safety of prison staff, inmates and society as a whole we need to make rehabilitation our number one priority.</p> <p>\u201cWales being at the top of this league table is a source of great shame. Our national assembly for Wales should take control of our prison system so we can create one fit for the unique needs of our nation and not simply allow Westminster to impose its unsuitable policies.\u201d</p> <p>The study, which was published on Wednesday, used the home addresses of offenders to differentiate between Wales and England. It found a higher proportion of Wales\u2019s overall population was in prison than England\u2019s for every year since 2013, when data became available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-15T13:57:22/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Custodial sentences Wales and England comparison\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-15T13:57:22/embed.html\">Custodial sentences Wales and England comparison</a> </figure>  <p>This trend was supported by the \u201cin country\u201d rate of imprisonment. In November 2018, the rate in Wales was at 148 per 100,000, compared with 141 per 100,000 in England. The Welsh rate is expected to increase once HMP Berwyn in Wrexham becomes fully operational.</p> <p>The study also showed that while the total number of custodial sentences handed down by courts in England fell by 16% between 2010 and 2017, it increased marginally (0.3%) in Wales. This was despite police recorded crime in Wales being lower than in England every year between 2013 and 2017, the report said.</p> <p>In addition, the report said white Welsh and English people were underrepresented in prison in 2017, with the level of racial disproportionality higher among the Welsh prison population than the English one.</p> <p>England and Wales has recorded the highest prison population rate in western Europe since 1999. Between then and 2018, the average prison population rate per 100,000 people in England and Wales was 141. In Scotland it was 135 per 100,000,Northern Ireland 78, Germany 89 and France 92.</p> <p>The UK government pointed out that sentencing guidelines were the same for England and Wales and independent judges made decisions based on the facts of each case.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cAs we have said previously, the prison population is too high and we are exploring potential alternatives to custody \u2013 such as reducing the number of ineffective short sentences which provide little opportunity to rehabilitate offenders and fail to tackle reoffending. We are clear that prison will continue to be the best place for serious offenders.\u201d</p> <p>Jane Hutt, the Welsh government deputy minister with responsibility for crime and justice policy, said: \u201cThe report is very timely; its findings will assist us in establishing a clearer picture of sentencing and custody in Wales which will influence our future work around offending.</p> <p>\u201cThe report highlights the differences in sentencing between Wales and England and the importance of Wales-specific data in understanding justice policy and practice.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhilst justice remains a non-devolved function, work is underway to get the best possible solution for Wales. Working with the Youth Justice Board Cymru and HMPPS [the UK government prison and probation service], we are developing proposals on how a distinct and different justice system would operate specifically for female and youth offenders in Wales. Early intervention and prevention are key - considering how we can divert people away from crime in the first place in a holistic and rehabilitative way is essential to Wales\u2019 future outlook.\u201d</p>",

While this will undoubtedly include further analysis of sentencing outcomes including the use of community sentences, fines and suspended sentences, attention should also be drawn to the significance of wider socioeconomic factors in Wales. \u201cIn particular, the data should be considered in light of Wales\u2019 status as one of the poorest parts of the UK. Previous research has identified the symbiosis between poverty, marginalisation and imprisonment.\u201d Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, said the figures showed the prison system was not fit for purpose. \u201cJust locking people up does not solve the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a genuinely rehabilitative prison system to break the vicious reoffending cycle that many inmates fall into. For the safety of prison staff, inmates and society as a whole we need to make rehabilitation our number one priority. \u201cWales being at the top of this league table is a source of great shame. Our national assembly for Wales should take control of our prison system so we can create one fit for the unique needs of our nation and not simply allow Westminster to impose its unsuitable policies.\u201d The study, which was published on Wednesday, used the home addresses of offenders to differentiate between Wales and England. It found a higher proportion of Wales\u2019s overall population was in prison than England\u2019s for every year since 2013, when data became available. This trend was supported by the \u201cin country\u201d rate of imprisonment. In November 2018, the rate in Wales was at 148 per 100,000, compared with 141 per 100,000 in England. The Welsh rate is expected to increase once HMP Berwyn in Wrexham becomes fully operational. The study also showed that while the total number of custodial sentences handed down by courts in England fell by 16% between 2010 and 2017, it increased marginally (0.3%) in Wales. This was despite police recorded crime in Wales being lower than in England every year between 2013 and 2017, the report said. In addition, the report said white Welsh and English people were underrepresented in prison in 2017, with the level of racial disproportionality higher among the Welsh prison population than the English one. England and Wales has recorded the highest prison population rate in western Europe since 1999. Between then and 2018, the average prison population rate per 100,000 people in England and Wales was 141. In Scotland it was 135 per 100,000,Northern Ireland 78, Germany 89 and France 92. The UK government pointed out that sentencing guidelines were the same for England and Wales and independent judges made decisions based on the facts of each case. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cAs we have said previously, the prison population is too high and we are exploring potential alternatives to custody \u2013 such as reducing the number of ineffective short sentences which provide little opportunity to rehabilitate offenders and fail to tackle reoffending. We are clear that prison will continue to be the best place for serious offenders.\u201d Jane Hutt, the Welsh government deputy minister with responsibility for crime and justice policy, said: \u201cThe report is very timely; its findings will assist us in establishing a clearer picture of sentencing and custody in Wales which will influence our future work around offending. \u201cThe report highlights the differences in sentencing between Wales and England and the importance of Wales-specific data in understanding justice policy and practice. \u201cWhilst justice remains a non-devolved function, work is underway to get the best possible solution for Wales. Working with the Youth Justice Board Cymru and HMPPS [the UK government prison and probation service], we are developing proposals on how a distinct and different justice system would operate specifically for female and youth offenders in Wales. Early intervention and prevention are key - considering how we can divert people away from crime in the first place in a holistic and rehabilitative way is essential to Wales\u2019 future outlook.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The local government ombudsman has reprimanded a local authority over its provision for children with special educational needs after upholding 11 complaints against the council over the last two years. The ombudsman\u2019s office said the number of complaints upheld against Norfolk county council was one of the highest in England, particularly given the relatively small population. The picture is replicated in many areas of the country, however, with many parents saying they have to fight to secure the SEN provision to which their children are entitled as cash-strapped local authorities struggle to meet growing demand for support. In the two most recent cases, which were the subject of separate investigations, the ombudsman, Michael King, censured Norfolk for leaving two boys \u201cwithout the vital support and provision they needed at crucial times of their education\u201d. In the first case, a mother complained that the council failed to provide her son with suitable education provision for nearly two academic years. It also took 46 weeks \u2013 twice the statutory timescale - to complete his education, health and care (EHC) plan, which sets out a child\u2019s legal requirements to additional support. In the second case, the ombudsman said the council had failed to provide a primary school-aged boy with suitable education provision after he was excluded, causing him to miss out on full-time education for eight months. Announcing his judgments in favour of both parents, the ombudsman pointed out that he had upheld nine similar complaints in Norfolk. \u201cIn both [of the latest] cases these children were without the vital support and provision they needed at crucial times of their education,\u201d the ombudsman said. \u201cWe welcome the proactive steps the council is now taking to improve its provision and oversight of services for children with SEN, and hope this will ensure children will get the support they need in future.\u201d The local government and social care ombudsman\u2019s role is to investigate complaints about local public services. Across 200 investigations into parents\u2019 complaints, the ombudsman has found in favour of parents in 80% of cases. King said recently: \u201cWhile our investigations can only provide part of the picture of how the SEN system is functioning \u2013 that picture is causing concern. The reality is that some families are suffering a disproportionate burden in having to battle for the support their children are entitled to.\u201d Following the two most recent cases affecting Norfolk, the council agreed to a number of service reviews and improvements, including examining other ways of providing alternative education for children out of school and completing an audit of children missing from education for whom it has a duty to provide education. It has also agreed to review its working processes to ensure EHC plans are produced within statutory timescales and to improve the way it monitors missing professional advice it requires in order to complete the plans. Norfolk county council said it fully accepted the LGO\u2019s findings and has already complied with all recommendations.

The new guidelines will be launched by Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, in a speech on Wednesday, with a consultation on revised inspection frameworks for state and independent schools as well as early years settings and further education colleges. Under the new proposals, schools that push out less able children \u2013 a practice known as \u201coff-rolling\u201d \u2013 or teach a narrow curriculum designed solely to improve test results and gaming league table rankings risk being punished by Ofsted\u2019s inspectors. Sean Harford, Ofsted\u2019s national director of education, said the new frameworks \u201ccover all the way from birth through to adult learning\u201d, with an emphasis on the quality of education, a new inspection category that will replace \u201coutcomes\u201d as one of the four main areas under which schools will be inspected.

A new inspection area \u2013 personal development \u2013 will rate how a school prepares pupils for life in modern Britain, while the leadership category will now encompass issues such as off-rolling, which Harford defined as \u201cgetting rid of people because they\u2019re not going to get the right scores\u201d.
