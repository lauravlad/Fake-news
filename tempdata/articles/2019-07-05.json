You have to make sacrifices sometimes,\u201d he said. </li> <li><strong>Johnson defended free speech and in his public gaffes</strong>. He said: \u201cWhen people say you are making a gaffe, what you are doing is saying something true and necessary.\u201d He added: \u201cI deplore xenophobia and hate speech but I do think we should be able to speak our minds frankly without the fear that we\u2019re going to get our heads bitten off.\u201d</li> <li><strong>Johnson claimed he was never in favour of the Conservative austerity programme and resisted David Cameron\u2019s plan for an austerity Olympics. </strong>\u201cThat not the stuff to give the troops,\u201d Johnson claimed he told Cameron. </li> <li><strong>Jeremy Hunt said austerity \u201cwent too far\u201d on cuts to policing and social care. </strong>But he said this was only with the benefit of hindsight. </li> <li><strong>Hunt pleaded with MPs not to take a no-deal off the table in Brexit negotiations.</strong> \u201cThe best way to get a deal is to leave no-deal on the table,\u201d he said. Earlier the chancellor warned Hunt and Johnson that parliament would find a way of blocking no deal. </li> <li><strong>In a pointed dig at his rival Hunt said he thought about the British Iranian Nazanin Zeghari-Ratcliffe every day she is jail. </strong>Her family claimed she was put at greater risk when Johnson falsely claimed she was in Iran to train journalists. </li> <li><strong>Hunt made new promises on immigration and the environment.</strong> He promised to reconsider the \u00a330,000 salary level as too high for business. And he suggested a national programme for installing electric car charging points. </li> <li><strong>John Major has backed Hunt\u2019s campaign for leadership of the party</strong>. \u201cWe need a serious leader for serious times,\u201d he told the BBC. </li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1f30e38f08d0b6ca52a877\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-05T11:15:33.204Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And that\u2019s it from Darlington.

Here\u2019s a summary of what learned from the Darlington hustings: Boris Johnson has denied a BBC report that he was kept away from intelligence briefings. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he said and added: \u201cI am extremely dubious about the provenance of this story.\u201d Jeremy Hunt refused to comment on the story. He said: \u201cWe have the finest intelligence services in the world, but that does depend on some discretion by the foreign secretary\u201d Johnson said he could have more money outside politics as an example of where he had put the national interest above his own self interest. \u201cIt is obviously possible to make more money by not being a full time politician. You have to make sacrifices sometimes,\u201d he said. Johnson defended free speech and in his public gaffes. He said: \u201cWhen people say you are making a gaffe, what you are doing is saying something true and necessary.\u201d He added: \u201cI deplore xenophobia and hate speech but I do think we should be able to speak our minds frankly without the fear that we\u2019re going to get our heads bitten off.\u201d Johnson claimed he was never in favour of the Conservative austerity programme and resisted David Cameron\u2019s plan for an austerity Olympics. \u201cThat not the stuff to give the troops,\u201d Johnson claimed he told Cameron. Jeremy Hunt said austerity \u201cwent too far\u201d on cuts to policing and social care. But he said this was only with the benefit of hindsight. Hunt pleaded with MPs not to take a no-deal off the table in Brexit negotiations. \u201cThe best way to get a deal is to leave no-deal on the table,\u201d he said. Earlier the chancellor warned Hunt and Johnson that parliament would find a way of blocking no deal. In a pointed dig at his rival Hunt said he thought about the British Iranian Nazanin Zeghari-Ratcliffe every day she is jail. Her family claimed she was put at greater risk when Johnson falsely claimed she was in Iran to train journalists. Hunt made new promises on immigration and the environment. He promised to reconsider the \u00a330,000 salary level as too high for business. And he suggested a national programme for installing electric car charging points. John Major has backed Hunt\u2019s campaign for leadership of the party. \u201cWe need a serious leader for serious times,\u201d he told the BBC. And that\u2019s it from Darlington. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. In the meantime, Downing Street has played down reports that Johnson was shut out of intelligence briefings. On austerity Hunt admitted that cuts went too far on police funding and social care. Q: Would a no-deal Brexit ruin the Conservative\u2019s reputation as the party of business? Hunt: We are the party of business but also the party that respects democracy. This is a country where politicians do what people tell them. We are going to leave the EU and make it a tremendous success. Q: Name a policy to improve the environment. Hunt: We have to show young people that we are true Conservatives by leaving the planet in a cleaner state. On specifics Hunt suggests putting in charging points for electric vehicles. When installing new internet capacity he said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put in electric car charging points so we get electric only car towns and cities?\u201d Q: Does the need to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland mean we can\u2019t leave the EU? Hunt: I believe their is a technological solution, but it will take time. The EU must know that the backstop will never get through parliament which is why they must discuss technological solutions. Hunt agreed that the debate on this before the referendum was not good. On immigration, Hunt says he would reconsider the \u00a330,000 salary limit. He said the current limit is not good for business. He promises a royal commission on the issue. Hunt said: \u201cI am concerned about the \u00a330,000 salary limit, because that is too high for the needs of many businesses.\u201d As he answers questions from the audience, Hunt has just won the backing of John Major. \u201cWe need a serious leader for serious times,\u201d the former prime minister told the BBC\u2019s Hard Talk programme. Q: When was the last time you let someone down? Hunt says he thinks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe every day. \u201cI am letting down Nazanin Zeghari-Ratcliffe every day she remains in jail.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to get her out, I\u2019ve met her husband Richard Ratcliffe on several occasions, she has a daughter the same age as my daughter.\u201d Q: would you accept a place in Johnson\u2019s cabinet? Hunt: After Brexit we have to come together, which is why there will always be a place for Boris Johnson in my cabinet. I would of course be proud to serve in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet. The best way to get a deal is to leave no-deal on the table, Hunt repeats. To Tory colleagues he said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t take no-deal off the table\u201d. This is loudly applauded. Q: Is Brexit like being emancipated from Slavery? Hunt: We need to dial down the rhetoric on all sides and be the best of friends. Asked about Islamophobia, Hunt said \u201cwe have to root out all prejudice in our party\u201d which is why he said he backs an inquiry into the issue. Q: Are you confident you are seeing all intelligence briefings? Hunt: we can\u2019t comment on intelligence. \u201cSorry I\u2019m not commenting on intelligence matters.\u201d \u201cWe have the finest intelligence services in the world, but that does depend on some discretion by the foreign secretary\u201d. Hunt promises that he won\u2019t take the Tories into a general election until it recruits more young people as members. He said: We could elect our own populist, or we could do better, we could elect our Jeremy. Jeremy Hunt is up next. He starts by praising Darlington\u2019s railway history and its current record on engineering and exporting bridges. He said the main difference between him and Johnson is his ability to negotiate a deal, and trots out his well-worn lines about being an entrepreneur. Johnson can\u2019t remember the location of the sausage factory he visited yesterday, describing it as \u201csomewhere in Yorkshire\u201d. The audience laughs. Asked about Tory MPs voting against whatever Brexit deal has been present to parliament, Johnson said: \u201cI think that they\u2019re just going to have to get used to the fact that unless we get on and do this we\u2019re going to keep on haemorrhaging support.\u201d Johnson suggested he won\u2019t accept chlorinated chicken being imported from the US after Brexit. Johnson claims he was never a fan of austerity. \u201cAusterity is not a helpful term. I never liked it. I remember Dave Cameron saying he wanted an austerity Olympics and I said: \u2018No way mate.\u2019 That\u2019s not the stuff to give the troops.\u201d Q: Should we have a written constitution to enshrine free speech? Free speech has been protect in Britain since the 18th century, Johnson said. He added that we don\u2019t need any protection for free speech from the EU he claims. \u201cI deplore xenophobia and hate speech but I do think we should be able to speak our minds frankly without the fear that we\u2019re going to get our heads bitten off.\u201d On Education, Johnson described student debt as \u201cmassive Ponzi\u201d scheme. He says wants to give young people a better chance of owning their own home. He also claims the Conservatives are the party for a cleaner environment, which he claims is a vote winner for young people. Asked about the fishing industry, Johnson refuses to say whether the UK will scrap the 12 mile limit. But he repeats that the UK will be taking controls of our waters. Johnson insists he is not selfish by claiming that he could have made more money by not being a politician. \u201cIt is obviously possible to make more money not being a politician. But you have to make sacrifices sometimes,\u201d he said. He claims he could have earned more by writing a book about Shakespeare. Johnson criticises Theresa May\u2019s government for slipping in its preparation for a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe sagged on our oars,\u201d he said. The most important thing is to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, he said. On that BBC intelligence story Johnson said: \u201cI am extremely dubious about the provenance of this story\u201d. Asked about gaffes, Johnson says: \u201cWhen people say you are making a gaffe, what you are doing is saying something true and necessary.\u201d Johnson is asked by CNN\u2019s Hannah Vaughan Jones about a BBC report that he was kept away from intelligence briefings. Johnson says he does not comment on intelligence maters. But then adds: \u201cIt is not true. But I cannot comment any further on intelligence matters. I am sure the prime minister will not comment on security matters.\u201d Johnson repeats his joke about the ingredients for Mars bars but adds a local reference to parmos. Johnson begins by lamenting the Conservative\u2019s standing in the polls. He says he can\u2019t remember when the party last sank to 9%, but claims this the dark before the dawn. Boris Johnson will be up first in Darlington. He will give a speech and then be interviewed. Jeremy Hunt will then go through the same formula. Once again there will be no head-to-head debate. Boris Johnson has arrived at the Darlington Hippodrome in time for the latest hustings, according to the local Northern Echo\u2019s live blog of event. \u201cIt\u2019s a north-east Tory who\u2019s who\u201d, according to the Echo\u2019s Chris Lloyd. Johnson has launched a new campaign video timed for the arrival in the post of ballot papers to Tory party members. He underlines his pledge not to delay Brexit beyond the Halloween deadline. \u201cKick the can and we kick the bucket\u201d, is his chosen soundbite to the party faithful. Jeremy Hunt appears to have arrived by train in Darlington for this morning\u2019s hustings. We\u2019re not sure how Johnson is getting there but it\u2019s only a 40 minute drive from Ripon (near where\u2019s he was shearing sheep) to Darlington. Boris Johnson has apologised for offending Scots, while condemning the SNP\u2019s record in government and insisting that a no-deal Brexit is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d in an interview in the Press and Journal. Asked about a series of magazine articles in which he described being a Scottish MP as a \u201cpolitical disability\u201d and said that \u201cgovernment by a Scot is just not conceivable\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cOf course I am sorry if people take offence at distorted quotations from old newspaper articles \u2013 but one of the things I want to make clear is that Conservatives must reach out beyond the Westminster bubble and that means not just speaking in waffle and jargon\u201d. He went on to accuse the SNP of using devolved power \u201cto damage the Scottish economy: making Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK, bloating the Scottish deficit to four times that of the UK\u2019s and desperately trying to keep Scottish fishing communities locked into the hated Common Fisheries policy\u201d. Boris Johnson has been shearing sheep in North Yorkshire before the hustings in Darlington today. Meanwhile, his campaign continues retweet posts from Tory members who claim to have voted for Johnson. Jeremy Corbyn has accused Amazon of not paying its fair share of taxes. The Labour leader wrote a card to the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, to mark the 25th anniversary of Amazon\u2019s launch. It read: \u201cDear Jeff. Happy Birthday. You owe the British people millions in taxes that pay for the public services that we all rely on. This year, pay your fair share of taxes, give your hard-working staff a pay rise and respect workers\u2019 rights. \u201cMany Happy Tax Returns, Jeremy.\u201d The outgoing LibDem leader, Vince Cable, has welcomed a pledge by the Greens and Plaid Cymru not to contest the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection next month, claiming it will open the way for more pro-remain electoral pacts. The contest was triggered by a recall petition after the Conservative MP for the seat, Chris Davies was convicted of fiddling expenses. Speaking to the Today programme Cable said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats have the best opportunity to win this byelection and Plaid have got behind us endorse our candidate as have the Greens. There is strength in being together.\u201d Asked if the LibDems were prepared to pull their candidates in seats where Plaid and the Greens had the best chance of winning, Cable said: \u201cYes in principle we would be willing to do that.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no narrow deal around this particular seat but it will create trust and good will, we will reciprocate in an appropriate way. We have no difficulty with that. We had an agreement with the Greens at the last general election - they didn\u2019t contest my seat and we didn\u2019t contest the Green\u2019s seat in Brighton. And that kind of thing could now happen much more widely given the strength of feeling about Brexit.\u201d Cable said he had consulted the two candidates competing to succeed him, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, about the move. He said: \u201cThey will have to endorse the strategy going forward but we\u2019ve had a careful process of consultation. The political logic of what\u2019s happening is irresistible.\u201d But Cable ruled out electoral deals with the Labour Party even if moved to back a second referendum. Cable said: \u201cThe Labour party is way off the map where this is concerned. They have been so ambiguous for so long and sat on the fence. There is no possibility of an agreement with the Labour party.\u201d Theresa May is heading for Poland on what is expected to her last foreign trip as prime minister. She is expected to tell delegates as the Western Balkans summit to work together to tackle organised crime. According to PA she is set to say crimes including money laundering, human and drugs trafficking, weapons trading, cyber-attacks and terrorism threaten lives in the UK and undermine security and stability in the Western Balkans. \u201cThere is no doubt that serious and organised crime and corruption are security challenges we all face across Europe,\u201d she will tell the summit. \u201cThey can only be tackled by strong international cooperation.\u201d Back home, five former top police officers in Britain have attacked May\u2019s record on crime, saying that \u201cresources drained to dangerously low levels\u201d have contributed to a \u201cfeeling of lawlessness\u201d and saying confidence in the police has to be urgently restored. A letter to the Times signed by Lord Condon, Lord Stevens, Lord Blair, Sir Paul Stephenson and Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, says: \u201cThe reduction of police and support staff by more than 30,000, the virtual destruction of neighbourhood policing and the inadvisable undermining of lawful police powers such as stop and search, have taken their toll. Common sense suggests that these factors have contributed to the feeling of lawlessness generated by knife murders and \u2018county lines\u2019 drugs.\u201d Speaking to LBC Stevens said: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s departure from number 10 will hopefully mark an end to the dark period of policing, where quite frankly, relationship between the government and police officers are an all time low. We know what the situation is on the streets, and we really do need something done about it, and done about it now. \u201cWe witnessed a complete breakdown of trust and confidence between her and overworked police officers.\u201d Welcome to a Friday instalment of Politics Live at a crucial juncture in the Tory leadership race. Most of the 160,000 Tory members will now have received their ballot papers and many will be voting over the weekend. The two contenders, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, are due to take part in four leadership hustings in the next two days. The first is in Darlington at 10.30am today, before Johnson and Hunt head to Perth for the only hustings in Scotland, at 7pm. Ringing in Hunt and Johnson\u2019s ears will be a parting shot from the chancellor Philip Hammond. Speaking to Nick Robinson\u2019s Political Thinking podcast, Hammond warned them that they won\u2019t be able to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, because Parliament will block such an outcome. Hammond predicted he would be sacked by whoever wins the contest but appears determined to scupper a no-deal Brexit, which both candidates have refused to rule out. He said: \u201cThe House Commons has been clear already that it does not support a no-deal exit. That is my position and as a backbencher I will continue to argue against a no deal exit. Let me quote the speaker, who has said if the Commons is determined to do something, he\u2019s quite sure it will find a way. I am quite confident that the House of Commons will find a way \u2014 and indeed should be able to find a way, because this is a parliamentary democracy, and it would be frankly rather shocking if the House of Commons, the elected representatives of the people, could be simply sidelined.\u201d",

In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass.

While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members.

Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has hit out at claims that Downing Street sought to restrict his access to some sensitive intelligence information when he became foreign secretary in mid-2016. The Conservative leadership frontrunner told a hustings of party members that \u201che was extremely dubious about the provenance\u201d of the story that had led the BBC morning bulletins and that it was untrue. Rumours have circulated in political and intelligence circles that Johnson\u2019s access to intelligence briefings was restricted during his time as foreign secretary, an interesting claim given that the role includes responsibility for MI6 and GCHQ. The BBC report said that in 2016 Downing Street did not want Johnson to be shown a category of sensitive secret intelligence. One source said this was down to \u201ccontrol freakery\u201d on the part of No 10 rather than fears about whether Johnson could be trusted. Johnson\u2019s campaign team has obtained assurances from Downing Street insiders from the time, who insisted there was no attempt to prevent him from seeing relevant intelligence. Downing Street in the early period of Theresa May\u2019s tenure was run by two joint chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy. People who worked for them at the time told the Guardian they were \u201cobsessed by controlling information\u201d, but they had no specific evidence that Johnson was singled out to be cut out of intelligence briefings. At the same hustings, Johnson\u2019s rival for the leadership and the current foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said there was a rule that ministers had to remain tight-lipped on intelligence matters. \u201cWe have the finest intelligence services in the world in this country \u2013 that does depend on some discretion by the foreign secretary so I\u2019m not going to breach that now,\u201d Hunt said. Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies are normally wary of becoming embroiled in any kind of political debate or dispute, and even raising the question has caused nervousness in the intelligence community. Whitehall sources said ministers received briefings or information that was appropriate to their role in government, and that general procedure was followed in Johnson\u2019s case. It would be normal for a prime minister to have more information than their senior prime ministers, as only Downing Street would have the full set of available information at any one time. Sources close to Johnson say there was no row at the time about being denied access and added that he saw everything he should have seen as foreign secretary. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said on Friday: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on intelligence matters.\u201d Asked whether May had trusted Johnson at the time, she said yes. The spokesperson added: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of fact that it was the PM\u2019s decision to appoint Boris Johnson as FS in full knowledge of all the responsibilities that that involves.

We always knew the Tory leadership campaign would, eventually, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/jeremy-hunt-promises-vote-on-repeal-of-foxhunting-ban\" title=\"\">come down to foxhunting</a>. Why wouldn\u2019t the most consequential leadership election of our lifetimes, one that could potentially define this country\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world and bring ruin to our economy for decades to come, be defined by a debate on whether or not it is right to tear a live animal apart with angry dogs?</p> <p>Having been at plenty of dinner parties with middle-class Tories from the home counties, I can tell you there are really only three topics of conversation \u2013 foxhunting, Hugh Bonneville, and London knife crime statistics (the latter only since Sadiq Khan became mayor). These debates are not usually naturally occurring, but rather brought up by the host to distract from the fact that the venison is a little dry, or that Tabitha has clearly been having a torrid six-month affair with the gamekeeper. And the same applies here. Jeremy Hunt has made \u2013 and then quickly retracted \u2013 a promise of a free vote on foxhunting, mostly to distract from the fact that economists and EU negotiators have roundly dismissed his detailed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/30/jeremy-hunt-i-would-tell-bust-businesses-no-deal-brexit-was-worth-it\" title=\"\">no-deal plan</a>. You might wonder what foxhunting has to do with the immediate Brexit-related problems facing this country right now, but we should give Hunt credit \u2013 hunting in a post-no-deal world will at least be fairer on the foxes, as beagles will have to learn urban parkour to navigate the miles of static trucks in what will be The Lorry Park Formerly Known As Kent.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to think that Hunt came up with this idea by randomly picking the names of MPs who supported him out of a hat and turning the words into a policy (\u201cField-Hands-Hunt-Fox \u2013 and so should we all!\u201d). In reality it\u2019s part of a very cunning media plan to make him more palatable to Tory members \u2013 which has the side-effect of making him look completely unhinged to normal people. Up until recently, Hunt tried to present himself as the Sensible One in this campaign, which fell apart on two counts. First, trying to be the Sensible One in a Tory leadership contest is like trying to be the Brainy One at a Chimpanzee Faeces Throwing Tournament \u2013 no one is judging you on those terms. Second, Hunt isn\u2019t the Sensible One \u2013 you can tell because he\u2019s still a member of the sex death cult formerly known as the Conservative party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/tories-have-drunk-the-no-deal-brexit-kool-aid\">Tories have drunk the no-deal Brexit Kool-Aid | Matthew d\u2019Ancona</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hunt keeps talking about how he can be trusted because he worked in business \u2013 but so did Christian Bale\u2019s character in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/06/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">American Psycho</a>. Hunt bullied junior doctors into an unsafe and irresponsible contract, and now uses it as evidence that he can \u201cdo deals\u201d, ignoring the fact that those doctors are now <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2019/01/25/why-are-so-many-doctors-quitting-the-nhs-its-time-to-ask-the-right-questions/\" title=\"\">fleeing the NHS in record numbers</a>. And let\u2019s not forget: he was a major part of the sensible coalition government that sensibly pushed a policy of mass unnecessary (but very sensible) austerity, which sensibly led to the deaths of thousands of vulnerable people, sensibly facilitated the destruction of local communities and sensibly suppressed wages throughout the country. And after all that, he agreed to an extremely sensible referendum that would blow up the entire sensible political system that he was a part of.</p> <p>So what changed? Hunt gave a hint in an answer at a recent hustings when he said that \u201cin this country, it\u2019s people that tell politicians what to do, not politicians that tell people what to do\u201d. Apart from fundamentally misunderstanding representative democracy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt/status/1144566921146318848\" title=\"\">this quote</a> explains Hunt\u2019s change in campaign direction. He\u2019s realised that, far from a Sensible Politician, the thing most members want more than anything is someone who will facilitate their most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/tories-have-drunk-the-no-deal-brexit-kool-aid\" title=\"\">bloodthirsty bidding</a>. As such, he\u2019s pivoted to being the best parody of a Conservative member that he can be.</p> <p>Foxhunting? Sure, bring it back.

      "bodyText": "Deep down, we always knew it would end this way. Like England losing in a World Cup semi-final, like Piers Morgan starting a fight with a gay footballer, like the Dalai Lama revealing himself to be as woke as a man from the 1970s who tells random women to \u201csmile more, love\u201d. We always knew the Tory leadership campaign would, eventually, come down to foxhunting. Why wouldn\u2019t the most consequential leadership election of our lifetimes, one that could potentially define this country\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world and bring ruin to our economy for decades to come, be defined by a debate on whether or not it is right to tear a live animal apart with angry dogs? Having been at plenty of dinner parties with middle-class Tories from the home counties, I can tell you there are really only three topics of conversation \u2013 foxhunting, Hugh Bonneville, and London knife crime statistics (the latter only since Sadiq Khan became mayor). These debates are not usually naturally occurring, but rather brought up by the host to distract from the fact that the venison is a little dry, or that Tabitha has clearly been having a torrid six-month affair with the gamekeeper. And the same applies here. Jeremy Hunt has made \u2013 and then quickly retracted \u2013 a promise of a free vote on foxhunting, mostly to distract from the fact that economists and EU negotiators have roundly dismissed his detailed no-deal plan. You might wonder what foxhunting has to do with the immediate Brexit-related problems facing this country right now, but we should give Hunt credit \u2013 hunting in a post-no-deal world will at least be fairer on the foxes, as beagles will have to learn urban parkour to navigate the miles of static trucks in what will be The Lorry Park Formerly Known As Kent. It\u2019s tempting to think that Hunt came up with this idea by randomly picking the names of MPs who supported him out of a hat and turning the words into a policy (\u201cField-Hands-Hunt-Fox \u2013 and so should we all!\u201d). In reality it\u2019s part of a very cunning media plan to make him more palatable to Tory members \u2013 which has the side-effect of making him look completely unhinged to normal people. Up until recently, Hunt tried to present himself as the Sensible One in this campaign, which fell apart on two counts. First, trying to be the Sensible One in a Tory leadership contest is like trying to be the Brainy One at a Chimpanzee Faeces Throwing Tournament \u2013 no one is judging you on those terms. Second, Hunt isn\u2019t the Sensible One \u2013 you can tell because he\u2019s still a member of the sex death cult formerly known as the Conservative party. Hunt keeps talking about how he can be trusted because he worked in business \u2013 but so did Christian Bale\u2019s character in American Psycho. Hunt bullied junior doctors into an unsafe and irresponsible contract, and now uses it as evidence that he can \u201cdo deals\u201d, ignoring the fact that those doctors are now fleeing the NHS in record numbers. And let\u2019s not forget: he was a major part of the sensible coalition government that sensibly pushed a policy of mass unnecessary (but very sensible) austerity, which sensibly led to the deaths of thousands of vulnerable people, sensibly facilitated the destruction of local communities and sensibly suppressed wages throughout the country. And after all that, he agreed to an extremely sensible referendum that would blow up the entire sensible political system that he was a part of. So what changed? Hunt gave a hint in an answer at a recent hustings when he said that \u201cin this country, it\u2019s people that tell politicians what to do, not politicians that tell people what to do\u201d. Apart from fundamentally misunderstanding representative democracy, this quote explains Hunt\u2019s change in campaign direction. He\u2019s realised that, far from a Sensible Politician, the thing most members want more than anything is someone who will facilitate their most bloodthirsty bidding. As such, he\u2019s pivoted to being the best parody of a Conservative member that he can be. Foxhunting? Sure, bring it back. Abortion? Limit it to 12 weeks. Northern Ireland? What is that? If I can\u2019t get votes from it, it\u2019s not a real place. At this point, though, Jeremy, with election ballots being sent out, you have to go big, or go home (ie, back to the manor house in your constituency where none of the consequences of your cruel politics will affect you). Forget bringing back the death penalty \u2013 the real Tory member will only accept you if you bring back criminals being hung, drawn and quartered. You\u2019ll have to bring back section 28 too, and go further \u2013 make it illegal for anyone to mention Freddie Mercury or Megan Rapinoe within three miles of a school. And for a real vote winner, you\u2019ve got to at least explore the idea of getting back the empire. Bring back national service, get the children to build galley ships (made out of the finest British oak), and then make them row to the subcontinent, dammit, ready to invade again.
