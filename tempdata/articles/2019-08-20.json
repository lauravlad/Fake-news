Here is an extract from the clip broadcast by Sky News. Johnson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing that slightly, I think, complicates the picture is that our EU friends still clearly think that there is a possibility that parliament will block Brexit.

And Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether.</p> </blockquote> <p>Questioned specifically about a protester who has been pictured on the Royal Mile with a \u2018England get out of Scotland\u2019 banner, Sturgeon said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon also made reference to the online reaction to <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/scotland-decades-behind-in-attitudes-to-race-warns-national-poet-1-4985812\">comments made by the Scottish national poet Jackie Kay over the weekend about Scotland\u2019s relationship with race.</a> She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the heart of what she was saying was that for all the progress we have made, Scotland still has a lot of work to do on tackling racism and equality. She got a lot of criticism online from people who would not accept that there\u2019s anything wrong with Scotland and frankly we should never be complacent about racism or bigotry.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon was also challenged about the behaviour of independence supporters online, but said that there was \u201can unrealistic expectation given social media and the way people operate online that any leader of any party can police that completely\u201d.</p> <p>To laughter from the audience, she added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not responsible for everything people say on Twitter, thank God! It cuts both ways. Some, which I try not to look at, of the abuse I get would literally make your hair curl, it\u2019s horrible, misogynist, filthy, disgusting and women across all parties get that.

He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is that for unionists the Good Friday agreement was an agreement between Unionists and nationalists, and there isn\u2019t unionist consent for the backstop, and therefore there is no cross-community consensus on this proposal and that breaches the principles of the GFA.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his letter to Donald Tusk, Boris Johnson also made a similar argument. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has become increasingly clear that the backstop risks weakening the delicate balance embodied in the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. </p> <p>The historic compromise in Northern Ireland is based upon a carefully negotiated balance between both traditions in Northern Ireland, grounded in agreement, consent, and respect for minority rights. </p> <p>While I appreciate the laudable intentions with which the backstop was designed, by removing control of such large areas of the commercial and economic life of Northern Ireland to an external body over which the people of Northern Ireland have no democratic control, this balance risks being undermined. </p> <p>The Belfast (Good Friday) agreement neither depends upon nor requires a particular customs or regulatory regime. The broader commitments in the agreement, including to parity of esteem, partnership, democracy, and to peaceful means of resolving differences, can best be met if we explore solutions other than the backstop. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is a relatively novel argument from Johnson against the backstop, although some unionists have been making it for a while. It also contradicts the more conventional view (shared by everyone from Theresa May to Sinn Fein) which is that the backstop would help to maintain the Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>The GFA sought to stop Northern Ireland being contested territory by, among other provisions, allowing anyone born there to hold British citizenship, Irish citizenship, or both, and having an open border has been seen as an important enabling factor that helps to make fluid citizenship possible. May\u2019s government and the EU agreed the backstop because they thought that, without it, border controls would reappear, and territorial disputes would follow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1255ba778da2139974a845fec866cfc024ec2959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1255ba778da2139974a845fec866cfc024ec2959/0_247_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Donaldson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Donaldson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul MceElane/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bfdd98f081cf11cf19d73\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T14:49:35.033Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Unionism does not support backstop, says DUP leader Arlene Foster</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Arlene Foster </strong>found herself channelling Mandy Rice-Davies (an unlikely heroine for the DUP leader) when she was interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster earlier. Asked about Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, saying the backstop would have to be maintained, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not surprised by the taoiseach\u2019s reaction. I am almost tempted to say \u2018He would say that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u2019 </p> <p>But I think the letter that the prime minister has sent to President Tusk explains very clearly why the backstop cannot be entered into. </p> <p>Apart from, of course, the simple political reality that it has been rejected three times by the House of Commons, it is anti-democratic, it is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and, of course, it risks weakening the delicate balance, as is pointed out in the letter, between the parties to the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement. </p> <p>I think that\u2019s very important because, of course, the Belfast agreement has been used to justify the backstop but, as the prime minister points out, it doesn\u2019t have the support of ourselves - political unionism as we are so-called. </p> <p>I mean, when you look across unionism, we are all against the backstop so that should concern the Dublin government, because if the Dublin government is genuine and values the Belfast agreement they should be very concerned that unionism does not support the backstop. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"992e41ba4ad7ec209e8d322125bf25acc22d112d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992e41ba4ad7ec209e8d322125bf25acc22d112d/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arlene Foster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arlene Foster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T15:01:51.087Z\">at 4.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5c03188f08a0805bcc14ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T14:30:32.040Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the decision by the UK to stop sending ministers and officials to some EU meetings from September.

Here are the key points he made when he spoke to the media.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn criticised Boris Johnson for threatening a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have just spent the morning with a group of innovative small businesses here in Stevenage, all of whom do significant amounts of trade with the European Union. Some, themselves, are European Union nationals. </p> <p>They want us to continue to trade with Europe, and they are appalled at the idea of a no-deal Brexit, and I think the Prime Minister should go and talk to them.</p> <p>He needs to recognise that just holding the threat of a no-deal Brexit on October 31 towards the European Union isn\u2019t going to bring about a change, it\u2019s going to make things much worse. </p> <p>He created this arbitrary date by his behaviour during the Tory leadership campaign. He needs to wise up and stop the nonsense with October 31 and start talking seriously.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government plan to end freedom of movement immediately after 31 October under a no-deal Brexit would lead to a scandal that would amount to \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d.</strong> He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Priti Patel has announced that freedom of movement here in every form will end on October 31. It is an utterly ludicrous position she has adopted. </p> <p>Does that mean that a European Union national living in this country, possibly as a doctor, a nurse, a trauma surgeon, all kinds of things, goes home to see their family in Germany or Czech Republic or wherever else, they are not allowed back into this country? Is this another Windrush, on steroids? It is a ludicrous proposal. </p> <p>We rely on a lot of European nationals to maintain our industries, maintain our education services.</p> <p>I\u2019d just say to Priti Patel, cut the nonsense, and don\u2019t impose this again.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b210df6a778b283d7380c91eefb9417120e591b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b210df6a778b283d7380c91eefb9417120e591b/0_27_5245_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn meeting business leaders at Stevenage Business and Technology centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn meeting business leaders at Stevenage Business and Technology centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bfa708f08a0805bcc1484\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T14:00:21.706Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ministers and officials to stop attending some EU meetings from September, Barclay says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Brexit department has just announced that British ministers and officials will stop attending some EU meetings from Sunday 1 September (or in practice Monday 2 September - the EU does not schedule a lot of meetings on Sundays). Here\u2019s an extract from the news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has decided this week that from 1 September, UK officials and ministers will now only attend EU meetings where the UK has a significant national interest in the outcome of discussions, such as on security.</p> <p>This decision reflects the fact that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 31 October is now very close and many of the discussions in EU meetings will be about the future of the Union after the UK has left.</p> <p>As the PM has promised in the House of Commons in July, as a departing member state it makes sense to \u2018unshackle\u2019 officials from these EU meetings to enable them to better focus their talents on our immediate national priorities. This includes, as the top priority, work on preparations for Brexit on 31 October and on our future relationship with the EU, but also on pioneering new trade deals and promoting a truly global Britain.</p> <p>This decision is not intended in any way to frustrate the functioning of the EU. The UK\u2019s vote will be delegated in a way that does not obstruct the ongoing business of the remaining 27 EU members.</p> <p>Where matters of ongoing national interest are being discussed, the UK will continue to be present until 31 October.</p> </blockquote> <p>The department says decisions about which meetings ministers and officials attend will be made on a case by case basis. But Boris Johnson will definitely continue to attend European council, the meeting of EU leaders (although only one is scheduled between now and the end of October).</p> <p>In a statement <strong>Stephen Barclay</strong>, the Brexit secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An incredible amount of time and effort goes into EU meetings with attendance just the tip of the iceberg. Our diligent, world-class officials also spend many hours preparing for them whether in reading the necessary papers or working on briefings.</p> <p>From now on we will only go to the meetings that really matter, reducing attendance by over half and saving hundreds of hours. This will free up time for ministers and their officials to get on with preparing for our departure on October 31 and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b71f0bb8cba6832aff026356208199f0d64225a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b71f0bb8cba6832aff026356208199f0d64225a/0_3_5663_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Barclay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Barclay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bf7c88f084061ab3895a9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T13:41:17.330Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 tells Tusk there is 'no prospect of deal' unless withdrawal agreement reopened</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m back, and No 10 has responded to Donald Tusk\u2019s statement rejecting Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for the backstop.

Here are the key points from her interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Abbott said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/19/reckless-plan-to-cut-off-free-movement-alarms-eu-nationals\">government plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit</a> would \u201ccreate chaos\u201d and \u201cmake Windrush look like a minor blip\u201d.</strong> She explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s going to create chaos, it\u2019s going to be very problematic for business, but it\u2019s going to be very difficult for EU nationals. </p> <p>There are currently 3 million here altogether, a million have registered for settled status, there\u2019s no possibility of 2 million registering between now and the 31st October, and then those EU nationals that were here but haven\u2019t registered for settled status will be in the exact same position as the Windrush people. </p> <p>There will be people that came here perfectly legally, but will not have the paperwork to prove that and will have all sorts of problems with employers and the NHS and so on ...</p> <p>The way Boris [Johnson] is doing it is heading to a catastrophe [which] will make Windrush look like a minor blip.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She dismissed the government\u2019s claim that it could tighten criminal record checks on EU nationals wanting to enter the UK immediately after a no-deal Brexit</strong>. She said she did not see how criminality could be checked once access to EU databases was lost. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is one of the problems about leaving the EU without a deal is we will lose access to all the EU databases that the police and the security services have relied on and we will lose it on the stroke of the end of the day on October 31st.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She suggested that it would not be right for Jeremy Corbyn to stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit.</strong> Yesterday<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/aug/19/brexit-latest-news-jeremy-corbyn-speech-labour-could-be-officially-neutral-in-any-second-referendum-campaign-john-mcdonnell-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5d5a93188f08c7e177d4d2cd#block-5d5a93188f08c7e177d4d2cd\"> Corbyn refused to commit to backing remain in any referendum held after a general election</a>, with a credible leave option also on the ballot, and he and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, both suggested that in such a referendum Labour could remain neutral, with members free to campaign for either side. Asked about this, Abbott said Corbyn was trying to keep both wings of the party together. When Today\u2019s <strong>Justin Webb</strong> asked if it would be feasible for Corbyn to remain neutral in such a contest, she replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy is the leader of the Labour party, as Jo Swinson needs to remember, and he can\u2019t stay to one side on an issue such as this, but what he can do is try and bring both wings of the Labour movement together.</p> </blockquote> <p>Listening to the exchange, it was clear that what Abbott meant by \u201ccan\u2019t stay to one side\u201d was \u201ccan\u2019t stay on the sidelines\u201d, not \u201ccan\u2019t take one side\u201d. But when Webb pressed her again on this, asking her if she was saying Corbyn would have to campaign for remain, Abbott gave a more evasive answer. She replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that Jeremy will do what he\u2019s always done, which is do what he thinks is best for the country and best for the Labour movement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, when Webb tried again to get her to clarify what she was saying, Abbott said they should be talking about the Tories instead. She finally said that Labour would have to debate this, and that Corbyn would follow what the party decided.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She confirmed she personally would campaign for remain in any future referendum on Brexit.</strong> This is also what John McDonnell said yesterday. Abbott said that she and \u201cJohn Mac\u201d, as she called him, were \u201cspeaking as individuals\u201d.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cfba2d6deb75f83a700931fdc9699409414652f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cfba2d6deb75f83a700931fdc9699409414652f/0_4_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Abbott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane Abbott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T10:40:47.630Z\">at 11.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d5bb23f8f08a0805bcc114f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-08-20T08:46:53.812Z\">9.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Brexit party has also criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to the EU.</p> <p>This is from its leader, <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/15/guardian-eu-referendum-debate-with-farage-clegg-alan-johnson-and-leadsom-live?page=with:block-56e88cc0e4b0d6cdda5302b2#block-56e88cc0e4b0d6cdda5302b2\">who only three years ago was saying he would welcome a Norway-style Brexit.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1163528836425900032\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Even without the backstop, this is still the worst \u201cdeal\u201d in history. <a href=\"https://t.co/tzOPjYaDL9\">https://t.co/tzOPjYaDL9</a></p>&mdash; Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1163528836425900032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And this is from <strong>Richard Tice,</strong> chair of the Brexit party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TiceRichard/status/1163532915550109696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s be clear: the WA even without the backstop is still the worst deal in history, is not Brexit and the Brexit Party will fight it tooth and nail.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has blamed those MPs trying to stop a no-deal Brexit for the EU\u2019s refusal to compromise on the backstop. But he has also claimed that, despite the EU\u2019s response to his proposal for an alternative to the backstop being \u201ca bit negative\u201d, he thinks a deal will be achieved in the end. (See 5.45pm and 6.02pm.) British officials will stop attending most EU meetings from September, the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, has said, suggesting his department would slash attendance by more than half to \u201cunshackle\u201d officials and ministers. Stopping freedom of movement immediately on 31 October could lead to a situation like \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d and the idea is \u201cutterly ludicrous\u201d, Jeremy Corbyn has said. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is another extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s clip for Sky News. Johnson said that in his meetings with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron later this week, and at the G7, he would be saying that the backstop would have to go. He said that the UK was not going to have checks at the border in Northern Ireland in any circumstances, and that that it was \u201ca bit odd\u201d that it was the EU who thought that checks might be necessary. And he insisted that alternatives to the backstop could be negotiated in the future talks on a long-term trade deal. Then he went on: You know what. At the moment it is absolutely true that our friends and partners are a bit negative. I saw what Donald Tusk had to say, and it wasn\u2019t redolent of a sense of optimism. But I think, actually, we will get there. I think there\u2019s a real sense now that something needs to be done with this backstop. We can\u2019t get it through parliament as it is. So I\u2019m going to go at it with a lot of oomph, as you would expect, and I hope we will be making some progress in the course of the next few weeks. Boris Johnson has recorded a clip for broadcasters, and in it he has effectively blamed those MPs trying to stop a no-deal Brexit for the fact that the EU is refusing to compromise on the backstop. Here is an extract from the clip broadcast by Sky News. Johnson said: One thing that slightly, I think, complicates the picture is that our EU friends still clearly think that there is a possibility that parliament will block Brexit. And as long as they think there\u2019s a possibility that parliament will block Brexit they are unlikely to be minded to make the concessions that we need. So it is going to take a bit of patience. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has told an audience at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that there is \u201cno place in Scotland\u201d for anti-English sentiment, insisting that the \u201ccivic nationalism\u201d of the SNP was \u201con another spectrum altogether\u201d from \u201cfar right, racist, insular movements\u201d seen in other parts of the world. Asked by comedian Matt Forde about Scottish nationalism, Sturgeon said: A lot of the regimes called nationalist today are not countries striving to be independent, because often they already are, but are based on some kind of racial exceptionalism or superiority - often very illiberal and oppressive of minorities. And Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether. Questioned specifically about a protester who has been pictured on the Royal Mile with a \u2018England get out of Scotland\u2019 banner, Sturgeon said: The person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP. Sturgeon also made reference to the online reaction to comments made by the Scottish national poet Jackie Kay over the weekend about Scotland\u2019s relationship with race. She said: At the heart of what she was saying was that for all the progress we have made, Scotland still has a lot of work to do on tackling racism and equality. She got a lot of criticism online from people who would not accept that there\u2019s anything wrong with Scotland and frankly we should never be complacent about racism or bigotry. Sturgeon was also challenged about the behaviour of independence supporters online, but said that there was \u201can unrealistic expectation given social media and the way people operate online that any leader of any party can police that completely\u201d. To laughter from the audience, she added: I\u2019m not responsible for everything people say on Twitter, thank God! It cuts both ways. Some, which I try not to look at, of the abuse I get would literally make your hair curl, it\u2019s horrible, misogynist, filthy, disgusting and women across all parties get that. There\u2019s a much bigger debate, not confined to Scotland, about how social media is distorting our political debate. Here is the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, on Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the EU was ready to find a solution to the backstop issue during a visit to Iceland today. According to Reuters, she said: The moment we have a practical arrangement on how to preserve the Good Friday agreement and at the same time define the borders of the [European Union\u2019s] internal market, we would not need the backstop anymore. This means we would naturally think about practical solutions. And I\u2019ve always said that when one has the will to find these solutions, one can do so in a short period of time. The EU is ready to find a solution. According to Reuters, Merkel said this would not require the withdrawal agreement to be re-opened and was instead a question for the so-called political declaration on future relations. On the World at One Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, claimed that the backstop would be contrary to the Good Friday agreement. He explained: The reality is that for unionists the Good Friday agreement was an agreement between Unionists and nationalists, and there isn\u2019t unionist consent for the backstop, and therefore there is no cross-community consensus on this proposal and that breaches the principles of the GFA. In his letter to Donald Tusk, Boris Johnson also made a similar argument. He said: It has become increasingly clear that the backstop risks weakening the delicate balance embodied in the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. The historic compromise in Northern Ireland is based upon a carefully negotiated balance between both traditions in Northern Ireland, grounded in agreement, consent, and respect for minority rights. While I appreciate the laudable intentions with which the backstop was designed, by removing control of such large areas of the commercial and economic life of Northern Ireland to an external body over which the people of Northern Ireland have no democratic control, this balance risks being undermined. The Belfast (Good Friday) agreement neither depends upon nor requires a particular customs or regulatory regime. The broader commitments in the agreement, including to parity of esteem, partnership, democracy, and to peaceful means of resolving differences, can best be met if we explore solutions other than the backstop. This is a relatively novel argument from Johnson against the backstop, although some unionists have been making it for a while. It also contradicts the more conventional view (shared by everyone from Theresa May to Sinn Fein) which is that the backstop would help to maintain the Good Friday agreement. The GFA sought to stop Northern Ireland being contested territory by, among other provisions, allowing anyone born there to hold British citizenship, Irish citizenship, or both, and having an open border has been seen as an important enabling factor that helps to make fluid citizenship possible. May\u2019s government and the EU agreed the backstop because they thought that, without it, border controls would reappear, and territorial disputes would follow. Arlene Foster found herself channelling Mandy Rice-Davies (an unlikely heroine for the DUP leader) when she was interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster earlier. Asked about Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, saying the backstop would have to be maintained, she said: I am not surprised by the taoiseach\u2019s reaction. I am almost tempted to say \u2018He would say that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u2019 But I think the letter that the prime minister has sent to President Tusk explains very clearly why the backstop cannot be entered into. Apart from, of course, the simple political reality that it has been rejected three times by the House of Commons, it is anti-democratic, it is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and, of course, it risks weakening the delicate balance, as is pointed out in the letter, between the parties to the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement. I think that\u2019s very important because, of course, the Belfast agreement has been used to justify the backstop but, as the prime minister points out, it doesn\u2019t have the support of ourselves - political unionism as we are so-called. I mean, when you look across unionism, we are all against the backstop so that should concern the Dublin government, because if the Dublin government is genuine and values the Belfast agreement they should be very concerned that unionism does not support the backstop. More on the decision by the UK to stop sending ministers and officials to some EU meetings from September. (See 3pm.) From my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels From Nicolai von Ondarza, from the German thinktank SWP From the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge Jeremy Corbyn has been discussing Brexit today with people running small businesses in Stevenage. Here are the key points he made when he spoke to the media. Corbyn criticised Boris Johnson for threatening a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. He said: I have just spent the morning with a group of innovative small businesses here in Stevenage, all of whom do significant amounts of trade with the European Union. Some, themselves, are European Union nationals. They want us to continue to trade with Europe, and they are appalled at the idea of a no-deal Brexit, and I think the Prime Minister should go and talk to them. He needs to recognise that just holding the threat of a no-deal Brexit on October 31 towards the European Union isn\u2019t going to bring about a change, it\u2019s going to make things much worse. He created this arbitrary date by his behaviour during the Tory leadership campaign. He needs to wise up and stop the nonsense with October 31 and start talking seriously. He said the government plan to end freedom of movement immediately after 31 October under a no-deal Brexit would lead to a scandal that would amount to \u201cWindrush on steroids\u201d. He explained: Priti Patel has announced that freedom of movement here in every form will end on October 31. It is an utterly ludicrous position she has adopted. Does that mean that a European Union national living in this country, possibly as a doctor, a nurse, a trauma surgeon, all kinds of things, goes home to see their family in Germany or Czech Republic or wherever else, they are not allowed back into this country? Is this another Windrush, on steroids? It is a ludicrous proposal. We rely on a lot of European nationals to maintain our industries, maintain our education services. I\u2019d just say to Priti Patel, cut the nonsense, and don\u2019t impose this again. The Brexit department has just announced that British ministers and officials will stop attending some EU meetings from Sunday 1 September (or in practice Monday 2 September - the EU does not schedule a lot of meetings on Sundays). Here\u2019s an extract from the news release. The government has decided this week that from 1 September, UK officials and ministers will now only attend EU meetings where the UK has a significant national interest in the outcome of discussions, such as on security. This decision reflects the fact that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on 31 October is now very close and many of the discussions in EU meetings will be about the future of the Union after the UK has left. As the PM has promised in the House of Commons in July, as a departing member state it makes sense to \u2018unshackle\u2019 officials from these EU meetings to enable them to better focus their talents on our immediate national priorities. This includes, as the top priority, work on preparations for Brexit on 31 October and on our future relationship with the EU, but also on pioneering new trade deals and promoting a truly global Britain. This decision is not intended in any way to frustrate the functioning of the EU. The UK\u2019s vote will be delegated in a way that does not obstruct the ongoing business of the remaining 27 EU members. Where matters of ongoing national interest are being discussed, the UK will continue to be present until 31 October. The department says decisions about which meetings ministers and officials attend will be made on a case by case basis. But Boris Johnson will definitely continue to attend European council, the meeting of EU leaders (although only one is scheduled between now and the end of October). In a statement Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said: An incredible amount of time and effort goes into EU meetings with attendance just the tip of the iceberg. Our diligent, world-class officials also spend many hours preparing for them whether in reading the necessary papers or working on briefings. From now on we will only go to the meetings that really matter, reducing attendance by over half and saving hundreds of hours. This will free up time for ministers and their officials to get on with preparing for our departure on October 31 and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead. I\u2019m back, and No 10 has responded to Donald Tusk\u2019s statement rejecting Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for the backstop. A Downing Street spokesman said: We are deeply invested in the peace, prosperity and security of Northern Ireland and always will be and we have been clear that we will never place infrastructure, checks, or controls at the border. But it is clear that unless the withdrawal agreement is reopened and the backstop abolished there is no prospect of a deal. It has already been rejected three times by MPs and is simply unviable as a solution, as the PM\u2019s letter makes clear. We are ready to negotiate, in good faith, an alternative to the backstop, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. The latest from Boris Johnson, which does not exactly move things on: Donald Tusk has rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to strip the backstop out of the Brexit deal, with a thinly veiled message that the British government was refusing to admit the lack of realistic alternatives. Ending the free movement of people with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would cause chaos and confusion for EU citizens on a scale that would make the Windrush scandal look like a minor blip, Diane Abbott has said. Abbott has suggested that Jeremy Corbyn could not stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit. (See 10.26am.) The government is holding on to more than \u00a328m in student loan overpayments by graduates that have been identified but not yet refunded. I\u2019m off for a bit to an important executive meeting (aka, a lunch). I\u2019ll be back after 2pm. In the meantime, a colleague will pick up the blog if there is any breaking news. Echoing the comment made by the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford (see 11.54am), the Sinn Fein leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has accused Boris Johnson of \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d over the peace process. In a statement she said: It is rank hypocrisy for Boris Johnson to claim to be acting in the interests of the peace process claiming it will be damaged by the backstop. In reality it is Boris Johnson\u2019s reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit that is threatening to undermine the peace process. Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday agreement and the Tories have shown a total and callous disregard to that agreement and to the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the north. The fact is that the British government has agreed to the backstop and Boris Johnson has voted for it himself. The EU have made it clear that the backstop is integral to the withdrawal agreement and it is necessary to avoid any hardening of the border. It is high time the Tories realised that too. The DUP has issued a statement backing the stance on the backstop taken by Boris Johnson in his letter to Donald Tusk. Here\u2019s an extract. We have been strongly highlighting the fact that unionism in Northern Ireland does not support the backstop. None of the main unionist parties and groupings support the backstop. If Europe and the Republic of Ireland are serious about ensuring and recognising that progress in Northern Ireland is founded on support from both major traditions then it will have to face the reality that the backstop is not the way forward. The DUP wants to see a negotiated and orderly exit from the European Union based on no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and no internal barriers to trade within the United Kingdom. The backstop has at its very heart an anti-democratic foundation where neither political representatives in London nor Belfast could change, or influence, rules made in Brussels to which Northern Ireland would be subjected. Those on all sides who genuinely want to see a deal will recognise that the backstop previously devised does not provide the basis for agreement. It may be the case that unionists in Northern Ireland reject the backstop, but a recent poll found that 58% of people in the region say they would prefer Northern Ireland, but not Great Britain, to remain aligned to the EU. This was the original backstop proposal made by the EU that was rejected by the DUP and the Conservative party because it would effectively put a regulatory border down the Irish Sea.

From the Financial Times editor Lionel Barber. Earlier I suggested that Boris Johnson\u2019s letter to Donald Tusk could be seen as just an elaborate exercise in attempted blame deflection. (See 9.25am.) This quote makes that interpretation look increasingly plausible. Judging by the use of the word \u201csad\u201d, government sources are starting to take their inspiration from Donald Trump. These are from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming in Brussels. These are from Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, on Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to the EU on the backstop. Here is the full quote from the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, on Boris Johnson\u2019s backstop proposal. She said: We welcome the UK government\u2019s engagement and continued commitment to an orderly withdrawal. We firmly believe this is in the best interests of both the EU and the UK. However, we also note that the letter does not provide a legal operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be and in fact it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transitional period. Otherwise, as we have said on many occasions, we do stand ready to work constructively with the UK and within our mandate. These are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has given his first response to the letter he received from Boris Johnson yesterday. He seems to be rejecting Johnson\u2019s proposal for an alternative to the backstop. In an interview on the Today programme James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, was asked about the point raised by Diane Abbott (see 10.26am) - the impact of a no-deal Brexit on criminal justice cooperation with the EU. Asked if Britain had had assurances from the EU that policing, intelligence and counter-terrorism sharing would continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Cleverly was unable to give a firm yes. Instead he replied: The EU are sensible pragmatic people and it would be in no-one\u2019s interest to reduce the amount of intelligence sharing and co-operation that we do. It\u2019s not in their interest, it\u2019s not in our interest, these are smart, sensible and pragmatic people and it is unrealistic to think that they would hamper their own safety or attempt to hamper ours, it\u2019s ridiculous. To those of you have have followed the Brexit debate closely after the last three years, this is a surprise return of the argument that used to be associated with BMW manufacturers and prosecco producers \u2013 that the UK and the EU were bound to agree a free trade deal because that would be in both sides\u2019 interests. And it would be. But the history of the Brexit negotiation that mutual self-interest is not, on its own, enough to secure a deal. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had the 8.10 slot on the Today programme this morning. Here are the key points from her interview. Abbott said government plans to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a no-deal Brexit would \u201ccreate chaos\u201d and \u201cmake Windrush look like a minor blip\u201d. She explained: I think it\u2019s going to create chaos, it\u2019s going to be very problematic for business, but it\u2019s going to be very difficult for EU nationals. There are currently 3 million here altogether, a million have registered for settled status, there\u2019s no possibility of 2 million registering between now and the 31st October, and then those EU nationals that were here but haven\u2019t registered for settled status will be in the exact same position as the Windrush people. There will be people that came here perfectly legally, but will not have the paperwork to prove that and will have all sorts of problems with employers and the NHS and so on ... The way Boris [Johnson] is doing it is heading to a catastrophe [which] will make Windrush look like a minor blip. She dismissed the government\u2019s claim that it could tighten criminal record checks on EU nationals wanting to enter the UK immediately after a no-deal Brexit. She said she did not see how criminality could be checked once access to EU databases was lost. She went on: The truth is one of the problems about leaving the EU without a deal is we will lose access to all the EU databases that the police and the security services have relied on and we will lose it on the stroke of the end of the day on October 31st. She suggested that it would not be right for Jeremy Corbyn to stay neutral in any future referendum on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn refused to commit to backing remain in any referendum held after a general election, with a credible leave option also on the ballot, and he and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, both suggested that in such a referendum Labour could remain neutral, with members free to campaign for either side. Asked about this, Abbott said Corbyn was trying to keep both wings of the party together. When Today\u2019s Justin Webb asked if it would be feasible for Corbyn to remain neutral in such a contest, she replied: Jeremy is the leader of the Labour party, as Jo Swinson needs to remember, and he can\u2019t stay to one side on an issue such as this, but what he can do is try and bring both wings of the Labour movement together. Listening to the exchange, it was clear that what Abbott meant by \u201ccan\u2019t stay to one side\u201d was \u201ccan\u2019t stay on the sidelines\u201d, not \u201ccan\u2019t take one side\u201d. But when Webb pressed her again on this, asking her if she was saying Corbyn would have to campaign for remain, Abbott gave a more evasive answer. She replied: I believe that Jeremy will do what he\u2019s always done, which is do what he thinks is best for the country and best for the Labour movement. Then, when Webb tried again to get her to clarify what she was saying, Abbott said they should be talking about the Tories instead. She finally said that Labour would have to debate this, and that Corbyn would follow what the party decided. She confirmed she personally would campaign for remain in any future referendum on Brexit. This is also what John McDonnell said yesterday. Abbott said that she and \u201cJohn Mac\u201d, as she called him, were \u201cspeaking as individuals\u201d. The Brexit party has also criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s offer to the EU. This is from its leader, Nigel Farage, who only three years ago was saying he would welcome a Norway-style Brexit. And this is from Richard Tice, chair of the Brexit party. As we report in our overnight story, EU sources were last night ruling out any renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, including the backstop. One well-informed source told the Guardian: There was a two and a half year negotiating process in which the EU compromised, including on the question of the backstop. The withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation and the backstop is not open for change. A legally operable backstop to avoid a hard border remains central to the withdrawal agreement for the EU27. Other reporters have been getting a similar message from their EU sources. These are from James Crisp, the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne. And these are from Charlie Cooper\u2019s London Playblook briefing for Politico Europe. Reaction 1: One EU diplomat told POLITICO\u2019s Lili Bayer: \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the letter that renegotiation is the last thing the British government wants. Brexit started and ends with preservation of the Tory party.\u201d Reaction 2: A French diplomatic official tells POLITICO\u2019s Rym Momtaz: \u201cReplacing the backstop with something that isn\u2019t defined gets rid of the guarantee the backstop was meant to provide. No checks, it\u2019s a joke, it means that the U.K. would accept that products that don\u2019t respect its rules enter its market without control? How long will that hold?\u201d Reminder: Johnson meets Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. Boris Johnson is meeting the EU\u2019s two most powerful national leaders, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, later this week. Last night, ahead of those meetings, he released his first proposal since he became prime minister for how the Brexit deal might be renegotiated. It came in the form of an open letter to Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president. You can read the four-page letter in full here (pdf). And here is our overnight story. Here is the key extract, where Johnson proposes how the backstop might be replaced. This government will not put in place infrastructure, checks, or controls at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We would be happy to accept a legally binding commitment to this effect and hope that the EU would do likewise. We must also respect the aim to find \u2018flexible and creative\u2019 solutions to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. That means that alternative ways of managing the customs and regulatory differences contingent on Brexit must be explored. The reality is that there are already two separate legal, political, economic, and monetary jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. This system is already administered without contention and with an open border. The UK and the EU have already agreed that \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019 can be part of the solution. Accordingly: - I propose that the backstop should be replaced with a commitment to put in place such arrangements as far as possible before the end of the transition period, as part of the future relationship. - I also recognise that there will need to be a degree of confidence about what would happen if these arrangements were not all fully in place at the end of that period. We are ready to look constructively and flexibly at what commitments might help, consistent of course with the principles set out in this letter. This morning opinion is divided as to whether this is a genuine offer, that could open the door to a very unlikely but not 100% impossible compromise solution, or just an elaborate exercise in attempted blame deflection. As is often the case when trying to explain motive in politics, it is probably best to assume that both factors are in play. But the opposition parties have been damning. Last night Labour issued this response, from the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Tony Lloyd. Boris Johnson seems to have forgotten that he voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal including the backstop. Whichever Brexit outcome he pursues, whether it\u2019s a disastrous no deal or this fantasyland wish list, Boris Johnson clearly has no qualms about putting jobs, rights, prosperity or peace in Northern Ireland at risk. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, posted this on Twitter. And the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, put out a statement saying: The backstop, agreed between the UK government and the EU, is there to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal to replace it with \u2018a commitment to put in place arrangements as far as possible before the end of the transition period\u2019 is so vague as to be deeply embarrassing. The border issue remains intractable and Johnson\u2019s intervention simply highlights after three years the Conservative government are no closer to identifying a credible solution. I will be posting more reaction as the day goes on. With parliament in recess, and much of the political class on holiday, there are only two diary items on the agenda for today. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn holds a meeting with business leaders in Hertfordshire. He is urging the government to publish the Operation Yellowhammer assessments of how disruptive a no-deal Brexit would be. 1.30pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is interviewed by Matt Forde at an Edinburgh fringe event. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at about 12.30pm and another when I wrap up. Unusually, I will be taking a break over lunch, so the blog will go quiet then for a bit. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "You report how a pregnant rape survivor experiencing a miscarriage and barely able to stand was unlawfully held in immigration detention which amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment (Home Office pays \u00a350,000 to trafficked woman detained during miscarriage, 20 August). This case show precisely why the Home Office must heed our advice and that of the medical profession, and actually ban the detention of pregnant women. Medical Justice sent volunteer midwives to visit pregnant women in immigration detention for a decade. We warned the Home Office that women and their unborn children were suffering inadequate healthcare. The Home Office paid little attention. In 2013 we published Expecting Change, a dossier calling for a ban on the detention of pregnant women, backed by the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as well as 337 other organisations. One of our clients complained for three weeks about abdominal pains and was sent to A&amp;E, where she miscarried with two guards in attendance. She subsequently attempted suicide and was admitted into a psychiatric ward. In 2016 the Home Office commissioned Stephen Shaw, a former prison and probation ombudsman, to review the use of immigration detention \u2013 he too called for a ban on the detention of pregnant women. In his 2018 follow-up, he called again for a ban \u2013 an option the Home Office again chose not to implement. Immigration detention is optional, so the Home Office is responsible for any woman miscarrying in detention. The Home Office must do the right thing, urgently, and ban the detention of pregnant women.
