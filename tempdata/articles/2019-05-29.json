      "bodyText": "John Bercow staying on as Speaker may not be enough to help parliament stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal at the end of October, according to one of the leading MPs trying to stop a hard Brexit. Nick Boles, who helped with efforts to legislate against a no-deal Brexit at the end of March, warned it would be extremely difficult for parliament to make such a successful attempt again. MPs have already voted against leaving the EU without a deal, but the Conservative leadership candidates Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey have all said they would be prepared to leave the EU, deal or no deal, at the end of October. MPs fighting against a hard Brexit cheered when Bercow told the Guardian on Tuesday that he would not vacate the Speaker\u2019s chair while Brexit was unresolved. He also warned Tory leadership candidates that the idea they could sideline parliament in the Brexit debate was \u201cunimaginable\u201d and \u201cfor the birds\u201d. However, Boles, who resigned the Conservative whip over the failure of efforts to reach a Brexit compromise, said there were \u201cextraordinary levels of complacency about the chances of MPs finding a way to stop no-deal Brexit on 31 October\u201d, with people \u201cblithely assuming MPs will find a way\u201d. He said stopping a \u201cno-deal Brexit requires legislation to compel the government to seek an extension to article 50. \u201cFor anyone other than the government to be able to move a new piece of legislation requires standing orders to be suspended. \u201cSuspending standing orders requires a motion or an amendment to that effect. Government controls the order paper so it can stop any motions that might be used in this way from being tabled. \u201cThe Speaker can assert that parliament\u2019s voice will be heard. No doubt it will. But voices alone aren\u2019t enough. We need to pass a law. Neither the Speaker nor MPs can magic the opportunity to do so out of thin air.\u201d Challenged on whether the Speaker could defy convention to allow backbencher time to bring forward legislation, Boles said the idea was \u201cwishful thinking\u201d, because the Speaker had \u201cno power to do that\u201d. On the suggestion that MPs could force a no-confidence vote in the government, he said a new Conservative prime minister could \u201cavoid losing power after vote of no confidence by keeping negotiations going until EU Council on 17-18 October then prorogue parliament until 4 November\u201d. His comments reflect alarm among many MPs campaigning against a no-deal Brexit that a Eurosceptic prime minister could try to force the UK to leave without a deal regardless of parliament\u2019s wishes. Raab has even suggested he would be ready to ignore the will of parliament in order to do so, telling BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for parliament now to legislate against a no deal, or in favour of a further extension, unless a resolute prime minister is willing to acquiesce in that \u2013 and I would not.\u201d The Institute for Government said there might be no decisive route left for parliament to block a no deal. However, some experts questioned whether there was the potential for an engaged Speaker to grant emergency motions or be more flexible in his interpretation of parliamentary convention to create opportunities for MPs to have their say. The prospect of Bercow staying on longer despite widespread expectation he would depart this summer has infuriated Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who believe he may try to defy convention to help the remain cause. Bercow said on Tuesday he maintained strict impartiality and simply stood up for MPs\u2019 rights. But James Duddridge, a Conservative MP who previously tried to raise support for a no-confidence motion in the Speaker, said: \u201cBercow does not want to resolve Brexit. He wants to block it. He wants to veto the referendum result and will abuse the role of Speaker to advance his cause. He is even trying to comment on the leadership campaign. Pompous, egocentric, undemocratic and dishonourable.\u201d Another critic, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, said: \u201cWe are going to face not only a parliament that is overwhelmingly remain but a partisan Speaker intent on overturning the democratic will of the British people expressed at the referendum to leave the European Union.\u201d The Tory Brexiter Mark Francois said: \u201cAs one vertically challenged MP to another, my sole advice to Speaker Bercow is: if you are going to stay on in these momentous times that\u2019s fair enough, but it is important that all the players on the pitch retain confidence in the objectivity of the referee until the end of the match.\u201d Maria Miller, the chair of the women and equalities committee, weighed in, saying Bercow should not be allowed to stay on longer as Speaker in light of last October\u2019s damning report about sexist bullying in parliament. Bercow had faced calls to step down after the report by Laura Cox, but the pressure ebbed away after friends privately suggested he was planning to step aside in July. \u201cThe Cox report was clear that the House of Commons needs a wholesale change in leadership to address an unacceptable culture of bullying and harassment,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe Cox report specifically includes the Speaker in that recommendation, the most senior person in the House of Commons. No MP should stand by and allow the Speaker to continue in his post.\u201d Cox\u2019s inquiry suggested that senior house staff, including Bercow, would not command the confidence to pursue necessary changes to the system for dealing with harassment and bullying. Bercow told friends and other MPs he was planning to depart in summer 2019 but gave no public confirmation and then changed his mind after the UK failed to leave the EU in March. Any move against Bercow is likely to be unsuccessful because he would be shored up by opposition parties and some Conservatives keen on his approach to ensuring parliament has a say on Brexit. The Speaker won support from some Labour figures, including Barry Sheerman, who said he was delighted to learn Bercow had decided to \u201cdo his duty\u201d and \u201csee us through these troubled times\u201d. Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer and former cabinet minister, said: \u201cJohn Bercow is absolutely right to stay in post until Brexit is resolved.

At present academies and free schools cannot be run for profit.</p> \n<p>Raab wrote that opening up schools to profit-making companies could help to raise capital investment for education at a time when funding from central government was under pressure, arguing that such a move would help raise standards.</p> \n<p>He acknowledged there was an \u201cunderstandable sensitivity of introducing the profit motive into schooling\u201d, suggesting that as well as the 50% profit limit on, dividends should only be paid if educational performance standards were met and that there should be a bar on the sale for commercial gain of school assets purchased with public money.</p> \n<p>However, Labour called on Raab to say he would not implement the policy as prime minister and demanded that the education secretary, Damian Hinds, and the other leadership candidates also ruled out such a move.</p> \n<p>Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives have already done enough damage to our schools but even Margaret Thatcher didn\u2019t dare to privatise them.<br><br>\u201cEducation should be a right, not a commodity to be bought and sold. The Tories have absolutely no mandate for policies like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has been fighting against school funding cuts, added: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute total and utter nonsense to let the market decide what is best for our children. The children that get left behind will not be profitable.</p> \n<p>\u201cDisabled children, kids with special educational needs, kids from domestic violence backgrounds, who struggle to fit into the system we created will not make the largest profit. Just introduce him to [former justice secretary] Chris Grayling and ask him how well the whole probation privatisation went.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raab has quickly become one of the favourites in the leadership race, having taken a tough line on the UK leaving the EU at the end of October regardless of whether a deal has been approved.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"48718617-39ff-43f6-86a7-0f462acf4b95\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers.

The team\u2019s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\">It may not have worked</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Johnson came first in the final round of MP voting with 160 votes.</b><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, he has also written extensively about his domestic policy ideas over the years.

      "bodyText": "Tory leadership hopeful Dominic Raab has been described as more rightwing than Margaret Thatcher over his proposal to let state schools be run by profit-making companies Raab, who is second favourite in the race to be the next prime minister, made the case for privately run state schools in 2013 and again in 2014, saying the government should open up the education system for companies to make money. The idea is one of a number of rightwing proposals put forward by Raab in pamphlets over the years. The former Brexit secretary has also suggested encouraging more private companies into the NHS by giving them tax breaks or paying them premiums, and scrapping the 45% top rate of income tax, instead having a basic rate at 15% and a higher rate at 35%. Asked whether Raab still endorsed the idea of letting companies run state schools, his spokesman did not rule out the proposal, saying: \u201cDominic has set out his priorities to fight for a fairer Britain \u2013 a fairer deal for workers by cutting taxes for those on low and middle incomes, a fairer society by boosting apprenticeships and getting a fairer deal from Brussels.\u201d In his 2013 paper Capitalism for the Little Guy, Raab suggested the government should \u201clift the bar on profit-making companies running academies and free schools\u201d, subject to a minimum of 50% of profits being reinvested into the school. At present academies and free schools cannot be run for profit. Raab wrote that opening up schools to profit-making companies could help to raise capital investment for education at a time when funding from central government was under pressure, arguing that such a move would help raise standards. He acknowledged there was an \u201cunderstandable sensitivity of introducing the profit motive into schooling\u201d, suggesting that as well as the 50% profit limit on, dividends should only be paid if educational performance standards were met and that there should be a bar on the sale for commercial gain of school assets purchased with public money. However, Labour called on Raab to say he would not implement the policy as prime minister and demanded that the education secretary, Damian Hinds, and the other leadership candidates also ruled out such a move. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives have already done enough damage to our schools but even Margaret Thatcher didn\u2019t dare to privatise them. \u201cEducation should be a right, not a commodity to be bought and sold. The Tories have absolutely no mandate for policies like this.\u201d Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has been fighting against school funding cuts, added: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute total and utter nonsense to let the market decide what is best for our children. The children that get left behind will not be profitable. \u201cDisabled children, kids with special educational needs, kids from domestic violence backgrounds, who struggle to fit into the system we created will not make the largest profit. Just introduce him to [former justice secretary] Chris Grayling and ask him how well the whole probation privatisation went.\u201d Raab has quickly become one of the favourites in the leadership race, having taken a tough line on the UK leaving the EU at the end of October regardless of whether a deal has been approved. However, he has also written extensively about his domestic policy ideas over the years. He has proposed scrapping all \u201clevies subsidising green technologies\u201d on energy bills, ending the minimum wage for the under-21s working for small businesses and making it easier for companies to sack underperforming employees. The MP for Esher and Walton has also spoken of wanting to scrap the Government Equalities Office, which he describes as \u201cpointless\u201d, and merging the Department for International Development into the Foreign Office. When Raab was challenged at the weekend over his claim from 2011 that feminists were some of the most obnoxious bigots and that men were getting a raw deal, he appeared to stand by the position. On the BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, he said: \u201c[It is] really important that in the debate on equality we have a consistency and not double standards and hypocrisy.\u201d Pressed by ITV on Wednesday on whether he would describe himself as a feminist, Raab said: \u201cNo, probably not. But I would describe myself as someone who\u2019s a champion of equality and meritocracy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened: Boris Johnson is to be summoned to court to face accusations of misconduct in public office over comments made in the run-up to the EU referendum, a judge has ruled. Johnson lied and engaged in criminal conduct when he repeatedly claimed during the 2016 EU referendum that the UK sent \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, lawyers for a 29-year-old businessman who has launched the prosecution bid told a court last week. Opposition MP have welcomed the summons and questioned Johnson\u2019s fittest to be prime minister. LibDem leadership hopeful, Ed Davey, said: \u201cGiven Johnson wants to be the next prime minister of this country, it\u2019s only right that he is held accountable.\u201d But commentators predicted the summons would boost Johnson\u2019s campaign. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has said the decision to expel Alastair Campbell for voting Lib Dem was \u201cspiteful\u201d. In a rebuke to Labour\u2019s HQ, Watson said members who voted for other parties should be listened to rather than punished. The Tory leadership hopeful Matt Hancock has laid Johnson for dismissing business warnings against a hard Brexit. Hancock also poured cold water on the claims of candidates who said they would take the UK out of the EU by the end of October whether or not there was a deal. Five of the Tory contenders have signed a pledge to keep the contest clean in a move being seen as bid to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign. So far it has been signed by Dominic Raab, Hancock, Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart and Kit Malthouse. Johnson supporter, Nadine Dorries, said the pledge was a \u201cdirty tricks\u201d campaign by Raab. John Bercow has said he plans to stay in his post as Speaker of the House of Commons despite previous expectations he was about to leave, risking the fury of hardline Eurosceptics who believe he wants to thwart a no-deal Brexit. The Speaker told the Guardian it was not \u201csensible to vacate the chair\u201d while there were major issues before parliament. Rory Stewart has pledged to double spending on climate change and the environment as he warned the UK must do more in the face of an \u201cenvironmental cataclysm\u201d. The International Development Secretary warned a million species could be lost and 100 million more people could be plunged into poverty unless more is done. Speaking on Sky News, Stewart also said he would double the UK\u2019s diplomatic budget and \u201ccompletely reframe\u201d the intelligence services. He said: \u201cI want to make DfID (the Department for International Development) centred on climate change and the environment.\u201d Stewart said he wants to double the amount of DfID\u2019s budget being spent on tackling climate change, taking it from \u00a31.1bn to \u00a32.2bn. He said the increase would be met over a five-year period. Stewart warned: \u201cWe are facing an environment cataclysm. Quite literally the ice shelf is going 10 times more quickly than people expected, we are about to lose maybe a million species on Earth and that is even before you count the fact that 100 million more people will be in poverty unless we tackle this. We have to tackle this.\u201d Stewart continues to attract praise from left leaning commentators, but he is struggling in the leadership race with only three Tory MPs willing to publicly back him. The Scottish government\u2019s constitutional relations secretary, Michael Russell, has described the SNP\u2019s victory in the European election as a \u201cfresh start\u201d for independence. He said that Scotland had \u201csaid loudly and clearly that it was a European nation\u201d, adding that the conditions for holding a second independence referendum set out in the SNP\u2019s 2016 manifesto had been \u201cmet in full\u201d as the UK was now heading for a no deal Brexit. Setting out the new referendum bill, published this morning, Russell said that one of the key lessons from Brexit was that \u201cthere is a need for reconciliation\u201d. He put put forward cross-party talks and a a citizen\u2019s assembly to discuss Scotland\u2019s future. Russell also announced that the secretaries of an Irish initiative used to successfully reform Ireland\u2019s abortion laws, would be visiting Holyrood to speak to MSPs about the initiative next month. Russell concluded that the Scottish government was trying \u201cto get away from the negativity and nastiness of the current Brexit process\u201d. He added: \u201cScotland deserves, and this week, has clearly demanded better. We must create a country in which we all feel we have gained something worth having, in which we all feel part of a shared national endeavour regardless of which side of the argument we have come from\u2026.That is the fresh start the people of Scotland have offered us.\u201d Ruth Davidson, leader of Scotland\u2019s Conservatives, has vowed to block the new bill. John Bercow should not be allowed to stay on longer as Speaker in light of last year\u2019s damning report about sexist bullying in parliament, Maria Miller, the chair of the women and equalities committee, has said. Miller said MPs should take a stand against Bercow, after the Speaker indicated he wanted to stay in the chair until Brexit is resolved, contrary to previous expectations that he would leave the post soon. The Speaker faced calls to step down after last October\u2019s report by Dame Laura Cox but the pressure ebbed away after friends of Bercow privately indicated he was planning to step aside in July this year. \u201cThe Cox report was clear that the House of Commons needs a wholesale change in leadership to address an unacceptable culture of bullying and harassment,\u201d Miller said. On Tuesday, Bercow told the Guardian that he plans to stay on as Speaker. And in a speech in Washington, he said it was \u201cfor the birds to think\u201d to think that parliament could be sidelined in the debate over Brexit. \u201cThe idea that parliament is going to... be evacuated from the centre-stage of the debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable,\u201d he said. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chairman, has hit out at second referendum campaigners for sneering at \u201cordinary people\u201d with pro-Brexit views and sniping at those who want to see the results of the 2016 poll respected. As Jeremy Corbyn faces intense pressure to back a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d in the wake of the European elections, Lavery argued in an article for the Guardianthat Labour would not win a general election \u201csimply by fighting for the biggest share of the 48%\u201d. He said both sides needed to come together to fight the prospect of a no-deal Brexit being pushed by some of the Conservative leadership candidates who are competing to be the next prime minister. \u201cAs someone who has opposed a so-called public vote, not least because parliament has no majority for it in principle and nobody has the faintest idea what we would actually put on the ballot, I have been doggedly attacked by certain sections of the party, as well as those on the outside,\u201d he said. Tory leadership candidates, Rory Stewart and Sajid Javid, have said they would block Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s plan to hold a second independence referendum for Scotland. Update: James Cleverly has also pledged to try to block a second Indy Ref. MP David Davies, who backs a hard Brexit, describes the court summons as \u201cdeeply sinister\u201d. Stephen Parkinson, the former deputy head of the attorney general\u2019s office, has expressed surprise at the Johnson courts summons. Parkinson, now a senior partner at Kingsley Napley, said: \u201cFreedom of political debate forms the bedrock of any democratic system. Clearly, if politicians were exposed to prosecution for the statements that they make in campaigns, that would have a chilling effect on our politics and undermine democracy. \u201cThe offence of misconduct in public office has become almost fashionable parlance recently given the frequency with which it is cited. However these types of prosecutions are still very rare.\u201d Meanwhile, my colleague Ben Quinn, looks at what happens next: Legal guidance on \u2018misconduct in public office\u2019 Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far today: Boris Johnson is to be summoned to court to face accusations of misconduct in public office over comments made in the run-up to the EU referendum, a judge has ruled. Johnson lied and engaged in criminal conduct when he repeatedly claimed during the 2016 EU referendum that the UK sent \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, lawyers for a 29-year-old businessman who has launched the prosecution bid told a court last week.

John Bercow has said he plans to stay in his post as Speaker of the House of Commons despite previous expectations he was about to leave, risking the fury of hardline Eurosceptics who believe he wants to thwart a no-deal Brexit. The Speaker told the Guardian it was not \u201csensible to vacate the chair\u201d while there were major issues before parliament. Ed Davey, who is expected to run to be the new Lib Dem leader, welcomed the court summons for Johnson. In a statement released by the pro-EU group, Best for Britain, Davey said: \u201cBoris Johnson has never had to rely on these vital public services. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t care about the impact of his campaign slogans. \u201cThree years down the road and our NHS is on its knees. EU staff are leaving in their droves, having been made to feel unwelcome, while local hospitals around the country have warned that they won\u2019t be able to deliver critical services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWe cannot let our communities down like this. Boris Johnson facing court is a sideshow - we need a final say vote on Brexit so that we can prevent the catastrophe he started.\u201d Opposition MPs have seized on the summons. Labour\u2019s David Lammy tweeted: \u201cRegardless of what happens in court, this charlatan should never be allowed to become PM.\u201d Ladbrooks still has Johnson as the favourite to win the leadership race, but he\u2019s also 2-1 to drop out before the first round of voting. Peter Shilton, former England goalie turned pro-Brexit conspiracy theorists, smells a rat: Commentators continue to predict it will be a boost for Johnson. Here\u2019s the full text of the decision to summon Johnson to court: In her written decision summoning Johnson to court, District Judge Margot Coleman also said: \u201cThe applicant\u2019s case is there is ample evidence that the proposed defendant knew that the statements were false. \u201cOne example is given that in a televised interview in May 2016 the proposed defendant stated, \u2018we send the EU 10 billion per year\u2019 and that therefore he knew that the 350 million per week figure (20 billion per year) was incorrect.\u201d She said: \u201cI accept that the public offices held by Mr Johnson provide status but with that status comes influence and authority. \u201cI am satisfied there is sufficient to establish prima facie evidence of an issue to be determined at trial of this aspect. I consider the arguments put forward on behalf of the proposed defendant to be trial issues.\u201d Some commentators reckon Johnson\u2019s court summons will be a boost to his leadership bid. Johnson\u2019s response to claims of misconduct was outlined in the ruling, describing the application as a \u201c(political) stunt\u201d. His position in summary said: \u201cThis application is brought for political purposes. The position presented to the Court is that this is a disinterested attempt to improve the standards of political debate. \u201cThe reality of this enterprise is different. The \u2018Prosecutor\u2019 (a limited company) is \u2018Brexit Justice Limited\u2019. Brexit Justice Limited is the product of a campaign to undermine the result of the Brexit referendum, and/or to prevent its consequences. \u201cThe company and this application owe their existence to the desire on the part of individuals such as Mr Ball to undermine the referendum result. The \u2018Brexit justice\u2019 which is ultimately sought is no Brexit.\u201d The ruling said: \u201cThe court is dealing with an application, dated 20th February 2019 and received by this court on the 25th February 2019, for a summons against the proposed defendant, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, for three offences alleging misconduct in a public office.\u201d It said that although there is no obligation on the court to give written reasons why an application for a summons is granted or refused, \u201cthis is an unusual and exceptional application with a considerable public interest and it is right that full reasons are provided to the unsuccessful party\u201d. Boris Johnson will be summoned to court to face accusations of misconduct in public office over claims he was lying when he said the UK gave the EU \u00a3350m a week, PA reports. The favourite to win the Tory leadership race faces a private prosecution by campaigner Marcus Ball. Lawyers representing Ball lodged an application to summons Johnson to court, claiming he had deliberately misled the public during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016 and then repeated the statement during the 2017 general election. In a written decision, District Judge Margot Coleman said Mr Johnson will be summoned to court. She wrote: \u201cThe allegations which have been made are unproven accusations and I do not make any findings of fact. Having considered all the relevant factors I am satisfied that this is a proper case to issue the summons as requested for the three offences as drafted. The charges are indictable only. \u201cThis means the proposed defendant will be required to attend this court for a preliminary hearing, and the case will then be sent to the Crown Court for trial. \u201cThe charges can only be dealt with in the Crown Court.\u201d Ball has raised more than \u00a3200,000 through a \u2018Brexit Justice\u2019 crowdfunding campaign to pay for the private prosecution. Neil Findlay, the Scottish Labour MSP who oversaw his party\u2019s disastrous European election campaign, has made clear he disagrees with its sudden switch in favour of a people\u2019s vote on Brexit. Findlay, until now right hand man for Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, suddenly resigned from the party\u2019s frontbench at Holyrood on Tuesday and announced he was stepped down from the Scottish parliament at the next election in 2021. One of Corbyn\u2019s most influential allies in Scotland, Findlay admitted in a BBC interview he shared the blame for his party\u2019s humiliating defeat, losing both its MEPs and 200,000 votes. \u201cI played a part in that election and clearly I have some responsibility for that; and I have never in my life shirked my responsibilities,\u201d he said, before taking aim at his centrist opponents in the party. But he criticised Leonard\u2019s conversion in the last 48 hours to emphatically back a second EU referendum and to support remain in any new vote, even if a Brexit deal is shaped by Labour \u2013 a position which goes further than Corbyn\u2019s reluctant admission a fresh referendum is now necessary. Fuelling suspicions this dispute played a part in his decision to resign, Findlay told BBC Scotland it would fuel the Scottish National party\u2019s calls for a second independence referendum: \u201cI have a difficulty in arguing for a second referendum because you then open up the issue of another referendum on Scotland. If the next one goes a different way, d\u2019you think the people who lose out in that referendum will stop calling for it? We\u2019re going to be in absolute neverendum territory.\u201d It was Scottish Labour\u2019s worst electoral performance since 1910 and the result in West Lothian, where Findlay was born and still lives, may have played a part in his decision to quit. In common with the rest of Scotland, Labour\u2019s vote in West Lothian collapsed from 31.7% in the 2014 European elections to 11.5% last week, only two points above the Tories and five points below the Brexit party. Legislation has just been published that could pave the way for a fresh vote on Scottish independence. The Holyrood parliament is anticipating a lunchtime statement from constitutional relations secretary Michael Russell on how the Referendums (Scotland) Bill will work. This bill has been much-trailed, and we know what it won\u2019t say: no date, question or referendum period. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has committed to securing the necessary transfer of powers from Westminster. This is something that Theresa May has consistently ruled out, but Sturgeon has yet to ask explicitly ask for the transfer of powers. Sturgeon is still suggesting that she\u2019d like to hold a referendum before the next Holyrood elections in 2021. She said: \u201cNow, more than ever, it is essential that we keep Scotland\u2019s options open so that people have the opportunity to choose a better future.\u201d \u201cAn independence referendum within this parliamentary term will give Scotland the opportunity to choose to be an independent European nation - rather than have a Brexit future imposed upon us.\u201d As with most developments around Scottish independence, this may be interpreted \u2013 and over-interpreted \u2013 as SNP sabre-rattling, or an attempt to mollify hardline activists who have been growing increasingly frustrated with the party leadership\u2019s more gradualist approach. But it undeniably adds momentum to the independence question and - if a referendum does not happen before 2021, which remains a very real possibility - the next Holyrood election campaign will be far more explicitly about the constitution. Former lord chancellor and Labour peer, Charlie Falconer, has joined criticism of Labour over the expulsion of Alastair Campbell. He told the Today programme: \u201cIf it was an offence under the rules, then I suspect thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of members of the Labour Party at the European elections broke the rules and that\u2019s not a tenable position.\u201d The decision, he said, was \u201cbound to have been taken high up the chain\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important, I think, to underline that how you operate your disciplinary process sends a message as a political party about the things that you are really concerned about.\u201d Falconer said he voted Labour in the European elections, was not in favour of a second referendum and trying to find a deal was the right answer. Speaking to Sky News, Falconer agreed that Labour had showed double standards on the swift expulsion of Campbell compared to how it has dealt with members accused of antisemiticism. He said: |A political party\u2019s disciplinary process is a means of sending out signals as to what is acceptable and what is not. And being antisemitic has got to be completely unacceptable and that means the disciplinary process has got to be swift, effective and clear as to what it finds acceptable.\u201d YouGov founder and Labour party member, Peter Kellner, says he should have been expelled from Labour years ago for voting tactically. The Tory leadership race is tightening according to a tally of MPs who have declared support for one of the candidates. The count, by Conservative Home, still puts Jeremy Hunt on top with 28 supporters (down one since Tuesday). But Boris Johnson is a close second on 26, with Michael Gove hot on his heels on 25 and Dominic Raab on 22. Sajid Javid is a distant fifth on 12 supporters and like the others appears to be struggling to cut through. Boris Johnson is the favourite with the bookies followed by joint second favourites Michael Gove and Dominic Raab. Watson\u2019s statement will fuel the row in Labour about support for a second referendum and claims of double standards. On Tuesday Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that Campbell was \u201cexpelled quicker than a man who threatened to kill me [and] quicker than a man in my [local party] who denied the Holocaust\u201d, adding that the two had only been suspended. The former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke called on the party to reinstate Campbell and said he also voted Liberal Democrat in the European elections. \u201cHis expulsion from Labour party membership is a disgrace and only compounds Labour\u2019s current political difficulties,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cI also voted Liberal Democrat. This was a one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour\u2019s position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit. Fiona MacTaggart, a former Labour minister who was an MP for Slough, admitted she also voted LibDem and urged others to do the same in a \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d fashion. Letter writers to the Guardian agreed: Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has stepped up the row about the expulsion of Alastair Campbell, by branding the move \u201cspiteful\u201d. In a statement he called for an \u201camnesty\u201d for members who did not support the party at the European elections. He said: \u201cIt is very clear that many thousands of Labour Party members voted for other parties last week. They were disappointed with the position on Brexit that a small number of people on the NEC inserted into our manifesto. They were sending the NEC a message that our position lacked clarity and they were right. \u201cIt is spiteful to resort to expulsions when the NEC should be listening to members. \u201cThe politics of intolerance holds no future for the Labour Party. A broad church party requires pluralism and tolerance to survive. \u201cThere should be an amnesty for members who voted a different way last week. \u201cWe should be listening to members rather than punishing them.\u201d Esther McVey has doubled down on her support for a no-deal exit, in the face of warnings that this would risk the government losing a vote of no confidence. Writing in the Telegraph she says: \u201cWe need to stop wasting time having artificial debates about renegotiating backstops or resurrecting botched deals ... The only way to deliver the referendum result is to actively embrace leaving the EU without a deal.\u201d The Tory leadership hopeful Matt Hancock has laid into his rival Boris Johnson for dismissing business warnings against a hard Brexit, saying: \u201cTo the people who say fuck business, I say fuck fuck business\u201d. Hancock also poured cold water on the claims of candidates who said they would take the UK out of the EU by the end of October whether or not there was a deal. He said: \u201cThe brutal reality is, \u2018no deal\u2019 is not a policy choice available to the next prime minister.\u201d Johnson was reported last year to have said \u201cfuck business\u201d when questioned about their concerns around a no-deal Brexit, although sources close to him say he was referring to anti-EU business lobby groups and not companies. James Cleverly has become the latest Tory leadership candidate to flirt with the idea of leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal. No deal, he said, was \u201cstill one of the options\u201d but added \u201cit is not my preferred destination\u201d. He told Today no deal would be \u201can added level of uncertainty and difficulty at a time when we could well do without that, we absolutely can deliver a Brexit with no deal\u201d. He added: \u201cUntil we have delivered Brexit we will not have the legitimacy to talk about any of the other issues that we absolutely have to talk about.\u201d So far four of the candidates: Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab, and Esther McVey have pledged to leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October. In response several senior Conservatives, including the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the former education secretary, Justine Greening, have hinted that they could vote to bring down the government to stop a no-deal Brexit. Clevery said candidates needed to be realistic. Reacting to John Bercow\u2019s pledge to stay on as Speaker, Cleverly said: \u201cWell I\u2019ve long known that the House of Commons and the Speaker in his fastidiously impartial way will do everything they can to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t take no deal off the table. My current role in government is to make sure that the country is prepared to leave without a deal if that\u2019s what happens, but the House of Commons has expressed its will on a number of occasions and the Speaker has facilitated the House expressing its will and that is reality. So we\u2019ve got to deal with the realities and it\u2019s no good for anybody, potential leaders or otherwise, to suggest there are some simple, easy ways of sorting this out.\u201d Boris Johnson supporter, Nadine Dorries, claims the clean campaign pledge is a \u201cdirty tricks campaign\u201d by Raab. She reckons Johnson wasn\u2019t asked to sign it before it was published. Hard Brexiter, Steve Baker, who is still considering launching a leadership bid, also accused Raab of not consulting other candidates about the clean pledge. Presumably Matt Hancock agreed not to speak ill of his fellow Conservatives and keep the campaign clean before he took this expletive-laden swipe at Boris Johnson. Rory Stewart, who is heading for Wigan on his campaign tour of the UK, has become the fourth candidate to sign Raab\u2019s clean campaign pledge after complaining of negative briefings against him. Louise Ellman, the veteran MP for Liverpool Riverside, has said her party is now in a \u201cvery shameful situation\u201d after the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced it was launching a formal investigation into allegations of Labour antisemitism. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Ellman, who is Jewish, said: \u201cThis issue has been festering for about three years now. \u201cThe Labour Party hasn\u2019t taken proper action against anti-Semitism within its own ranks and now the EHRC, itself set up by the Labour Party, is investigating the party itself for anti-Semitism, it\u2019s a very shameful situation to have reached.\u201d The party, she said, needed to have taken \u201cimmediate action\u201d, but had for long a time \u201cdenied there was a problem\u201d and there was a \u201cclear campaign where it was alleged that people making allegations of anti-Semitism were doing so simply to smear the leader of the Labour Party\u201d. Ellman added: \u201cThe party has simply failed to act, it has responded when there has been public exposure of its failings, but otherwise it hasn\u2019t acted.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s quite a contrast there with the speed of action. Alastair Campbell was expelled very quickly indeed, as I understand it without any kind of hearing, whereas the allegations of anti-Semitism just roll on and very little action is taken.\u201d \u201cI certainly couldn\u2019t say I will never leave the party, but it is true to say that I find it extremely difficult to leave the party that I\u2019ve been so involved with and represented over so very many years.\u201d Welcome to politics live and another day on the increasingly crowded Conservative leadership hustings. Three of the Tory contenders have signed a pledge to keep the contest clean in a move being seen as bid to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign. It was organised by Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit rival Dominic Raab. So far it has been signed by both the health secretary, Matt Hancock and the home secretary Sajid Javid after complaints that the campaign is turning nasty. Rory Stewart accused his leadership rivals of poor taste after a Tory source suggested he was a \u201csuicide bomber\u201d candidate attempting to clear the path for Michael Gove. Stewart, who previously served as a governor in Iraq during the Iraq war, told the Guardian he found the trope offensive. He said he believed the negative briefings were coming from Johnson\u2019s supporters and suggested he was being targeted because of growing support for his candidacy. His comments came after Johnson-backing MP Nadine Dorries accused Stewart of running a Stop Boris campaign on behalf of Michael Gove. \u201cThe stop Boris team in all its nasty glory,\u201d she tweeted. Under the new pledge candidates commit \u201cdo all that I can to encourage my supporters to keep their campaigning clean \u2013 particularly on social media\u201d. It also says: \u201cI will not allow third parties to spend money on online advertising to support my candidacy. All spending on my campaign will be declared properly.\u201d On Tuesday the Guardian revealed an online campaign putting pressure on Conservative MPs to back Boris Johnson being run by Paul Staines, the founder of the Guido Fawkes blog. Boris on the Ballot, which launched this weekend, is designed to encourage members of the public to write to their local Tory MP and encourage them to nominate Johnson for leader. Meanwhile, Brexit minister, James Cleverly, the 11th candidate to enter the race, is setting out his leadership pitch. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has promised to reverse Conservative cuts to front line policing, if he becomes prime minister. Also today Speaker John Bercow has risked the fury of Eurosceptics by signalling he wishes to stay on in the post. And Labour is under pressure to ballot members on a second referendum.",

That is a very big deal. Only one political party has come under EHRC scrutiny before, and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/05/28/human-rights-watchdog-launches-statutory-investigation-labour/\" title=\"\">that was the BNP</a>. It should be a day of shame that an organisation that likes to boast that combating prejudice is in its DNA is now under investigation for that very offence. And make no mistake: the EHRC does not make such a move lightly. It only rarely undertakes a full-scale investigation (the last comparable inquiry was into the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-metropolitan-police-service\" title=\"\">Metropolitan police</a> several years ago). Human rights lawyers who work closely with the EHRC say the commission would not launch a full investigation into Labour unless they had seen evidence of institutional racism that was \u201ccredible and serious\u201d.</p> <p>So how to bury this particular piece of bad news? The answer appears to have come in the form of Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/labour-expels-alastair-campbell-from-party\" title=\"\">expulsion from the Labour party</a>. That story <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattChorley/status/1133375274626813954\" title=\"\">promptly knocked the EHRC inquiry down the running order</a> and gave supporters of the leadership a hate figure to attack: \u201cAlastair Campbell\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier started the Iraq war and left a million dead,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeoplesMomentum/status/1133343475255173121\" title=\"\">tweeted Momentum</a>, apparently forgetting the minor supporting role played by George W Bush and the United States military. \u201cBeing kicked out of the party is the least he deserves\u201d. All so much more fun than having to bow your head in shame at the realisation that your movement now stands alongside the BNP in the category of political parties deemed to merit statutory investigation for racism.</p> <p>Still, if that was a deliberate tactic of news management \u2013 with Campbell more spinned against than spinning \u2013 it came at a cost. For one thing, it invited an obvious comparison. How striking that Labour was able to move so swiftly against Campbell \u2013 with expulsion coming less than 36 hours after his admission of voting Lib Dem \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\" title=\"\">when it had taken two years or more</a> to expel party members guilty of anti-Jewish racism or, just as often, failed to expel them at all. MPs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessphillips/status/1133339190370996224\" title=\"\">stepped forward to wonder</a> why it was that Holocaust deniers were still members of their local Labour party, months and years after they\u2019d been reported, while Campbell had been so rapidly ejected. A party\u2019s disciplinary actions tell you a lot about their priorities, and what this says is that Labour regards a protest vote against Brexit as a greater crime than spreading neo-Nazi hatred.</p> <p>The defence is that Campbell\u2019s case was straightforward, because support for another party is punished by \u201cauto-exclusion\u201d, automatic expulsion with no need for any legal process. Trouble is, that\u2019s not quite right. Labour\u2019s former head of compliance, Mike Creighton, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MJCreighton/status/1133368235376746497\" title=\"\">who knows the Labour rule book better than most</a>, explained that \u201cAnnouncing after the polls closed that you voted for another candidate does not breach the rules in any way. Voting for another party is not in itself a breach of rule however much people wish it were.\u201d</p> <p>That rather undermines the defenders of Campbell\u2019s expulsion who have been arguing that the move was not some cunning bit of politicking by Team Corbyn, that it was barely a deliberate decision taken by a human being, but rather was done almost automatically, as if by an algorithm. Their goal is to make \u201cauto-exclusion\u201d seem like a universal rule, consistently applied, regardless of whether the rule-breaker was straying to the left or right.</p> <p>But, again, the facts stand in the way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/the-expulsion-of-alastair-campbell-is-a-spartacus-moment-for-labour-members\" title=\"\">Witness the letter to the Guardian</a> recalling the thousands of Labour party members who voted against the party\u2019s official candidate in the 2000 London mayoral election, Frank Dobson, preferring to vote and actively campaign for Ken Livingstone, who ran as an independent. Did the hated Blair, the control freak\u2019s control freak, issue those rebels with instant auto-exclusion notices? No, he did not. They faced no sanction whatsoever.</p> <p>And yet Labour officials <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labourpress/status/1133373903403999232\" title=\"\">confidently insisted yesterday</a> that \u201cpublicly declaring or encouraging support for another candidate or party is against the rules and is incompatible with party membership.\u201d That will have come as news to one party member who tweeted what looked a lot like a warm declaration of support and encouragement for \u201canother candidate or party\u201d back in 2012. The candidate in question was George Galloway, who had just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/30/george-galloway-bradford-spring-labour\" title=\"\">defeated Labour</a> in a byelection in Bradford West. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/185542633056239616\" title=\"\">message of support was effusive</a>: \u201cCongratulations to George Galloway on astonishing result in Bradford. Big message here on opposition to wars and austerity.\u201d Who wrote that tweet? Why, it was none other than one Jeremy Corbyn. Needless to say, he did not receive an auto-exclusion notice either.</p> <p>The truth is, this is displacement activity.

      "bodyText": "As a dead cat, Alastair Campbell has proved most effective. You\u2019ll recall the advice of the rightwing election guru Lynton Crosby, who recommended that a politician about to face a scandal or crushing revelation throw a dead cat on the table: onlookers might be appalled, even disgusted \u2013 but at least you\u2019d have changed the subject. On Tuesday, confirmation came that the Equality and Human Rights Commission is to investigate the Labour party over anti-Jewish racism. That is a very big deal. Only one political party has come under EHRC scrutiny before, and that was the BNP. It should be a day of shame that an organisation that likes to boast that combating prejudice is in its DNA is now under investigation for that very offence. And make no mistake: the EHRC does not make such a move lightly. It only rarely undertakes a full-scale investigation (the last comparable inquiry was into the Metropolitan police several years ago). Human rights lawyers who work closely with the EHRC say the commission would not launch a full investigation into Labour unless they had seen evidence of institutional racism that was \u201ccredible and serious\u201d. So how to bury this particular piece of bad news? The answer appears to have come in the form of Tony Blair\u2019s former director of communications, and his expulsion from the Labour party. That story promptly knocked the EHRC inquiry down the running order and gave supporters of the leadership a hate figure to attack: \u201cAlastair Campbell\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier started the Iraq war and left a million dead,\u201d tweeted Momentum, apparently forgetting the minor supporting role played by George W Bush and the United States military. \u201cBeing kicked out of the party is the least he deserves\u201d. All so much more fun than having to bow your head in shame at the realisation that your movement now stands alongside the BNP in the category of political parties deemed to merit statutory investigation for racism. Still, if that was a deliberate tactic of news management \u2013 with Campbell more spinned against than spinning \u2013 it came at a cost. For one thing, it invited an obvious comparison. How striking that Labour was able to move so swiftly against Campbell \u2013 with expulsion coming less than 36 hours after his admission of voting Lib Dem \u2013 when it had taken two years or more to expel party members guilty of anti-Jewish racism or, just as often, failed to expel them at all. MPs stepped forward to wonder why it was that Holocaust deniers were still members of their local Labour party, months and years after they\u2019d been reported, while Campbell had been so rapidly ejected. A party\u2019s disciplinary actions tell you a lot about their priorities, and what this says is that Labour regards a protest vote against Brexit as a greater crime than spreading neo-Nazi hatred. The defence is that Campbell\u2019s case was straightforward, because support for another party is punished by \u201cauto-exclusion\u201d, automatic expulsion with no need for any legal process. Trouble is, that\u2019s not quite right. Labour\u2019s former head of compliance, Mike Creighton, who knows the Labour rule book better than most, explained that \u201cAnnouncing after the polls closed that you voted for another candidate does not breach the rules in any way. Voting for another party is not in itself a breach of rule however much people wish it were.\u201d That rather undermines the defenders of Campbell\u2019s expulsion who have been arguing that the move was not some cunning bit of politicking by Team Corbyn, that it was barely a deliberate decision taken by a human being, but rather was done almost automatically, as if by an algorithm. Their goal is to make \u201cauto-exclusion\u201d seem like a universal rule, consistently applied, regardless of whether the rule-breaker was straying to the left or right. But, again, the facts stand in the way. Witness the letter to the Guardian recalling the thousands of Labour party members who voted against the party\u2019s official candidate in the 2000 London mayoral election, Frank Dobson, preferring to vote and actively campaign for Ken Livingstone, who ran as an independent. Did the hated Blair, the control freak\u2019s control freak, issue those rebels with instant auto-exclusion notices? No, he did not. They faced no sanction whatsoever. And yet Labour officials confidently insisted yesterday that \u201cpublicly declaring or encouraging support for another candidate or party is against the rules and is incompatible with party membership.\u201d That will have come as news to one party member who tweeted what looked a lot like a warm declaration of support and encouragement for \u201canother candidate or party\u201d back in 2012. The candidate in question was George Galloway, who had just defeated Labour in a byelection in Bradford West. The message of support was effusive: \u201cCongratulations to George Galloway on astonishing result in Bradford. Big message here on opposition to wars and austerity.\u201d Who wrote that tweet? Why, it was none other than one Jeremy Corbyn. Needless to say, he did not receive an auto-exclusion notice either. The truth is, this is displacement activity. Labour can debate expulsions and begin purges in a quest for ideological purity \u2013 or it can face the reality: namely, that it was just trounced in a UK-wide election, reduced to 14% even when taking on the most divided, incompetent and discredited government of modern times; that it came third in Wales and fifth in Scotland. It can punish the lifelong supporters who voted for other parties out of a desperate desire for someone, anyone, to oppose the calamity of Brexit \u2013 but, if it chooses that path, it should brace itself for the consequences. As Kevin Maguire of the Mirror puts it, \u201cExpel every Labour member who voted Lib Dem or Green last week and Labour will shrink from Europe\u2019s largest political party to one of the smallest\u201d. It can kick out Campbell. It can even kick out the many other Labour members now stepping forward, Spartacus-style, to admit that they too broke ranks last Thursday. Or it can ask itself why those devoted supporters felt compelled to break the habit of a lifetime \u2013 and do what\u2019s needed to bring them back. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",
