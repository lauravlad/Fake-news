But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/18/pm-faces-brexit-extension-even-if-his-deal-is-passed\">Letwin amendment may thwart that</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>EU27 leaders suggested a further extension would be unlikely.</strong> The French president said he did not think one would be granted, while the Irish taoiseach said the UK should not expect one. On Thursday, there were mixed signals over whether or not a delay could be agreed and Johnson has sought to present Saturday\u2019s planned meaningful vote as the last chance to leave with a deal.</li> \n   <li><strong>One thing the Letwin amendment would provide is more time to consider the ramifications of Johnson\u2019s agreement.</strong> Among other considerations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/18/boris-johnson-launches-frantic-sales-pitch-of-brexit-deal-ahead-of-commons-vote-politics-live?page=with:block-5da998ac8f08993584c890e8#block-5da998ac8f08993584c890e8\">MPs were told</a> they will not see any official economic analysis of its impact before Saturday\u2019s votes.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are Labour MPs in seats that voted 60, 70% to leave and they will, of their own volition, regardless of anything I could say to them, be thinking about how do they best represent their own voters. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In fact new research from the <strong>British Election Study</strong>, which studies voting behaviour in considerable detail through an extensive database going back years, suggests that Rees-Mogg is wrong. Even in constituencies that voted leave in 2016 by large majorities, the people voting Labour are predominantly remain supporters, the research found.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract from <strong>Ed Fieldhouse</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/labours-electoral-dilemma/#.XancE29KhHd\">write-up for the British Election Study website. </a>(I have highlighted some of the highlights in bold)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First, while 68% of Labour voters voted to remain in the EU in 2016, what about voters in those seats which voted to Leave the EU? Dividing countries in to leave and remain seats and subdividing by the 2017 winner, the BES data shows that in Labour seats where there was a leave majority, 60% of Labour voters voted to remain in 2016 compared to 76% in remain seats. In other words while unsurprisingly there were more Labour leave voters in leave seats, on average there was still a substantial remain majority. <strong>Even in those with a leave vote of greater than 60%, a clear majority (57%) of Labour voters voted remain in 2016.</strong></p> \n   <p>Of course, Labour is not looking to win only the votes of those who supported them in 2017, and some people have changed their Brexit preferences since 2016. Rather than focus on 2017 vote and 2016 EU referendum vote we can use the BES to look at the Brexit preferences of all potential Labour voters in May 2019. We defined respondents who scored Labour on a like-dislike scale at least 5 on a 0-10 scale as potential supporters, making up 46% of all respondents that said they would vote and had decided how to vote.</p> \n   <p><strong>Overall 70% of these potential Labour voters said they would vote to remain in the EU, with only 21% preferring to leave</strong>, with the rest saying they \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 or \u2018would not vote\u2019 in another referendum. In leave constituencies these figures change only slightly to 65% and 25% respectively. When we narrow this down to Labour seats we see little evidence to suggest that Labour MPs in leave constituencies who are concerned about their re-election prospects need worry more about alienating leave voters than remain voters. In Labour held sets with a leave majority the figures are almost identical: 64% remain and 25% leave.<strong> Even in strong leave Labour seats (where leave vote exceeded 60%) the number of potential Labour voters who would vote remain (62%) is more than twice the number who would vote Leave (26%).</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fieldhouse says the view expressed by Rees-Mogg (also shared by some Labour MPs, who worry that a remain stance will cost them votes in leave areas) is what social scientists call \u201can ecological fallacy\u201d. Fieldhouse explains: \u201cJust because Labour voters disproportionately live in leave areas doesn\u2019t mean that they are more likely to be Leave voters themselves.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong><br></strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5da9dcb38f08c78d1cb4e806\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-18T15:53:46.552Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has tabled two motions for the debate tomorrow; the first, approving Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal; and a second, alternative one, approving a no-deal Brexit.

For obvious reasons, the government wanted to restrict the chances for its motion to be amended.</p> \n  <p>Taking advantage of his own rule change, Letwin has tabled an amendment to the government motion tomorrow. It has heavyweight, cross-party support, with those backing it including Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, and Philip Hammond, the former chancellor.</p> \n  <p>You can read the text of the Letwin amendment on the order paper <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201920/cmagenda/OP191019.pdf\">here (pdf)</a>. The amendment would remove almost all the government motion (which says the Commons has approved the Brexit deal) and says the Commons is withholding approval of the deal until the legislation implementing it has been passed.</p> \n  <p>As Letwin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/17/eu-leaders-gather-for-summit-as-boris-johnson-scrambles-to-get-backing-for-brexit-deal-politics-live?page=with:block-5da860f48f08c78d1cb4e169#block-5da860f48f08c78d1cb4e169\">explained in the debate yesterday</a>, his aim is to close a loophole in the Benn act. The legislation forces the PM to request a Brexit extension if a deal has not been passed by the end of tomorrow. A vote in favour of the deal tomorrow would have meant there was no need for the PM to request an extension. But if the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) failed to get through parliament by 31 October, the UK could end up leaving with no deal by accident. Letwin\u2019s amendment would lead to the PM having to request an extension tomorrow, on the proviso that if the WAB gets through by the end of October, at that point the extension would be withdrawn. You could call it a backstop.</p> \n  <p>The Benn act passed by 29 votes at second reading and it is likely that the Letwin amendment, which is just intended to copper bottom the Benn act, will also pass tomorrow.</p> \n  <p>If it does, the make-or-break vote on Johnson\u2019s deal will never actually take place. Instead MPs will vote on a bland motion (see below), which could go through on the nod.</p> \n  <p>At that point, if Johnson complies with <a href=\"https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/docs/default-source/cos-general-docs/pdf-docs-for-opinions/2019csoh77.pdf?sfvrsn=0\">the assurances that he gave to the court of session in Scotland</a>, he will have to write a letter to the EU requesting an extension.</p> \n  <p>And at that point Johnson would have to decide whether to try to pass his withdrawal agreement bill by 31 October, to release him from the obligation to take up the extension - or whether to accept the extension, and then hold the election that Labour has promised to back in the event of an extension happening. He would campaign promising to implement his Brexit deal - against Labour promising a further negotiation.</p> \n  <p>This is starting to get speculative, but what is clear is that there is now a real chance that \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d could turn out not to be the make-or-break Brexit moment people have been expecting.</p> \n  <p>Assuming that Letwin\u2019s amendment passes, this is the motion, as amended, that MPs would be voting on.

Because provided we can get that clear assurance, and I have been given it so far by people like Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, and I\u2019m hoping to get it from the prime minister tomorrow, that we will be leaving after the trade talks, if those trade talks fail up to December 2020, on no-deal terms - as long as we can get that assurance, and I think we have done, then we\u2019ll be supporting the deal tomorrow.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Under the government\u2019s current plan the UK would leave the EU legally on 31 October but then remain in a transition until December 2020, during which most aspects of EU law would continue to apply. Ministers claim that they will be able to negotiate a new trade relationship with the EU before the end of next year, but the withdrawal agreement allows the transition to be extended for an extra year or two years and most trade experts think that in practice this will be necessary because there is very little chance of negotiating a trade deal within 14 months.

It was published by the <strong>UK in a Changing Europe</strong>, an academic research network, and it is based on economic modelling of Theresa May\u2019s deal, Johnson\u2019s deal, and a WTO Brexit (ie, no deal).</p> \n  <p>The report says UK trade would be lower under all three options than it would be if the UK stayed in the EU, with Johnson\u2019s plan being considerably more damaging than May\u2019s. Looking ahead 10 years, it estimates that Johnson\u2019s plan would cost Britons \u00a3800 per head.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract from the report:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Relative to staying in the EU, income per capita in the UK would be 2.5% lower under Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals, compared to 1.7% under Mrs May\u2019s deal and 3.3% in the WTO scenario. We draw the following conclusions:</p> \n   <p>All three scenarios would reduce UK living standards compared to staying in the EU.</p> \n   <p>The decline in income per capita under Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals is 50% greater than for Mrs May\u2019s deal, but smaller than under a WTO exit.

As noted above, we also assume that the public finances benefit by 0.4% of GDP per year as a result of reduced EU net contributions, although this may be optimistic \u2026</p> \n   <p>Our most optimistic scenario suggests that, assuming no contributions to the EU budget, Mr Johnson\u2019s deal would leave the public finances \u00a316bn worse off at current prices. For comparison, the government forecasts transport spending at \u00a319bn in 2019-20 (at 2018-19 prices). Our most pessimistic scenario forecasts a much greater impact on the public purse, of around \u00a349bn.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister\u2019s plan to push his Brexit deal through parliament was left in doubt after an alliance of MPs united behind a plan to force a new extension. Johnson appeared to be edging towards the level of support he will need to see his deal pass on Saturday, with some formerly reluctant Tory MPs and some rebellious Labour MPs indicating they will back it. But the Letwin amendment may thwart that. EU27 leaders suggested a further extension would be unlikely. The French president said he did not think one would be granted, while the Irish taoiseach said the UK should not expect one. On Thursday, there were mixed signals over whether or not a delay could be agreed and Johnson has sought to present Saturday\u2019s planned meaningful vote as the last chance to leave with a deal. One thing the Letwin amendment would provide is more time to consider the ramifications of Johnson\u2019s agreement. Among other considerations, MPs were told they will not see any official economic analysis of its impact before Saturday\u2019s votes. The former chancellor, Philip Hammond, also suggested the PM could be planning to bring about a \u201cheavily camouflaged\u201d no-deal Brexit via the motion Letwin seeks to amend. For those a little unsure what to expect from tomorrow\u2019s hugely important parliamentary proceedings, my colleague Peter Walker has this excellent primer: The hard Brexit-supporting Tory MP, Andrea Jenkyns, has said she will back Johnson\u2019s deal. Jenkyns voted against May\u2019s deal on all three occasions and, as she notes in her tweet, would still prefer a no-deal Brexit. Nevertheless, she is certainly one of the MPs No 10 would have been particularly keen to win round. Margot James, one of 21 Tory rebel MPs expelled from the party last month, has said she will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. James said her decision is due to that fact 64% of her constituents in Stourbridge voted to leave the EU, but that she does have concerns about risks it may pose to the future of the UK. It is important to note that what I trust will be agreed by parliament tomorrow is just a starting point for negotiations about our future relationship with the EU. I am disappointed that the PM has removed many of the commitments made by the former PM that provided for frictionless trade and maximum access to the single market for goods and services. But that is a debate for another day; the priority for parliament tomorrow is to get off the starting blocks by passing the deal. Sir Oliver Letwin has said the purpose of his amendment was to ensure there was an extension to the negotiations if there were problems or delays passing the deal\u2019s legislation through parliament. Basically, we are supporting the deal and we are making sure there is an insurance policy to make sure there isn\u2019t a mistake that leads to an unforeseen crashing out. We are creating a sustained insurance policy which means if something goes wrong with the legislation, then we will be sure that the country will be in the EU beyond 31 October until we have found some other way of getting out conveniently. Letwin said the amendment would make it easier for Labour MPs to vote with the government. They know they won\u2019t find themselves in that crashing out position later in the month if something goes wrong in the legislation process, so I really do think it maximises the chance of the deal going through. A judge at the court of session in Edinburgh has rejected a bid by the anti-Brexit campaigner, Jolyon Maugham, that questioned the legality of Boris Johnson\u2019s new withdrawal deal. The basis of the legal challenge by the QC and director of the Good Law Project was that the newly agreed deal contravened legislation \u2013 originally amended by hardline Brexiters to stymie the backstop arrangement \u2013 that prevents Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory. But Lord Pentland, who heard submissions on Friday morning and delivered his ruling at 5pm the same day, said Maugham\u2019s argument was \u201cweak\u201d, adding that his petition was \u201cof doubtful competency\u201d. In his ruling, Pentland said: It is a cardinal principle of constitutional law that the courts should not intrude on the legitimate affairs and processes of parliament. Responding to the ruling, Maugham accepted that he had been mistaken in bringing the action in haste. We had to make a decision to issue proceedings for interim remedies quickly or not at all; once the withdrawal agreement reaches parliament it becomes impossible to challenge. That was a difficult decision to make. It is difficult to move quickly and accurately and, the court has found, I got that decision wrong. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing in the court of session at noon next Monday, as part of an earlier action by Maugham along with the SNP MP, Joanna Cherry, and Dale Vince, the millionaire owner of the Ecotricity green energy company. Carloway could issue court orders forcing Johnson to send a letter to the EU asking for an extension to article 50 until 31 January, as required by the Benn act. In another broadcast interview, this time with ITV News, the prime minister has claimed his deal \u2013 which leaves Northern Ireland practically within the customs union, while removing England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 gets the UK out of the backstop. It busts out of [the] backstop, the previous problem with the deal, the previous deal that kept us locked in the customs union and the single market so, it\u2019s a vast, vast, vast step forward. And what it also does, which is good, is it creates a period, a transition period from end of October, end of this month, there\u2019s a period of standstill giving certainty to business and at the end of that it is perfectly correct that we will move to the new arrangements. For a clear idea of what, precisely, the deal entails, see this very handy explainer from my colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll: Johnson also insisted the agreement did not signal a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d. There\u2019s some good language in the level playing field stuff, in the political declaration about this country\u2019s ambitions on the environment and on social protection you know we\u2019re world leaders in this stuff, there are ways in which we want to go further than the EU. Under the freedoms that we will win it will be possible for instance for the UK to ban the export of live animals, which has caused offence over many years in this country and we can do all things differently to a higher standard and our aspirations to high levels of protection will be enshrined in the political declaration. There is \u201cno better outcome\u201d than the Brexit deal on offer, the prime minister has claimed this evening. In an interview with the BBC, Boris Johnson has sought to portray the forthcoming vote on his Brexit deal as a chance to \u201cmove on\u201d from three years of divisive politics in Westminster and beyond. There\u2019s no better outcome than the one I\u2019m advocating tomorrow. I just kind of invite everybody to imagine what it could be like tomorrow evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to to move on. Johnson said he was hopeful the deal would pass in the Commons tomorrow, saying: Look, you know, this has been a long exhausting and quite divisive business Brexit. I hope that people will think well, you know, what\u2019s the balance, what do our constituents really want? Do they want us to keep going with this argument, do they want more division and delay? Critics, of course, will point out that Johnson\u2019s own government\u2019s analysis suggests his deal will cost the UK billions in economic growth and that the best outcome \u2013 on that front, at least \u2013 would be no Brexit at all. Asked about the deal he struck on the Irish border issue, the prime minister denied breaking a promise to the DUP, saying: I think that what you have is a fantastic deal for all of the UK, and particularly for Northern Ireland because you\u2019ve got a single customs territory. Northern Ireland leaves the EU with the rest of the UK. In an article for the Times (paywall) Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, and one of the 21 Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit last month, says he will only vote for the PM\u2019s deal if he gets an assurance that it will not lead to a no-deal Brexit when the transition period finishes at the end of next year. Hammond says: I haven\u2019t come this far seeking to avoid no-deal in 2019 to be duped into voting for a heavily camouflaged no-deal at the end of 2020. But I am not a lost cause. The assurance Hammond is seeking is the exact opposite of the assurance that the Tory Brexiter John Baron demanded in a BBC interview this morning. Baron said that he had received private promises from ministers that the government would be willing to default to no-deal at the end of next year if trade talks with the EU failed, but that he wanted Boris Johnson to say this in public. (See 2pm.) Hammond wants Johnson to say in public that he won\u2019t consider this. The People\u2019s Vote campaign described the Baron comment as evidence that the government is planning a no-deal Brexit for 2020, but government insiders dismiss this as \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d thinking. They argue that Johnson would not have worked so hard for a deal in recent weeks if he actually wanted no deal. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has joined the Boris Johnson fan club, it seems. This is from my colleague Jennifer Rankin. Macron has changed his tune a bit from the days when he used to denounce those who led the Vote Leave campaign as \u201cliars\u201d. Sebastian Payne says, in the light of Labour\u2019s Melanie Onn saying she would back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, the PM now has a notional majority of two for his plan according to the Financial Times\u2019 tally. Melanie Onn has become the latest Labour MP to declare that she is prepared to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal despite intense pressure at Westminster to oppose it, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Peter Walker report. On the World at One Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said he thought Labour MPs in seats that voted leave might want to back the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. He said: There are Labour MPs in seats that voted 60, 70% to leave and they will, of their own volition, regardless of anything I could say to them, be thinking about how do they best represent their own voters. In fact new research from the British Election Study, which studies voting behaviour in considerable detail through an extensive database going back years, suggests that Rees-Mogg is wrong. Even in constituencies that voted leave in 2016 by large majorities, the people voting Labour are predominantly remain supporters, the research found. Here is an extract from Ed Fieldhouse\u2019s write-up for the British Election Study website. (I have highlighted some of the highlights in bold) First, while 68% of Labour voters voted to remain in the EU in 2016, what about voters in those seats which voted to Leave the EU? Dividing countries in to leave and remain seats and subdividing by the 2017 winner, the BES data shows that in Labour seats where there was a leave majority, 60% of Labour voters voted to remain in 2016 compared to 76% in remain seats. In other words while unsurprisingly there were more Labour leave voters in leave seats, on average there was still a substantial remain majority. Even in those with a leave vote of greater than 60%, a clear majority (57%) of Labour voters voted remain in 2016. Of course, Labour is not looking to win only the votes of those who supported them in 2017, and some people have changed their Brexit preferences since 2016. Rather than focus on 2017 vote and 2016 EU referendum vote we can use the BES to look at the Brexit preferences of all potential Labour voters in May 2019. We defined respondents who scored Labour on a like-dislike scale at least 5 on a 0-10 scale as potential supporters, making up 46% of all respondents that said they would vote and had decided how to vote. Overall 70% of these potential Labour voters said they would vote to remain in the EU, with only 21% preferring to leave, with the rest saying they \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 or \u2018would not vote\u2019 in another referendum. In leave constituencies these figures change only slightly to 65% and 25% respectively. When we narrow this down to Labour seats we see little evidence to suggest that Labour MPs in leave constituencies who are concerned about their re-election prospects need worry more about alienating leave voters than remain voters. In Labour held sets with a leave majority the figures are almost identical: 64% remain and 25% leave. Even in strong leave Labour seats (where leave vote exceeded 60%) the number of potential Labour voters who would vote remain (62%) is more than twice the number who would vote Leave (26%). Fieldhouse says the view expressed by Rees-Mogg (also shared by some Labour MPs, who worry that a remain stance will cost them votes in leave areas) is what social scientists call \u201can ecological fallacy\u201d. Fieldhouse explains: \u201cJust because Labour voters disproportionately live in leave areas doesn\u2019t mean that they are more likely to be Leave voters themselves.\u201d The government has tabled two motions for the debate tomorrow; the first, approving Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal; and a second, alternative one, approving a no-deal Brexit. As this House of Commons library briefing explains, the second motion is only expected to be moved (ie, put to a vote) if the first one gets defeated. The Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, who have been behind previous attempts to get the Commons to support a confirmatory referendum on a Brexit deal, have tabled an amendment to the second motion saying a referendum should be held. They say more than 90 MPs have signed it. But, given that the second motion will probably not get moved in the first place, the Kyle/Wilson amendment will probably not get put to a vote. And Nick Boles, the former Tory who now sits as an independent, will back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary and one of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn last month after rebelling over Brexit, says he will back Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 but is backing the Letwin amendment too. The FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne reckons Boris Johnson could now have a majority of one for his deal. The Labour MP Sarah Champion says she will vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham reports (assuming MPs get the chance to vote on the deal tomorrow). Sir Oliver Letwin has released a note to journalists explaining what his amendment will do. (See 4.05pm.) Here it is. I am writing this as somebody that voted three times for Theresa May\u2019s deal, who has guaranteed publicly to vote for any deal that provides for an orderly exit, and who will vote for Boris\u2019s excellent deal at all stages through to third reading of the implementing legislation, without any changes whatsoever. The one issue that concerns me is to keep the Benn act extension in place as an insurance policy until the implementing legislation is passed by both houses of parliament and the UK\u2019s withdrawal is ratified. The purpose of my amendment is, accordingly, to remove from the government\u2019s motion the bits that would have had the legal effect of satisfying the Benn act conditions and would therefore have removed the need for the PM to seek an extension. It is important to note that, under the Benn act, the extension is maximally flexible, and automatically comes to an end just as soon as the UK completes an orderly withdrawal. So nothing in my amendment or in the Benn act itself in any way delays the actual departure of the UK from the EU immediately following the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. In short, my aim is to ensure that Boris\u2019s deal succeeds, but that we have an insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation. Simple as that! My colleague Heather Stewart says Labour is planning to back the Letwin amendment tomorrow. This sounds like a technicality, and it is not unexpected, but it may be the most important news of the day, and it could make a Brexit extension followed by an election more likely. Yesterday the government was defeated by 12 votes on a motion tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory cabinet minister, ensuring that, when the Commons votes on the Brexit deal tomorrow, it will be possible for MPs to debate and vote on multiple amendments. For obvious reasons, the government wanted to restrict the chances for its motion to be amended. Taking advantage of his own rule change, Letwin has tabled an amendment to the government motion tomorrow. It has heavyweight, cross-party support, with those backing it including Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, and Philip Hammond, the former chancellor. You can read the text of the Letwin amendment on the order paper here (pdf). The amendment would remove almost all the government motion (which says the Commons has approved the Brexit deal) and says the Commons is withholding approval of the deal until the legislation implementing it has been passed. As Letwin explained in the debate yesterday, his aim is to close a loophole in the Benn act. The legislation forces the PM to request a Brexit extension if a deal has not been passed by the end of tomorrow. A vote in favour of the deal tomorrow would have meant there was no need for the PM to request an extension. But if the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) failed to get through parliament by 31 October, the UK could end up leaving with no deal by accident. Letwin\u2019s amendment would lead to the PM having to request an extension tomorrow, on the proviso that if the WAB gets through by the end of October, at that point the extension would be withdrawn. You could call it a backstop. The Benn act passed by 29 votes at second reading and it is likely that the Letwin amendment, which is just intended to copper bottom the Benn act, will also pass tomorrow. If it does, the make-or-break vote on Johnson\u2019s deal will never actually take place. Instead MPs will vote on a bland motion (see below), which could go through on the nod. At that point, if Johnson complies with the assurances that he gave to the court of session in Scotland, he will have to write a letter to the EU requesting an extension. And at that point Johnson would have to decide whether to try to pass his withdrawal agreement bill by 31 October, to release him from the obligation to take up the extension - or whether to accept the extension, and then hold the election that Labour has promised to back in the event of an extension happening. He would campaign promising to implement his Brexit deal - against Labour promising a further negotiation. This is starting to get speculative, but what is clear is that there is now a real chance that \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d could turn out not to be the make-or-break Brexit moment people have been expecting. Assuming that Letwin\u2019s amendment passes, this is the motion, as amended, that MPs would be voting on. (The Letwin text, replacing 12 lines in the original, is in bold.) That, in light of the new deal agreed with the European Union, which enables the United Kingdom to respect the result of the referendum on its membership of the European Union and to leave the European Union on 31 October with a deal, this house has considered the matter but withholds approval unless and until implementing legislation is passed. From PoliticsHome\u2019s John Johnston And Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has also said that MPs at Westminster should not assume that the EU27 would inevitably agree to a Brexit extension. Speaking at his post-summit press conference, he said: The position that we have agreed as the European council is that as things stand there is no request from the UK for an extension, if for some reason a request came, then Donald Tusk \u2013 president of the European council \u2013 would consult individually with all the European leaders to see if we would agree to such a request. But bear in mind that request would have to be agreed unanimously by all 27 leaders, so I don\u2019t think MPs voting tomorrow should make the assumption there would be unanimity for an extension. But our point of view has always been that we would be open to it, but it would be a mistake to assume that it\u2019s a guarantee, given that it requires unanimity by all 27 member states. He also said although Ireland would be open to an extension to allow more time for the House of Commons to ratify a deal, there was no plan B. He explained: Plan B is no deal, and we\u2019re all preparing for that, and we\u2019ve all been preparing for that since the referendum, but let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has said he does not want to grant another Brexit extension. Speaking at a press conference at the end of the EU summit, he said: So that we can turn to the future I believe that we shall stick to the deadline of October 31. That being said, I\u2019m not trying to read the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay. I believe it is now time to put an end to these negotiations and work on the future relationship and put an end to what is currently ongoing. Like I said, there shall be no delay unless there are some major changes. Under the Benn act, Boris Johnson will have to request a Brexit extension if his deal is not agreed by parliament tomorrow. For an extension to be granted, all EU states would have to approve, which means that Macron would have a veto. Any suggestion that he might not allow an extension is helpful to Johnson, because he wants MPs to think tomorrow that they face a choice between his deal and no deal. The intervention by Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, at the summit yesterday, when he also said there should be no extension, was also interpreted as an attempt to help Johnson get his deal through the Commons. In practice, although most of the EU27 are fed up of Brexit and want it over, it is assumed that, faced with a no-deal Brexit as an alternative, in practice they would grant a request for an extension from the UK. The court of session has finished hearing submissions on the latest legal challenge by anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC, and Lord Pentland has said that he will give his decision by the end of the day. Scotland\u2019s highest court heard that Boris Johnson\u2019s new withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union involves a \u201cclear and unequivocal breach\u201d of national law. The basis of the challenge is that the newly agreed deal with the EU contravenes legislation \u2013 originally amended by hardline Brexiters to stymie the backstop arrangement \u2013 that prevents Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory. Sitting before Pentland, the court of session in Edinburgh heard from Aidan O\u2019Neill QC that the provisions of the new withdrawal agreement make it plain that Northern Ireland would also form part of a separate customs territory, that of the European Union, and that this breaches section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, which states that it is \u201cunlawful for Her Majesty\u2019s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain\u201d. Noting that section 55 \u2013 the result of an amendment sponsored by the hardline European Research Group - \u201cintended to tie the government\u2019s hands\u201d, O\u2019Neill added that whether Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory after Brexit \u201cis a question of objective law\u201d and that it \u201ccan\u2019t be plainer\u201d that the UK government has acted unlawfully. But Gerry Moynihan QC for the UK government argued that the petition was beyond the competency of the court, saying it was inviting the court to \u201cinhibit\u201d consideration of the agreement. \u201cThis is a manifest attempt to interfere with proceedings in parliament,\u201d he told Pentland. He added that a substantial part of Northern Ireland\u2019s trade would remain part of the UK\u2019s customs territory and therefore section 55 would be complied with. Moynihan also presented a letter from the Speaker\u2019s counsel which warned that Maugham\u2019s petition was asking for action that would \u201cinevitably involve interference on proceedings in parliament and as a breach of the separation of powers\u201d. The hearing, which concluded just before 1pm, involved testy exchanges between Pentland and O\u2019Neill, as the judge attempted to clarify whether the court was in effect being asked to prevent parliament debating the deal on Saturday. O\u2019Neill said that he was asking the court to clarify the law for parliament, and that it would be parliament\u2019s decision whether to then repeal section 55 in order to retrospectively validate the agreement. Another \u201cSpartan\u201d, the former Brexit minister Suella Braverman, has announced that she will be voting for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. The Tory Brexiter John Baron told the BBC this morning that ministers such as Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, have told him that, if the trade talks with the EU do not produce a deal by the end of next year, the UK would leave the transition and trade with the EU on no-deal (ie, WTO) terms. He also said a similar assurance in public from Boris Johnson would help to persuade hardline Brexiters (ie, the core of the European Research Group) to back the deal. He said: All I can share with you is this: I am doing my best to persuade colleagues, the so-called Spartans who like me voted three times against Theresa May\u2019s deal, to look at this in a favourable light. Because provided we can get that clear assurance, and I have been given it so far by people like Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, and I\u2019m hoping to get it from the prime minister tomorrow, that we will be leaving after the trade talks, if those trade talks fail up to December 2020, on no-deal terms - as long as we can get that assurance, and I think we have done, then we\u2019ll be supporting the deal tomorrow. Under the government\u2019s current plan the UK would leave the EU legally on 31 October but then remain in a transition until December 2020, during which most aspects of EU law would continue to apply. Ministers claim that they will be able to negotiate a new trade relationship with the EU before the end of next year, but the withdrawal agreement allows the transition to be extended for an extra year or two years and most trade experts think that in practice this will be necessary because there is very little chance of negotiating a trade deal within 14 months. In an interview with the Irish Times last month Phil Hogan, the incoming European trade commissioner, said it would take him up to eight months to assemble a new trade negotiating team and then \u201ca number of years\u201d to conclude talks with the UK. But the People\u2019s Vote campaign says Baron\u2019s comment show that the government is not sincere about wanting a trade deal and that is is preparing for a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. These are from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. The Tory Brexiter John Baron told the BBC this morning that Boris Johnson\u2019s deal could make a no-deal Brexit possible at the end of next year, when the transition ends. (See 11.02am.) The People\u2019s Vote campaign claims this comment shows that no deal remains a Brexiter ambition. It has released this quote from the Tory MP Guto Bebb, a PV supporter. He said: John Baron let the cat out of the bag. He admits that he and many of his fellow ideologues in the extremist Conservative faction of the ERG are supporting Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals only because they see it as the fastest way to fulfil their no deal fantasies. Liberty has lost a bid to have an urgent hearing of its case against Boris Johnson over the Brexit deadline, the Press Association reports. Lawyers for the civil rights organisation argued today that its legal challenge, brought to ensure Johnson \u201cacts within the law\u201d, should be heard immediately. But their application for an urgent hearing was rejected by court of appeal judges, who said there was no need for an expedited hearing. Government lawyers said Liberty\u2019s case did not need to proceed urgently, as there was \u201cample time\u201d for it to be heard before the UK\u2019s planned exit from the EU on 31 October, the Press Association reports. Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents hardline Tory Brexiters, and one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on all three occasions, has gone into No 10 for a meeting with the PM. On his way in he said: I still have some concerns about some of the specifics of the deal. So I\u2019m going to go in now and discuss them personally with the prime minister. He very kindly granted me a meeting. And I\u2019ll decide what to do when I\u2019ve had a chance to put some questions to the prime minister. From YouGov From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell The DUP MP Sammy Wilson is urging Tory MPs to join the DUP in rejecting Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told the BBC this morning that, if Boris Johnson wins the vote tomorrow, the opposition parties should unite to bring down his government with a no confidence vote. Blackford said: If it does go through [the deal], we will be saying to the opposition parties that we have to come together. We have to remove Boris Johnson\u2019s government from office and we have to move to an early general election. This is a deal that if it does get support in the House of Commons, is going to be devastating for our communities, devastating for jobs. Richard Benyon, one of the 21 Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit last month, has confirmed that he will vote for the government tomorrow. Many of the 21 will be voting with the government. They rebelled because they wanted parliament to rule out a no-deal Brexit, but many of them are willing to see the UK leave the EU as long as a deal is in place. The government may not be publishing an economic impact assessment of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote (see 11.50am), but MPs who cannot wait for the official verdict could do a lot worse than read this report on the topic published at the weekend (pdf). It was published by the UK in a Changing Europe, an academic research network, and it is based on economic modelling of Theresa May\u2019s deal, Johnson\u2019s deal, and a WTO Brexit (ie, no deal). The report says UK trade would be lower under all three options than it would be if the UK stayed in the EU, with Johnson\u2019s plan being considerably more damaging than May\u2019s. Looking ahead 10 years, it estimates that Johnson\u2019s plan would cost Britons \u00a3800 per head. Here is an extract from the report: Relative to staying in the EU, income per capita in the UK would be 2.5% lower under Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals, compared to 1.7% under Mrs May\u2019s deal and 3.3% in the WTO scenario. We draw the following conclusions: All three scenarios would reduce UK living standards compared to staying in the EU. The decline in income per capita under Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals is 50% greater than for Mrs May\u2019s deal, but smaller than under a WTO exit. The costs of Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals are roughly equidistant between those of Mrs May\u2019s deal and a WTO exit. And here is a chart with the figures. These figures do not take into account the impact on productivity. The report says trade integration can raise productivity, and that when the impact on productivity of post-Brexit trade barriers is also included, the impact of all three options is even worse. The report also looks at the impact of the three Brexit options on government finances. it explains: To estimate the implications for the government finances, we assume that a 1% fall in GDP per capita reduces government revenue by 0.4% of GDP. As noted above, we also assume that the public finances benefit by 0.4% of GDP per year as a result of reduced EU net contributions, although this may be optimistic \u2026 Our most optimistic scenario suggests that, assuming no contributions to the EU budget, Mr Johnson\u2019s deal would leave the public finances \u00a316bn worse off at current prices. For comparison, the government forecasts transport spending at \u00a319bn in 2019-20 (at 2018-19 prices). Our most pessimistic scenario forecasts a much greater impact on the public purse, of around \u00a349bn. This is substantially above current forecast spending on defence in 2019-20 of \u00a339bn (at 2018-19 prices). And here are the figures. MPs will not see any official economic analysis of the impact of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal before they vote on it on Saturday, Downing Street has confirmed, with such documents only being produced subsequently. The Labour MP Hilary Benn has written to the government seeking an impact assessment. But Johnson\u2019s spokeswoman said these would be more relevant when MPs debated the subsequent withdrawal agreement bill, or WAB, setting out the fuller framework of departure, which will happen if the deal is approved. Asked about the economic analysis she said: It\u2019s worth saying that this negotiation focused primarily on the withdrawal agreement and the changes that we were seeking to make there, rather than the political declaration. We will keep parliament updated throughout the process of passing the WAB. If the motion is voted for on Saturday, we\u2019ll set out some more details on Monday in relation to publications next week. Asked to confirm that this meant no analysis would appear before Saturday\u2019s vote, she added: \u201cWe will publish analysis at the appropriate times.\u201d We also learned that Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting today at 4pm, and is spending the rest of the day with his team trying to persuade wavering MPs to back his plan, largely on the phone, as parliament is not sitting. Johnson will open Saturday\u2019s proceedings with a statement and questions on his plan, just after 9.30am. The actual motion on the deal will follow afterwards, at which point the Speaker, John Bercow, will say what amendments have been selected for votes. The number of amendments will largely shape the timing of the crucial vote, and No 10 believe it could be as late as the evening. Asked about Jon Lansman\u2019s suggestion that any Labour MP who backed Boris Johnson\u2019s deal should be prevented from standing as a candidate at the next election (see 10.57am), a spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn pointed out that Corbyn had not backed this idea when asked about it recently. Asked if any MP who rebelled on this vote would lose the party whip, Corbyn replied: I believe in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat. I will ask all Labour MPs to vote along with the party in opposing any deal which damages rights and protections in our society or drives us into the arms of Donald Trump. Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group and one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, wants to keep the media guessing as to how the ERG hardcore Brexiters will vote tomorrow. He has posted this on Twitter. The ERG is due to meet tomorrow when it will discuss the vote and make a recommendation. Baker may like to imply that it is all still up in the air but, as the Guardian reported on Wednesday, the signs are that most of the \u201cSpartans\u201d are likely to support the PM. Comments this morning from Andrew Bridgen (see 8.19am) and John Baron (see 11.02am) are firming up that analysis. The Labour MP John Mann has predicted that \u201cmore than nine\u201d of his parliamentary colleagues will vote for Johnson\u2019s deal on Saturday. The Bassetlaw MP told RTE radio on Friday morning he would be voting for the Johnson deal with others prepared to risk the Labour whip and join him. \u201cI think there will be more Labour MPs [voting for the deal] than British media have been speculating this morning,\u201d he said, adding that this was because these MPs saw no deal as a worse option. He told the Sean O\u2019Rourke show that Labour MPs who were saying the deal would erode workers rights were wrong because it would be up to parliament to confirm anything set out in the political declaration in the next set of negotiations for a trade deal. If parliament wanted to reduce workers\u2019 rights, then \u201cmore fool them\u201d, he said. Asked how many Labour MPs would vote for Johnson deal, he replied: \u201cMore than nine.\u201d The Financial Times vote count quoted earlier (see 9.40am) had seven Labour MPs voting for the deal, and Boris Johnson losing by three votes. If Mann is right about the number of Labour rebels, and the FT is right about everything else, Johnson would win. Angela Merkel has told EU leaders a Brexit extension will be unavoidable if MPs vote down the deal agreed with Boris Johnson, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. Her story goes on: During private EU summit talks on Brexit, the German chancellor told her fellow leaders they could not pretend an extension would not be offered to the UK if it was requested, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Merkel framed Brexit as a historic issue weighing on the EU and said leaders had a responsibility not to push the UK out if there was a request for further delay. Her remarks contrast with the public statement of Jean-Claude Juncker, who said he was \u201cruling out\u201d an extension. Although the outgoing commission president has no power to veto any delay, he said: \u201cIf we have a deal, we have a deal and there is no need for prolongation.\u201d And here is Jennifer\u2019s story in full. Huda Elmi, another member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee, has backed Jon Lansman (see 10.57am) in saying that any Labour MP who votes for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal should not be allowed to stand as a parliamentary candidate for the party again. Elmi\u2019s stance is not surprising because she was elected to the NEC along with Lansman when all nine slots allocated for people elected by CLPs (constituency Labour parties) were won by people on the Momentum slate. It is quite possible that all of the so-called #JC9 (apart from the one who has been suspended) would take this view. But they do not have a majority on the NEC, which on most issues votes in accordance with the wishes of the party leadership. The Tory Brexiter John Baron was one of the 28 \u201cSpartans\u201d who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times. But he told BBC News this morning he was planning to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal because there was now no danger of Northern Ireland being trapped in the backstop (the point underlined by Geoffrey Cox this morning \u2013 see 10.08am). Baron explained: The reason I am inclined to vote for this one is very simple; Theresa May\u2019s backstop could have had us locked into that arrangement indefinitely. Boris Johnson has torn up that backstop, which means that if the trade talks are not successful after we hopefully agree the deal tomorrow here, then we could leave on no-deal terms. And the reason that\u2019s important is that, by leaving no deal on the table, it makes a good trade deal in those negotiations up to December 2020 more likely to succeed. Asked how many other \u201cSpartans\u201d would back Johnson tomorrow, Baron replied: I can\u2019t speak for everybody, but my sense of it is that the momentum is with the prime minister on this. Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, the Labour organisation for Jeremy Corbyn supporters and a member of the party\u2019s national executive committee, has said that any Labour MP who votes for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal should not be allowed to stand again as a Labour candidate. Although Lansman is a close ally of Corbyn\u2019s, he is not a proxy for the Labour leader and the two don\u2019t always agree. The Labour leadership has never said it would remove the whip from MPs who vote with the government tomorrow (John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, sidestepped a question on this on the Today programme this morning) and it has been reported that Corbyn definitely will not remove the whip from them. Removing the whip would prevent people from standing for the party at the next election. This is from the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley. Raoul Ruparel, who was Theresa May\u2019s Europe adviser in No 10, has posted a good thread on Twitter explaining the differences between her Brexit deal and Boris Johnson\u2019s. It starts here. And here is his conclusion. Scotland\u2019s highest court is hearing a new challenge from anti-Brexit campaigners this morning as they seek to have Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal declared unlawful, arguing that it contravenes legislation \u2013 originally amended by the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 that prevents Northern Ireland forming part of a separate customs territory. Jolyon Maugham QC, the director of the Good Law Project, who has spearheaded a series of court challenges to the UK government over Brexit, is seeking an interdict from the court of session in Edinburgh that would effectively suspend the deal, which parliament is set to debate in a historic Saturday session tomorrow, as well as a court order so that if MPs do vote on the deal as planned, the full, final text is put before them. Lawyers for Maugham will tell the court that the deal contravenes section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, which states that it is \u201cunlawful for Her Majesty\u2019s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain\u201d. Maugham\u2019s legal team insist that section 55 is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d and that any form of differentiated deal for Northern Ireland will contravene it. On Twitter this morning, Maugham confirmed he would ask the inner house of the court on Monday to order the prime minister to apply for an extension to article 50 until 31 January under the Benn act, or send the letter itself. Lord Carloway, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge, has already cleared time for an emergency hearing at noon next Monday, as part of an earlier action by Maugham along with the Scottish National party MP Joanna Cherry and Dale Vince, the millionaire owner of the Ecotricity green energy company. Maugham posted this on Twitter this morning. On the morning of the second \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, published legal advice on her deal that killed off whatever small, lingering prospect there was of hardline Tory Brexiters supporting it. That is because he said the UK could remain trapped in the backstop. He said: However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol\u2019s arrangements, save by agreement. This morning, the government has published a summary of his legal advice on the new mechanism that will replace the backstop. Cox said there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for thinking it would trap the UK because there was an exit mechanism. The full statement (only three paragraphs) is here (pdf), and here is the conclusion. There are no grounds for supposing that the EU would have any legal basis to assert that articles 5 to 10 of the protocol should continue to apply absent that consent or that the EU would possess a veto over the right of members of the Northern Ireland legislative assembly to withhold consent to the continued application of those provisions. All attention at Westminster at the moment is focused on whether Boris Johnson will be able to get the 320 or so votes that he needs to pass his deal tomorrow. Many people have been looking at the numbers, but at the moment there is no consensus yet as to whether or not Johnson can win \u2013 mostly because some MPs will not declare how they will vote until the last moment. My colleague Rowena Mason published an analysis of the situation at around lunchtime yesterday. She said that at that point Johnson had 259 votes in the bag, and needed about 60-odd more votes, from a pool of potentially about 71 votes \u2013 mostly hardline Tory Brexiters (28), anti-no-deal former Tories (19) and Brexity opposition MPs (21). Her full analysis is here. The Financial Times has tried to produce a tally. As Sebastian Payne reports, as of last night they had 318 MPs due to support the deal, and 321 against. As Sam Coates reports, Sky News has come to a very similar conclusion. It has been counting votes for the deal, and it reckons Johnson has 316 \u2013 four short of the 320 he needs. The Times (paywall) has got a tally saying everything hinges on 57 undeclared MPs. At BuzzFeed, Alex Wickham has a list of MPs who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal on the third occasion who have now confirmed they will vote for Johnson\u2019s deal. He has 10 names on it, but it was last updated almost 24 hours ago. And this chart, from the Cicero Group public affairs agency, has some interesting projections on how the vote could go under different scenarios. On the Today programme, the Labour MP Graham Stringer, who voted to leave the European Union in 2016 but voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, admitted he might vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s plans. He said it was very similar to May\u2019s deal, better in some respects but worse in others. But getting Brexit delivered was a priority, he said. [I] will consider whether, if this deal goes down, we won\u2019t get Brexit at all. So it\u2019s a bad deal. But if I thought that we wouldn\u2019t get Brexit at all, then I would consider voting for it. And here is some Twitter comment from journalists on the Dominic Raab interview (see 8.42am.) From the Independent\u2019s Rob Merrick. From Sky\u2019s Rob Powell Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Ben Quinn. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, got the 8.10am slot on the Today programme this morning, and he was asked about how Boris Johnson could defend his new Brexit plan, which would in practice put a customs border down the Irish Sea, when, in a speech to the DUP conference last year, he said no Conservative government could sign up to a plan that would impose customs controls between Britain and Northern Ireland. For the record, here is the Johnson quote in full. If we wanted to do free trade deals, if we wanted to cut tariffs \u2026 if we wanted to vary our regulation then we would have to leave Northern Ireland behind as an economic semi-colony of the EU and we would be damaging the fabric of the union with regulatory checks and even customs controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 on top of those extra regulatory checks down the Irish Sea that are already envisaged in the withdrawal agreement. Now I have to tell you, no British Conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement. Asked if the government was signing up to an arrangement of the kind that Johnson said would be unacceptable, Raab replied: \u201cNo.\u201d He went on: Under the new arrangements, the only tariff that could conceivably be levied in relation to goods in Northern Ireland would be in relation to those that come from GB where the idea is to circumvent the rules of the single market and the ultimate destination is mainland Europe. Even then the UK has a double safeguard of waiver or reimbursement. That is not something that was there before. In terms of the regulatory side of customs, the paperwork of customs, there will be none from Northern Ireland to Britain. Great Britain to Northern Ireland already has regulatory declarations, there is already a regulatory border but not a customs border. So there will be an incremental additional section that would have to be filled out on the form. But that is not a substantial extra burden for business. And, overall, what Northern Ireland businesses get is remaining part of the UK customs territory, no infrastructure at the border with the Republic and frictionless access to the single market. It is a cracking deal for Northern Ireland businesses. Andrew Bridgen, the Tory MP and leading member of the European Research Group (ERG), has predicted the vast majority of the hardline pro-Brexit grouping within the parliamentary party will vote for the deal. He said: I think the vast majority of the ERG will come to the conclusion that this deal is tolerable. What we don\u2019t want is a second referendum. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has tweeted her suspicions that Labour will ultimately be happy to allow the deal to go through tomorrow: McDonnell said he did not expect Labour MPs to defy the party whip by voting for the deal, but added that he believed in the \u201cpowers of persuasion\u201d. He was against the deal \u201cbecause we won\u2019t vote for anything that makes our constituents or our country poorer and by any assessment that\u2019s what this deal will do\u201d. He went on: It will introduce checks and barriers on our border and. It is worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal because it removes those commitments that she was willing to offer about a level playing field to protect workers\u2019 rights, environmental standards and consumer rights. It\u2019s a very bad deal we can\u2019t support it. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has indicated that the priority of Labour tomorrow will be opposing the deal the government has negotiated, rather than pushing for a second referendum or \u201dconfirmatory vote\u201d. \u201cTo be frank, I think on Saturday we should just vote the deal down because it\u2019s such a bad deal,\u201d he said, speaking on the Today programme. He appealed to other Labour MP\u2019s such as Ronnie Campbell (who has been a firm backer of Jeremy Corbyn, pictured with him below), who has revealed he is likely to vote for the deal when it comes to the House of Commons in a special Saturday sitting, not to do so. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a chat with Ronnie,\u201d added McDonnell, who warned against what powers would come into the government\u2019s hand on issues such as employment rights. These are the extreme right that have attacked trade unions throughout their careers and you cannot allow them to have these powers. Campbell, MP for Blyth Valley in north-east England, told the Evening Chronicle last night: I\u2019m likely to vote for it. I think we\u2019ve got to get something across the line. The people of this country are just sick and tired of the shenanigans that have gone on in parliament over the last three years. Something\u2019s got to happen. Something\u2019s got to break. Among old (former) colleagues from the Labour party, there is some disquiet after Chuka Umunna wondered aloud \u201chow on earth\u201d any Labour MP could vote for Johnson\u2019s deal. \u201cThe Labour party is generally of one voice in saying that people didn\u2019t vote to be poorer and that is what this agreement is about,\u201d the former Labour, now Liberal Democrat, MP added. I haven\u2019t spoken to any Labour MP representing a leave seat who says that their constituent voted to make the country poorer. He added that a lot of those who had been mooted as potential supporters were people who were not standing again and he would \u201cvery respectfully ask them, do you want one of your last acts in parliament to be helping to facilitate one of the most rightwing, nationalist, political projects this country has ever seen?\u201d An answer came in fairly short order on Twitter from Gloria de Piero, a Labour MP who is stepping down at the next election as the MP for Ashfield, where voters backed leave by 70% in the 2016 EU referendum. In October, she was one of 19 Labour MPs who wrote to the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, saying they \u201cwish to see the British EU referendum result honoured without further delay\u201d. A cheery-looking Dominic Raab has come out to bat on the morning television bulletins, claiming the deal is a \u201ccracking one\u201d for Northern Ireland. Not only does Northern Ireland have \u201cfrictionless access\u201d to the single market, but there is no hard border and a consent mechanism has been enshrined, the foreign secretary told BBC1. On tomorrow\u2019s vote, Raab said the government would be making the argument to MPs who are worried about no deal that this is the opportunity to secure a deal It\u2019s dealt with the lion\u2019s share that people like me certainly had with the last deal. It takes about two minutes before he checks off Downing Street\u2019s \u201cnow is the moment to get Brexit done\u201d talking point (election slogan?). There\u2019s a concerted attempt by Raab to paint the deal as very different from Theresa May\u2019s, adding that the prime minister, \u201cagainst all the odds\u201d, had secured key changes. Wilson added that the DUP made concessions with the prime minister in order to help him get a deal but suspected he would do what was best for the Conservative party. \u201cWe are disappointed he didn\u2019t stick to the red lines he said he would,\u201d the east Belfast MP said. He also voiced the view that a successful election could help Johnson get a better deal. I believe, with a big majority, he can be more robust in his negotiations. It is one of the reasons why we believe that voting this down tomorrow is not the end of the game but in fact probably opens up possibilities for the government that are not available at present but will be after a general election. The DUP will \u201cabsolutely\u201d be voting against the deal when it comes to the House of Commons, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, has said, contradicting a suggestion earlier from Peter Bone that the unionist party might be willing to support it. He told the Today programme: Why would we when this deal goes against everything, first of all that the government promised they would do to Northern Ireland. A syphoning off from the rest of the United Kingdom and putting a border down the Irish Sea, in addition to extra costs for Northern Ireland\u2019s businesses. Wilson added that the party would vote as a block and that there was no question of abstaining. The party had already been having conversations with Tory MPs and encouraging them to vote with the DUP \u201cto protect the union\u201d. Good morning. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog from Kate. Michael Dougan, professor of European law at University of Liverpool, has this interesting Twitter thread breaking down Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, the majority of which \u201cremains identical to that finalised by Theresa May\u201d. It\u2019s worth a read. This, from the BBC\u2019s Mark Urban, is quite extraordinary. How the papers covered it Johnson\u2019s progress in getting his deal features on the front pages today, though most papers make it clear that this is not a done deal. The Times says: \u201cFinal hurdle in sight as Johnson gets his deal\u201d, the Guardian reports: \u201cJohnson gets his Brexit deal \u2013 now it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d. The Mirror says: \u201cOn the brink of Brexit \u2026 once again\u201d, the i has: \u201cJohnson gets his EU deal \u2026 now for the tricky part\u201d and the FT says: \u201cDUP veto threat leaves Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal gamble in the balance\u201d. Other papers are sounding warnings to MPs to vote for the deal. The Telegraph quotes from the prime minister: \u201cIt\u2019s my deal or no deal\u201d, the Daily Mail features a picture of Johnson pointing, with the headline: \u201cHe\u2019s done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs\u201d, the Sun has rhyming advice: \u201cGet real \u2026 take the deal\u201d and the Express says: \u201cJust do it!\u201d Chuka Umunna will be doing the radio rounds to explain the Lib Dems opposition to Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. The Conservative party\u2019s social media team are not missing a moment in their bid to persuade people that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal is the way to go. The official Conservatives account has been tweeting pro-Brexit deal videos or pictures every hour overnight, so here are some of their videos and pictures, tweeted out while you slept: Good morning politics fans and welcome to another day on the Brexit train. Yesterday, Boris Johnson got the EU to sign off (not formally, that only happens after they do some careful legal scrutinising of the deal) on a Brexit deal that he said was \u201ca great deal for our country\u201d as well as \u201ca very good deal for our friends in the EU\u201d. Johnson will now launch a charm offensive to win support for the deal, which MPs will vote on in a historic sitting on Saturday. The PM has said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d the deal will be approved, even without the backing of the DUP, which issued a statement early on Thursday morning saying it could not support the government\u2019s position. The party went further later in the day after the text of the reworked withdrawal agreement was published by the European commission. Arlene Foster\u2019s party issued a more strident statement, saying the agreement \u201cdrives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast agreement\u201d. Johnson hopes to frame Saturday\u2019s vote as a dramatic \u201cnew deal or no deal\u201d moment \u2013 but EU leaders declined to come to his aid in Brussels by ruling out any further delay to Brexit. So today, we can expect to see wrangling, posturing and sweet-talking, as Johnson and his allies try to play the numbers game to get the vote passed on Saturday. I\u2019ll be here on the blog, keeping you company in the early hours, before handing over to my colleagues. As always, you can contact me on Twitter or via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com).",

Perhaps the huge mistake we are about to make will shock people into demanding a chance to recant, and at that time we will need a strong left-of-centre party ready to provide leadership, not to ask: \u201cWhat did you do in the [Brexit] war?\u201d<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones cites Ramsay MacDonald as the ultimate class betrayer for joining a coalition with the Conservatives.

      "bodyText": "Removing the whip from Labour MPs who support Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal may make Owen Jones feel better, but it won\u2019t materially affect the situation (Labour MPs who vote for a Tory deal must lose the whip, 17 October). Their votes, if cast for the deal, may contribute to securing Johnson\u2019s future, which would be a grave error on their part but the past few years have been error strewn and nobody comes out of this well. Many of us \u2013 whether smug, complacent, out of touch or lazy \u2013 have to take some responsibility for the outcome of the 2016 referendum, but none of us can live life in reverse. In 1975 I voted to leave the European Economic Community, as many on the left of the party did, but I came to my senses as I watched Margaret Thatcher wreak havoc on our country, and came to admire the progressive proposals and requirements imported from Europe, which turned me into an advocate for continued EU membership. Perhaps the huge mistake we are about to make will shock people into demanding a chance to recant, and at that time we will need a strong left-of-centre party ready to provide leadership, not to ask: \u201cWhat did you do in the [Brexit] war?\u201d Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 Owen Jones cites Ramsay MacDonald as the ultimate class betrayer for joining a coalition with the Conservatives. But he fails to mention that it was 68 rebel Labour MPs in 1971 who ignored a three-line whip and a five-to-one vote at the Labour party annual conference and voted with the Heath Conservative government to get us into the EEC, as it then was. Roy Jenkins, who led the rebels, was condemned at the time as a traitor by the left. There is a real irony that a group of Labour MPs could now vote against their party\u2019s policy to take us out of the EU when some of their predecessors voted against their party\u2019s policy to take us in. Andrew Harris Moulsford, Oxfordshire \u2022 Owen Jones is right. The problem is that Jeremy Corbyn wants Brexit so he is trying to make it easy for leaver MPs to support the Johnson deal. He wants Brexit but not to be blamed for it, hence this ploy. John Cookson Bournemouth \u2022 Simon Jenkins (A deal is done. Now let\u2019s end the agony, 18 October) may well be right to proclaim \u201cit is time, surely, to end this agony\u201d, but what has he to say about the agony that Brexit is likely to inflict on the economy, the NHS, the standard of living for a substantial proportion of the population and the future of the union? Jeremy Beecham Labour House of Lords \u2022 So this is it. This is Brexit at last. Now we have some substance. Rather than the debate revolving endlessly around the referendum vote and the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, we can now ask the substantive question: is the deal on offer better for us as a people than the deal we already have? This is the point we should have reached prior to invoking article 50. Time to rectify matters. Time for the actual debate to begin. Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands \u2022 If it\u2019s such a good deal for Northern Ireland why can\u2019t we have it for the rest of the UK?

      "body": "<p>It would be tempting to call this the moment of truth, had truth not been an early casualty of a Brexit saga that was mired in lies and deception from the very start. Even so the Brexit story, which has twisted and tormented this country for the last three and a half years, is at a moment of decision. Outside parliament, <a href=\"https://www.peoples-vote.uk/\" title=\"\">hundreds of thousands will gather </a>to make one, possibly last, plea to stay in the European Union. Inside, MPs are due to vote on an agreement that, if it passes, will see us make the break in less than a fortnight \u2013 thereby ending British participation in a dream that has animated Europe ever since the final bombs fell in 1945.</p> <p>Almost everything about this moment deserves either regret or condemnation. Forty months have passed since the referendum, but MPs will have little more than four hours to assess the new withdrawal agreement governing Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. That\u2019s barely time to read it, let alone debate and scrutinise it. To rush through a decision of such gravity is not the action of a country that is serious about its own future.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In return for their readiness to wave goodbye to Northern Ireland, the Tory ultras are getting a harder Brexit than May ever offered</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That in itself is a good reason to support <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-parliaments-50098128\" title=\"\">Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment</a>, which would force the government to seek another EU extension and give everyone more time. (Letwin\u2019s prime purpose is to head off a bit of Spartan chicanery, making it impossible for the hardcore Brexiters to get round the Benn Act by voting yes on Saturday, only to vote down the withdrawal agreement later, thereby triggering a no-deal exit on 31 October.)</p> <p>What debate there is will be blind to the most crucial facts. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/107355/sajid-javid-rejects-call-release-impact-assessment-boris\" title=\"\">refused to provide an economic impact assessment </a>of the deal, breezily insisting that any cost will be worth it because getting Brexit agreed will be \u201cgood for the fabric of our democracy\u201d. The closest guide we have is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKandEU/status/1185126805499514880\" title=\"\">an independent study</a>, warning that the latest arrangements could reduce Britain\u2019s per capita GDP by up to 7% over 10 years (compared with remaining), making this deal even more economically damaging than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/13/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-theresa-may-trade\" title=\"\">Theresa May\u2019s</a>.</p> <p>And yet it is being hailed as a great prize, and Boris Johnson lauded as a master strategist. That is baloney. Once Johnson scrubbed out what had previously been a red line \u2013 no border in the Irish Sea, lest that weaken the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 then of course the EU could offer some new options. That doesn\u2019t make Johnson a negotiating genius. It just means he was ready to \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 surrender a principle that for the leader of the Conservative and Unionist party should have been sacrosanct. If you\u2019re buying a car and suddenly agree to give up on having back seats, the price will go down. That doesn\u2019t make you a tactical mastermind: it just means you gave up on something you previously insisted was vital.</p> <p>News reports keep insisting that the backstop has gone, and Brussels is happy to allow that impression; but that too is false. It has, as one former Downing Street adviser puts it, become the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaoulRuparel/status/1184908655327625218\" title=\"\">\u201cfrontstop\u201d</a>, meaning that what was once a contingency is now a certainty. Northern Ireland will be, in effect, in the EU customs union from day one, even if it officially remains part of the UK customs area.</p> <p>Credit to the negotiators for imaginatively finding that inch of space between de facto and de jure, and good for Northern Ireland for retaining at least some closeness to the enormous market on the UK\u2019s doorstep, even as the rest of the UK needlessly distances itself from it. (Don\u2019t blame remain-voting Scotland if it wants that too.) In a telling slip, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rob_Merrick/status/1185094511925628928\" title=\"\">the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab,</a> told Northern Ireland to cheer up and realise it was getting a \u201ccracking deal\u201d that would allow it to keep \u201cfrictionless access to the single market\u201d \u2013 which rather highlights why this is a terrible deal for everyone else. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570c1bd94d647b79b4bb68d14a8aba1fdfd51ba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570c1bd94d647b79b4bb68d14a8aba1fdfd51ba8/0_0_5393_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An anti-Brexit protester outside the Houses of Parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anti-Brexit protester outside the Houses of Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, there\u2019s no dressing it up. Northern Ireland is being cut loose, by the same Boris Johnson who less than a year ago was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarranMarshall/status/1184441210343251968?s=20\" title=\"\">telling the DUP\u2019s annual conference </a>that any customs or regulatory distinction between Britain and Northern Ireland would \u201cdamage the fabric of the union\u201d, and: \u201cNo British Conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement.\u201d How is this suddenly acceptable to today\u2019s Tory party? Because, sighs a former minister, his colleagues \u201cdon\u2019t give a shit about Northern Ireland and don\u2019t care about the union\u201d. Only Brexit matters now.</p> <p>In return for their readiness to wave goodbye to Northern Ireland, the Tory ultras are getting a harder Brexit than May ever offered. The new withdrawal agreement is replete with changes that will put ever greater distance between Britain and our neighbours \u2013 measures that, as Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1184838374286331906\" title=\"\">rightly points out, </a>will \u201cslash workers\u2019 rights, environmental standards and consumer protections\u201d. It beggars belief that any Labour MP worthy of the name could possibly vote for it.</p> <p>The most wild-eyed Brexiters have spotted something else too. If they vote for this new agreement, they need only sit tight through the 14-month transition period and then, if no free trade agreement has been sealed by the end of 2020, they\u2019ll get the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peoplesvote_uk/status/1185160014421299200\" title=\"\">no-deal crash-out of their dreams</a>.</p> <p>For that reason, and because there are pro-Brexit Labour MPs who reckon voting aye will bring only a mild slap on the wrist from a leader <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theousherwood/status/1185182916797702145\" title=\"\">whose purposes it might suit</a> to have Brexit out of the way (so long as no one blames him, that is), Johnson may just scrape home. If that happens, there will be many millions in this country who will feel nothing less than bereft.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/18/boris-johnson-launches-frantic-sales-pitch-of-brexit-deal-ahead-of-commons-vote-politics-live\">Brexit: Labour to back rebel Tory bid to force Johnson to demand extension \u2013 live news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since 2016, remainers have often been rightly rebuked for failing to respect or even understand the sensibilities of the 17.4 million of their fellow citizens who voted to leave. But 16.1 million Britons voted to stay in the EU, and they have often been dismissed no less casually, whether rubbished as elitist \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d or mysteriously excluded from \u201cthe people\u201d whose will must be done. Yet they too are devoted citizens of this country, and, very soon, they may face a change that, to many, will feel like a grievous loss.</p> <p>For three and a half years, they have put off that moment of pain, hoping that somehow, Brexit might be averted, that their fellow Britons would change their minds and change course. Sometime on Saturday that dream could be over. For all the procrastination since 2016, it will feel quite sudden: 31 October is very near.</p> <p>They will contemplate a project whose importance to them \u2013 like so much in life \u2013 they didn\u2019t fully appreciate until it was nearly gone. Yet in these last 40 months, often unheard amid all the noise about process, about meaningful votes and second referendums, they have come to value it very dearly. It is an ideal of cooperation across borders; of their country combining with its neighbours, rather than fighting against them, to face down shared threats, whether they be the climate crisis or the lethal recklessness of Donald Trump. In 2019, that idea seems more necessary than ever. Yet tomorrow it could all vanish.</p> <p>So forgive them if they shout themselves hoarse at those demos and rallies, or if they watch the Parliament channel through their fingers as they wait anxiously for the vote. They \u2013 we \u2013 fear we are about to lose something very precious.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "It would be tempting to call this the moment of truth, had truth not been an early casualty of a Brexit saga that was mired in lies and deception from the very start. Even so the Brexit story, which has twisted and tormented this country for the last three and a half years, is at a moment of decision. Outside parliament, hundreds of thousands will gather to make one, possibly last, plea to stay in the European Union. Inside, MPs are due to vote on an agreement that, if it passes, will see us make the break in less than a fortnight \u2013 thereby ending British participation in a dream that has animated Europe ever since the final bombs fell in 1945. Almost everything about this moment deserves either regret or condemnation. Forty months have passed since the referendum, but MPs will have little more than four hours to assess the new withdrawal agreement governing Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. That\u2019s barely time to read it, let alone debate and scrutinise it. To rush through a decision of such gravity is not the action of a country that is serious about its own future. That in itself is a good reason to support Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment, which would force the government to seek another EU extension and give everyone more time. (Letwin\u2019s prime purpose is to head off a bit of Spartan chicanery, making it impossible for the hardcore Brexiters to get round the Benn Act by voting yes on Saturday, only to vote down the withdrawal agreement later, thereby triggering a no-deal exit on 31 October.) What debate there is will be blind to the most crucial facts. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has refused to provide an economic impact assessment of the deal, breezily insisting that any cost will be worth it because getting Brexit agreed will be \u201cgood for the fabric of our democracy\u201d. The closest guide we have is an independent study, warning that the latest arrangements could reduce Britain\u2019s per capita GDP by up to 7% over 10 years (compared with remaining), making this deal even more economically damaging than Theresa May\u2019s. And yet it is being hailed as a great prize, and Boris Johnson lauded as a master strategist. That is baloney. Once Johnson scrubbed out what had previously been a red line \u2013 no border in the Irish Sea, lest that weaken the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 then of course the EU could offer some new options. That doesn\u2019t make Johnson a negotiating genius. It just means he was ready to \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 surrender a principle that for the leader of the Conservative and Unionist party should have been sacrosanct. If you\u2019re buying a car and suddenly agree to give up on having back seats, the price will go down. That doesn\u2019t make you a tactical mastermind: it just means you gave up on something you previously insisted was vital. News reports keep insisting that the backstop has gone, and Brussels is happy to allow that impression; but that too is false. It has, as one former Downing Street adviser puts it, become the \u201cfrontstop\u201d, meaning that what was once a contingency is now a certainty. Northern Ireland will be, in effect, in the EU customs union from day one, even if it officially remains part of the UK customs area. Credit to the negotiators for imaginatively finding that inch of space between de facto and de jure, and good for Northern Ireland for retaining at least some closeness to the enormous market on the UK\u2019s doorstep, even as the rest of the UK needlessly distances itself from it. (Don\u2019t blame remain-voting Scotland if it wants that too.) In a telling slip, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told Northern Ireland to cheer up and realise it was getting a \u201ccracking deal\u201d that would allow it to keep \u201cfrictionless access to the single market\u201d \u2013 which rather highlights why this is a terrible deal for everyone else. Still, there\u2019s no dressing it up. Northern Ireland is being cut loose, by the same Boris Johnson who less than a year ago was telling the DUP\u2019s annual conference that any customs or regulatory distinction between Britain and Northern Ireland would \u201cdamage the fabric of the union\u201d, and: \u201cNo British Conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement.\u201d How is this suddenly acceptable to today\u2019s Tory party? Because, sighs a former minister, his colleagues \u201cdon\u2019t give a shit about Northern Ireland and don\u2019t care about the union\u201d. Only Brexit matters now. In return for their readiness to wave goodbye to Northern Ireland, the Tory ultras are getting a harder Brexit than May ever offered. The new withdrawal agreement is replete with changes that will put ever greater distance between Britain and our neighbours \u2013 measures that, as Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer rightly points out, will \u201cslash workers\u2019 rights, environmental standards and consumer protections\u201d. It beggars belief that any Labour MP worthy of the name could possibly vote for it. The most wild-eyed Brexiters have spotted something else too. If they vote for this new agreement, they need only sit tight through the 14-month transition period and then, if no free trade agreement has been sealed by the end of 2020, they\u2019ll get the no-deal crash-out of their dreams. For that reason, and because there are pro-Brexit Labour MPs who reckon voting aye will bring only a mild slap on the wrist from a leader whose purposes it might suit to have Brexit out of the way (so long as no one blames him, that is), Johnson may just scrape home. If that happens, there will be many millions in this country who will feel nothing less than bereft. Since 2016, remainers have often been rightly rebuked for failing to respect or even understand the sensibilities of the 17.4 million of their fellow citizens who voted to leave. But 16.1 million Britons voted to stay in the EU, and they have often been dismissed no less casually, whether rubbished as elitist \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d or mysteriously excluded from \u201cthe people\u201d whose will must be done. Yet they too are devoted citizens of this country, and, very soon, they may face a change that, to many, will feel like a grievous loss. For three and a half years, they have put off that moment of pain, hoping that somehow, Brexit might be averted, that their fellow Britons would change their minds and change course. Sometime on Saturday that dream could be over. For all the procrastination since 2016, it will feel quite sudden: 31 October is very near. They will contemplate a project whose importance to them \u2013 like so much in life \u2013 they didn\u2019t fully appreciate until it was nearly gone. Yet in these last 40 months, often unheard amid all the noise about process, about meaningful votes and second referendums, they have come to value it very dearly. It is an ideal of cooperation across borders; of their country combining with its neighbours, rather than fighting against them, to face down shared threats, whether they be the climate crisis or the lethal recklessness of Donald Trump. In 2019, that idea seems more necessary than ever. Yet tomorrow it could all vanish. So forgive them if they shout themselves hoarse at those demos and rallies, or if they watch the Parliament channel through their fingers as they wait anxiously for the vote. They \u2013 we \u2013 fear we are about to lose something very precious. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

In the interview, which came soon after a homophobic assault on a gay man in Newtownabbey, north of Belfast, Robinson branded homosexuality an \u201cabomination\u201d. Mitchell has used a verbatim account of that lengthy and hugely controversial phone conversation, together with other DUP statements attacking homosexuality over the last 40 years, to create the libretto of an hour-long opera that arrives in Belfast at the most sensitive of moments. As well as the DUP being the pivotal player in the battle over Brexit, same-sex marriage and abortion today are reaching a key stage on the road to legalisation in Northern Ireland. In theory, the failure of the Stormont assembly to reconvene means that, following legislation at Westminster earlier this year, both will now automatically be legalised early in 2020, though gay and women\u2019s rights activists still expect there to be efforts to block liberalisation. The festival\u2019s artistic director, Ruth McCarthy, insists the opera, parts of which were tried out at last year\u2019s festival, wasn\u2019t chosen to coincide with these historic events: \u201cWe wish we were that organised!\u201d The Brexit and same-sex marriage deadlines had not been fixed, she says, when the festival was planned. Mitchell, who set up the Belfast Ensemble music and theatre group in 2017, has never forgotten the Robinson-Nolan interview. \u201cIn 2008, I had had enough of central London and wanted to come home to reconnect with my family and live somewhere with no flatmates and get a grand piano. I found the most amazing place; I had a few commissions for Aldeburgh; I was feeling like a million dollars \u2013 and then that came on breakfast radio. Within a few years, I was drinking myself to death.\u201d He says that, for a gay man, the storm Robinson triggered was overwhelming. \u201cThere was suddenly a massive debate in Northern Ireland about, effectively, do gay people have souls? I thought, \u2018I have made a huge mistake [coming back].\u2019 It ate away at me for a long time.\u201d He sees it as the catalyst for the personal problems that beset him, though he overcame them and has been sober since October 2014 \u2013 a date tattooed on his neck in Roman numerals. Mitchell insists Abomination is not anti-unionist. \u201cPeople have accused us of having a republican agenda,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t. My art is very political, but it\u2019s totally bipartisan.\u201d The message underlying the opera is that \u201cwords have weight\u201d \u2013 if you demonise a section of the population, there will be consequences. Press reports of the higher-than-average suicide rate among LGBT people in Northern Ireland are pinned to the wall of the rehearsal room to underline the point. But Mitchell doesn\u2019t intend to be preachy, or tell an enlightened audience what they already know. Instead, he plans to let Robinson\u2019s arias of disgust and hellfire spiral into anarchic ecstasy. \u201cI am clinging to that word \u2018party\u2019 in Democratic Unionist party,\u201d he says. \u201cDUP members come on stage one by one and then all hell breaks loose. There was a huge rumpus here over gay cake, so we\u2019ll have cake thrown all over the place; Matthew Cavan [a well-known Belfast-based actor and drag queen] will get into drag; we\u2019ll have red, white and blue streamers; and an angel will descend and make love to Iris on a bed.\u201d The angel represents 19-year-old Kirk McCambley who, it emerged in 2010, had been having an affair with the then 59-year-old Iris Robinson at the height of the \u201cabomination\u201d controversy in 2008. \u201cI love the idea of creating chaos out of order,\u201d says Mitchell, who believes the Robinson interview undid all the DUP\u2019s attempts to become respectable, ripping away the curtain to expose the bigotry behind it. He intends to present an open, unbuttoned party, but probably best not to offer DUP leader Arlene Foster a complimentary ticket. \u2022 Abomination, A DUP Opera is at the Lyric theatre, Belfast, 8-10 November, with a preview performance on 7 November.",
