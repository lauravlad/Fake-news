      "body": "<p>On the terrace of a recently renovated market hall overlooking Moscow\u2019s Trubnaya Square, lounge music beats played as well-dressed customers drank from bottles of craft beer or cradled glasses of Aperol spritz.<strong> </strong>Below them, as the concrete glowed in the last rays of sunshine, hundreds of riot police chased groups of young people through the square and into neighbouring streets, roughly bundling those they caught into waiting police vans. A booming voice from a loudspeaker on one of the police buses cut through the music on the terrace, threatening the protesters with arrest.</p> <p>The scene \u2013 played out last Saturday as police met a protest about opposition access to the Moscow local elections with the largest number of arrests in recent Russian history \u2013 was a striking distillation of the contradictions of life under mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who in recent years has offered Muscovites an impressive programme of urban beautification while keeping extremely strict<strong> </strong>limitations on political freedom.</p> <p>The protests are the biggest the<strong> </strong>capital has seen for nearly a decade. The issue of independent and opposition candidates being barred from standing in September\u2019s elections to the Moscow city parliament is relatively niche, but a broader, more existential discontent has coalesced around it. This Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/02/russia-protesters-threatened-with-jail-before-planned-rally\" title=\"\">central Moscow was again thronged with protesters, who turned out despite the knowledge that they risked arrest</a>, court cases and prison terms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a78fd6cffb666c7a8852a8eb3530b219618c726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a78fd6cffb666c7a8852a8eb3530b219618c726/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mostly young people gather in central Moscow to demand that opposition candidates be included on ballots for local elections in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mostly young people gather in central Moscow to demand that opposition candidates be included on ballots for local elections next September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pavel Golovkin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sergei Orlov, a 33-year-old IT worker, said he hadn\u2019t been to many demonstrations but had been angered by last weekend\u2019s crackdown. \u201cMy mother taught me to vote, and these elections show that even that\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said, walking with hundreds of protesters near Pushkin Square, as riot police looked on.</p> <p>Rainy weather combined with the strong police response to last weekend\u2019s rally meant that the numbers of protesters were lower than had been expected. Nevertheless, the anger being expressed suggests that the bargain president Vladimir Putin allowed Sobyanin to make with Russia\u2019s capital is beginning to disintegrate, just as Putin\u2019s popularity across Russia is sliding. The aggressive line the authorities have taken could be counterproductive, but concessions may start a spiral effect that will chip away at the Kremlin\u2019s grip on power.</p> <p>Leading the protests are associates of campaigner Alexei Navalny, whose team of investigators shine a light on rampant corruption among Russia\u2019s elite. Their well-documented and slickly produced videos contain allegations that are hard for the Kremlin to brush off. Punishments for Navalny\u2019s activities in recent years have included a ban on appearing on state television, repeated court cases, the jailing of his brother for several years, an attack with green paint that almost made him blind in one eye, and a refusal to allow him on to the ballot paper for the 2018 presidential election. He was jailed for 30 days last month to keep him away from this round of protests, and last week suffered what his lawyers claim could have been a poisoning attempt in jail.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of those protesting are young people who are doing reasonably well financially, but want  Russia to become a different kind of country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A group of Navanly\u2019s associates are emerging from his shadow and proving equally problematic. Lyubov Sobol, a 31-year-old lawyer who has worked with Navalny since 2011, planned to stand as an independent in the Moscow elections and collected the thousands of voter signatures required, only to be told, like others, that an \u201cexpert committee\u201d had found many of the signatures to be fake, and her candidacy invalid. Refusing to take no for an answer, she was carried out of the electoral committee office on the sofa where she had planted herself. Videos of her berating electoral officials about their corruption have gone viral.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, they understand that if they let even one independent into the Moscow city parliament, it will become a completely different place,\u201d she told the<em> Observer </em>last week. \u201cThere is no discussion about any important issues there at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Sobol is three weeks into a hunger strike over not being allowed to stand, and was speaking from a camp bed at the independent candidates\u2019 campaign headquarters. Her voice still had its steely resolve, but she spoke at a fraction of her usual volume, and complained of a spinning head and kidney pain. She is determined to continue her protest, however.</p> <p>When she began her hunger strike, even many of her supporters thought it was a strange battle to pick, but the protest is now about more than a mere local parliament vote, and Sobol has become one of its key figures.

In that case, the authorities stepped back and freed Golunov, and they have also made concessions in a number of other recent cases of single-issue protests.

      "bodyText": "On the terrace of a recently renovated market hall overlooking Moscow\u2019s Trubnaya Square, lounge music beats played as well-dressed customers drank from bottles of craft beer or cradled glasses of Aperol spritz. Below them, as the concrete glowed in the last rays of sunshine, hundreds of riot police chased groups of young people through the square and into neighbouring streets, roughly bundling those they caught into waiting police vans. A booming voice from a loudspeaker on one of the police buses cut through the music on the terrace, threatening the protesters with arrest. The scene \u2013 played out last Saturday as police met a protest about opposition access to the Moscow local elections with the largest number of arrests in recent Russian history \u2013 was a striking distillation of the contradictions of life under mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who in recent years has offered Muscovites an impressive programme of urban beautification while keeping extremely strict limitations on political freedom. The protests are the biggest the capital has seen for nearly a decade. The issue of independent and opposition candidates being barred from standing in September\u2019s elections to the Moscow city parliament is relatively niche, but a broader, more existential discontent has coalesced around it. This Saturday, central Moscow was again thronged with protesters, who turned out despite the knowledge that they risked arrest, court cases and prison terms. Sergei Orlov, a 33-year-old IT worker, said he hadn\u2019t been to many demonstrations but had been angered by last weekend\u2019s crackdown. \u201cMy mother taught me to vote, and these elections show that even that\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said, walking with hundreds of protesters near Pushkin Square, as riot police looked on. Rainy weather combined with the strong police response to last weekend\u2019s rally meant that the numbers of protesters were lower than had been expected. Nevertheless, the anger being expressed suggests that the bargain president Vladimir Putin allowed Sobyanin to make with Russia\u2019s capital is beginning to disintegrate, just as Putin\u2019s popularity across Russia is sliding. The aggressive line the authorities have taken could be counterproductive, but concessions may start a spiral effect that will chip away at the Kremlin\u2019s grip on power. Leading the protests are associates of campaigner Alexei Navalny, whose team of investigators shine a light on rampant corruption among Russia\u2019s elite. Their well-documented and slickly produced videos contain allegations that are hard for the Kremlin to brush off. Punishments for Navalny\u2019s activities in recent years have included a ban on appearing on state television, repeated court cases, the jailing of his brother for several years, an attack with green paint that almost made him blind in one eye, and a refusal to allow him on to the ballot paper for the 2018 presidential election. He was jailed for 30 days last month to keep him away from this round of protests, and last week suffered what his lawyers claim could have been a poisoning attempt in jail. A group of Navanly\u2019s associates are emerging from his shadow and proving equally problematic. Lyubov Sobol, a 31-year-old lawyer who has worked with Navalny since 2011, planned to stand as an independent in the Moscow elections and collected the thousands of voter signatures required, only to be told, like others, that an \u201cexpert committee\u201d had found many of the signatures to be fake, and her candidacy invalid. Refusing to take no for an answer, she was carried out of the electoral committee office on the sofa where she had planted herself. Videos of her berating electoral officials about their corruption have gone viral. \u201cOf course, they understand that if they let even one independent into the Moscow city parliament, it will become a completely different place,\u201d she told the Observer last week. \u201cThere is no discussion about any important issues there at the moment.\u201d Sobol is three weeks into a hunger strike over not being allowed to stand, and was speaking from a camp bed at the independent candidates\u2019 campaign headquarters. Her voice still had its steely resolve, but she spoke at a fraction of her usual volume, and complained of a spinning head and kidney pain. She is determined to continue her protest, however. When she began her hunger strike, even many of her supporters thought it was a strange battle to pick, but the protest is now about more than a mere local parliament vote, and Sobol has become one of its key figures. On Saturday, she gathered her strength to set out for the protest, but was detained before it even started. \u201cWho are you scared of? Are you scared of your own citizens, of a woman on her 20th day of hunger strike?\u201d she shouted as riot police bundled her into a waiting van. The political mood now is reminiscent of the last major protest season to hit the country, in late 2011 and 2012, when the illusion that Russia could be heading for liberalisation under Dmitry Medvedev was dispelled by Putin\u2019s announcing his return to the Kremlin.

      "bodyText": "I am a long-time Labour activist in an erstwhile Tory stronghold, and Paul Mason\u2019s call for a Labour-led, cross-party response to the threat of rightwing populism resonates strongly (Labour must adopt a tactic from the 1930s: a popular front, Journal, 3 August). I joined Labour as a hard-up lone parent and council tenant because I saw where Thatcherism was leading and wanted to be part of the resistance. As socialists we surely cannot ignore the urgent threat now posed not only to our increasingly fragile postwar social contract but also to our party as a credible voice for the many. Yes \u2013 we do want to defeat Boris Johnson and the triumph of nationalism, greed, vanity, narrow self-interest and intolerance that his premiership represents. Labour must offer the leadership that Mason proposes, not just because of what the polls, professionals and historians are telling us but because of what we heard time and again on doorsteps in May from the many people who once saw Labour as their party. The mood has changed since 2017. First past the post looks increasingly unlikely to deliver a sound Labour majority, however fervently we will it. We need to put country before party and the people before tribal reflexes, and thwart the disaster that leaving the EU would most heavily inflict on the poorest in our communities. If we succeed we must then reflect on the lessons learned from this sorry episode, including the consequences of clinging to an electoral system that continues to work in favour of the few. Brenda Weston Taunton, Somerset \u2022 Paul Mason makes clear the near-inevitability of a snap general election and the need for a temporary alliance of the parties of the left and centre to beat Johnson and prevent the disaster of a no-deal Brexit. He concludes that Labour members should \u201crule nothing out\u201d. To this 90-year-old member, who remembers the bliss of 1945 and is beyond anger at the state we are now in, it is obvious that the elephant in the room is Jeremy Corbyn. Once such an inspiration, his name has become toxic \u2013 and the direction of change is irreversible. To avoid a fatal split in the party, senior shadow cabinet members, such as Tom Watson, Emily Thornberry, Keir Starmer, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, must now combine to convince Corbyn to stand down voluntarily and with his dignity intact. His successor must commit enthusiastically to what is now clearly in the best interests of the people of the United Kingdom: remaining in Europe. This is, I firmly believe, our only hope. Dan Willis Gillingham, Kent \u2022 Paul Mason is, as usual, spot on when he advocates some kind of united front. All progressive-minded people understand that if Johnson and Farage are hellbent on something, it must be destructive and harmful for ordinary folk.

I joined the Labour party in 1964, and voted for Corbyn as leader twice. Robert Leach Selkirk, Scottish Borders \u2022 Paul Mason is right. We face a crisis. Sooner or later, there will be a snap general election. Johnson and Farage will get their act together and, against a divided opposition, will win. The outcome will be Brexit and a horrible far-right government.

Boris Johnson backed the proposal along with the four other candidates still in the race when it was raised by Sajid Javid during the BBC Tory leadership debate in June. In an interview on Sunday, Cleverly said there would be an independent inquiry but he did not explicitly confirm that it would be be specific to Islamophobia rather than a general inquiry into racism. Subsequently, a party source told the Guardian that the party was considering options for \u201can investigation into all types of prejudice and discrimination\u201d, rather than the Islamophobia-specific one that the Muslim Council of Britain has been calling for. A spokesman for the MCB said the party needed to clarify exactly what was being proposed, and it would be a travesty if Johnson did not honour the promise given during the BBC debate. \u201cThere are over 100 incidents of Islamophobia that we have identified yourselves in the past year alone,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe Conservative party\u2019s approach to Islamophobia has thus far been one of denial and obfuscation.

The MCB has been calling for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party for more than a year, claiming that multiple incidents show that party officials are not doing enough to reprimand or remove those who express Islamophobic views. A YouGov poll this year suggesting that 54% of Conservative party members think Islam is \u201cgenerally a threat to the British way of life\u201d has also been cited as evidence that Islamophobia is entrenched in the party. Asked about this finding, Cleverly told Sky that the Tories did not share their membership data with YouGov and that therefore there was some doubt as to whether those surveyed for the poll were all party members. He said the party took a \u201crobust line\u201d with people who said inappropriate things.",

It was very hot in Beijing that morning and I had gone to a meeting with my publishing agent. I kept checking the BBC app on my phone for news. Finally, after leaving the meeting, while waiting for a taxi, my phone buzzed \u2013 the UK had chosen to leave.</p> <p>Suddenly I was reminded of an old Yugoslav film, <em>Walter Defends Sarajevo</em>, which was <a href=\"https://qz.com/quartzy/1589664/chinas-love-for-old-yugoslav-war-movie-fuels-balkan-tourism-boom/\" title=\"\">very popular in China</a> in the 1970s. There is a famous line that many Chinese people will remember: \u201cThe air is shaking, as if the sky is going to burn. The storm is coming.\u201d</p> <p>Within a few hours, I published an article titled \u201cThe storm is coming\u201d. It was read by more than 100,000 people in just one hour. Later, I persuaded my editor to do a cover story on Brexit. We put that out within 72 hours, under the headline: \u201cBrexit: are we facing the reversal of globalisation?\u201d That edition sold almost 200,000 copies \u2013 even more than our report on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win.</p> <p>Not many Chinese people care about the technical or legal details of the Brexit deal, but the saga has made an impression. The reputation of British democracy has suffered. If you ask someone on the streets of Beijing what they think of Brexit, they might say: \u201cDemocracy only leads to confusion.\u201d I know that\u2019s not true, but it is difficult to change their impression.</p> <p>For the past two or three decades, the US and Britain have been cultural symbols in Chinese people\u2019s eyes: the US powerful, rich, enviable; the UK exquisite, elegant. Public intellectuals, especially liberals, talk about the British style of constitutionalism, comparing it to our Soviet-style totalitarian regime. Students know more about Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher than JFK or Bill Clinton. That is real \u201csoft power\u201d.</p> <p>But now this image has collapsed. In the Brexit farce, there is no Churchill or Thatcher, only a dozen mediocre politicians, none of whom want to take responsibility or unite the nation. This has encouraged the nationalists in China, especially the young generation born after 1989. With the \u201chelp\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown\" title=\"\">great firewall</a>, they knew little about the inner crisis of their own country. But they see that China now has more aircraft carriers, more missiles and more hi-tech fighters, while the UK is trapped in the wallows of Brexit. There is an inner voice in their hearts: \u201cNow we are strong. They are weak.

Four years ago, Marine Le Pen could still float the Frexit temptation and lead some of her supporters to believe that leaving the EU would somehow solve France\u2019s problems.</p> <p>By the time she launched her campaign for the 2017 presidential election, the Brexit referendum had already had one effect: the Front National leader no longer dared push her Frexit argument any more, confining herself instead to attacking the euro and advocating a return to the old franc. Even this proved a bad idea.</p> <p>In the last TV debate between the two rounds of the election, Emmanuel Macron crushed Le Pen by proving how incoherent her idea of a French paradise outside the eurozone actually was. It took a year for her to recover, and two years for her party \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/marine-le-pen-rebrands-front-national-in-push-for-support\" title=\"\">now renamed National Rally</a> \u2013 to produce a programme admitting that leaving the euro was \u201cnot a priority any more\u201d.</p> <p>But for us, this has been the only silver lining of the Brexit saga. Watching the long descent of Westminster into something resembling hell has been an exhausting experience. Theresa May\u2019s very British resilience was impressive, but we ended up pitying her. Nigel Farage\u2019s type was all too familiar to us: we well understood just how dangerous he was. Some of us once found Boris Johnson funny; we long ago stopped laughing. John Bercow\u2019s ties and desperate calls for order made a good show, but on the whole, this was a cast with too many villains and too few heroes.</p> <p>Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as an example, and watch prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons with envy: for us, accustomed to semi-monarchical presidents of the Republic, this was the very Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy. Now that Rolls-Royce looks more like a dodgem.</p> <p>We have come to dread seeing old British friends, now so obsessed with Brexit that it is all but impossible to talk of anything else. We wondered how it was possible for such brilliant public servants and such a legendary diplomatic service to be unable to come up with better plans and bring them to the negotiating table.</p> <p>And we could not understand how a former empire could dream of becoming \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. All our myths, in short, have been destroyed. Instead of taking back control, the Brits seemed to be losing their minds.</p> <p>Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\" title=\"\">France had its own crisis</a>: the <em>gilets jaunes</em>. It was violent, ugly, destabilising. Maybe Brexit was Britain\u2019s <em>gilets jaunes</em> moment? The UK version of a widespread crisis of representative democracy? Less violent \u2013 but, in the end, more destructive.</p> <p>Watching this final episode, of the election of a prime minister by 0.2% of the population, many of us came to this conclusion: this is a British crisis, not a European one. And you will never solve it without leaving, one way or another. So please, go now. Check the freezing temperature outside, fix your problem. And then come back.

Quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Khu\u00ea Pham, </em><em>staff writer, Zeit magazine</em></p> <p>It has been difficult to write with the eye of a neutral observer about an event, Brexit, that can feel like a personal affront. After Berlin, London was my second home town, a place where I had gone to university and lived for four years. Yet the vote to leave made me realise that perhaps there was a side to Britain I had overlooked.</p> <p>I learned a lot since then \u2013 not just about Britain, but also our blindspots as reporters. I saw parallels to Brexit not just in Donald Trump\u2019s election victory later that year, but also in the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alternative-fur-deutschland-afd\" title=\"\">Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland</a> at the 2017 elections in Germany. All three raise questions of social inequality that we have failed to address until now. The problem is that we are still looking for ways to resolve them. People are more disillusioned about politics than ever, and yet we are nowhere nearer to cleaning up the mess.</p> <p>For our readers at <em>Die Zeit</em>, Boris Johnson is by far the most intriguing character in the Brexit drama. He makes them come out in a rash \u2013 it\u2019s as if they are allergic to him. They feel he has been disdainful towards Europeans, treating Europe as a big joke. That view will stick around even as prime minister \u2013 quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that.</p> <p>I wrote a profile of him during the referendum campaign, and the impression I had then was of someone who doesn\u2019t actually have a very strong opinion on Europe at all, and who isn\u2019t really interested in the detail part of politics, which requires hard work. His stint as foreign secretary only confirmed that, so I am really surprised how many British commentators now endorse him as a prime minister.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s soft power has already started to diminish. Caught up in Brexit, the UK government doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to play a role in European politics any more. I think the German public has started to lose interest in the latest details of the negotiations \u2013 they used to think of Britain as being very cool, now it\u2019s seen as a big mess.</p> <p>I am not very hopeful about good relations between Britain and Germany in the near future. Merkel is on her way out and there\u2019s no strong candidate to succeed her. The danger is that in a year\u2019s time both Britain and Germany could be in a volatile state, both with leaders who need to prove to the electorate that they can be tough in negotiations. I fear the UK will come to miss Merkel as a pillar of stability.<br><strong>As told to Philip Oltermann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"849d662ee6d0a5e8ee1c815ce64ade33786d0b88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/849d662ee6d0a5e8ee1c815ce64ade33786d0b88/0_0_770_775/497.jpg\" alt=\"Nobuyuki Suzuki of Tokyo Shimbum\" width=\"497\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Japan: \u2018The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Nobuyuki Suzuki, media and entertainment news editor, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper</em></p> <p>I\u2019m very concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. This is unprecedented. I\u2019m afraid that Japanese companies will continue to rethink their investments in Britain, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/11/no-deal-brexit-could-cost-japanese-auto-makers-in-uk-1bn-a-year\" title=\"\">Nissan and Honda have already done</a>.</p> <p>Japanese companies invested in Britain because it was a member of the EU. But agreeing a Japan-UK free trade deal after Brexit would take a very long time, and during that period it would be difficult for Japanese firms to continue operating in Britain.</p> <p>With or without a deal, leaving the EU is a bad idea and I hope, somehow, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think David Cameron ever thought that Britain would vote to leave, but voters were influenced by fake news claims about membership of the EU and what leaving would mean. They were persuaded that Brexit would be easy.</p> <p>I feel very sorry for British voters. A lot of people who voted to leave saw themselves as victims of globalisation. If I was a British factory worker and I had lost my job, I would have been tempted to support leaving the EU. The gap between rich and poor was growing. Immigration was also an issue. People looked around and thought: \u201cI want to go back to the way Britain was.\u201d I don\u2019t think voters were given enough information about what the issues were before the referendum, and there should have been much more discussion of the risks and benefits of leaving.</p> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is considering calling for a referendum on revising Japan\u2019s postwar constitution (to legally recognise the self-defence forces, Japan\u2019s de facto military). If Brexit has taught us anything, it is that the media have to do more to ensure that the public has a proper grasp of both sides of the argument.</p> <p>We run a lot of Brexit stories in the <em>Tokyo Shimbun</em>. It\u2019s one of the hottest foreign news stories around. The tone of our coverage is almost always downbeat and we talk a lot about how chaotic British politics has become.</p> <p>The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed, first because of Brexit and now because of the rise of Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Johnson doesn\u2019t fit the stereotype of an English gentleman. He reminds a lot of people in Japan of Donald Trump, both physically and in terms of his political style.</p> <p>Johnson looks a little wild, and he speaks his mind. We don\u2019t have politicians like that in Japan. What he says about politics doesn\u2019t really matter to the Japanese\u2026 instead we are intrigued by the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak or behave like a conventional politician.<br><strong>As told to Justin McCurry</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a3b28cda164ac03d7b701bbd1a73dca60320dd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3b28cda164ac03d7b701bbd1a73dca60320dd68/0_100_898_858/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mihir Sharma\" width=\"500\" height=\"478\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>India: \u2018If Britain wants a deal with India, it will have to relax immigration. This is non-negotiable\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Mihir Sharma, author, Bloomberg columnist, and senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi</em></p> <p>I visit the UK regularly and was there during the referendum. I was surprised but not shocked at the result. The Westminster system, which we share, is meant to conceal the real \u201cwill of the people\u201d. It\u2019s a bad idea to combine that with referendums. You might discover what people actually want, which is usually something politicians, and reality, can\u2019t deliver.</p> <p>The result, observing the saga unfold from afar, is high comedy: a political class that is trapped by its own promises and lies into delivering the undeliverable and which is now losing all credibility as a consequence. It\u2019s been strange to watch the incredible arrogance on display in England (not Britain), which reveals itself in this belief that they will somehow be a desirable location or partner for other countries once they leave Europe. </p> <p>Such a giant and inexplicable act of self-harm would be sad if it happened to a country less sure of itself, but when it happens to England, it is amusing as well.</p> <p>Britain confuses its standing with that of London. London is a great global city. Britain is a small European country with ideas above its station. People will continue to shop in London. Companies will locate less in Britain. The Indian government will pay less attention to the British prime minister and more to Brussels and Berlin.</p> <p>It seems to me that too many people in London seem to believe, deep down, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. They don\u2019t seem to realise they are now strangers in their own country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a91283364738efbf8ae2cc82856335e6db066d7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91283364738efbf8ae2cc82856335e6db066d7a/212_0_2607_1565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by James Melaugh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by James Melaugh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: James Melaugh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a political analyst, I have learned quite a few things from Brexit. For one, I see it as a warning of the danger in allowing a single issue to take over all politics, all economic planning, and in fact all conversation. Brexit has dumbed Britain down.</p> <p>For another, politicians need to realise that in democracies like Britain or India, people are always angry: whether at austerity, or decreasing living standards, or immigration, or religious diversity. Anger just needs a target. The Brexit referendum gave them one: the EU. The country that invented the Westminster system, intended to control popular anger, seems to have forgotten how to run a democracy.</p> <p>India, like others, has noticed for the first time that Europe exists independently of Britain. India thought of Europe as Britain\u2019s backyard. Brexit means we will now develop independent relationships with European countries. Britain, and London, will become less important.</p> <p>If Brexiters think that negotiating a trade agreement with India is going to be easy, they are in for a nasty shock. There is a far stronger belief in Britain than in India in the power of nostalgia and a \u201cshared history\u201d. It won\u2019t impact trade negotiations at all. If Britain wants a deal, it will have to concede India\u2019s demand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/ease-migration-rules-for-indians-to-win-post-brexit-deals-say-mps\" title=\"\">easier work visas for professionals and students</a>. It will have to relax immigration. This is as non-negotiable for New Delhi as it is for Brussels. I\u2019m sure Brexiters will be fine with that!</p> <p>Britain\u2019s reputation for common sense and pragmatism has been severely damaged by Brexit.

There\u2019s some interest in the political spectacle, but the importance of Great Britain in the consciousness of South Africa has waned. Yet there\u2019s a gleefulness in watching the British realise the ineptitude of their own politicians. I guess we suffered when they were colonial rulers, and Boris Johnson [encapsulates] everything you might lampoon about Britain and its idea of itself.</p> <p>In South Africa we have problems with our own politicians, and it is almost consoling to see that we are not alone. Britain is trying to figure itself out in 2019 and is suddenly realising that it\u2019s not that important any more. </p> <p>Britain has come to think of itself in very noble terms, and to do that it has had to fundamentally erase its dealings with the colonies. Its history has been written that way. I am a fourth-generation South African of Indian descent, so my own history is riddled with Britain\u2019s colonialism, and all that is glossed over.</p> <p>Of course we were surprised by the referendum result, but when you zoom out a bit it all makes sense.

We get that the drama is related. No one thought Britain would vote to leave the EU, until it did. No one thought Trump would win the presidency, until he did.</p> <p>What happened in the UK in June 2016 later looked like the harbinger of America\u2019s political upheaval. Or maybe it felt more soothing that way. Here, America may not have wanted to be first.</p> <p>If the comparisons between Trump and Brexit seemed straightforward \u2013 the rise of populism and rightwing nationalism; the distrust of institutions and the \u201celite\u201d \u2013 it became clear the events connected in deeper, murkier ways. Misinformation became a feature of both the referendum and the presidential campaign: the UK had the Brexit bus, the US had (well, still has) Trump\u2019s twitter feed. Fake news was amplified on social media, including by Russian trolls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolecadwalladr\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a> appeared as a villain in both. So, somehow, did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/video-reveals-steve-bannon-links-to-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Steve Bannon</a>.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s ascension to prime minister feels a bit like we still don\u2019t get it, that all the forces that made Trump and Brexit possible have only hardened in the three years since. Johnson, Americans know, is the guy that sold Brexit, and Brexit really has not gone well. But his party, at least, is buying into his vision, even doubling down on it. It puts a knot in our stomach about 2020.</p> <p>Johnson isn\u2019t exactly \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d. Their commonalities are mostly superficial: born in New York, both have populist appeal despite a privileged upbringing; both court controversy and are owners of questionable hairstyles. But Johnson appears more savvy, more shrewd, more deliberate. He\u2019s Trump, if Trump were in on the joke.</p> <p>The end result might be the same for both nations: leaders who cater to the voters who buy into their rhetoric, leaving everyone else to condemn their lies. Two men who should be cast off as ridiculous were they not so capable of tapping into anger, resentment, racism.</p> <p>Johnson and Trump will meet as heads of state at the G7 later this month, and the next, weirder stage of the special relationship will begin. It could be short-lived. Trump\u2019s presidency has strained democratic alliances, and amplified some uncomfortable bonds, from Jair Bolsonaro to Mohammad bin Salman. But the US under Trump doesn\u2019t look as desperate for friends as the UK does in its breakup with the EU. The Brexiters seem to think that the US will be a better substitute for the EU. But Trump can\u2019t be trusted, particularly not on trade, where his one organising principle is that everyone\u2019s out to take advantage of the US. And even if Trump gets along with Johnson now, he might be looking over his shoulder for someone better, or, really, just Nigel Farage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5f82a61e7da5b34c3b67b26ab8bd00528be16bb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f82a61e7da5b34c3b67b26ab8bd00528be16bb4/0_0_800_723/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fernanda Mena, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Brazil: \u2018The UK appears fixated on its own problems \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Fernanda Mena, columnist, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo</em></p> <p>Many of my peers, upper-middle-class Paulistas, are anglophiles, people who appreciate Britain as the homeland of ideas of liberalism, free markets and multiculturalism \u2013 all reinforced by the soft power of British pop culture. We have always seen London as one of the capitals of the world \u2013 very cosmopolitan and full of youth culture.</p> <p>And as Brazilians we know that Brits in general are better educated than us. So it was quite shocking to see people being driven by lies to vote for Brexit \u2013 and betraying all those principles of multiculturalism, liberalism and free markets.</p> <p>I was incredulous when I heard the result, but looking back at the time I spent studying in London, there were one or two things that could have given me a sign of what was to come. For example, the scandal that broke in 2009 about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/11/primark-ethical-business-living\" title=\"\">Primark paying very low wages to Manchester textile workers</a> \u2013 we never thought of the British working-class as being as exploited as workers in eastern Asia. And of course this has to do with globalisation.</p> <p>A link between Brexit and Brazil is the use of social media to target uncertain and vulnerable voters with fake news. It happened here in Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s election \u2013 and maybe it is not a coincidence that Bolsonaro is close to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/video-reveals-steve-bannon-links-to-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Steve Bannon</a>, who was key in Trump\u2019s election.</p> <p>It looked mad that Britain wanted to leave the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. In June, Brazil, as part of the Mercosur economic area, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48807161\" title=\"\">signed a major trade deal with the EU</a>, so I think the relationship we have with the UK will be much weaker. My impression with Brexit is that a lot of companies will leave the UK. The UK is still the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/\" title=\"\">fifth-largest economy</a> but for how much longer? It appears so self-centred, fixated on its own problems that it is currently out of the global debate \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly.<br><strong>As told to Ian Tucker</strong> </p>",

      "bodyText": "China: \u2018The Brexit farce has encouraged the nationalists in China, especially the young generation\u2019 Liu Ye, editor of international affairs at Sanlian Life Week magazine in Beijing I remember the day of the referendum. It was very hot in Beijing that morning and I had gone to a meeting with my publishing agent. I kept checking the BBC app on my phone for news. Finally, after leaving the meeting, while waiting for a taxi, my phone buzzed \u2013 the UK had chosen to leave. Suddenly I was reminded of an old Yugoslav film, Walter Defends Sarajevo, which was very popular in China in the 1970s. There is a famous line that many Chinese people will remember: \u201cThe air is shaking, as if the sky is going to burn. The storm is coming.\u201d Within a few hours, I published an article titled \u201cThe storm is coming\u201d. It was read by more than 100,000 people in just one hour. Later, I persuaded my editor to do a cover story on Brexit. We put that out within 72 hours, under the headline: \u201cBrexit: are we facing the reversal of globalisation?\u201d That edition sold almost 200,000 copies \u2013 even more than our report on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win. Not many Chinese people care about the technical or legal details of the Brexit deal, but the saga has made an impression. The reputation of British democracy has suffered. If you ask someone on the streets of Beijing what they think of Brexit, they might say: \u201cDemocracy only leads to confusion.\u201d I know that\u2019s not true, but it is difficult to change their impression. For the past two or three decades, the US and Britain have been cultural symbols in Chinese people\u2019s eyes: the US powerful, rich, enviable; the UK exquisite, elegant. Public intellectuals, especially liberals, talk about the British style of constitutionalism, comparing it to our Soviet-style totalitarian regime. Students know more about Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher than JFK or Bill Clinton. That is real \u201csoft power\u201d. But now this image has collapsed. In the Brexit farce, there is no Churchill or Thatcher, only a dozen mediocre politicians, none of whom want to take responsibility or unite the nation. This has encouraged the nationalists in China, especially the young generation born after 1989. With the \u201chelp\u201d of the great firewall, they knew little about the inner crisis of their own country. But they see that China now has more aircraft carriers, more missiles and more hi-tech fighters, while the UK is trapped in the wallows of Brexit. There is an inner voice in their hearts: \u201cNow we are strong. They are weak. We have nothing to learn from them.\u201d That\u2019s the danger. Today, no one really cares about Boris Johnson, but since he was the one who called for Brexit at the beginning, Chinese people will be interested to see how he can turn his commitment into reality. As told to Lily Kuo France: \u2018Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as the Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy\u2019 Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director and contributor, Le Monde First, I should say that we French Europeans are grateful to our British friends for making sure one word has exited our vocabulary: Frexit. For Brexit has made Frexit impossible. Four years ago, Marine Le Pen could still float the Frexit temptation and lead some of her supporters to believe that leaving the EU would somehow solve France\u2019s problems. By the time she launched her campaign for the 2017 presidential election, the Brexit referendum had already had one effect: the Front National leader no longer dared push her Frexit argument any more, confining herself instead to attacking the euro and advocating a return to the old franc. Even this proved a bad idea. In the last TV debate between the two rounds of the election, Emmanuel Macron crushed Le Pen by proving how incoherent her idea of a French paradise outside the eurozone actually was. It took a year for her to recover, and two years for her party \u2013 now renamed National Rally \u2013 to produce a programme admitting that leaving the euro was \u201cnot a priority any more\u201d. But for us, this has been the only silver lining of the Brexit saga. Watching the long descent of Westminster into something resembling hell has been an exhausting experience. Theresa May\u2019s very British resilience was impressive, but we ended up pitying her. Nigel Farage\u2019s type was all too familiar to us: we well understood just how dangerous he was. Some of us once found Boris Johnson funny; we long ago stopped laughing. John Bercow\u2019s ties and desperate calls for order made a good show, but on the whole, this was a cast with too many villains and too few heroes. Once, we used to hold up British parliamentary life as an example, and watch prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons with envy: for us, accustomed to semi-monarchical presidents of the Republic, this was the very Rolls-Royce of liberal democracy. Now that Rolls-Royce looks more like a dodgem. We have come to dread seeing old British friends, now so obsessed with Brexit that it is all but impossible to talk of anything else. We wondered how it was possible for such brilliant public servants and such a legendary diplomatic service to be unable to come up with better plans and bring them to the negotiating table. And we could not understand how a former empire could dream of becoming \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. All our myths, in short, have been destroyed. Instead of taking back control, the Brits seemed to be losing their minds. Then France had its own crisis: the gilets jaunes. It was violent, ugly, destabilising. Maybe Brexit was Britain\u2019s gilets jaunes moment? The UK version of a widespread crisis of representative democracy? Less violent \u2013 but, in the end, more destructive. Watching this final episode, of the election of a prime minister by 0.2% of the population, many of us came to this conclusion: this is a British crisis, not a European one. And you will never solve it without leaving, one way or another. So please, go now. Check the freezing temperature outside, fix your problem. And then come back. The door will stay open, because we do want you back. Just calmed down a bit. As told to Jon Henley Germany: \u2018Johnson is seen as treating Europe as a big joke. Quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that\u2019 Khu\u00ea Pham, staff writer, Zeit magazine It has been difficult to write with the eye of a neutral observer about an event, Brexit, that can feel like a personal affront. After Berlin, London was my second home town, a place where I had gone to university and lived for four years. Yet the vote to leave made me realise that perhaps there was a side to Britain I had overlooked. I learned a lot since then \u2013 not just about Britain, but also our blindspots as reporters. I saw parallels to Brexit not just in Donald Trump\u2019s election victory later that year, but also in the rise of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland at the 2017 elections in Germany. All three raise questions of social inequality that we have failed to address until now. The problem is that we are still looking for ways to resolve them. People are more disillusioned about politics than ever, and yet we are nowhere nearer to cleaning up the mess. For our readers at Die Zeit, Boris Johnson is by far the most intriguing character in the Brexit drama. He makes them come out in a rash \u2013 it\u2019s as if they are allergic to him. They feel he has been disdainful towards Europeans, treating Europe as a big joke. That view will stick around even as prime minister \u2013 quoting witty lines in Latin won\u2019t change that. I wrote a profile of him during the referendum campaign, and the impression I had then was of someone who doesn\u2019t actually have a very strong opinion on Europe at all, and who isn\u2019t really interested in the detail part of politics, which requires hard work. His stint as foreign secretary only confirmed that, so I am really surprised how many British commentators now endorse him as a prime minister. Britain\u2019s soft power has already started to diminish. Caught up in Brexit, the UK government doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to play a role in European politics any more. I think the German public has started to lose interest in the latest details of the negotiations \u2013 they used to think of Britain as being very cool, now it\u2019s seen as a big mess. I am not very hopeful about good relations between Britain and Germany in the near future. Merkel is on her way out and there\u2019s no strong candidate to succeed her. The danger is that in a year\u2019s time both Britain and Germany could be in a volatile state, both with leaders who need to prove to the electorate that they can be tough in negotiations. I fear the UK will come to miss Merkel as a pillar of stability. As told to Philip Oltermann Japan: \u2018The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed\u2019 Nobuyuki Suzuki, media and entertainment news editor, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper I\u2019m very concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. This is unprecedented. I\u2019m afraid that Japanese companies will continue to rethink their investments in Britain, as Nissan and Honda have already done. Japanese companies invested in Britain because it was a member of the EU. But agreeing a Japan-UK free trade deal after Brexit would take a very long time, and during that period it would be difficult for Japanese firms to continue operating in Britain. With or without a deal, leaving the EU is a bad idea and I hope, somehow, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think David Cameron ever thought that Britain would vote to leave, but voters were influenced by fake news claims about membership of the EU and what leaving would mean. They were persuaded that Brexit would be easy. I feel very sorry for British voters. A lot of people who voted to leave saw themselves as victims of globalisation. If I was a British factory worker and I had lost my job, I would have been tempted to support leaving the EU. The gap between rich and poor was growing. Immigration was also an issue. People looked around and thought: \u201cI want to go back to the way Britain was.\u201d I don\u2019t think voters were given enough information about what the issues were before the referendum, and there should have been much more discussion of the risks and benefits of leaving. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is considering calling for a referendum on revising Japan\u2019s postwar constitution (to legally recognise the self-defence forces, Japan\u2019s de facto military). If Brexit has taught us anything, it is that the media have to do more to ensure that the public has a proper grasp of both sides of the argument. We run a lot of Brexit stories in the Tokyo Shimbun. It\u2019s one of the hottest foreign news stories around. The tone of our coverage is almost always downbeat and we talk a lot about how chaotic British politics has become. The Japanese have always seen Britain as a gentle, stable country, but that has changed, first because of Brexit and now because of the rise of Boris Johnson. Johnson doesn\u2019t fit the stereotype of an English gentleman. He reminds a lot of people in Japan of Donald Trump, both physically and in terms of his political style. Johnson looks a little wild, and he speaks his mind. We don\u2019t have politicians like that in Japan. What he says about politics doesn\u2019t really matter to the Japanese\u2026 instead we are intrigued by the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak or behave like a conventional politician. As told to Justin McCurry India: \u2018If Britain wants a deal with India, it will have to relax immigration. This is non-negotiable\u2019 Mihir Sharma, author, Bloomberg columnist, and senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi I visit the UK regularly and was there during the referendum. I was surprised but not shocked at the result. The Westminster system, which we share, is meant to conceal the real \u201cwill of the people\u201d. It\u2019s a bad idea to combine that with referendums. You might discover what people actually want, which is usually something politicians, and reality, can\u2019t deliver. The result, observing the saga unfold from afar, is high comedy: a political class that is trapped by its own promises and lies into delivering the undeliverable and which is now losing all credibility as a consequence. It\u2019s been strange to watch the incredible arrogance on display in England (not Britain), which reveals itself in this belief that they will somehow be a desirable location or partner for other countries once they leave Europe. Such a giant and inexplicable act of self-harm would be sad if it happened to a country less sure of itself, but when it happens to England, it is amusing as well. Britain confuses its standing with that of London. London is a great global city. Britain is a small European country with ideas above its station. People will continue to shop in London. Companies will locate less in Britain. The Indian government will pay less attention to the British prime minister and more to Brussels and Berlin. It seems to me that too many people in London seem to believe, deep down, that Brexit won\u2019t happen. They don\u2019t seem to realise they are now strangers in their own country. As a political analyst, I have learned quite a few things from Brexit. For one, I see it as a warning of the danger in allowing a single issue to take over all politics, all economic planning, and in fact all conversation. Brexit has dumbed Britain down. For another, politicians need to realise that in democracies like Britain or India, people are always angry: whether at austerity, or decreasing living standards, or immigration, or religious diversity. Anger just needs a target. The Brexit referendum gave them one: the EU. The country that invented the Westminster system, intended to control popular anger, seems to have forgotten how to run a democracy. India, like others, has noticed for the first time that Europe exists independently of Britain. India thought of Europe as Britain\u2019s backyard. Brexit means we will now develop independent relationships with European countries. Britain, and London, will become less important. If Brexiters think that negotiating a trade agreement with India is going to be easy, they are in for a nasty shock. There is a far stronger belief in Britain than in India in the power of nostalgia and a \u201cshared history\u201d. It won\u2019t impact trade negotiations at all. If Britain wants a deal, it will have to concede India\u2019s demand for easier work visas for professionals and students. It will have to relax immigration. This is as non-negotiable for New Delhi as it is for Brussels. I\u2019m sure Brexiters will be fine with that! Britain\u2019s reputation for common sense and pragmatism has been severely damaged by Brexit. I doubt it will survive a Boris Johnson premiership. As told to Amrit Dhillon South Africa: \u2018There\u2019s a gleefulness in watching the British realise the ineptitude of their own politicians\u2019 Khadija Patel, editor-in-chief, the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, Johannesburg People find Brexit inexplicable and are getting bored by it. There\u2019s some interest in the political spectacle, but the importance of Great Britain in the consciousness of South Africa has waned. Yet there\u2019s a gleefulness in watching the British realise the ineptitude of their own politicians. I guess we suffered when they were colonial rulers, and Boris Johnson [encapsulates] everything you might lampoon about Britain and its idea of itself. In South Africa we have problems with our own politicians, and it is almost consoling to see that we are not alone. Britain is trying to figure itself out in 2019 and is suddenly realising that it\u2019s not that important any more. Britain has come to think of itself in very noble terms, and to do that it has had to fundamentally erase its dealings with the colonies. Its history has been written that way. I am a fourth-generation South African of Indian descent, so my own history is riddled with Britain\u2019s colonialism, and all that is glossed over. Of course we were surprised by the referendum result, but when you zoom out a bit it all makes sense. We have seen similar shocks elsewhere \u2013 Trump, Modi in India, Bolsonaro in Brazil and so on. The global trend towards populism is scary. It fundamentally undermines democracy. I\u2019m going to be interested in how Boris Johnson deals with Africa\u2026 I don\u2019t think that [South African president] Cyril Ramaphosa or [foreign minister] Naledi Pandor are going to respond very well to him as a serious interlocutor with proposals about strengthening ties between our two countries. Britain will never hold that soft power again, no way. As told to Jason Burke Russia: \u2018Our leaders see Boris Johnson as temporary \u2013 a clown. They\u2019ll wait for the new leader\u2019 Alexey Venediktov, editor-in-chief, Echo of Moscow radio station The economic leadership of Russia is not happy [about Brexit]. They think turbulence is not in our interest because Russia has a fairly weak economy at the moment. It changes the rules now, while we are weak. They\u2019re concerned about the future. But the political leadership see a united front of western countries against them, and they see any weakening \u2013 the separatist movement in Catalonia, the rise of Salvini in Italy, the growth of the far right in the Netherlands and Germany, the exit of the UK from the EU \u2013 as a positive, because it makes our opponents look at themselves, not at us. I don\u2019t see a possibility [for relations to improve]. The bilateral relationship isn\u2019t determined by whether or not the UK is in the EU. Our relations of late have largely been determined by the Skripal case, and the British leadership is now seen as the most actively hostile European government to Russia. [Of greater importance to diplomacy is] Vladimir Putin\u2019s personal relationship with a leader, as we saw with George W Bush. Despite political differences, they had [a rapport] that helped smooth over many of the problems between Russia and the US. Unfortunately, the view of Boris Johnson in the leadership is quite negative. They don\u2019t think he is serious. They think he\u2019s a clown. And second, they think he has little support in his party and his country. So he\u2019s temporary\u2026 we\u2019ll wait for the new leader. As told to Andrew Roth The United States: \u2018Trump\u2019s US doesn\u2019t look as desperate for friends as the UK does in its split from the EU\u2019 Jen Kirby, foreign and national security reporter, Vox Brexit, and the rise of Boris Johnson, is a drama Americans know they\u2019re supposed to pay attention to, if only we weren\u2019t so consumed by our own. We get that the drama is related. No one thought Britain would vote to leave the EU, until it did. No one thought Trump would win the presidency, until he did. What happened in the UK in June 2016 later looked like the harbinger of America\u2019s political upheaval. Or maybe it felt more soothing that way. Here, America may not have wanted to be first. If the comparisons between Trump and Brexit seemed straightforward \u2013 the rise of populism and rightwing nationalism; the distrust of institutions and the \u201celite\u201d \u2013 it became clear the events connected in deeper, murkier ways. Misinformation became a feature of both the referendum and the presidential campaign: the UK had the Brexit bus, the US had (well, still has) Trump\u2019s twitter feed. Fake news was amplified on social media, including by Russian trolls. Cambridge Analytica appeared as a villain in both. So, somehow, did Steve Bannon. Johnson\u2019s ascension to prime minister feels a bit like we still don\u2019t get it, that all the forces that made Trump and Brexit possible have only hardened in the three years since. Johnson, Americans know, is the guy that sold Brexit, and Brexit really has not gone well. But his party, at least, is buying into his vision, even doubling down on it. It puts a knot in our stomach about 2020. Johnson isn\u2019t exactly \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d. Their commonalities are mostly superficial: born in New York, both have populist appeal despite a privileged upbringing; both court controversy and are owners of questionable hairstyles. But Johnson appears more savvy, more shrewd, more deliberate. He\u2019s Trump, if Trump were in on the joke. The end result might be the same for both nations: leaders who cater to the voters who buy into their rhetoric, leaving everyone else to condemn their lies. Two men who should be cast off as ridiculous were they not so capable of tapping into anger, resentment, racism. Johnson and Trump will meet as heads of state at the G7 later this month, and the next, weirder stage of the special relationship will begin. It could be short-lived. Trump\u2019s presidency has strained democratic alliances, and amplified some uncomfortable bonds, from Jair Bolsonaro to Mohammad bin Salman. But the US under Trump doesn\u2019t look as desperate for friends as the UK does in its breakup with the EU. The Brexiters seem to think that the US will be a better substitute for the EU. But Trump can\u2019t be trusted, particularly not on trade, where his one organising principle is that everyone\u2019s out to take advantage of the US. And even if Trump gets along with Johnson now, he might be looking over his shoulder for someone better, or, really, just Nigel Farage. Brazil: \u2018The UK appears fixated on its own problems \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly\u2019 Fernanda Mena, columnist, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo Many of my peers, upper-middle-class Paulistas, are anglophiles, people who appreciate Britain as the homeland of ideas of liberalism, free markets and multiculturalism \u2013 all reinforced by the soft power of British pop culture. We have always seen London as one of the capitals of the world \u2013 very cosmopolitan and full of youth culture. And as Brazilians we know that Brits in general are better educated than us. So it was quite shocking to see people being driven by lies to vote for Brexit \u2013 and betraying all those principles of multiculturalism, liberalism and free markets. I was incredulous when I heard the result, but looking back at the time I spent studying in London, there were one or two things that could have given me a sign of what was to come. For example, the scandal that broke in 2009 about Primark paying very low wages to Manchester textile workers \u2013 we never thought of the British working-class as being as exploited as workers in eastern Asia. And of course this has to do with globalisation. A link between Brexit and Brazil is the use of social media to target uncertain and vulnerable voters with fake news. It happened here in Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s election \u2013 and maybe it is not a coincidence that Bolsonaro is close to Steve Bannon, who was key in Trump\u2019s election. It looked mad that Britain wanted to leave the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. In June, Brazil, as part of the Mercosur economic area, signed a major trade deal with the EU, so I think the relationship we have with the UK will be much weaker. My impression with Brexit is that a lot of companies will leave the UK. The UK is still the fifth-largest economy but for how much longer? It appears so self-centred, fixated on its own problems that it is currently out of the global debate \u2013 it is losing relevance quite quickly. As told to Ian Tucker",

      "body": "<p>Booed in Scotland. Confronted by farmers in Wales. Chided over the future of the union in Northern Ireland. Hit by damaging leaks and warned about the risk of recession by the Bank of England, all amid a tumbling pound.</p> <p>The turbulence that has struck Boris Johnson\u2019s administration was more reminiscent of an ageing government fighting for survival than one embarking on its first seven days in office. Yet such is the perpetual turmoil of British politics amid the Brexit impasse that many in Westminster regarded the week\u2019s events as a gentle opening to an inevitable crisis.</p> <p>Figures in Johnson\u2019s team do not pretend his early visits to the four corners of the union were easy. His aides, who admit to an \u201cintense\u201d transition to life in Downing St, also insist there is one vital positive at the end of his UK tour: \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Their sense of relief is understandable. Johnson\u2019s flurry of activity in the hostile territories of Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast saw him repeatedly confronted over his willingness to back a no-deal Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, described him as \u201cdangerous\u201d. In Wales, having kept both the media and public at a safe distance, he was accused of \u201cplaying Russian roulette\u201d with farmers\u2019 livelihoods. By the time he reached Belfast, the head of the SDLP, Nichola Mallon, accused him of having \u201clittle understanding of the complexities and fragility of relationships in Northern Ireland\u201d.</p> <p>Close observers said his itinerary was significant not just in terms of where he chose to go but also the places he chose to avoid. \u201cThey know very well that what they are asking for from the EU [in terms of a new Brexit deal], the EU is not going to give,\u201d said one veteran of Theresa May\u2019s team. \u201cThat is why they are not going to EU capitals. It would be visible activity to no useful end. But whenever you take on the job, you need quickly to be able to say you have visited the four nations of the union.\u201d</p> <p>By Friday morning, Johnson\u2019s travails had been compounded by losing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a> and further reducing his wafer-thin working majority. Yet even some of the new government\u2019s fiercest critics believe that, while Johnson\u2019s opening days have been far from flawless, he has been spared more serious political fallout by opinion polls appearing to show a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, and a strange hiatus that has descended on Westminster just as he has taken office.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a most peculiar atmosphere,\u201d said one senior Tory concerned about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans. \u201cSo many people are on holiday. They are literally in Spain or Portugal or France. They can follow all of this on their iPads, but Boris has been given pretty free rein.\u201d</p> <p>Westminster is always eerily quiet as its summer recess starts, but this year\u2019s lull has provided a bizarre contrast to the feverish activity that ended May\u2019s reign and the inevitable frenzy set to unfold when MPs return in September, with a no-deal Brexit just weeks away. In truth, Tory MPs tracking his progress from the beach say that, for all the criticism Johnson received on his outings last week, the real danger signs are not so much lurking below the surface as hiding in plain sight.</p> <p>Several Tory MPs pointed to a series of warning lights that were already flashing. First, some in the European Research Group of hardline Brexiters have signalled that they would vote down any Brexit deal, even if it did not contain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/johnson-refuses-to-meet-eu-leaders-unless-they-scrap-backstop\" title=\"\">Irish backstop provision</a> that they believe keeps Britain tethered to the EU. One May ally said this was a sign they would turn on Johnson, too. \u201cThey are not in the mood to compromise,\u201d they said. \u201cThere was a way of running his leadership campaign without relying on them, giving him more freedom. But he chose not to do that.\u201d</p> <p>On the other wing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/boris-johnson-warned-he-could-lose-control-of-parliament\" title=\"\">Tory Phillip Lee</a> has signalled he is considering joining the Lib Dems and that others are countenancing a similar move \u2013 eliminating Johnson\u2019s working majority. Meanwhile, the forces of no-deal resistance are getting organised.

      "bodyText": "Booed in Scotland. Confronted by farmers in Wales. Chided over the future of the union in Northern Ireland. Hit by damaging leaks and warned about the risk of recession by the Bank of England, all amid a tumbling pound. The turbulence that has struck Boris Johnson\u2019s administration was more reminiscent of an ageing government fighting for survival than one embarking on its first seven days in office. Yet such is the perpetual turmoil of British politics amid the Brexit impasse that many in Westminster regarded the week\u2019s events as a gentle opening to an inevitable crisis. Figures in Johnson\u2019s team do not pretend his early visits to the four corners of the union were easy. His aides, who admit to an \u201cintense\u201d transition to life in Downing St, also insist there is one vital positive at the end of his UK tour: \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Their sense of relief is understandable. Johnson\u2019s flurry of activity in the hostile territories of Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast saw him repeatedly confronted over his willingness to back a no-deal Brexit. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, described him as \u201cdangerous\u201d. In Wales, having kept both the media and public at a safe distance, he was accused of \u201cplaying Russian roulette\u201d with farmers\u2019 livelihoods. By the time he reached Belfast, the head of the SDLP, Nichola Mallon, accused him of having \u201clittle understanding of the complexities and fragility of relationships in Northern Ireland\u201d. Close observers said his itinerary was significant not just in terms of where he chose to go but also the places he chose to avoid. \u201cThey know very well that what they are asking for from the EU [in terms of a new Brexit deal], the EU is not going to give,\u201d said one veteran of Theresa May\u2019s team. \u201cThat is why they are not going to EU capitals. It would be visible activity to no useful end. But whenever you take on the job, you need quickly to be able to say you have visited the four nations of the union.\u201d By Friday morning, Johnson\u2019s travails had been compounded by losing the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection and further reducing his wafer-thin working majority. Yet even some of the new government\u2019s fiercest critics believe that, while Johnson\u2019s opening days have been far from flawless, he has been spared more serious political fallout by opinion polls appearing to show a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, and a strange hiatus that has descended on Westminster just as he has taken office. \u201cIt is a most peculiar atmosphere,\u201d said one senior Tory concerned about Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans. \u201cSo many people are on holiday. They are literally in Spain or Portugal or France. They can follow all of this on their iPads, but Boris has been given pretty free rein.\u201d Westminster is always eerily quiet as its summer recess starts, but this year\u2019s lull has provided a bizarre contrast to the feverish activity that ended May\u2019s reign and the inevitable frenzy set to unfold when MPs return in September, with a no-deal Brexit just weeks away. In truth, Tory MPs tracking his progress from the beach say that, for all the criticism Johnson received on his outings last week, the real danger signs are not so much lurking below the surface as hiding in plain sight. Several Tory MPs pointed to a series of warning lights that were already flashing. First, some in the European Research Group of hardline Brexiters have signalled that they would vote down any Brexit deal, even if it did not contain the Irish backstop provision that they believe keeps Britain tethered to the EU. One May ally said this was a sign they would turn on Johnson, too. \u201cThey are not in the mood to compromise,\u201d they said. \u201cThere was a way of running his leadership campaign without relying on them, giving him more freedom. But he chose not to do that.\u201d On the other wing, Tory Phillip Lee has signalled he is considering joining the Lib Dems and that others are countenancing a similar move \u2013 eliminating Johnson\u2019s working majority. Meanwhile, the forces of no-deal resistance are getting organised. Oliver Letwin, the former cabinet minister who has masterminded previous attempts to block a no-deal, was one of the few figures left in Westminster last week. And there have already been a series of leaks about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Then there is the perceived instability of Johnson\u2019s new team. Some insiders regard the new discipline in government installed by Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave strategy chief now calling the shots in No 10, as uneasy. \u201cMinisters are like their equivalents in the Chinese people\u2019s republic \u2013 they are there to deliver policy already worked out by the politburo,\u201d said one Tory. \u201cThe politburo is Dominic Cummings and his special advisers. They are the ones that have all of the ideas.\u201d Some ministers are already deemed to have a limited lifespan. \u201cI do wonder what the hell [pro-Remain cabinet ministers] Robert Buckland, Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan are doing in this regime,\u201d said one Tory preparing to block no-deal. \u201cThey have tried to tell me it\u2019s a bit like the early days of Trump. \u2018We are there to control him\u2019.

As one Brussels insider put it: \u201cGoing all the way out, and then having to bid for an article 218 negotiation puts the UK in an exceptionally weak negotiating position \u2026 Back to money and the backstop.\u201d As they checked out for their stint on the beach, one diplomat had clear advice to all those involved in the battle ahead: \u201cHave a great summer and prepare for an exceptionally stormy autumn.\u201d Johnson finished his turbulent week with a visit to the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge, where residents were forced to flee their homes amid fears that the walls of a reservoir could collapse. Both he and his new team already know that there are similar structural weaknesses in his new premiership. While the waters in Westminster may be still for now, the political dam could be ready to burst before the summer is out. Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday",

      "body": "<p>Much has been made in recent days of the supposed similarities between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. On a personal level, it is said, both men are boastful braggarts, frequently untruthful and skilled at self-promotion, which is pretty much all they care about. In terms of policy, both are rightwing populists wedded to a recklessly destructive form of regressive, pseudo-nostalgic nationalism.</p> <p>Both Johnson and Trump inspire strong feelings, especially in their detractors. Max Hastings, who was Johnson\u2019s boss at the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, recently described him as a weak, cowardly character more akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/alan-partridge\" title=\"\">Alan Partridge</a> than to his hero, Winston Churchill. \u201cAlmost the only people who think Johnson a nice guy are those who do not know him,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\" title=\"\">Hastings wrote</a>.</p> <p>Trump fares even worse. The usually unemotional US columnist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/opinion/trump-2020.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Thomas Friedman</a> called him a \u201cracist, divisive, climate-change-denying, woman-abusing jerk\u201d. After Trump belittled a local black congressman, Elijah Cummings, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/29/baltimore-sun-editorial-trump\" title=\"\"><em>Baltimore Sun</em></a> denounced him as \u201cthe most dishonest man to ever occupy the Oval Office\u201d.</p> <p>Much less has been said about the similarities between the choices and dilemmas facing those at the opposing, liberal-progressive end of the political spectrum in the US and Britain. In both countries, the left, broadly defined, faces an all but existential challenge. The most pressing issue for Democrats as next year\u2019s election approaches is how to beat Trump. In Britain, the pre-eminent question is how to halt Brexit.</p> <p>Most liberal-progressive politicians and supporters on either side of the Atlantic understand that unless and until Trump is defeated, and Brexit stopped, their respective countries cannot move forward. Recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/01/democratic-debates-2019-detroit-joe-biden-trump\" title=\"\">debates</a> between candidates for the Democratic nomination, for example, were dominated by the spectre of a Trump second term. More than any policy issue, what matters most is identifying the person who can defeat him.</p> <p>It\u2019s early days, but <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\" title=\"\">polls suggest</a> Joe Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president, is clear favourite. Despite unconvincing debate performances and doubts about his age (he is 76), Biden is touted as the sort of reassuring, experienced, moderate pragmatist who could attract middle America\u2019s pivotal swing voters.</p> <p>Yet that way of thinking is fiercely resisted on the party\u2019s left, where a <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html\" title=\"\">younger, energised generation of reformers</a>, some from minority and multicultural backgrounds, is championing a more radical agenda on touchstone issues such as universal healthcare and migration. Insurgent candidates such as Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke are jostling the more experienced Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All want to break the mould, not repair it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d289db81ab7a5bd7f2916ee8321c49964dcc696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d289db81ab7a5bd7f2916ee8321c49964dcc696/320_99_3365_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden watches as Kamala Harris speaks during a Democratic primary debate on 31 July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden watches as Kamala Harris speaks during a Democratic primary debate on 31 July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a possible general election nears, Britain\u2019s unambiguously anti-Brexit parties \u2013 and Labour \u2013 face similar dilemmas. If stopping Johnson\u2019s slide into no-deal catastrophe means forming nationwide electoral pacts, a successful tactic for the Liberal Democrats in last Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/brecon-radnorshire-byelection-lib-dems-jane-dodds-win-cuts-johnson-commons-majority-to-one\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a>, then must such temporary compromises be accepted for the greater good? Or is it better to maintain ideological purity and a distinct policy platform, as some in Labour may prefer, thereby increasing the Brexit risk?</p> <p>Trump is doubtless hoping Democrats pick a left-leaning candidate he can marginalise as a \u201csocialist\u201d (for Republicans, that\u2019s a dirty word) hostile to American values. He has already begun, aiming his racist, misogynistic venom at the so-called \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 four reformist congresswomen of colour whom he told to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from. His attack on Cummings in Baltimore was another ugly signal to white America.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s attempt to brand as unpatriotic extremists those progressives who seek to create a fairer, inclusive and more equal society is a familiar one in Britain. Johnson, trapped by his own hardline Brexit rhetoric and hounded from the right by Nigel Farage, is not above adopting a version of Trump\u2019s divisive politics of identity and grievance if he thinks it will help him survive.</p> <p>How does the liberal-progressive left respond to the menace of immoral, unscrupulous rightwing populism, personified by Trump and the Johnson cabinet? How to neutralise this poison seeping through our societies? The answer cannot be a panicky, Biden-like scramble to the fabled centre-ground if that means abandoning the reform agenda. But nor is it a resort to populism of the left.</p> <p>The results of last May\u2019s local elections and the European parliamentary elections clearly showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/five-things-we-have-learned-from-the-election-results-across-europe\" title=\"\">voters are fed up with party politics as usual</a>. They want honest, practical leaders ready to shake things up and address vital issues of income inequality, healthcare, education, infrastructure and the climate crisis. Old tribal loyalties are dissolving. Radical new non-partisan thinking is required.</p> <p>Rightwing populism in Britain and the US threatens lives and livelihoods; elsewhere, it can threaten the very idea of democracy. To defeat it, and resist the global rise of authoritarianism, liberals and progressives of all stripes must join forces around a programme of reform. In Britain, that means considering parliamentary and electoral coalitions of the willing, focused in the first instance on dispelling the Brexit nightmare.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Much has been made in recent days of the supposed similarities between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. On a personal level, it is said, both men are boastful braggarts, frequently untruthful and skilled at self-promotion, which is pretty much all they care about. In terms of policy, both are rightwing populists wedded to a recklessly destructive form of regressive, pseudo-nostalgic nationalism. Both Johnson and Trump inspire strong feelings, especially in their detractors. Max Hastings, who was Johnson\u2019s boss at the Daily Telegraph, recently described him as a weak, cowardly character more akin to Alan Partridge than to his hero, Winston Churchill. \u201cAlmost the only people who think Johnson a nice guy are those who do not know him,\u201d Hastings wrote. Trump fares even worse. The usually unemotional US columnist Thomas Friedman called him a \u201cracist, divisive, climate-change-denying, woman-abusing jerk\u201d. After Trump belittled a local black congressman, Elijah Cummings, the Baltimore Sun denounced him as \u201cthe most dishonest man to ever occupy the Oval Office\u201d. Much less has been said about the similarities between the choices and dilemmas facing those at the opposing, liberal-progressive end of the political spectrum in the US and Britain. In both countries, the left, broadly defined, faces an all but existential challenge. The most pressing issue for Democrats as next year\u2019s election approaches is how to beat Trump. In Britain, the pre-eminent question is how to halt Brexit. Most liberal-progressive politicians and supporters on either side of the Atlantic understand that unless and until Trump is defeated, and Brexit stopped, their respective countries cannot move forward. Recent debates between candidates for the Democratic nomination, for example, were dominated by the spectre of a Trump second term. More than any policy issue, what matters most is identifying the person who can defeat him. It\u2019s early days, but polls suggest Joe Biden, Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president, is clear favourite. Despite unconvincing debate performances and doubts about his age (he is 76), Biden is touted as the sort of reassuring, experienced, moderate pragmatist who could attract middle America\u2019s pivotal swing voters. Yet that way of thinking is fiercely resisted on the party\u2019s left, where a younger, energised generation of reformers, some from minority and multicultural backgrounds, is championing a more radical agenda on touchstone issues such as universal healthcare and migration. Insurgent candidates such as Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke are jostling the more experienced Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All want to break the mould, not repair it. As a possible general election nears, Britain\u2019s unambiguously anti-Brexit parties \u2013 and Labour \u2013 face similar dilemmas. If stopping Johnson\u2019s slide into no-deal catastrophe means forming nationwide electoral pacts, a successful tactic for the Liberal Democrats in last Thursday\u2019s Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, then must such temporary compromises be accepted for the greater good? Or is it better to maintain ideological purity and a distinct policy platform, as some in Labour may prefer, thereby increasing the Brexit risk? Trump is doubtless hoping Democrats pick a left-leaning candidate he can marginalise as a \u201csocialist\u201d (for Republicans, that\u2019s a dirty word) hostile to American values. He has already begun, aiming his racist, misogynistic venom at the so-called \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 four reformist congresswomen of colour whom he told to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from. His attack on Cummings in Baltimore was another ugly signal to white America. Trump\u2019s attempt to brand as unpatriotic extremists those progressives who seek to create a fairer, inclusive and more equal society is a familiar one in Britain. Johnson, trapped by his own hardline Brexit rhetoric and hounded from the right by Nigel Farage, is not above adopting a version of Trump\u2019s divisive politics of identity and grievance if he thinks it will help him survive. How does the liberal-progressive left respond to the menace of immoral, unscrupulous rightwing populism, personified by Trump and the Johnson cabinet? How to neutralise this poison seeping through our societies? The answer cannot be a panicky, Biden-like scramble to the fabled centre-ground if that means abandoning the reform agenda. But nor is it a resort to populism of the left. The results of last May\u2019s local elections and the European parliamentary elections clearly showed that voters are fed up with party politics as usual. They want honest, practical leaders ready to shake things up and address vital issues of income inequality, healthcare, education, infrastructure and the climate crisis. Old tribal loyalties are dissolving. Radical new non-partisan thinking is required. Rightwing populism in Britain and the US threatens lives and livelihoods; elsewhere, it can threaten the very idea of democracy. To defeat it, and resist the global rise of authoritarianism, liberals and progressives of all stripes must join forces around a programme of reform. In Britain, that means considering parliamentary and electoral coalitions of the willing, focused in the first instance on dispelling the Brexit nightmare.",
