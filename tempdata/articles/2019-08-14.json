Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP who coordinates around 30 MPs in a group called Respect the Result, said he believed that passing the withdrawal agreement was the most certain way of stopping the UK crashing out without a deal. Kinnock, who had been urging Corbyn to do a deal with Theresa May in cross-party talks, said there was an increasing feeling among many of his colleagues opposed to a second referendum that passing the withdrawal agreement bill was the best option. Despite Johnson\u2019s refusal to negotiate with the EU unless it drops the backstop, Kinnock said a time would come in the autumn when a compromise deal could be done based on the withdrawal agreement that emerged out of cross-party talks. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make a radical and dramatic intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cIf enough of us do then it\u2019s up to Boris Johnson to see where he goes from there.

The newly created states of India and Pakistan had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict\" title=\"\">gone to war</a> over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum \u2013 something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir\u2019s autonomy.</p> <p>India has also abrogated article 35A, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35A_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" title=\"\">introduced in 1954</a>. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It\u2019s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land.</p> <p>By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there.</p> <p>All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India\u2019s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir.</p> <p>Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who\u2019s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India\u2019s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms.</p> <p>As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who\u2019ve been arguing India\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/kashmir-leaders-placed-under-arrest-amid-security-crackdown\" title=\"\">have been arrested</a>. The entire population is under the severest curfew in decades and an unprecedented communications blockade has been put in place, with mobile phones, broadband, even landlines blocked. The world\u2019s largest democracy has cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2954b32649f20e2fff5f06f89a92a9967fac49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2954b32649f20e2fff5f06f89a92a9967fac49/166_561_4168_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Narendra Modi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Narendra Modi\u2019s vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference, and dissent will be crushed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision, however, has wide support across India. Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers \u2013 everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation.</p> <p>India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed. The rebellious others on the margins, especially if Muslim, are to be subjugated and subjected to a medieval siege to force them to bend to the will of the mega-state. For some, this comes complete with references to spoils of war.

The erasure of autonomy, however tenuous, however token, is the starkest display of that relationship \u2013 and it\u2019s important to remember that Kashmir is subject to the densest militarisation on the planet.

      "bodyText": "I haven\u2019t been able to hear the voices of my parents for more than a week now. We usually talk or exchange messages a few times during the day, mostly about their creeping health issues or about my children\u2019s latest antics here in London. But now, not a peep. It\u2019s because, like all Kashmiris, they\u2019re under siege, experiencing the worst crackdown in three decades, imposed by the Indian government as it revoked the region\u2019s autonomy by abrogating article 370 of the constitution. The article, dating back to 1949, guaranteed Kashmir\u2019s special status within the larger Indian union and enshrined the conditions of the state\u2019s accession to India soon after partition in 1947. The newly created states of India and Pakistan had gone to war over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum \u2013 something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. India has also abrogated article 35A, introduced in 1954. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It\u2019s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land. By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there. All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India\u2019s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir. Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who\u2019s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India\u2019s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms. As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who\u2019ve been arguing India\u2019s case, have been arrested. The entire population is under the severest curfew in decades and an unprecedented communications blockade has been put in place, with mobile phones, broadband, even landlines blocked. The world\u2019s largest democracy has cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world. The decision, however, has wide support across India. Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers \u2013 everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation. India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed. The rebellious others on the margins, especially if Muslim, are to be subjugated and subjected to a medieval siege to force them to bend to the will of the mega-state. For some, this comes complete with references to spoils of war. Two lawmakers from the ruling party, including a chief minister, have made jokes about \u201cbringing in girls\u201d from Kashmir. Kashmiris will inevitably see this new attack on their body politic as part of a long list of betrayals, and it reinforces the idea that India\u2019s behaviour towards Kashmir has always been like that of a coloniser. The erasure of autonomy, however tenuous, however token, is the starkest display of that relationship \u2013 and it\u2019s important to remember that Kashmir is subject to the densest militarisation on the planet. A video filmed by the BBC shows thousands protesting after Friday prayers in Srinagar. Another video, recorded by Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan, shows boys in hospital beds who\u2019ve already been hit in the eyes with lead pellets. As statist Indian journalists (some of whom have been given access to Kashmir while most local journalists remain incommunicado) work overtime to project a narrative of normality, it has fallen to the international media, and a few brave Indian outlets, to report the truth. The BBC, the New York Times, Reuters, Al Jazeera, the Guardian, the Wire India, Scroll India, Telegraph India and a few others have shown protest marches, wounded civilians, and a grieving people seething with anger, despite the unprecedented siege. Addressing the people of Kashmir in 1952, India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, said: \u201cKashmir is not the property of India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people ... We have taken the issue to the United Nations and give our word of honour for a peaceful solution. As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question of final solution to the people of Kashmir and we are determined to abide by their decision.\u201d India has now done exactly what Nehru ruled out, going back on its word, and scripted a final betrayal of the Kashmiri people. The journey from being a colony of the British empire to colonising the unyielding Muslim other next door reveals a catastrophic mutation at the heart of the Indian state. I asked a Kashmiri journalist who had returned to Delhi after spending two days in the state if he knew where it was all headed. He responded with one word, Falasteen, the Urdu for Palestine \u2013 a clear reference to the settler-colonialist occupation there. I pray that when I go home next, I do not visit my parents in a colony of the Hindu nationalist empire. \u2022 Mirza Waheed is a journalist and author of the novels The Collaborator and The Book of Gold Leaves",

      "body": "<p>In an effort to promote a no-deal Brexit, Gisela Stuart asserts \u201clet\u2019s be clear about one thing: the voters\u2019 decision to leave the European Union and how politicians have gone about implementing the result are two different issues \u2026 the paralysis of indecision \u2026 has been corrosive and damaging\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/11/leave-eu-31-october-politicians-brexit-process\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 12 August). She goes on to insist on the absolute imperative of respecting the result of the 2016 referendum. It would be hard to come up with a more flawed and misleading interpretation of the past three years than that.</p> <p>The present Brexit impasse arises not from poor governance and irresolute politicians but from a rational collective judgment \u2013 now that some of the costs of the Brexit alternatives have become clearer, there is no majority in parliament and the country for any means of achieving the outcome voted for in the 2016 referendum. The will of the people as of 2016 is inconsistent with the somewhat better informed will of the people now.</p> <p>The fundamental source of this difference is the lack of democratic content in the 2016 Brexit vote. A political vote is only democratic if the electorate has access to reasonably comprehensive and honest assessments of the consequences of voting one way or the other. In 2016 this information was unavailable through a combination of the use of blatant untruths (for example about the Brexit bonus to NHS funding and that 76 million Turks were about to join the EU) and straightforward omissions (for example about the issue of the Northern Ireland border).</p> <p>This impasse will not be overcome by blustering exhortations to deliver on the result of a seriously flawed referendum. The right conclusion to be drawn from the past three years is that the electorate should be invited to reconsider the Brexit issue on the basis of full information the truthfulness of which can be tested.<br><strong>Bernard Stafford</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Gisela Stuart speaks of a deal not being possible but of course it is if the government would accept the one Theresa May agreed with the EU. What may not be possible is for them to accept the removal of the Irish backstop, but this is something only the UK out of 28 nations is demanding. No club would change its rules if only one member was in favour and the rest against.<br><strong>Dr Richard Turner</strong><br><em>Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I voted Brexit in the original referendum; mainly because of the reported widespread corruption of the administration in Brussels and because of my personal and professional experience of prescriptive regulation stifling innovation and entrepreneurial activity of business. However, approaching four years on from the dishonest claims by politicians and the discussion before that referendum, we now know so much more. There is a very complex, well-developed, integrated supply chain between businesses and consumers across the EU and with international trade. It took 40 years to develop and will take just as long to develop a new one, but we start off on the back foot if we leave. That is even if we accepted the deal negotiated by the last PM\u2019s team.</p> <p>Philip Hammond is reported recently as having said that a no-deal Brexit would result in a lonely \u201clittle England\u201d. He is right. In the event of Brexit, Scotland\u2019s first minister has stated clearly that she will push for a second referendum on Scottish independence. Labour \u201cwill not get in the way\u201d of that. The EU will give every possible incentive to Scotland to leave the UK and join the EU. The Northern Irish border will be a potentially explosive issue and many Protestants will go to Scotland resulting in the reunification of Ireland. Wales is already very dependent on the EU and likely to go the same way as Scotland.</p> <p>So, yes, Hammond is right: if Brexit goes through, with or without a deal, Boris Johnson is very likely to be the last PM of the United Kingdom. Common sense says that parliament\u2019s duty is to act like a parliament and insist now that there is another referendum with the option of wiping the slate clean, revoking article 50 and staying in the EU.<br><strong>Bill Butterworth</strong><br><em>Devizes, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 As an Anglo-Welsh European I was interested to read John Denham\u2019s piece on English nationalism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/13/english-nationalism-brexit-remain-and-reform\" title=\"\">Opinion</a>, 13 August), but disappointed by the familiar whiff of sullen resentment towards Scottish and Welsh devolution. The reason Scotland and Wales now have limited control over their own affairs is because they fought and campaigned for this kind of civic nationalism for decades. If English people really wanted their own regional parliament, they could have done likewise, instead of constantly playing the victim and voting for a gang of Brexit fanatics to wreck the country and drag the rest of the UK down with them. At this late stage, the best remaining option is surely to revoke article 50 so the rest of the UK can stay in the EU, then let England secede from two unions it has never understood and clearly despises.<br><strong>Chris Webster</strong><br><em>G\u00fcmligen, Switzerland</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have read so much about the efforts being made to prevent Boris et al pushing through a no-deal Brexit, and their aim to do this alongside a strategy for winning the election afterwards. But isn\u2019t it possible this \u00fcber-Machiavellian power hub could be planning to get Brexit through without a deal, call an election immediately with all the hell and chaos ensuing, and be quite happy for Labour to win so they would not be able to carry out their hugely needed social healing policies because they would need to cope with the fallout of Brexit and a below-the-plimsoll-line economy. Then they would collapse as a government and Boris could chortle that he\u2019d have done better, talk the usual codswallop about how he would sort it all out, win back power and, bingo, be there for the long haul.<br><strong>Angela Neustatter</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Before we get too carried away about the prospects of increased trade with America (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/11/john-bolton-arrives-in-uk-to-seek-support-on-iran-and-huawei\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 13 August), it\u2019s worth remembering that the carbon cost of importing or exporting a given item could be roughly 100 times greater than to Europe (3,000 miles v 30).<br><strong>Mick Crawley</strong><br><em>Ascot, Berkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "In an effort to promote a no-deal Brexit, Gisela Stuart asserts \u201clet\u2019s be clear about one thing: the voters\u2019 decision to leave the European Union and how politicians have gone about implementing the result are two different issues \u2026 the paralysis of indecision \u2026 has been corrosive and damaging\u201d (Opinion, 12 August). She goes on to insist on the absolute imperative of respecting the result of the 2016 referendum. It would be hard to come up with a more flawed and misleading interpretation of the past three years than that. The present Brexit impasse arises not from poor governance and irresolute politicians but from a rational collective judgment \u2013 now that some of the costs of the Brexit alternatives have become clearer, there is no majority in parliament and the country for any means of achieving the outcome voted for in the 2016 referendum. The will of the people as of 2016 is inconsistent with the somewhat better informed will of the people now. The fundamental source of this difference is the lack of democratic content in the 2016 Brexit vote. A political vote is only democratic if the electorate has access to reasonably comprehensive and honest assessments of the consequences of voting one way or the other. In 2016 this information was unavailable through a combination of the use of blatant untruths (for example about the Brexit bonus to NHS funding and that 76 million Turks were about to join the EU) and straightforward omissions (for example about the issue of the Northern Ireland border). This impasse will not be overcome by blustering exhortations to deliver on the result of a seriously flawed referendum. The right conclusion to be drawn from the past three years is that the electorate should be invited to reconsider the Brexit issue on the basis of full information the truthfulness of which can be tested. Bernard Stafford York \u2022 Gisela Stuart speaks of a deal not being possible but of course it is if the government would accept the one Theresa May agreed with the EU. What may not be possible is for them to accept the removal of the Irish backstop, but this is something only the UK out of 28 nations is demanding. No club would change its rules if only one member was in favour and the rest against. Dr Richard Turner Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire \u2022 I voted Brexit in the original referendum; mainly because of the reported widespread corruption of the administration in Brussels and because of my personal and professional experience of prescriptive regulation stifling innovation and entrepreneurial activity of business. However, approaching four years on from the dishonest claims by politicians and the discussion before that referendum, we now know so much more. There is a very complex, well-developed, integrated supply chain between businesses and consumers across the EU and with international trade. It took 40 years to develop and will take just as long to develop a new one, but we start off on the back foot if we leave. That is even if we accepted the deal negotiated by the last PM\u2019s team. Philip Hammond is reported recently as having said that a no-deal Brexit would result in a lonely \u201clittle England\u201d. He is right. In the event of Brexit, Scotland\u2019s first minister has stated clearly that she will push for a second referendum on Scottish independence. Labour \u201cwill not get in the way\u201d of that. The EU will give every possible incentive to Scotland to leave the UK and join the EU. The Northern Irish border will be a potentially explosive issue and many Protestants will go to Scotland resulting in the reunification of Ireland. Wales is already very dependent on the EU and likely to go the same way as Scotland. So, yes, Hammond is right: if Brexit goes through, with or without a deal, Boris Johnson is very likely to be the last PM of the United Kingdom. Common sense says that parliament\u2019s duty is to act like a parliament and insist now that there is another referendum with the option of wiping the slate clean, revoking article 50 and staying in the EU. Bill Butterworth Devizes, Wiltshire \u2022 As an Anglo-Welsh European I was interested to read John Denham\u2019s piece on English nationalism (Opinion, 13 August), but disappointed by the familiar whiff of sullen resentment towards Scottish and Welsh devolution. The reason Scotland and Wales now have limited control over their own affairs is because they fought and campaigned for this kind of civic nationalism for decades. If English people really wanted their own regional parliament, they could have done likewise, instead of constantly playing the victim and voting for a gang of Brexit fanatics to wreck the country and drag the rest of the UK down with them. At this late stage, the best remaining option is surely to revoke article 50 so the rest of the UK can stay in the EU, then let England secede from two unions it has never understood and clearly despises. Chris Webster G\u00fcmligen, Switzerland \u2022 I have read so much about the efforts being made to prevent Boris et al pushing through a no-deal Brexit, and their aim to do this alongside a strategy for winning the election afterwards. But isn\u2019t it possible this \u00fcber-Machiavellian power hub could be planning to get Brexit through without a deal, call an election immediately with all the hell and chaos ensuing, and be quite happy for Labour to win so they would not be able to carry out their hugely needed social healing policies because they would need to cope with the fallout of Brexit and a below-the-plimsoll-line economy. Then they would collapse as a government and Boris could chortle that he\u2019d have done better, talk the usual codswallop about how he would sort it all out, win back power and, bingo, be there for the long haul. Angela Neustatter London \u2022 Before we get too carried away about the prospects of increased trade with America (Report, 13 August), it\u2019s worth remembering that the carbon cost of importing or exporting a given item could be roughly 100 times greater than to Europe (3,000 miles v 30).

The trade union boss, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn whose views will carry significant weight in writing any future party manifesto, said Labour had to address how it would approach negotiating future trade deals if the UK had left the EU after Labour came to power. \u201cI believe that if we haven\u2019t left by 31 October that we should respect the 2016 referendum, which means leaving Europe but on a deal that the 48% would be happy with,\u201d McCluskey told the BBC. \u201cThat is access to a frictionless market and a customs union protecting jobs and investment. \u201cAnd the 52% would be happy because of the policies that Labour have to invest in their communities and to deal with the abuses of migrant labour coming into our country with labour market regulations.\u201d He said a no-deal Brexit would be \u201calmost impossible to stop\u201d and said he was not certain a no-confidence vote in Boris Johnson would be successful. \u201cThe important thing for me is for Labour to continue to hold a very clear vision of the type of Britain we want to be and the relationship we want with Europe, because come the 31 October if we leave without a deal, there is still going to have to be debate and discussion about trade deals and about what kind of relationship we have,\u201d he said. McCluskey said that a referendum would be \u201ca legitimate stance\u201d in order to test the popularity of no deal with the British public but said he did not believe it would take place. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, of course \u2013 there isn\u2019t going to be a second referendum under Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal approach to life,\u201d he said. Asked if that went against so many Labour supporters and MPs who wanted another referendum, McCluskey said: \u201cSo many Labour MPs and supporters want the issue done and dusted.\u201d McCluskey said the trade unions had endorsed a position that Labour should negotiate a Brexit deal if they came to power prior to the UK leaving.
