The supreme court so held in January 2017 in the case brought by Gina Miller (for whom I acted as counsel) successfully challenging Theresa May\u2019s decision to notify the EU of Britain\u2019s intention to withdraw from membership without first seeking the approval of parliament.</p> \n   <p>Whether prorogation is a breach of the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty depends on the circumstances of the case. In Canada in 2008 [where parliament was prorogued for political reasons] the issue did not come to court.</p> \n   <p>There would be three important features of a case in October. First, the prime minister would be seeking to prorogue parliament for the purpose of avoiding parliamentary sovereignty on an issue of significant constitutional importance.</p> \n   <p>Second, he would be seeking to stop parliament sitting when time would be of the essence, given the deadline of the end of October.</p> \n   <p>And third, he would be seeking to evade parliament because it has previously made clear its wish to prevent a no-deal Brexit. If he were to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament in these circumstances, the courts would be likely to hear an urgent application and then declare his advice to be unlawful.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a useful Twitter thread, starting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1148870904581185536\">here</a>, the barrister <strong>Jo Maugham</strong> has compiled a list, with links, of some more articles addressing this question.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1148870904581185536\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A short bibliography of some of the literature on whether the could be a judicial review of (in effect) the decision to seek a prorogation of Parliament. /THREAD</p>\u2014 Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1148870904581185536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T09:48:53.192Z\">at 10.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d25a7f38f0845f89e30a1ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T08:59:06.462Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg </strong>points out that, given where the Conservative party membership is on Brexit, John Major\u2019s threat to go to court to stop a no-deal Brexit prorogation will probably be helpful to Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1148856117621133312\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In the dynamics of this Tory race tho, Major\u2019s threat will probably give more fire to Brexit supporters</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1148856117621133312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d25a76f8f08cf92bb76cdea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T08:54:50.666Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Charlie Falconer</strong>,<strong> </strong>a former Labour lord chancellor (and that was in the days when the lord chancellor had to be a QC, not just a jobbing cabinet minister), says John Major is right to say that there would be a good case for taking a decision to prorogue parliament to avoid a no-deal Brexit to judicial review (JR).</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LordCFalconer/status/1148854127960739840\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Major says he would apply for an immediate Juducial Review against the Prime Minister preventing him advising HMQ to prorogue Parliament to facilitate No Deal.

As a Telegraph journalist in the 1990s Johnson regularly ridiculed the Major government, and the former prime minister hasn\u2019t forgotten, or forgiven. In his Today interview this morning Major said he was supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Conservative leadership, despite some reservations (he does not agree with Hunt\u2019s willingness to accept a no-deal Brexit as an option). But Major spent most of the interview criticising Johnson, and in particular two Johnson positions that were illuminated in last night\u2019s ITV debate: Johnson\u2019s refusal to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson\u2019s refusal to confirm that he would keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington following President Trump\u2019s declaration that he will no longer deal with Darroch.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit.</strong> Although proroguing is a prerogative power that is hard to challenge, Major said he thought a legal challenge was possible.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In order to close down parliament, the prime minister would have to go to Her Majesty the Queen and ask for her permission to prorogue. If her first minister asks for that permission, it is almost inconceivable that the Queen will do anything other than grant it ... She is then in the midst of a constitutional controversy, that no serious politician should put the Queen in the middle of.</p> \n   <p>Now, I think this is completely and utterly against parliamentary tradition, and against the way in which our government should work.</p> \n   <p>If that were to happen. I think there would be a queue of people who would seek judicial review. The Queen\u2019s decision cannot be challenged in law. But the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen can, I believe, be challenged in law and I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed. </p> \n   <p>I served in parliament for over 20 years. I\u2019m very proud to have done so. I have huge admiration for our parliamentary traditions. I\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion. It is utterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Major said proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cutterly and totally unacceptable for any British parliamentarian or democrat\u201d.</strong> He also said it would be hypocritical from someone like Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit so that parliament could take back control. Major said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let\u2019s strip away the jargon of proroguing and contemplate what this actually means. What it means is that a prime minister \u2013 Prime Minister Johnson, presumably \u2013 because he cannot persuade parliament to agree with his policy, will close down parliament so that he can bypass it until his policy comes into operation. </p> \n   <p>Now, nobody has done that since King Charles II in the 1640s and it didn\u2019t end well for him. And it shouldn\u2019t end well. You cannot and should not bypass parliament in this fashion. And I cannot imagine how anyone could conceivably think that is right ...</p> \n   <p>I seem to recall that the Brexiteers, led by Mr Johnson, actually campaigned in the referendum for the sovereignty of Parliament ... They can\u2019t be concerned for the sovereignty of Parliament except when it is inconvenient to Mr Johnson.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Major said the UK government should keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to the US, despite President Trump\u2019s refusal to deal with him.</strong> He defended Darroch, and said that in giving his \u201cunvarnished views\u201d about the Trump administration he was just doing his job. Major said it was unacceptable to allow foreign governments to choose the British ambassadors who should serve in their countries. Major went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is a secondary point that Mr Johnson and everybody else should ponder. The whole of the diplomatic service, which is vital to the interests of this country, will have seen that one of their most senior diplomats was prepared to be thrown to the wolves because of the criticism of a non-British government. I do not think that is good for the morale of the civil service. And I do not think anybody who does that will endear themselves in obtaining the loyalty of the civil service in future. Loyalty is a two-way street. Mr Darroch has not misbehaved. He has behaved exactly as he was expected to behave, indeed, probably instructed to behave. And he deserves the support of the British government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Major said the government should keep Darroch in post even if this meant a \u201cshort-term freeze\u201d in relations with Washington.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If this means a short term freeze in relationships, that would be very unfortunate, because America [is] a very important ally of this country and always [has] been. But nonetheless there comes a time with principle has to come first. And the principle that we stand by our ambassadors when they have behaved entirely properly, is one that cannot be changed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1148869403578159107\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Former British PM Sir John Major will \"seek a judicial review\" to prevent the next prime minister suspending Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/r4today?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#r4today</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MyWlMEV8nK\">https://t.co/MyWlMEV8nK</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0aLl8Ej5H5\">pic.twitter.com/0aLl8Ej5H5</a></p>\u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1148869403578159107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T10:03:49.155Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2595648f08d0b6ca52d8cf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T07:52:19.801Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">John Major threatens court action to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament for Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the ITV Tory leadership debate last night Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to be the next prime minister, again refused to rule out proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Senior Labour figures were accused by a number of whistleblowers of undermining efforts to investigate allegations of antisemitism by interfering in the internal party complaints process, ahead of a BBC Panorama programme at 9pm tonight which asks \u2018Is Labour Anti-Semitic?\u2019 Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to Washington who has been at the centre of a diplomatic row over leaked cables criticising Donald Trump, has resigned. Ursula von der Leyen, the nominee to lead the European commission, has signalled she will not reopen Brexit talks with the next British prime minister and stressed the \u201cprecious\u201d Irish backstop must be defended. Downing Street has said the government will deliver on landmark House of Commons votes extending same-sex marriage and abortion rights to Northern Ireland, indicating Theresa May supports the principles of the backbench amendments, if not their methods. The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland has warned against complacency over political limbo as an official report predicts that 40,000 jobs are at risk in the region in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading, and your comments. Four whistleblowers speak of top Labour aides interfering in antisemitism investigations - video Labour MP\u2019s and commentators supportive of Jeremy Corbyn are being advised on how to respond to tonight\u2019s Panorama programme, according to HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. Former shadow business minister Stella Creasy tweeted: If this is actually real and has been produced by someone within the Labour Party then heads should absolutely roll for it .. We need to tackle the problem of antisemitism, not try to \u2018spin\u2019 or \u2018drown out\u2019 the voices brave enough to speak out about it. Jeremy Hunt has confirmed he was not the Tory leadership candidate who raised concerns about the composition of the BBC debate between him and Boris Johnson, which was slated for next Tuesday. This just in from Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker. Eight whistleblowers have told how they felt consistently undermined by senior Labour bosses in attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints and claiming that one key aide mocked their efforts. Four of the whistleblowers, including the former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol, who left his post last year, have broken non-disclosure agreements to come forward. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme, about which the Labour party has raised complaints to the highest level at the BBC, former officials allege key aides including Labour\u2019s director of communications, Seumas Milne and Labour\u2019s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal email address was also copied into leaked email chains, which former officials allege show interference. Labour robustly denies any interference and say that \u201cformer disaffected employees sought the view of staff in the leader\u2019s office, which was complied with in good faith\u201d. Labour peer Lord Falconer has said the party is \u201cstill in denial\u201d about antisemitism within its ranks. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: The thing that most strikes me about it, is it\u2019s a Labour party still in denial. Hearing Andrew Gwynne, who is a decent man, still trying to defend what\u2019s going on is a problem. Falconer said that Labour was not taking the issue seriously, despite: The Equality and Human Rights Commission launching a full statutory investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism within the party. Suspended MP Chris Williamson \u201cbaiting the Jewish community by his persistent and utterly inappropriate support of people that are antisemitic\u201d. Peter Willsman, an NEC member, saying \u201call this antisemitism is got up by the Israeli embassy\u201d. The Labour Party, my party, will not take it seriously and it is absolutely appalling. I don\u2019t know why it is, I think it is because too many people think it is wrapped up in factionalism. On whether much of the criticism over antisemitism was disguised to undermine Jeremy Corbyn as leader, Falconer said: I don\u2019t think it is. I think there is a very real problem about antisemitism. I think there are some people who want to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn who draw attention to the problems of antisemitism. I don\u2019t think that means the problems of antisemitism are illusory or unreal. But whatever the position, what you\u2019ve got to do is look at the evidence. Now I haven\u2019t seen the Panorama programme, I\u2019ve only heard the extracts that you\u2019ve read me, those extracts are as hair-raising and as anxiety-inducing as the Willsman case I referred to, and the Williamson case which everyone knows about. He added that he did not believe antisemitism was part of Labour\u2019s DNA, and stressed he did not believe Corbyn was antisemitic. However, he claimed a number of antisemites had joined the party since 2015 and \u201cmust be thrown out\u201d. Falconer went on to criticise Labour for using non-disclosure agreements to stop former staffers from revealing details of how the party handles complaints. He said the NDA\u2019s were being wielded by a party acting more \u201clike a big business or an executive\u201d who sought to cover up abuse. After speaking to the Foreign Affairs select committee, the department\u2019s permanent under-secretary Simon McDonald convened an all-staff meeting to express solidarity with the outgoing ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch. This is from Mark Warner, a Democratic senator in the US and vice chair of the senate intelligence committee. This counters President Trump\u2019s claim (dismissed as absurd by diplomatic experts) that Kim Darroch was \u201cnot liked or well thought of within the US\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Mattha Busby is taking over. Here is the top of the embargoed news release that the BBC has sent out about its Panorama tonight about Labour and antisemitism. Eight former Labour officials, including seven from the complaints and disputes department, have spoken to BBC Panorama, to discuss antisemitism in the Labour party. They all worked for the party over the last four years, and all have now left. Four are speaking out despite having signed NDAs with the Labour party. In total Panorama has spoken to more than 20 Labour officials, which includes many of the officials who have been dealing with antisemitism complaints since 2015. Their testimony reveals: A complaints and disciplinary system that had to deal with a huge increase in antisemitism complaints since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015. Allegations that there were substantial disagreements within the party about what constituted antisemitism. Allegations of interference in the complaints process from the leader\u2019s office, including a claim that there was even one occasion when complaints were directly processed by aides in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Westminster Office. Discussion by the general secretary about interference with the national constitution committee (NCC), the independent body within the Labour party that has the final say over expulsions. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, was speaking to the Commons Brexit committee this afternoon. The Economist\u2019s John Peet has some highlights. Boris Johnson is has been widely criticised at Westminster today for not backing Sir Kim Darroch, the outgoing ambassador to Washington, after President Trump said he would no longer deal with him. But, according to this YouGov poll, public opinion on this is fairly evenly divided. YouGov found 41% of respondents saying the government should support Darroch when it polled on this yesterday, but 35% saying Darroch should be replaced with someone more amenable to the White House. The BBC was meant to be holding a Question Time special with both Tory leadership candidates next Tuesday. But, according to the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes, it now looks as if that will not go ahead. Tonight the BBC is showing an hour-long Panorama programme looking at how Labour has dealt with allegations of antisemitism. There have been claims that the revelations will be damaging and Labour, which has been approached for its side of the story, has responded with a long letter to Tony Hall, the BBC director general, complaining about the programme. Here is an extract from the Labour letter. We\u2019ve had a number of questions put to us by the Panorama team and we\u2019ve answered them fully and extensively. We\u2019ve given them 50 pages of documentation in response to their questions and we\u2019ve also complained to the BBC at various levels including director general level over the way the process has been engaged in, the lack of engagement with us at an earlier stage and the failure to come to us with a balanced and fair set of questions. And from what we\u2019ve seen of the questions and the nature of the investigation, the Panorama team had already come to a conclusion about where its investigation was going before it looked at the evidence in full. We are absolutely adamantly opposed to antisemitism in all its forms and we will continue to take the strongest action to eradicate it from the Labour Party and we\u2019ve taken a series of steps. Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour group, has also been using Twitter to attack John Ware, the reporter who made the programme. As the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley reports, this is the same John Ware who was described as an \u201cever-vigilant investigative journalist\u201d in a congratulatory Commons early day motion signed by Jeremy Corbyn in 2002. Asked about the Labour criticism, a BBC spokesperson said: The Labour party is criticising a programme they have not seen. The programme adheres to the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines. In line with those, the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says the resignation of Kim Darroch has shamed the UK. In a statement she said: The fact that Sir Kim has been bullied out of his job, because of Donald Trump\u2019s tantrums and Boris Johnson\u2019s pathetic lick-spittle response, is something that shames our country. It makes a laughing-stock out of our government, and tells every one of Britain\u2019s brilliant representatives abroad that the next Tory prime minister will not stand up for them, even when they are simply telling the truth and doing their job. Sir Kim Darroch should hold his head high for the wonderful job he has done representing our country, while Boris Johnson should go and hang his head in shame. He claims to regard Winston Churchill as his hero. But just imagine Churchill allowing this humiliating, servile, sycophantic indulgence of the American president\u2019s ego to go unchallenged. Johnson likes to accuse opponents of being \u2018supine invertebrate jellies\u2019. How does he think he looks today? If this is what represents the future of leadership in our country, then it is all the more reason why we must force Johnson to call an election, and let the British people decide if such an obsequious weakling should be our prime minister. House of Lords staff have been subject to bullying and harassment, an inquiry has found. The investigation by Naomi Ellenbogen QC stated: The prevailing culture and behaviours in the House of Lords, as a place of work, have not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure that all those working there are treated with dignity and respect. Staff have bullied and harassed other staff. Members have bullied and harassed staff. On the whole, staff who have experienced bullying and harassment have tended not to complain, formally or otherwise, in the belief that nothing will happen and/or for fear of reprisal. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described it as \u201cshameful\u201d that Kim Darroch has been forced out \u201cfor doing the job that diplomats are appointed to do\u201d. Responding to a tweet from Nigel Farage that suggested Darroch be replaced by a Brexiter, Sturgeon added: Who could Farage be thinking of? The last thing that should happen is the politicisation of the civil service and the replacement of honourable diplomats with charlatans like this guy. Meanwhile, the SNP\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Stephen Gethins MP, said that the resignation was a \u201cdeeply concerning and a worrying sign of where the UK\u2019s role on the international stage is heading\u201d, adding: The integrity and impartiality of the civil service must not be compromised. It would be unacceptable if the UK\u2019s diplomatic service and appointments were outsourced to the whims of the Trump administration. Jeremy Corbyn says Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to back Kim Darroch in the ITV debate last night showed \u201che won\u2019t stand up to Donald Trump\u201d. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says Theresa May should leave it to her successor to appoint the next ambassador to Washington. Speaking at an Institute for Government event, he told the Guardian: This must have been a very difficult decision for Kim Darroch. But what is most important now is that it is the new prime minister who takes the decision on who his replacement will be because the relationship with the US will be fundamentally important, not least when we have left the EU. The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland has warned against \u201ccomplacency\u201d over political limbo in the region as an official report predicts that 40,000 jobs are at risk in the region in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (See 2.07pm.) David Sterling was accused of engaging in \u201coperation fear\u201d in March by a Brexiter Conservative MP by warning of the \u201cgrave\u201d consequences for the region. Today he said he had \u201cdeveloped a thick skin\u201d in the face of such criticism but that those fears still hold. \u201cOur assessment is that no-deal would have a profound and longlasting impact on Northern Ireland and society, a point I made back in March and it remains valid today,\u201d said Sterling speaking at the Institute for Government in London. He said the uncertainty over Brexit was now impacting on investment with latest local purchasing managers index (PMI) data showing the \u201cstrongest reduction in output since September 2012\u201d. He also warned that there would be an increase in smuggling on the border and the community relations in those areas could deteriorate. [No-deal] could change the attitude in communities which over time could have an impact in the culture of those areas. While tensions around parades has been in \u201cdecline\u201d and there was \u201cless street disorder\u201d, there were \u201cother societal tensions that are probably the result of the political impasse,\u201d he said. We wouldn\u2019t want to overstate it but at the same time I wouldn\u2019t be complacent \u2026 it would wrong to be complacent and think this will be the same for evermore. He said the absence of Stormont has meant that Northern Ireland issues don\u2019t get the airing they should in Westminster. \u201cWe have lacked that ministerial voice in Whitehall that has championed the cause of Northern Ireland,\u201d he said adding he not want to see direct rule. Here are the main points from Sir Simon McDonald\u2019s evidence about the Kim Darroch leak to the foreign affairs committee. McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office said he was bracing himself for more leaks of sensitive diplomatic memos. \u201cI fear there may be more,\u201d he said, when asked about the possibility of further leaks. He said that he could not think of another example in his 37-year diplomatic career of a head of state refusing to deal with a British ambassador, in the way President Trump said he would refuse to deal with Sir Kim Darroch. McDonald said he could not think of this happening even with governments hostile to the UK, although he could think of precedents for an ambassador resigning because of difficult relations with an unfriendly power. McDonald described the leak as the \u201cworst breach of trust\u201d he had seen in the diplomatic service in his career. He said Foreign Office staff were \u201cshaken\u201d by what had happened. He said that the police were involved in the leak investigation. He said he had had a \u201cfree and frank\u201d exchange of views with the charge d\u2019affaires at the American embassy about Trump\u2019s comments about Darroch. A Labour source said Boris Johnson was behaving as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cpatsy\u201d if his lack of support prompted Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation, the Press Association reports. The Labour source said: If that\u2019s the case I think it is clear that Boris Johnson is effectively behaving as Donald Trump\u2019s patsy and he\u2019s doing that clearly because he\u2019s banking on a sweetheart trade deal and is putting himself in hock to the US president. It\u2019s clear that he is not prepared and won\u2019t stand up to Donald Trump and he won\u2019t stand up for Britain and that\u2019s clearly the result of a policy on Brexit that is putting the country at risk of a no-deal exit from the European Union. This is from David Miliband, a Labour former foreign secretary. From my colleague Peter Walker These are from Nick Boles, who used to be a Conservative MP but who now sits as an independent. A no-deal Brexit could cost 40,000 jobs in Northern Ireland, an updated report from the region\u2019s department of economy has said. It said: A no deal would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI\u2019s economy and society. No-deal could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment with at least 40,000 jobs at risk. It said the impact of EU tariffs and non-tariff barriers will mean that whatever the Irish government and the EU do \u201cmany businesses will no longer be able to export to the Irish market, leading to a major reduction in NI\u2019s exports to Ireland,\u201d it said. It predicted the impact of EU tariffs could reduce NI\u2019s exports to Ireland by 11% to \u00a3100m to \u00a3180m. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of the Northern Irish Retail Consortium, said the report made for \u201cstark reading\u201d but \u201cno surprise\u201d as business had been warning of the consequences of no deal for more than a year. Downing Street said Theresa May spoke to Sir Kim Darroch for around five minutes shortly before PMQs today. This is from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis on the removal of Kim Darroch. Back in the foreign affairs committee Sir Simon McDonald, head of the Foreign Office, says he has served as an ambassador twice. He says diplomats use \u2018diptels\u201d (diplomatic telegrams) when they want information circulated quite widely in the system. They are not used for information that is particularly sensitive. But they are there if an ambassador wants to pass on information not being picked up by the media. Here are comments from three Labour MPs on Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation. From Ben Bradshaw, a former Foreign Office minister From Bill Esterson From Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs committee The Conservative MP Bob Seely asks McDonald if he accepts that it looks as if only a relatively small number of memos were leaked, rather than a large cache. McDonald says he does not want to comment. And Tom Tugendhat, the committee chair, asks McDonald if he has met his counterpart in the American embassy recently. McDonald said he did have a meeting. They had a \u201cfree and frank\u201d exchange of views, he says. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant goes next. He asks McDonald thinks there will be more leaks. McDonald says he is \u201cbraced\u201d for further revelations. \u201cI fear there may be more,\u201d he says. Back in the committee Labour\u2019s Ian Murray asks what the Foreign Office would think about having a political appointee as the next ambassador to Washington. McDonald says there is one in post already, Ed Llewellyn, the ambassador to Paris. He says political appointees are subject to security procedures after their appointment. Q: What would happen if they failed? McDonald says that has not happened before. If it were to happen, he would have to have a difficult conversation with the PM, he says. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation will lead to soul-searching across the Foreign Office and he criticised the failure of the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to offer the ambassador his backing. Kerslake said: Darroch did nothing wrong ... We cannot pander to Trump\u2019s insecurity. There is going to have to be a lot of soul searching in the FCO as to how we arrived at this point. Asked whether Johnson\u2019s lack of support may have been a factor in Darroch\u2019s decision, Kerslake said: It was depressingly predictable for Boris. I wish that he had stood up [to the president] and been more forthright. Boris will rely on robust advice from ambassadors if he becomes prime minister. Hunt gave a much better answer to this question [in the ITV debate]. Back in the foreign affairs committee Sir Simon McDonald, head of the Foreign Office, says diplomats have been \u201cshaken\u201d by what has happened. Asked if he thought the establishment should stand should to shoulder with a diplomat like Kim Darroch, he said of course. He said the Foreign Office was grateful for what Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt have said about this. On a campaign visit to a pub in London this morning - alongside Brexiteer and JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin - Boris Johnson was asked about John Major\u2019s threat to go to court to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. (See 8.52am.) Johnson replied: What we are going to do is deliver Brexit on October 31, which is what I think the people of this country want us to get on and do. I think everybody is fed up with delay and I think the idea of now consecrating this decision to the judiciary is really very, very odd indeed. What we want is for Parliament to take their responsibilities, get it done as they promised that they would. They asked the British people whether they wanted to leave in 2016, the British people returned a very clear verdict so let\u2019s get it done. McDonald says the most sensitive diplomatic memos are only circulated to between five and 10 people. But every computer has a forward button, he says. McDonald says the Foreign Office will pursue who was responsible for this leak with all means at its disposal. And he says diplomats must continue to give frank advice to London. But he will urge people to think again about what can be done to ensure their communications are secure, he says. This is from Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief. Back in the committee McDonald says some of the leaked memos were \u201cdiptels\u201d, diplomatic telegrams, that are circulated quite widely, and others were email letters, which have a much smaller Whitehall readership. Here is the full quote from what Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, told the BBC about Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson - a former foreign secretary and he hopes to be the future prime minister - has basically thrown our top diplomat under the bus, There are a lot of people in the Commons who are very, very angry and feel that he has lost so much respect for having done what he has done. His disregard for Sir Kim and his refusal to back him was pretty contemptible and also not in the best interests of the country he is trying to lead ... Commenting on Johnson\u2019s failure to defend Darroch in the ITV debate last night, Duncan said: For someone who wants to lead, let alone unite, the country, that was contemptible negligence on his part. He has basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under the bus to serve his own personal interests. Q: What is the process for appointing a new ambassador? McDonald says the standard procedure is for the post to be advertised, candidates to be interviewed, and then decisions taken by the foreign secretary and the prime minister. But that process is not always followed when a new ambassador to Washington is being appointed, he says. McDonald says Darroch knew that the government was committed to keeping him in place. But Darroch decided to go anyway, he says. Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, has just started giving evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about the Kim Darroch affairs. He starts by saying that Darroch decided to resign partly because of the pressure on his family. And he says that, in his 37 years as a diplomat, he can think of no other example where a friendly government has refused to deal with a serving ambassador, in the way that President Trump said he would refuse to deal with Darroch. McDonald says there have been occasions where a government has refused to accept a proposed ambassador in the first place. Q: Has the UK ever had difficulties with America before? McDonald says the last time there was a problem like this was in 1856, when the Americans objected to the British ambassador recruiting Americans to fight in the Crimean War. PMQs - Snap verdict: Jeremy Corbyn had a good case to make on legal aid cuts, and he presented it quite well - being only moderately unsettled by Theresa May\u2019s attack over antisemitism - but it was still something of a lost opportunity for him, highlighting how his lack of dexterity at PMQs continues to hold him back. A more strategic leader of the opposition would have prepared questions on Kim Darroch, to drive a wedge between May and the person who will almost certainly be leading her party two weeks\u2019 today and a first-rate parliamentarian would have rewritten the script at the last moment, after Darroch\u2019s resignation was announced, to hammer Boris Johnson with lines we are now hearing from fellow Tories. (See 12.41pm and 12.45pm.) But why should he follow the media, you might ask? Aren\u2019t legal aid cuts more important than the career of one civil servant? Yes they are. (Read the brilliant The Secret Barrister.) But PMQs is a media event, and if Corbyn had chosen go focus on Darroch, he would have got his attack lines into the top of the news bulletins. As it is, his legal aid critique is unlikely to get much further than Facebook. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but you can\u2019t chalk it up as a communications victory. Boris Johnson has said he regrets the resignation of Kim Darroch. Describing Darroch as \u201ca superb diplomat\u201d, he went on: I think whoever leaked his diptels (diplomatic telegrams) really has done a grave disservice to our civil servants, to people who give impartial advice to ministers. I hope that whoever it is, is run down, caught and eviscerated, quite frankly, because it is not right that advice to ministers that civil servants must be able to make in a spirit of freedom should be leaked. It is not right that civil servants\u2019 careers and prospects should be dragged into the political agenda. In PMQs Sir Vince Cable says Theresa May\u2019s last job will be to recommend to the Queen who her successor should be. How will she be sure that that person can command a majority in the Commons? May says, whoever wins the Tory leadership contest, they will make an excellent PM. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin This is from Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office. Another senior Tory has criticised Boris Johnson for refusing to stand up for Sir Kim Darroch, This is from Patrick McLoughlin, the former Tory chief whip, who is supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership. It is unedifying to see someone who wants to be prime minister failing to stand up for hard working civil servants, who have done nothing wrong, under attack from foreign governments. Leadership involves standing up for your team. If we don\u2019t call out those who want a witch-hunt through the civil service we are complicit in creating divisions that may never heal. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has put out this statement about Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation. I am deeply saddened by Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign as Her Majesty\u2019s Ambassador in Washington. For 42 years, Sir Kim served his country with the utmost dedication and distinction. He brought dispassionate insight and directness to his reporting to ministers in London. Whenever I visited Washington as foreign secretary, I was struck by Sir Kim\u2019s professionalism and intellect. I am outraged that a selection of his reports should have been leaked. I am sure that our ambassadors worldwide will continue to provide the objective and rigorous reporting that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has always prized. I profoundly regret how this episode has led Sir Kim to decide to resign. He deserves to look back upon his career as a servant of Britain with the greatest satisfaction and pride. Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, has told the BBC that Boris Johnson\u2019s treatment of Kim Darroch was \u201ccontemptible\u201d. Last night Duncan, who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, described Johnson as an \u201cutter wimp\u201d. (See 11.07am.) This is from Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, the union which represents senior civil servants, on Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign. Sir Kim Darroch has been placed in an impossible situation, firstly by the leaking of confidential communiques and then by the failure of Boris Johnson and his supporters to provide unequivocal support. As a loyal public servant he has, as he always did, put his country first. Can we honestly say that about those who took to the airways and equivocated? Johnson and his allies have sent the clearest signal possible to Sir Kim, the diplomatic corp, the wider civil service and unfortunately to foreign governments: that their professional, impartial advice is needed, but they are ultimately expendable if it proves politically expedient. And this is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. This is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. This is from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, on the resignation of Kim Darroch. The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, says every time Theresa May speaks in Scotland, the SNP vote goes up. He says today is the Srebrenica memorial day. He says it is a pity that Boris Johnson did not stand up for Kim Darroch yesterday. Mark Carney says the UK economy is not growing. And Danny Blanchlower says the economy is already in recession, Blackford says. (It sounds like he\u2019s been reading Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s Guardian column today.) May says the economy is doing well, but would have been doing even better if the SNP had voted for a Brexit deal. Blackford says May is driving the UK economy over the cliff. He urges her to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. May repeats her point about how the SNP could have taken no-deal off the table by voting for her deal. She says forecasts show the Scottish economy is expected to grow more slowly than the economy in the rest of the UK under the SNP. Here is the full quote from Theresa May earlier on Kim Darroch. This morning I have spoken to Sir Kim Darroch. I have told him that it is a matter of great regret that he has felt it necessary to leave his position as ambassador in Washington. The whole cabinet rightly gave its full support to Sir Kim on Tuesday. Sir Kim has given a lifetime of service to the United Kingdom and we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. Good government depends on public servants being able to give full and frank advice. I want all our public servants to have the confidence to be able to do that and I hope the House will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure. Corbyn says he is totally committed to tackling racism in any form in the Labour party. Shouldn\u2019t May address Islamophobia in the Conservative party. He says May should listen to what the UN said about the government\u2019s disregard for the rights of disabled people. And he turns to Windrush. Does May agree that that scandal would not have happened if legal aid had not been cut? May says Corbyn needs to consider his arguments. She has apologised for what happened to the Windrush generation. She says a review found 18 people wrongly deported, but some of those cases happened under Labour. She says Labour claims to back whistleblowers, and yet it uses NDAs. He used to back leave, but now backs remains. He lives up to the words of Marx, not Karl but Groucho - \u201cThose are my prinicples. If you don\u2019t like them, I\u2019ve got others.\u201d Corbyn says he will not take lectures from May. Her party consorts with racists in the European parliaments. He says legal aid cuts have disproportionately affected the poor and the disabled. Millions are denied access to justice because they are poor. Isn\u2019t that a burning injustice? May says Corbyn can try to avoid the antisemitism issue. She quotes the former Labour general secretary saying that one day Labour may be anti-racist, but not today. She attacks Labour for wanting to to tax more. Labour used to have a slogan, \u201cEducation, education, education.\u201d Now it is just, \u201cTax, tax, tax.\u201d Corbyn says the coalition cut legal aid, and introduced fees for tribunals. But his union, Unison, took the government to court and won. He quotes a leaseholder who is being threatened with eviction who cannot get legal aid. He has been working until 2am every night collecting evidence. Doesn\u2019t he deserve legal aid? May says a quarter of the ministry of justice\u2019s budget is spent on legal aid. He says the government is reviewing legal aid schemes. Corbyn says Labour is committed to restoring legal aid for family law, housing, judicial review preparation and real action on immigration cases. He says the government should restore the cuts affecting disabled people. May says spending on disabled people is at a record high. If Corbyn is interested in tackling injustice, he should deal with antisemitism, she says. Jeremy Corbyn says he also regrets the resignation of Kim Darroch. He says the comments made about him are beyond unfair and wrong. He says many people welcomed the points Theresa May made when she was first appointed about burning injustices when she became PM. Does she agree that access to justice is vital? May says there are many aspects to this. She says the racial disparities audit she commissioned highlighted an important aspect of what needed to be done. Corbyn says the coalition slashed legal aid. The results are unfair, he says. There are legal aid deserts across the country. Has that helped or hindered the fight against burning injustices. May says tackling burning injustice is not just a matter of access to the legal system. If Labour cared about this, they would have done more when they were in power. Theresa May starts by saying she spoke to Sir Kim Darroch this morning and told him it was a matter of great regret that he felt the need to resign. The whole cabinet supported him on Tuesday, she said. She said good public servants should be able to offer honest advice. And she says MPs should reflect on the importance of standing up for principles when they are under threat. May implicitly criticises Boris Johnson for refusing to back Kim Darroch. UPDATE: See 12.21pm for the full quote. And this is what Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said in his reply to Sir Kim Darroch. On behalf of the diplomatic service, I accept your resignation with deep personal regret. Over the last few difficult days you have behaved as you have always behaved over a long and distinguished career, with dignity, professionalism and class. The prime minister, foreign secretary and whole of the public service have stood with you: you were the target of a malicious leak; you were simply doing your job. I understand your wish to relieve the pressure on your family and your colleagues at the embassy; I admire the fact that you think more of others than yourself. You demonstrate the essence of the values of British public service I want to stress my deep appreciation for all you have done over the last four decades. In a series of demanding roles - including national security adviser and permanent representative to the European Union - you have loyally served the government of the day without fear or favour. We have been lucky to have you as a friend and colleague. You are the best of us. This is what Sir Kim Darroch said in his resignation letter. Since the leak of official documents from this embassy there has been a great deal of speculation surrounding my position and the duration of my remaining term as ambassador. I want to put an end to that speculation. The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like. Although my posting is not due to end until the end of this year, I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador. I am grateful to all those in the UK and the US, who have offered their support during this difficult few days. This has brought home to me the depth of friendship and close ties between our two countries. I have been deeply touched. I am also grateful to all those with whom I have worked over the last four decades, particularly my team here in the US. The professionalism and integrity of the British civil service is the envy of the world. I will leave it full of confidence that its values remain in safe hands. Kim Darroch has resigned as ambassador to Washington, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Yesterday Labour announced that it would campaign for remain in any second referendum on a Tory Brexit deal. But Jeremy Corbyn refused to say that the party would propose in its manifesto if there were an early general election. At a meeting earlier this week union leaders said the party should go into an election promising to negotiate a Labour Brexit, with the outcome put to the public in a referendum, but the shadow cabinet has not agreed to this plan. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Labour\u2019s election position would be decided at the time, and it would depend when an election was called. But he conceded that it would be hard for the party to remain committed to leave given what it is now saying about backing remain in a pre-election referendum. Here is the key exchange with Today\u2019s Justin Webb. JW: There\u2019s a thing called logic. You can\u2019t be campaigning effectively for remain effectively before an election and then say afterwards you might change your mind. KS: Well, I accept that. There is a logic in that. We will build on the policy position that we\u2019ve got, as we always do .... JW: What I\u2019m suggesting to you is that ... the one thing that you\u2019ve decided on commits you to the second. You could not have an election where you say, \u2018Actually, you know what, we might leave anyway.\u2019 KS: Look, having got a position by consensus, and a strong and clear position, obviously we build on that as we go into a manifesto. What I can\u2019t do, Justin, is suggest that the shadow cabinet at this stage can decide what we will say in our manifesto ... Obviously a critical question is going to be when that election is. Parliament has a new group, the Independents. These are not to be be confused the independent MPs, the ones sit without party affiliation (normally because they have resigned from or been suspended by the party they were representing when elected). There are currently five Independents. Just to make things complicated, four of them - Heidi Allen, Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith - used to be members of what started life as the Independent Group before it turned into Change UK. Change UK then split when six of its 11 MPs became independents. Now four of those six are Independents. The other two were Chuka Umunna, who has joined the Lib Dems, and Sarah Wollaston, who is still an independent. The fifth Independent is John Woodcock, who used to be Labour MP before resigning in protest against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism (although he was also suspended at the time over a harassment allegation that he strongly denied). Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, has described Boris Johnson as an \u201cutter wimp\u201d because of his refusal to stand up to President Trump over the British ambassador, Kim Darroch. Matt Hancock, the health secretary who is supporting Boris Johnson for leader after his own bid failed, has been taking the Johnson line on Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US, in interviews this morning. He refused to say that Darroch should stay in his post, and he argued that the relationship with the US needed a \u201creset\u201d. Britain\u2019s Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate was watched by an average of 4.3m viewers, ITV has said. According to viewing figures from ITV, the debate had a peak audience of 4.7m viewers. This is from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. The pro-independence National newspaper leads this morning with the fact that the union and Scotland were not discussed at all during the televised Tory leadership debate on ITV last night. After last week\u2019s plea from Theresa May \u2013 made in Scotland \u2013 to defend the union, and both Hunt and Johnson\u2019s promises on the subject, one doesn\u2019t have to be a staunch nationalist to note this omission. Elsewhere, the Herald has a fascinating read-out of Theresa May\u2019s most recent cabinet meeting which, according to UK political editor Michael Settle, discussed the threat to the union and rising support for independence at length, and concluded that extra spending was needed to promote the cause of UK unity. This is from Nikki da Costa, Theresa May\u2019s former director of legislative affairs at Downing Street. John Major was asked about this in his Today interview. He did not specifically deny calling the 1997 election a bit early to avoid the publication of a cash for questions report, but he said that by the time he did call that election, the parliament had already more or less run its full course. When Sir John Major said that a judicial review challenging the prime minister\u2019s decision to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament for a no-deal Brexit might succeed, he may have been influenced by the arguments in this Times article (paywall) by David Pannick QC. Pannick represented Gina Millar in the article 50 case and he explains why he thinks the JR route might work. Until the mid-1980s, judges decided what prerogative powers were enjoyed by the crown, but would not assess the way in which such powers were exercised. More recently, the courts have held that the legal reviewability of governmental action depends less on the nature of the power being exercised, and more on whether the grounds of review raise legal issues that the court is equipped to address ... What could be challenged is the legality of the advice on prorogation given by the prime minister. The claimant would need to show that the advice breaches a fundamental legal principle. One such principle is the sovereignty of parliament. The supreme court so held in January 2017 in the case brought by Gina Miller (for whom I acted as counsel) successfully challenging Theresa May\u2019s decision to notify the EU of Britain\u2019s intention to withdraw from membership without first seeking the approval of parliament. Whether prorogation is a breach of the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty depends on the circumstances of the case. In Canada in 2008 [where parliament was prorogued for political reasons] the issue did not come to court. There would be three important features of a case in October. First, the prime minister would be seeking to prorogue parliament for the purpose of avoiding parliamentary sovereignty on an issue of significant constitutional importance. Second, he would be seeking to stop parliament sitting when time would be of the essence, given the deadline of the end of October. And third, he would be seeking to evade parliament because it has previously made clear its wish to prevent a no-deal Brexit. If he were to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament in these circumstances, the courts would be likely to hear an urgent application and then declare his advice to be unlawful. In a useful Twitter thread, starting here, the barrister Jo Maugham has compiled a list, with links, of some more articles addressing this question. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg points out that, given where the Conservative party membership is on Brexit, John Major\u2019s threat to go to court to stop a no-deal Brexit prorogation will probably be helpful to Boris Johnson. Charlie Falconer, a former Labour lord chancellor (and that was in the days when the lord chancellor had to be a QC, not just a jobbing cabinet minister), says John Major is right to say that there would be a good case for taking a decision to prorogue parliament to avoid a no-deal Brexit to judicial review (JR). From Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen Sir John Major has never been a fan of Boris Johnson. As a Telegraph journalist in the 1990s Johnson regularly ridiculed the Major government, and the former prime minister hasn\u2019t forgotten, or forgiven. In his Today interview this morning Major said he was supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Conservative leadership, despite some reservations (he does not agree with Hunt\u2019s willingness to accept a no-deal Brexit as an option). But Major spent most of the interview criticising Johnson, and in particular two Johnson positions that were illuminated in last night\u2019s ITV debate: Johnson\u2019s refusal to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson\u2019s refusal to confirm that he would keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington following President Trump\u2019s declaration that he will no longer deal with Darroch. Here are the main points. Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Although proroguing is a prerogative power that is hard to challenge, Major said he thought a legal challenge was possible. In order to close down parliament, the prime minister would have to go to Her Majesty the Queen and ask for her permission to prorogue. If her first minister asks for that permission, it is almost inconceivable that the Queen will do anything other than grant it ... She is then in the midst of a constitutional controversy, that no serious politician should put the Queen in the middle of. Now, I think this is completely and utterly against parliamentary tradition, and against the way in which our government should work. If that were to happen. I think there would be a queue of people who would seek judicial review. The Queen\u2019s decision cannot be challenged in law. But the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen can, I believe, be challenged in law and I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed. I served in parliament for over 20 years. I\u2019m very proud to have done so. I have huge admiration for our parliamentary traditions. I\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion. It is utterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed. Major said proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cutterly and totally unacceptable for any British parliamentarian or democrat\u201d. He also said it would be hypocritical from someone like Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit so that parliament could take back control. Major said: Let\u2019s strip away the jargon of proroguing and contemplate what this actually means. What it means is that a prime minister \u2013 Prime Minister Johnson, presumably \u2013 because he cannot persuade parliament to agree with his policy, will close down parliament so that he can bypass it until his policy comes into operation. Now, nobody has done that since King Charles II in the 1640s and it didn\u2019t end well for him. And it shouldn\u2019t end well. You cannot and should not bypass parliament in this fashion. And I cannot imagine how anyone could conceivably think that is right ... I seem to recall that the Brexiteers, led by Mr Johnson, actually campaigned in the referendum for the sovereignty of Parliament ... They can\u2019t be concerned for the sovereignty of Parliament except when it is inconvenient to Mr Johnson. Major said the UK government should keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to the US, despite President Trump\u2019s refusal to deal with him. He defended Darroch, and said that in giving his \u201cunvarnished views\u201d about the Trump administration he was just doing his job. Major said it was unacceptable to allow foreign governments to choose the British ambassadors who should serve in their countries. Major went on: There is a secondary point that Mr Johnson and everybody else should ponder. The whole of the diplomatic service, which is vital to the interests of this country, will have seen that one of their most senior diplomats was prepared to be thrown to the wolves because of the criticism of a non-British government. I do not think that is good for the morale of the civil service. And I do not think anybody who does that will endear themselves in obtaining the loyalty of the civil service in future. Loyalty is a two-way street. Mr Darroch has not misbehaved. He has behaved exactly as he was expected to behave, indeed, probably instructed to behave. And he deserves the support of the British government. Major said the government should keep Darroch in post even if this meant a \u201cshort-term freeze\u201d in relations with Washington. If this means a short term freeze in relationships, that would be very unfortunate, because America [is] a very important ally of this country and always [has] been. But nonetheless there comes a time with principle has to come first. And the principle that we stand by our ambassadors when they have behaved entirely properly, is one that cannot be changed. In the ITV Tory leadership debate last night Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to be the next prime minister, again refused to rule out proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. This morning, in an extraordinary intervention, Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, told the Today programme that he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop this happening. He said: I think the idea of proroguing parliament is utterly and totally unacceptable from any British parliamentarian or democrat. I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed. I will post more from Major\u2019s interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: David Gauke, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. 10.20am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech at the King\u2019s Fund\u2019s leadership and management summit. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 1pm: Sir Simon McDonald, head of the Foreign Office, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about the leak of the Kim Darroch memos about the Trump White House. 1pm: David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland civil service, gives a speech to the Institute for Government. 2.30pm: Cressida Dick, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about progress since the Macpherson report. 3.15pm: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, speaks at a conference on media freedom. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Surely there were precedents from unfriendly countries such as Venezuela? \u201cI know of none,\u201d McDonald replied again. Not even hostile states have behaved like Trump, he insisted. Had there been some distant occasion when a British ambassador fell foul of the White House in such a way? There was, McDonald admitted, a \u201cdifficulty\u201d in 1856, when President Franklin Pierce accused the British ambassador of recruiting Americans to fight in the Crimean war. The listeners in committee room 16 laughed, but McDonald did not.</p> <p>And then came in many ways the most extraordinary remark of the lot. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d McDonald told another MP. \u201cThere must be consequences.

More recently he has been Britain\u2019s ambassador in Berlin and is an authoritative analyst of German politics and policy. For the past four years he has been the head of the diplomatic service in London.</p> <p>McDonald is emphatically not an old-school British diplomat. He is a bit of an outsider, modern, approachable and fiercely loyal to his staff and colleagues. Getting a story out of McDonald is one of the hardest journalistic tasks I have encountered. I\u2019ve never heard him talk in public the way he did yesterday. It tells you that this is really serious. He is not just angry: he\u2019s looking into the abyss into which the British postwar worldview is sliding.</p> <p>Darroch was brought down by three people. The first was the leaker of successive critical memos from the Washington embassy, who gave them to one of Britain\u2019s most effective pro-Brexit journalists. The second was President Trump, who followed up on the leaks with a fusillade of personal insults and punitive actions of his own which brought Darroch to the brink. And the third was Boris Johnson, who knowingly refused to express confidence in Darroch during Tuesday\u2019s ITV leadership hustings with Jeremy Hunt. It was Johnson\u2019s action that led directly to Darroch\u2019s inevitable resignation today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5dab4b8fa6a2e5e6f241d59a36aec1cfe9a5a78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dab4b8fa6a2e5e6f241d59a36aec1cfe9a5a78b/161_427_2195_2743/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson takes part in the debate on ITV.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson, \u2018who knowingly refused to express confidence in Darroch during Tuesday\u2019s ITV leadership hustings\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Han Yan/Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each of these requires us to pause and digest the implications. First, consider the leaker. This must have been either a senior insider \u2013 a politician or diplomat \u2013 with access to highly classified material. Alternatively, it may have been an outside job, a hack or intercept, possibly by the agent of a state bent on mischief. Either way, these options are devastating for the practicality of diplomatic cables in the modern era. They are a reminder too of the extent to which Brexit subverts the workings of the British state. There\u2019s been nothing like it for alternative loyalty since the Soviet spies of the cold-war era.</p> <p>Second, consider Trump. He didn\u2019t have to turbo-charge the leak. He will have had some around him who tried to stop him. But he did it once, and then he did it again. These were knowing acts, deliberate interventions, designed to weaken a country that thinks of itself, and is still often seen in Washington, as America\u2019s special ally. They were a wilful assertion of power over Britain; an attempt to fire and hire Britain\u2019s envoy. It was a crude act with implications for any country that seeks alliance with America or indeed with any other global power. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will have been watching approvingly. For Britain, though, it is a stake through the heart of its entire postwar self-image.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-effectively-sacked-by-johnson-on-the-orders-of-trump\">Kim Darroch: effectively sacked by Johnson on the orders of Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, consider Johnson.

The underpinnings of Trumpism, in the shape of populist nationalism and contempt for other countries, alliances and accords, go much deeper, both in the US and in Brexit Britain. If Johnson, or any other Brexiter leader, gets his way, Britain may once again embrace the US. But the America they embrace will not be the outward-looking republic of presidents from Eisenhower to Obama but an inward-looking exceptionalist country that seeks to disrupt everything about the international order. In such a world, Britain risks becoming the vassal of a capricious unilateralist state.

      "bodyText": "As a signatory to the UN body Cedaw (the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women) it is shocking that in its latest report in 2018 it notes that in its almost 20 years it has made 13 recommendations about the abortion situation in Northern Ireland, all of which have been ignored. This year the UN committee against torture recommended that \u201cthe State party ensure that all women and girls in the State party, including in Northern Ireland, have effective access to the means of terminating a pregnancy when not doing so is likely to result in severe pain and suffering, such as when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, when the life or health of the pregnant person is at risk and in cases of fatal fetal impairment\u201d. The UK can hardly criticise other countries for ignoring UN recommendations if it behaves in this way. We therefore welcome the vote to extend abortion legislation to Northern Ireland as a first step to decriminalisation of this medical matter (Rights to same-sex marriage and abortion for whole of UK, 10 July).

Given what we know about the impact of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policies and last year\u2019s Windrush scandal, we have every reason to believe that children who have been denied citizenship under these requirements are now at risk of being excluded from key services such as work, healthcare or access to university, and potentially, could even be detained and deported at any moment. This is why the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens (PRCBC), Amnesty UK and the Runnymede Trust worked together last year to bring this injustice to the attention of the government and the public. There is currently much that needs to be amended in relation to children registering their citizenship. The exorbitant fees for applying for citizenship (three times the cost of processing applications) is one, but equally there are concerns about the costs and lack of legal aid for appeals, the lack of transparency in official decisions as well as the inappropriate treatment of children as adults. The government took some steps to update the good character guidance in January 2019 \u2013 but this is insufficient and does not meet the government\u2019s statutory obligations in relation to the UN convention on the rights of the child. Children\u2019s best interests are still being ignored and the government is undermining the intention of the 1981 British Nationality Act: to ensure that children born or raised in this country for the first 10 years of their life have the same citizenship rights as their peers. This is why the good character test for all children registering their citizenship must be scrapped. \u2022 Dr Zubaida Haque is the deputy director at the Runnymede Trust, a leading race equality thinktank \u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2019 to reflect the writer\u2019s original intention in the hypothetical example given of a child without British citizenship, that their parents also did not have British citizenship, indefinite leave to remain or permanent residence status",

Indeed, some moderate Tories might imagine this is the Exocet they\u2019ve been waiting for, a threat of legal action by Major \u2013 together with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/christopherhope/status/1148862643320610817\" title=\"\">his accusation</a> that Johnson is putting party before country and his own career before both \u2013 at last putting a hole below the waterline of the Johnson campaign to become the next Conservative leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/boris-johnson-displays-why-he-will-be-most-ill-qualified-pm-of-modern-times\">Boris Johnson displays why he will be most ill-qualified PM of modern times | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is a forlorn hope. Major\u2019s move has almost certainly come too late, in that the selectorate in this contest, Tory party members, have received their ballot papers and many will already have cast their votes. But it\u2019s too late in a deeper sense, in that the Conservatives stopped listening long ago to warnings like those their former leader issued this morning.</p> <p>Indeed, Major\u2019s move will doubtless galvanise the Brexit ultras who dominate today\u2019s Tory party. They will simply add him to the long list of \u201cenemies of the people\u201d who stand in the way of their Brexit dream, along with the judges, the BBC, the CBI, the TUC, the experts, business and those Tory cabinet ministers \u2013 including, say, Michael Gove, who with Boris Johnson led the leave campaign in 2016 \u2013 who are now deemed to lack sufficient faith.</p> <p>For this is the new Brexit dividing line. Back in Major\u2019s day, Tories were split between those who wanted to rule out Britain joining the euro forever, and those who only wanted to rule it out for the lifetime of a single parliament. Now merely leaving the European Union itself is not enough; nor even is leaving the EU without a deal, a no-deal Brexit, enough. No, to be a true Brexiteer today, you must be ready to leave the EU without a deal even if that means denying MPs a say. In the macho politics of Brexit, a willingness to blow up centuries of parliamentary democracy is the latest virility test.</p> <p>In this climate, it actually helps Johnson to be pitted against a man whom hardcore Brexiters see as a Brussels-loving, remainer weakling. Major\u2019s calm reasoning will be dismissed as mere defeatism by a Tory tribe that wants to hear fantasies, such as the latest one served up by Johnson during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/1148674034713817088\" title=\"\">last night\u2019s TV debate</a> against Jeremy Hunt, when, in defiance of all the evidence, he promised that, with the right preparations, a no-deal exit from the EU would be \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d.</p> <p>So Major\u2019s legal threat will not change the direction of a contest apparently destined to put Johnson in Downing Street, even if it does see an escalation of blue-on-blue hostilities \u2013 and note the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48934781\" title=\"\">Johnson camp\u2019s declaration</a> that Major \u201chas gone completely bonkers\u201d \u2013 already intensified by Hunt\u2019s combative performance last night. But it has value, nonetheless.</p> <p>First, it might help prevent a no-deal crash-out, by forcing the next PM to realise that obstacles stand in the way of every version of that scenario \u2013 whether it\u2019s a no-confidence vote in the Commons or a verdict in the high court. And, second, it highlights the glaring hypocrisy of the Brexiter case.</p> <p>Recall that in the spring of 2016, the leavers said we had to exit the EU for the sake of parliamentary sovereignty, to restore once more the right of MPs to have the final say on how Britain is governed. And yet here we are, three years later, with those same leavers insisting on the right to cut MPs out of this decision altogether. Nothing better confirms that Brexit has become a fetish, one to which every other principle has been subordinated \u2013 including the conservative principle of preserving a constitution that has endured for more than three centuries.</p> <p>It is bleakly appropriate that a former Conservative leader and prime minister has reminded us of that fact. Not for the first time, John Major has done his country a public service.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Twenty six years after he was caught by a hot mic denouncing the Eurosceptic \u201cbastards\u201d in his own cabinet, John Major has proved that he has not lost his knack for making news \u2013 and this time he very much knew the microphone was on. The former Tory prime minister told the Today programme that any move to \u201cprorogue\u201d, or suspend, parliament in order to drive through a no-deal crash-out from the European Union \u2013 a move Boris Johnson has pointedly refused to rule out \u2013 would be \u201ccompletely and utterly against parliamentary tradition\u201d, adding that \u201cI, for one, would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed.\u201d In other words, a former Tory PM just threatened to take the next Tory PM to court to stop a no-deal Brexit. The legal scholars will debate the ins and outs of that idea, as they face the prospect that the judiciary will again be drawn into the Brexit quagmire sooner or later, but the immediate impact of this intervention will be political. Indeed, some moderate Tories might imagine this is the Exocet they\u2019ve been waiting for, a threat of legal action by Major \u2013 together with his accusation that Johnson is putting party before country and his own career before both \u2013 at last putting a hole below the waterline of the Johnson campaign to become the next Conservative leader. That is a forlorn hope. Major\u2019s move has almost certainly come too late, in that the selectorate in this contest, Tory party members, have received their ballot papers and many will already have cast their votes. But it\u2019s too late in a deeper sense, in that the Conservatives stopped listening long ago to warnings like those their former leader issued this morning. Indeed, Major\u2019s move will doubtless galvanise the Brexit ultras who dominate today\u2019s Tory party. They will simply add him to the long list of \u201cenemies of the people\u201d who stand in the way of their Brexit dream, along with the judges, the BBC, the CBI, the TUC, the experts, business and those Tory cabinet ministers \u2013 including, say, Michael Gove, who with Boris Johnson led the leave campaign in 2016 \u2013 who are now deemed to lack sufficient faith. For this is the new Brexit dividing line. Back in Major\u2019s day, Tories were split between those who wanted to rule out Britain joining the euro forever, and those who only wanted to rule it out for the lifetime of a single parliament. Now merely leaving the European Union itself is not enough; nor even is leaving the EU without a deal, a no-deal Brexit, enough. No, to be a true Brexiteer today, you must be ready to leave the EU without a deal even if that means denying MPs a say. In the macho politics of Brexit, a willingness to blow up centuries of parliamentary democracy is the latest virility test. In this climate, it actually helps Johnson to be pitted against a man whom hardcore Brexiters see as a Brussels-loving, remainer weakling. Major\u2019s calm reasoning will be dismissed as mere defeatism by a Tory tribe that wants to hear fantasies, such as the latest one served up by Johnson during last night\u2019s TV debate against Jeremy Hunt, when, in defiance of all the evidence, he promised that, with the right preparations, a no-deal exit from the EU would be \u201cvanishingly inexpensive\u201d. So Major\u2019s legal threat will not change the direction of a contest apparently destined to put Johnson in Downing Street, even if it does see an escalation of blue-on-blue hostilities \u2013 and note the Johnson camp\u2019s declaration that Major \u201chas gone completely bonkers\u201d \u2013 already intensified by Hunt\u2019s combative performance last night. But it has value, nonetheless. First, it might help prevent a no-deal crash-out, by forcing the next PM to realise that obstacles stand in the way of every version of that scenario \u2013 whether it\u2019s a no-confidence vote in the Commons or a verdict in the high court. And, second, it highlights the glaring hypocrisy of the Brexiter case. Recall that in the spring of 2016, the leavers said we had to exit the EU for the sake of parliamentary sovereignty, to restore once more the right of MPs to have the final say on how Britain is governed. And yet here we are, three years later, with those same leavers insisting on the right to cut MPs out of this decision altogether. Nothing better confirms that Brexit has become a fetish, one to which every other principle has been subordinated \u2013 including the conservative principle of preserving a constitution that has endured for more than three centuries. It is bleakly appropriate that a former Conservative leader and prime minister has reminded us of that fact. Not for the first time, John Major has done his country a public service. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

He pretty much achieved that, with a performance that was short on jokes and long on pre-rehearsed lines about his ability to see off both the Brexit party and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour. The only slight slip-up seemed to be his mention of a \u201cforthcoming election\u201d, which appeared to imply it could be sooner than 2022.</p> \n<p><strong>Hunt:</strong> He had his first and only opportunity to directly take on Johnson, attacking him on his weak spots of being poor on detail and most interested in his own ambition.

      "bodyText": "Overall pitch Boris Johnson: Pitched himself as the candidate to give Brexit its \u201cmojo\u201d back, and got applause for his insistence that energy and optimism was important when it came to delivering a departure from the European Union. The favourite contrasted his determination to get the UK \u201coff the hamster wheel of doom\u201d with the \u201cmanagerial\u201d approach that Theresa May \u2013 and Jeremy Hunt \u2013 have had so far. Jeremy Hunt: Gave familiar lines that he would deliver Brexit because he is an experienced negotiator and has been an entrepreneur. He also promised to invest in \u201cour brilliant armed forces\u201d and boasted of having won a marginal seat \u2013 even though his South West Surrey constituency has always been Conservative. Best line Johnson: Steered mostly clear of attacks on Hunt but he did deliver one stinging remark near the end, saying he \u201cgreatly admires Jeremy\u2019s ability to change his mind\u201d, highlighting his rival\u2019s conversion from remainer to Brexiter. Hunt: There were a few zingers that took aim at Johnson but one of the best was his attack on his rival\u2019s vagueness about Brexit trade tariff policy. \u201cGetting details like that wrong is fine for a newspaper column but if you\u2019re prime minister that is people\u2019s jobs at stake,\u201d Hunt said. Strategy Johnson: His main aim in the debate was to get through it without any major gaffes and to ram home his message that he would take the UK out of the EU no matter what by 31 October. He pretty much achieved that, with a performance that was short on jokes and long on pre-rehearsed lines about his ability to see off both the Brexit party and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour. The only slight slip-up seemed to be his mention of a \u201cforthcoming election\u201d, which appeared to imply it could be sooner than 2022. Hunt: He had his first and only opportunity to directly take on Johnson, attacking him on his weak spots of being poor on detail and most interested in his own ambition. He managed to deliver some cutting pre-prepared lines, saying: \u201cBecause Boris never answers the question we\u2019ve absolutely no idea what a Boris premiership would be like.\u201d Worst moment Johnson: Struggled over the issue of why he targeting income tax cuts at higher earners, saying it was \u201cpart of a package\u201d. Hunt (himself prioritising tax cuts for businesses) said it was not helping dispel the Conservatives\u2019 image as a \u201cparty of the rich\u201d and argued any income tax cuts should be for lower earners. This riled Johnson to the extent that he lamented even having to take part in the event, saying: \u201cThis is one of the reasons that blue-on-blue debates are so embarrassing.\u201d Hunt: Had taken what appeared to be a tough line on keeping Sir Kim Darroch in his job as UK ambassador to Washington, implying that he was standing up to Donald Trump. But Johnson took this apart somewhat by pointing out that the ambassador was due to go anyway near the end of the year and Hunt was unwilling to say that he would extend the tenure. Unanswered questions Johnson: Refused to say he would resign if he failed to achieve Brexit by 31 October under direct questioning from Hunt rather than an audience member.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt escalated the blue-on-blue warfare in Tuesday night\u2019s televised debate, trading blows on which potential prime minister could see through a no-deal Brexit, as Hunt repeatedly emphasised his rival\u2019s refusal to answer questions. The bitter back-and-forth, which will raise questions over whether Hunt could serve in a Johnson government after the aspersions he cast on his rival, saw the foreign secretary accuse Johnson of putting personal ambition above the welfare of the country. In the hour-long ITV broadcast, Johnson swerved questions repeatedly on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and declined to condemn Donald Trump for his attacks on the British ambassador. Johnson also gave equivocal answers on issues including HS2, Heathrow\u2019s third runway, and abortion and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland.

Other areas where the two men clashed included Johnson\u2019s proposed tax cuts for workers earning between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000, his first pledge of the campaign. Though Johnson insisted those would be \u201cpart of the package\u201d which would include measures for those on low incomes, Hunt said it was tarnishing the image of the party. \u201cI have spent my life trying to convince people we are not the party of the rich, we are the party of everyone, and if the very first tax cut you announce is a tax cut for the rich, that is the wrong signal to send about our party,\u201d he said.

The ITV debate \u2013 the only head-to-head in the campaign \u2013 came after ballot papers had already been distributed to Tory party members, raising questions as to whether anything in the debate would influence how members will vote. Sources close to Hunt said they did not believe the debate would be an irrelevance and that anecdotal evidence from local associations suggested many were still undecided. In the Johnson camp, there was little concern as to whether their candidate had swerved too many questions. \u201cThe whole frame of this contest is about Brexit and when we are going to leave and that is the one thing where Hunt is refusing to answer.
