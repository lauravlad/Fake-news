The Institute for Fiscal Studies said plans unveiled by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, and John McDonnell, his Labour shadow, would represent a decisive break with the past, but warned that a future government might have trouble delivering projects on the scale envisaged. On a day dominated by the ditching of austerity by both main parties, Javid\u2019s plan to spend an extra \u00a320bn a year on capital projects such as roads, railways, schools and hospitals was trumped by McDonnell\u2019s proposal to increase infrastructure investment by \u00a355bn for the next five years.

Speaking at an aircraft hangar outside Manchester, the chancellor loosened constraints on borrowing to the tune of \u00a320bn a year at the same time as attacking Labour for planning to \u201csaddle the country with debt\u201d. He drew a line under the era of George Osborne and Philip Hammond by setting a new cap on borrowing for investment at 3% of national income, while day-to-day current spending would be balanced. If the Conservatives win the election, that would allow borrowing to rise from \u00a347bn in the current financial year to around \u00a370bn, and then keep rising as the economy expanded in the future. Apart from a brief period during the financial crisis and deep recession of 2008-09, investment spending has not been at 3% of GDP since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. Repeatedly challenged over his decision to increase borrowing at the same time as criticising Labour for wanting to do the same, Javid said now was a responsible time because interest rates were negative for the government and it was a moment for \u201cnew rules for a new economic era\u201d.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/07/general-election-sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-come-out-fighting-on-economy-live-news?page=with:block-5dc4153c8f0867dcebfd0682#block-5dc4153c8f0867dcebfd0682\">1.04pm.)</a></p> \n  <p>But in an interview on the World at One, <strong>Prof Sir John Curtice</strong>, the leading elections expert, said that in practice he thought the pact would result in remain parties winning only around six more seats than if the three parties had been competing against each other.</p> \n  <p>He said just over one in three of the 60 seats were already held by one of the three pro-remain parties, or by Labour, which is committed to a referendum with remain as an option. And he said that in some of these seats, and in some seats where the Lib Dems were not far behind the Conservatives in 2017, the Greens did not stand anyway two years ago. </p> \n  <p>As a result, he said there were \u201cprobably, perhaps, five or six seats that might not be otherwise won by the Liberal Democrats, if they faced competition from the Greens or, in a couple of instances, from Plaid [that might now be won].\u201d He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That\u2019s probably the order of the impact given the current standing in the polls. Obviously, if the Liberal Democrats were to improve in the polls nationally, the picture might differ.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Curtice said that, by standing down in Beaconsfield, the Lib Dems and the Greens might also help Dominic Grieve to hold the seat, following his loss of the Conservative whip. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Around half a dozen seats that might otherwise be Conservative might go to one or other of these parties, or to Dominic Grieve.</p> \n   <p>Now, if the election is very close, it could be crucial. But, to be honest, given where the polls are at the moment, with about a 10-point Conservative lead, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be enough. But of course these parties are hoping that in the end the Conservatives won\u2019t do so well as they are currently doing in the polls.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a68dbf40d6040590834f36e7cf6dc0daf74f482e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a68dbf40d6040590834f36e7cf6dc0daf74f482e/66_0_1118_671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof John Curtice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof John Curtice.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T17:48:19.549Z\">at 5.48pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc44a448f08be4a102e4dcf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T16:46:19.571Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c7d03598ab8c08ad70a50c8d0882446caf3ef60\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c7d03598ab8c08ad70a50c8d0882446caf3ef60/0_20_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn with activists after he made a speech at the Library Theatre in Darwen, Lancashire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn with activists after he made a speech at the Library Theatre in Darwen, Lancashire.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc443708f08be4a102e4d79\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T16:26:21.420Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lib Dems face backlash from activists over pact with Greens and Plaid Cymru</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Lib Dem candidate asked to stand aside as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/lib-dems-greens-and-plaid-cymru-reveal-remain-election-pact\">the Unite to Remain pact</a> has vowed to run as an independent and said members of his party were \u201cextremely unhappy\u201d about how the deal was struck. As PA Media reports, <strong>Mike Powell</strong>, who intended to stand in Pontypridd as a Lib Dem candidate, said he was asked to stand aside three weeks ago.

Now Osborne edits the Evening Standard, and he does not seem over-impressed by Javid\u2019s plan to turn on the borrowing taps. Here is an extract from <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-borrowing-now-taxes-later-as-spending-soars-a4281221.html\">today\u2019s Standard editorial</a>.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Number 11 is doing a heroic job trying to restrain its neighbours, but they too want to spend more.

That\u2019s the real choice.</p> \n   <p>What isn\u2019t a choice is that the ordinary taxpayer will pick up the bill. Because all borrowing is just higher taxes deferred. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interestingly, in the editorial (which would have been approved by Osborne, if not actually written by him), the Standard also suggests that Boris Johnson is going to put plans for a \u201cnational care service\u201d at the heart of his manifesto. </p> \n  <p>Labour is also proposing a \u201cnational care service\u201d, although <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49787468\">the policy it announced at its party conference in the autumn</a> was just for personal care to be free, at a cost of \u00a36bn a year, not for all social care to be free.</p> \n  <p>This is what the Standard is predicting in its editorial.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s attitude to the public finances is simple: I\u2019m in charge, and if I don\u2019t spend it someone else will.</p> \n   <p>No 10 wants to make billions of pounds worth of commitments on spending and tax cuts during this campaign. The big idea for the Tory manifesto is social care. That might send a shiver down the spine of Conservative candidates who remember the fiasco of the 2017 manifesto pledge to make the well-off pay for their care.</p> \n   <p>But this Downing Street has found a different group of people to pay for it: you, the general public.</p> \n   <p>Get ready for plans for a national care service, funded out of general taxation like the NHS. It\u2019s a big expansion of the state \u2014 and an idea the Tories attacked when Labour proposed it a decade ago.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/1192418464704675841\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our editorial \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EveningStandard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EveningStandard</a>\u2069: all parties want to borrow more now, which means higher taxes later <a href=\"https://t.co/nTKR6vlBL7\">https://t.co/nTKR6vlBL7</a></p>\u2014 George Osborne (@George_Osborne) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/1192418464704675841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T14:23:19.675Z\">at 2.23pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc41ea88f08c2d1f80db634\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T13:40:25.442Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Green party in Northern Ireland has announced it will not stand in any of Belfast\u2019s four constituencies in a bid to assist the election of pro-remain MPs, PA Media reports.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The real question, in the short run, is would it be possible sensibly to spend this scale of money.

\u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students.</p> \n  <p>Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, and is being replicated by lecturers elsewhere in the country before the 26 November deadline for registration.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related:

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/boris-johnson-goes-on-attack-election-speech-after-high-profile-tory-gaffes\">Johnson kicked off the Conservative election campaign</a> yesterday with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/rees-mogg-keeps-low-profile-after-grenfell-comments-outrage\">suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense</a> and <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/alun-cairns-welsh-secretary-resigns-from-cabinet-over-trial-allegations\">Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign</a> over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. </p> \n  <p>Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"446e419a-7ad6-44c8-96fa-8059ecb07419\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lc1_nYlsj1Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc3a69f8f0867dcebfd038f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-lyons\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-07T05:59:10.867Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning and welcome to the first day of the official election campaign. It has not yet been 24 hours since Boris Johnson visited the Queen, dissolved parliament, and formally announced that a general election would take place on 12 December, and already we have seen high drama.</p> \n  <p>On the Labour side this came as <strong>Tom Watson </strong>announced last night that <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">he will step down as deputy leader</a>. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. </p> \n  <p>His departure is likely to reignite the debate about the direction of the Labour party under Corbyn after one senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. </p> \n  <p>Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January. Here he is, talking about his plans for life post-politics.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff8fee9b-43b3-4549-9331-63e2106743b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAdvOZckGxM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Meanwhile today, Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-shift-battle-to-economy\">both set to give speeches in the north-west of England</a>. </p> \n  <p>Javid is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-shift-battle-to-economy\">expected to hammer Labour on the economy</a>, saying the Tories won\u2019t \u201clet Labour off the hook like last time\u201d. In 2017, the Conservatives\u2019 claims that Labour was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d to fund its lavish spending pledges fell flat when Theresa May\u2019s party failed to publish costings of its own policies. But Javid will signal the Tories\u2019 determination to attack Labour on the economy relentlessly over the next five weeks \u2013 although unlike two years ago, the government is touting a series of multibillion pound spending pledges of its own.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d.</p> \n  <p>As usual, you can get in touch with me via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsKateLyons\">Twitter</a> and email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com).

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives and Labour have unveiled plans for an infrastructure spending boom that would increase investment in road, rail and buildings to the highest levels in more than 40 years, with both parties signalling a large rise in public borrowing to pay for it. John McDonnell has announced a radical Labour plan to commit \u00a3400bn of investment to what he called the twin crises of the climate emergency and social deprivation, saying \u201cfuture generations would never forgive us\u201d if rapid action was not taken. Sajid Javid has ripped up the Conservative party\u2019s former fiscal rules and loosened constraints on borrowing to the tune of \u00a320bn a year, while attacking Labour for planning to \u201csaddle the country with debt\u201d. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, has said the Tory plans to increase investment spending will mean \u201chigher taxes later\u201d. (See 2.13pm.) Pro-EU candidates have said they are \u201cputting party politics aside\u201d at the launch of a pact under which they have agreed not to stand against each other in 60 seats at the general election to avoid splitting the remain vote. A former Lib Dem candidate in Wales has said that many Welsh Liberal Democrats are unhappy about his party being involved in the Unite to Remain pact. (See 4.26pm.) Ian Austin, the former Labour MP and ally of Gordon Brown, has urged the party\u2019s voters to back Boris Johnson to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying the Labour leader is \u201ccompletely unfit\u201d to lead the country. Boris Johnson has made a \u201ccast iron\u201d pledge that he will not grant Nicola Sturgeon the powers she needs to hold a second independence referendum, regardless of whether the Scottish National party wins a majority of Scottish seats in December\u2019s general election or if they win a pro-independence majority in the Holyrood elections of 2021. Boris Johnson has been forced to distance himself from comments made by a Conservative parliamentary candidate who once said women should keep their \u201cknickers on\u201d to avoid rape. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey on Ian Austin\u2019s decision to endorse the Tories. In a clip broadcast on the BBC, Jeremy Corbyn was asked to respond to the front page Jewish Chronicle editorial that says most British Jews think he is antisemitic. In his reply, Corbyn said that many Jewish people in Britain did not agree with what the paper was saying and that Labour had confronted the issue. He said: Antisemitism is a poison and an evil in our society. Any form of racism is a poison and an evil in our society. I have spent my whole life fighting against racism. I will die an anti-racist. I want every community to feel safe and supported in this country \u2013 the Jewish community, the Muslim community, any other community from any faith or any other part of the world. Our party has confronted the issue. We have suspended or expelled members. We have an education programme. And all of that has been set up since I became the leader of this party. And we will carry on doing exactly that. There are many Jewish people in this country who are members of the Labour party, supporters of the Labour party, work with the Labour party, and they do not share the views that have been put forward on the front page of the Jewish Chronicle. I regret the Jewish Chronicle has chosen to say that. I simply say to everyone: our community is stronger when people work together, when we recognise the danger and poison that antisemitism is. We will be a stronger community when we defeat all forms of racism. And I will be part of that campaign to eradicate racism in any form. At the Unite to Remain press conference this morning it was claimed that \u201cat least 44\u201d of the 60 seats covered by the Lib Dem/Green/Plaid Cymru pact were winnable. (See 1.04pm.) But in an interview on the World at One, Prof Sir John Curtice, the leading elections expert, said that in practice he thought the pact would result in remain parties winning only around six more seats than if the three parties had been competing against each other. He said just over one in three of the 60 seats were already held by one of the three pro-remain parties, or by Labour, which is committed to a referendum with remain as an option. And he said that in some of these seats, and in some seats where the Lib Dems were not far behind the Conservatives in 2017, the Greens did not stand anyway two years ago. As a result, he said there were \u201cprobably, perhaps, five or six seats that might not be otherwise won by the Liberal Democrats, if they faced competition from the Greens or, in a couple of instances, from Plaid [that might now be won].\u201d He went on: That\u2019s probably the order of the impact given the current standing in the polls. Obviously, if the Liberal Democrats were to improve in the polls nationally, the picture might differ. Curtice said that, by standing down in Beaconsfield, the Lib Dems and the Greens might also help Dominic Grieve to hold the seat, following his loss of the Conservative whip. He went on: Around half a dozen seats that might otherwise be Conservative might go to one or other of these parties, or to Dominic Grieve. Now, if the election is very close, it could be crucial. But, to be honest, given where the polls are at the moment, with about a 10-point Conservative lead, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be enough. But of course these parties are hoping that in the end the Conservatives won\u2019t do so well as they are currently doing in the polls. A Lib Dem candidate asked to stand aside as part of the Unite to Remain pact has vowed to run as an independent and said members of his party were \u201cextremely unhappy\u201d about how the deal was struck. As PA Media reports, Mike Powell, who intended to stand in Pontypridd as a Lib Dem candidate, said he was asked to stand aside three weeks ago. The pact involves the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party agreeing not to stand against each other in 60 seats across England and Wales to give voters a single choice for a remain-supporting candidate. Powell, who has been a councillor since 1999, has refused to cooperate with the pact and will instead stand as an independent. As part of the pact, a Plaid candidate will stand in Pontypridd, PA Media reports. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s World at One, Powell said there was \u201cdisquiet and discomfort\u201d within the Welsh Lib Dems about the pact. Explaining his decision to run as an independent, he said: I think that people deserve to have an opportunity to vote for someone who\u2019s going to represent the people of Pontypridd, rather than standing to represent a cause to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. When it was put to him that by standing he would split the remain vote, he said: I don\u2019t think I will split the remain vote. That won\u2019t happen. It will not be a split. I understand the fundamentals. We\u2019re dealing with Plaid Cymru, they\u2019re the Welsh nationalist party. We\u2019re not dealing with the Scottish nationalist party, we\u2019re not dealing with the English nationalist party. These are nationalists. They want to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. I don\u2019t see them as a remain party as such. Their ultimate goal is to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. And myself and a lot of people in the valleys are not prepared to vote for that. Powell said many Welsh Liberal Democrats felt the same way: I know there are an awful lot of members in the Welsh Liberal Democrats who are extremely unhappy with the way this negotiation has been dealt with. Jeremy Corbyn has been in Rossendale and Darwen this afternoon. He said it was the 15th constituency he had visited in the campaign. It is a Conservative seat (Jake Berry was the sitting MP), but Labour finished behind by just 3,216 votes at the last election. In a short speech, he criticised the Daily Telegraph for the way it used its front page yesterday to promote Boris Johnson\u2019s column defending billionaires. He said: When the Tories and Boris Johnson decide to make the front page of the Daily Telegraph a defence of billionaires, it\u2019s a bid odd, it\u2019s a bit weird. I would have thought they\u2019d have some humility, some humility to understand just how offensive all of that is. At his Q&amp;A in Liverpool, when asked about Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism allegations (in the light of what Ian Austin has been saying today), John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour had done what the Jewish community had asked it to do on this issue. (See 11.58am.) He said the same thing later on the World at One, telling the programme: Look, everything that has been asked of us by the Jewish community we\u2019ve done. We were asked to look at antisemitism in the party and we\u2019ve done a detailed investigation. We\u2019ve identified a small, a tiny number, of antisemitic activities and we\u2019ve dealt with it. We were asked to ensure we had disciplinary procedures that were fast, and I was saying ruthless as well, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve expelled people. We were asked to set up an education programme. We\u2019ve done that with independent organisations. I just say to them, have a look again at the reality of what we\u2019ve done because actually we\u2019ve done everything asked of us. But the Jewish Labour Movement, the mainstream organisation for Jews in the party, has said McDonnell is wrong, and that the party has not been doing enough. Boris Johnson has made a \u201ccast iron\u201d pledge that he will not grant Nicola Sturgeon the powers she needs to hold a second independence referendum, regardless of whether the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats in December\u2019s general election or if they win a pro-independence majority in the Holyrood elections of 2021. In his strongest rebuff yet to Sturgeon\u2019s vow to hold a second vote on independence next year, Johnson used his first visit to Scotland of the election campaign to insist: Absolutely, there is no case whatsoever [for a second referendum] because people were promised in 2014 that it would be a once in a generation event and I see no reason why we should go back on that pledge. Describing Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn as \u201cyoke-mates of destruction\u201d in terms of the future stability of the union, he told reporters: It\u2019s perfectly obvious that Jeremy Corbyn is going to rely on the SNP to get him into power and to do that he\u2019s done a shady deal to have a second referendum. On Wednesday, the leader of Scottish Labour, Richard Leonard, categorically ruled out any form of electoral deal with the SNP, after Johnson warned against making 2020 the \u201cyear of two referendums\u201d and Sturgeon told voters that demand for a second vote on independence would become \u201cirresistible\u201d if her party were to win the election in Scotland. Johnson visited the Roseisle distillery, near Elgin, in Moray, accompanied by the local Scottish Conservative candidate, Douglas Ross, who won the seat from the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader Angus Robertson in 2017. Johnson spent little over an hour touring the rural distillery in a strictly managed visit during which he had no contact with the public. Boris Johnson has said that the comment from the Tory candidate Nick Conrad, who said in 2014 that women at risk of rape should keep their knickers on (see 12.20pm), was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Johnson told journalists: Those comments are completely unacceptable. He has apologised long ago. But I can\u2019t stress [enough], those comments are completely unacceptable. The Conservative MP Sir George Hollingbery, a former minister and former parliamentary private secretary to Theresa May, has announced that he standing down as an MP. As the Institute for Government\u2019s Gavin Freeguard points out, this takes the tally of MPs leaving parliament up to 72. Richard Tice, the Brexit party chairman, has confirmed that he is standing as a candidate in Hartlepool. As my colleague Josh Halliday reported in his story this morning, before Tice\u2019s candidature had been formally announced, the Labour-held constituency is one of the Brexit party\u2019s key targets. The Brexit party has joint control of the council and got a higher vote in the constituency in the European elections, according to one estimate, than in any other Labour seat. These are from my colleague Steven Morris, who has been with the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, on a campaign visit to Somerset. Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, is going to stand for the Labour deputy leadership after Tom Watson stands down after the election, Bloomberg is reporting. George Osborne was seen as a political patron to Sajid Javid when Osborne was chancellor and Javid was a new MP rapidly getting promoted into government. Now Osborne edits the Evening Standard, and he does not seem over-impressed by Javid\u2019s plan to turn on the borrowing taps. Here is an extract from today\u2019s Standard editorial. Number 11 is doing a heroic job trying to restrain its neighbours, but they too want to spend more. In an echo of his shadow, Sajid Javid announced today his own \u00a3100bn \u201cfund\u201d for a \u201cdecade of renewal\u201d. That\u2019s code for higher capital spending \u2013 on the grounds that one-off commitments to roads and hospital buildings can be turned off more quickly than recurring spending on things like welfare and staffing. All this borrowing by the Tories further shatters the fiscal rules that Philip Hammond established to constrain Theresa May, so his successor is proposing new rules ... Why are the Conservatives going through these contortions? Because they want to borrow more, while preserving their dividing line with Labour. The risk is that they blur a distinction that should be clear: yes the Tories want to spend billions more; but Labour want to spend a great deal more billions than that. That\u2019s the real choice. What isn\u2019t a choice is that the ordinary taxpayer will pick up the bill. Because all borrowing is just higher taxes deferred. Interestingly, in the editorial (which would have been approved by Osborne, if not actually written by him), the Standard also suggests that Boris Johnson is going to put plans for a \u201cnational care service\u201d at the heart of his manifesto. Labour is also proposing a \u201cnational care service\u201d, although the policy it announced at its party conference in the autumn was just for personal care to be free, at a cost of \u00a36bn a year, not for all social care to be free. This is what the Standard is predicting in its editorial. Boris Johnson\u2019s attitude to the public finances is simple: I\u2019m in charge, and if I don\u2019t spend it someone else will. No 10 wants to make billions of pounds worth of commitments on spending and tax cuts during this campaign. The big idea for the Tory manifesto is social care. That might send a shiver down the spine of Conservative candidates who remember the fiasco of the 2017 manifesto pledge to make the well-off pay for their care. But this Downing Street has found a different group of people to pay for it: you, the general public. Get ready for plans for a national care service, funded out of general taxation like the NHS. It\u2019s a big expansion of the state \u2014 and an idea the Tories attacked when Labour proposed it a decade ago. The Green party in Northern Ireland has announced it will not stand in any of Belfast\u2019s four constituencies in a bid to assist the election of pro-remain MPs, PA Media reports. The party had already withdrawn from the South Belfast contest earlier this week to endorse the SDLP\u2019s bid to unseat the outgoing DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly. The CBI, the leading business organisation, has cautiously welcomed the Labour and Conservative plans to spend more on investment. In a statement, Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief economist, said: Labour\u2019s ambitions to eradicate regional economic inequalities and upgrading our networks to decarbonise are shared by business. The Conservatives\u2019 new fiscal rules would allow the purse strings to be loosened to modernise our economic infrastructure. The Scottish Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie has appealed for support from Labour voters who feel they are \u201cwithout a political home\u201d. Speaking at his party\u2019s official campaign launch, Rennie said: The Labour party are moving far to the left. They\u2019re out of touch with moderate, reasonable people in this country. People who want to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union and want to focus on the big issues that the country faces. All of those people who are without a political home, I think they need to come with the Liberal Democrats, because we speak for them. Bad news for Northern Ireland\u2019s remainers and good news for the Democratic Unionist party: Lady Sylvia Hermon has decided to step down as an MP. The independent unionist, Northern Ireland\u2019s sole pro-remain voice at Westminster, announced on Wednesday night that she was vacating her North Down seat. The decision dismayed remainers and greatly boosts the DUP\u2019s chances of taking the seat. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s abstention from Westminster meant Hermon was the only Northern Ireland MP to challenge the DUP\u2019s Brexiters and to represent the 56% of people in her country who voted to stay in the EU. Tributes to her 18 years of service flowed from all sides. Hermon was an eloquent, effective parliamentarian. \u201cThis has been a particularly difficult decision but, after much thought, I have concluded that it is the right decision for my family and for me at this time,\u201d Hermon said. The prospect of a tumultuous, toxic campaign in Northern Ireland may also have influenced her decision. Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP had planned to stand aside in North Down to increase her chances of fending off the DUP\u2019s Alex Easton, who closed the gap to 1,200 votes in the last election. He is now favourite to take the seat and offset potential DUP losses in Belfast. Like Ian Austin, John Woodcock was elected as a Labour MP and subsequently left the party, strongly criticising Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and his handling of the issue of antisemitism (although, unlike Austin, Woodcock was suspended at the time over a misconduct allegation). Woodcock and Austin both sat as independents instead of defecting to another party. Woodcock is standing down as an MP and today, like Austin, he is urging people to vote Conservative to keep Corbyn out of No 10. He said: There are one of two people who are going to be prime minister after an election. It is Boris Johnson or it is Jeremy Corbyn. We pleaded with our friends in the Labour party to face up to this choice, not to leave it until too late. Now all of that, to an extent, is water under the bridge, but we have arrived in a campaign where one of two people are going to be prime minister. The choice to keep Jeremy Corbyn away from Downing Street, to stop him getting his hands on the levers of national security and defence has to be to vote Conservative in this election and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing as well. Northern politicians and business leaders have joined forces with more than 30 regional news organisations to publish the first manifesto for the north, on the second day of an election campaign in which northern England is regarded as a key battleground. The manifesto demands the newly elected government sign up to five \u201cgame changers for the north\u201d, as the two main political leaders address crowds in Teesside, Liverpool and Manchester today. Uniting across political and geographical differences, the \u201cpower up the north\u201d collaboration will present the policy pledges to the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats, demanding they sign up to the vision to \u201cunleash\u201d the north\u2019s potential. The proposals came out of a conference in September, organised by NP11 - a group of the 11 Northern Local Enterprise Partnerships \u2013 and is backed by newspaper front pages across the region including those of the Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo, the Yorkshire Post and the Chronicle in Newcastle. They include: Taking local control of education and training Asking the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal Treasury objective A northern transport budget Greater scale and control of investment Placing the north at the helm of a green industrial revolution In an article for the Guardian, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said the pledges could free northerners \u201cfrom the shackles of short-sighted Westminster policies\u201d. He writes that the proposals are backed by analysis led by the former head of the UK civil service, Bob Kerslake, which found that the north-south divide in England was as \u201cstark as the east-west divide in Germany in the early 1990s\u201d. Roger Marsh, the chair of the NP11, said the north led the first industrial revolution and could be \u201cthe crucible\u201d for the \u201cfourth \u2013 and first sustainable \u2013 industrial revolution, but only if we take critical action now\u201d. He added: \u201cOur message to all political parties is clear; the north is ready to lead the transformation required for net zero 2050, enhanced productivity and a truly inclusive Great Britain.\u201d Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, said: \u201cOur north is one made up of many different and distinct places, but by working together like this we have shown we are a powerful region which is prepared to speak with one voice and do what is needed to create opportunity for the future\u201d. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party have formed a general election pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seats, PA Media reports. The deal, brokered by the Unite to Remain group, will give voters a single remain choice in 60 constituencies across England and Wales. The group is confident that \u201cat least 44\u201d of the 60 seats are \u201chighly winnable\u201d. As PA Media reports, the move follows an agreement earlier this year in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, where the Lib Dems took the seat from the Conservatives after the other two parties stood aside. Heidi Allen, the chairwoman of Unite To Remain and previously Lib Dem MP for South Cambridgeshire, said the cross-party arrangement was \u201cunprecedented in modern British political history\u201d. In total, the Lib Dems will stand in 43 constituencies, the Greens will stand in 10 and Plaid Cymru will stand in seven. At a press conference in London, Peter Dunphy, an election strategist and director at Unite to Remain, said: \u201cAt least 44 of those 60 can be regarded as highly winnable constituencies.\u201d As PA reports, he said this evaluation was based on a wide range of data, including current national opinion polls, and results from local and European elections. Here\u2019s my colleague Kate Proctor\u2019s story about the launch: These are from my colleague Richard Partington, who has been listening to the press conference that Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has been giving. Here is some more analysis of the Sajid Javid and John McDonnell speeches from economic specialists (journalists and thinktankers). From Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor From Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies From Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation From the economics professor Jonathan Portes From Newsnight\u2019s economics editor Ben Chu From Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation With the Conservatives and Labour both proposing to increase sustained public spending to a level last seen in the 1970s, it was perhaps appropriate that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, delivered his speech at the Aviation View Park in Manchester below a surviving Concorde - the supersonic passenger jet launched in the 1970s. Sadly, Concorde turned out to be unsustainable. These are from Reuters Kylie MacLellan. The Bank of England has today downgraded its growth forecasts for the UK. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his business live blog. These are from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending thinktank, on the rival Conservative and Labour borrowing plans. A former BBC Radio Norfolk presenter who said women should \u201ckeep their knickers on\u201d while he was discussing a high-profile rape case has been chosen as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Broadland in Norfolk, the Press Association reports. Nick Conrad, 34, received the backing of the local party on Wednesday to run for the seat held by fellow Tory Keith Simpson, who has stepped down after 22 years as an MP. Simpson held the constituency at the 2017 election with a majority of 15,816. As the Press Association reports, Conrad was criticised for the comments he made in 2014 during a radio conversation about the footballer Ched Evans, who was jailed for rape before having his conviction quashed and being cleared at a retrial. Conrad said: What I\u2019m trying to say is that women also have to understand that when a man\u2019s given certain signals he\u2019ll wish to act upon them and if you don\u2019t wish to give out the wrong signals, it\u2019s best, probably, to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him. Does that make sense? This week Conrad told the Eastern Daily Press that he had already apologised for what he said in 2014 and that he was apologising again. He said: I completely messed up, I knew I\u2019d got it wrong and it didn\u2019t demonstrate the fact that I know that it\u2019s the most abhorrent crime. I\u2019ve for many years broadcast very difficult subject matter and I was very disappointed in myself after the reaction flared up on the back end of those comments. I apologise, I learned from it and I moved forward. Jess Phillips, who is seeking re-election as a Labour MP, posted this on Twitter in response to the news about Conrad\u2019s selection. Q: Should Jacob Rees-Mogg be forced out as an MP? McDonnell says he and Jeremy Corbyn have been on the silent walks to commemorate the Grenfell Tower fire. He recalls Corbyn embracing survivors. That is what MPs should be doing. He says Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments show how Tories patronise the people. They must be removed from office, he says. That\u2019s what MPs should be doing, embracing and supporting [Grenfell Tower survivors]. What does it show? It shows they have no idea how we live. They have no idea how ordinary working people feel. And their sense of entitlement, elite, patronising, looks down on us. And when they get power, walk all over us. And that\u2019s it. The McDonnell Q&amp;A is over. I will post more from the Javid and McDonnell speeches and Q&amp;As, with reaction, shortly. McDonnell is now answering questions from activists at the event. He says Labour wants to give local authorities the power to control rents. People think that is radical, he says. But it is normal through Europe. And rent controls used to apply in this country too. Q: Why have Ian Austin and the Jewish Chronicle both decided that the election choice should not be Labour? McDonnell does not refer to Austin by name. But, referring to a \u201cformer Labour MP\u201d, he says Austin is now employed by the Tories, and so he speaks on their behalf. He\u2019s now employed by the Tories: what else do you expect him to do in an election campaign where you\u2019re employed by the Tories, you speak on behalf of the Tories. That\u2019s what this was about this morning. (That is a reference to Austin being a trade envoy to Israel. Trade envoys are unpaid, but their travel costs are covered by the government.) On the Jewish Chronicle editorial (see 9.28am), McDonnell says he is saddened by this. He says one antisemite in the party is one too many. But he says Labour has done what the Jewish community has asked for in terms of dealing with this problem. But he says anyone concerned about racism should not be supporting the Tories. He says they won\u2019t address Islamophobia in their own party. Q: What impact will the remain alliance pacts have on Labour? And why is Labour not part of that? McDonnell says Labour is heading for a majority. It does not need a pact, he says. But he says anyone considering a pact with the Lib Dems should consider their record in supporting austerity. McDonnell says what he is proposing stands in the best traditions of socialism. John McDonnell is now taking questions. Lucy Powell, the Labour candidate (not an MP now, because parliament has been dissolved) who is chairing the event, urges activists to be \u201crespectful\u201d when journalists ask questions. (In the past journalists have been booed for asking critical questions at these events.) Q: What is your response to Sajid Javid\u2019s speech? McDonnell says Javid seems to have become a climate change denier. He has not included this in his letter to the Bank of England. Under Javid\u2019s plans, the UK would not be able to meet its climate change targets, he says. He says Labour\u2019s plans do match the scale of the climate crisis. If Labour did not step up to the mark, future generations would not forgive it. Q: Will these plans allow you to increase your target for building homes? McDonnell says these borrowing plans will allow Labour to meet its housing targets. Details of those will be published in due course, he says. Q: Does the next Labour deputy leader have to be a woman? McDonnell says he is always in favour of a gender balance. McDonnell says Labour will exclude investment from its borrowing targets. Our fiscal rule for the next parliament will exclude borrowing for investment from our borrowing targets. It will mandate us to deliver an improvement in the overall balance sheet by the end of the parliament. So that when we invest in the infrastructure our country desperately needs, it\u2019s recognised both as a cost and as a benefit. Yes \u2013 adding to the government\u2019s debt but also adding to the government\u2019s assets and strengthening our public sector to deal with the future. With the rents on our new council homes and the electricity produced by our public sector energy agencies set against the cost of servicing the debt issued to build them. And a ceiling on that debt servicing cost \u2013 in normal times \u2013 of 10% of tax revenue. On this at least there\u2019s nothing radical, just common sense. McDonnell says the OBR forecasts there were expected to be published today (see 9.05am) would have shown an increase in borrowing. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s restated forecast, which was meant to be published today, was expected to show tens of billions more borrowing Because the Tories designed an expensive student loan system that hid the costs off the books. They got caught out in the end. Too late for the millions who\u2019ve racked up tens of thousands in debt at eye-watering interest rates. That\u2019s what happens when you design fiscal rules to minimise the costs on one side of your balance sheet. Ignoring the benefits on the other. Labour won\u2019t make that mistake. McDonnell says Labour will build the tidal barrage proposed for the Mersey. McDonnell says he will also base the Treasury department dealing with the national transformation fund in the north. They will be supported by a national transformation fund unit of the Treasury. I can confirm that this powerful section of the Treasury unit will be based here in the north. At the same time my Treasury ministerial meetings will no longer be solely in London. Labour\u2019s Treasury ministers will meet outside of London and will have a ministerial office in the north. The centre of gravity, of political gravity, is shifting away from London. McDonnell says decisions about how this money is spent will be taken locally. We\u2019ll carve out part of our national transformation fund for a local transformation fund in each of England\u2019s regions with money for the devolved governments as well of course. And that money will be ringfenced for infrastructure projects decided and developed at a local level, with decisions made transparently and democratically in each region about how their fund is allocated. And regional offices of government departments overseen by a board of local county and city council leaders, with that board publicly accountable to open meetings of local councillors, trade unions and business representatives. McDonnell now explains the components of what he says will be Labour\u2019s national transformation fund. On the scale of change investment needed I can tell you today that Labour\u2019s national transformation fund will be bigger than we promised at the 2017 election. For areas that haven\u2019t had their fair share for years. We\u2019ll deliver \u00a3250bn of investment here and around the country over the next ten years through our green transformation fund. Upgrading our energy, transport and other networks. To meet our targets and decarbonise as thoroughly and fast as our commitment to a just transition will allow. But it\u2019s not just the natural world that\u2019s been neglected. So we\u2019ll also commit to an additional \u00a3150bn in a new social transformation fund spent over the first five years of our Labour government. The social transformation fund will begin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that the Tories have torn apart. \u00a3150bn to replace, upgrade and expand our schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. To deal with the human emergency which the Tories have created, alongside the climate emergency. McDonnell says decision making has to shift out of London. To achieve that objective also requires therefore an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision making and investment in this country from its location solely in London into the north and regions and nations of our country. McDonnell says Labour wants to achieve an \u201cirreversible shift\u201d in power. Our aim as a Labour government is to achieve what past Labour governments have aspired to. An irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people. This is a reference to an ambition first set out in Labour\u2019s February 1974 manifesto, which promised to \u201cbring about a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families.\u201d McDonnell says there is an alternative, contrary to what the Tories claimed in the 1980s. This election is about that alternative, he says. It is a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance to get back on track, remake this country and transform everyone\u2019s lives for the better.\u201d McDonnell says the Tory attitude in the 1980s, towards Liverpool and other places, was summed up by the phrase \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d. The Tories are always the same. In the 80s it was dole queues and sky-high inflation Now it\u2019s zero hours contracts, universal credit and foodbanks. And if they win again it\u2019ll be more of the same. Slashing inheritance tax for the richest, despite an ever-deepening crisis in our care homes and a crumbling public transport system. A hard right Tory Brexit smashing a hole in our public finances. They treat us all with contempt. They think people are stupid. That with Brexit on the agenda, they think we\u2019ll all forget about the past ten years and the prospect of the next five years if they get back. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now. McDonnell was brought up in Liverpool, and he recalls his father working as a docker in the city. Like so many other families, his family moved south after work on the docks dried up. What happened to the Liverpool docks and to Liverpool is what happened to so many cities and communities across the North and Britain. Traditional industries declined and little was done to replace them. Old skills were lost and new skills were not invested in. Successive Labour governments sought to engage and invest, only to see their efforts swept aside when the Tories took charge. Corbyn is introducing John McDonnell. He says McDonnell is someone who has changed the economic debate in this county. Here is Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, making the same point in a tweet on the Sajid Javid speech. Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking at the Labour event in Liverpool. The main announcements will come from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, who is due to speak shortly, but Corbyn is starting with a general warm-up. He criticises what Jacob Rees-Mogg said about the Grenfell Tower, and says a Labour government would act immediately to remove Grenfell-style cladding from tower blocks. There are massive imbalances in the country, he says, between east and west, north and south. He says Labour\u2019s tax plans will affect the richest 5% of the population. But everyone else will benefit, he says. These are from the FT\u2019s economic editor, Chris Giles. This is what Sajid Javid said about how much extra spending would be possible under his new fiscal rules. (See 10.50am.) The rules that I\u2019ve set out today, which will allow us to borrow more responsibly ... historically we have invested as a country about 1.8% of GDP a year in infrastructure. If you say add a percentage point, and which you comfortably can do [under the rules], that\u2019s about an extra \u00a320bn a year. Over a five-year period, you can easily add another \u00a3100bn. We will set out, both in our manifesto and then, if we win, in a future budget, much more detail about what this infrastructure investment looks like. Q: Isn\u2019t it irresponsible to be using the no-deal headroom when a no-deal Brexit is still a risk? Javid does not accept that. He says he only used half the headroom there. He says his plans are affordable. The difference between Labour and the Conservatives could not be bigger, he says. Anything John McDonnell promises today - it doesn\u2019t matter if it is an extra \u00a31, an extra \u00a3150bn, an extra \u00a31tn - it cannot be relied on. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: Can you commit to the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme in full? Javid says this is just the kind of plan that he wants to see for the north. He does not want to make an announcement about that today. But he says it would be \u201ccomfortably\u201d affordable under the plans he has announced. Labour can \u201cspray money around like confetti\u201d, he says. But that does not mean anything if they are going to crash the economy. Q: How much would you borrow for investment? Javid says historically the country has invested 1.8% of GDP per year for infrastructure. He says taking that to 2.8%, which would be affordable, would give you an extra \u00a320bn a year. Q: Swing voters have suffered cuts for 10 years. Why shouldn\u2019t they go with Labour? Javid says increased infrastructure spending can only happen with a strong economy. If you \u201ccrater\u201d the economy, that will not be possible. He says Labour\u2019s investment numbers are meaningless. John McDonnell is talking about \u00a3150bn in investment. He might as well talk about \u00a31tn. These numbers are meaningless. Q: Do you still want to reform stamp duty? Javid says he will not comment on particular taxes today. Sajid Javid is now taking questions. Q: Does this mean you won\u2019t be able to afford tax cuts? Javid says there will be scope for tax cuts. Q: Are you not guilty of doing what you accuse Labour of : increasing borrowing irresponsibly? No, says Javid. He says the difference between the two parties\u2019 approaches is \u201cthe difference between night and day\u201d. Under the Tory plan, debt as a proportion of GDP would come down over the course of the parliament, he says. He says Labour has just conjured up a new \u00a3150bn fund, on top of the \u00a3250bn one already planned. He says he does not know if Labour will have fiscal rules. But if they do, they will not meet them. He says Labour will have to raise taxes. There will be a \u201ctax bombshell\u201d under Labour, he says. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is still speaking. He is now attacking Labour\u2019s economic policies. He says Labour would \u201cruin your finances\u201d, raise tax and \u201csaddle the next generation with debt\u201d. He says every single Labour government in history has left this country with an economic crisis. He says the last Labour government took 13 years to undo the economic legacy left to it by the Conservatives. A Jeremy Corbyn government would only take 13 months, he says. He says Labour wants to renationalise companies, without paying market rates of compensation. And he singles out Labour\u2019s plans to make big companies allocate up to 10% of their shares to workers in \u201cinclusive ownership funds\u201d. He says this would take \u00a3300bn from companies. That is not socking it to to the rich. That is stealing private investments. And who owns those investments? Your pension funds. And these are from Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor. These are from Torsten Bell, a former Labour adviser who is now chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, an economic thinktank, on Javid\u2019s new fiscal rules. (See 10.31am.) Javid says the Tories are \u201ctaking the government forward from a decade of recovery to a decade of renewal\u201d. He summarises some of the government spending announcements since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Public services were a lifeline for people like him when he was growing up, \u201cand we must nurture them\u201d, he says. But he says that does not mean the party believes in an \u201cever-expanding state\u201d. He says when he became chancellor there was \u00a327bn of \u201cheadroom\u201d that he could use for spending. He used half of that, he says. He says it is possible to borrow at negative interest rates. So it makes sense to borrow. He says today he is announcing new fiscal rules, so that the government can borrow, but without being irresponsible. He says his first rule will be to have a balanced current budget. He says in his first budget, in the new year, he will announce plans to level up the whole of the country. There will be more money for new schools and hospitals, and for better broadband. We will borrow some more to invest, but we know all too well what happens if debt gets out of control. He says the second rule is that the government will only borrow to invest. That means: Javid said under the Tories investment will not exceed 3% of GDP. He says the average in the past has been 1.8%, and so this is a big increase. He says his third rule is that, if debt interest starts to rise significantly, the borrowing limit will be reviewed. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is giving a speech on the economy in Manchester. He says the biggest fear that business has is a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. He says the fundamentals of the economy are strong. The IMF forecasts that next year the UK will grow faster than France, Italy, Germany and Japan, he says. Here is my Guardian colleague Owen Jones, who of course is a prominent and active Jeremy Corbyn supporter, responding to Ian Austin\u2019s announcement that he is backing Boris Johnson. In his speech later today John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, will say that Labour would spend \u00a3150bn over five years through a \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d on items such as schools, hospitals, care homes and council houses. This is in addition to Labour\u2019s plans to spend \u00a3250bn over 10 years through a green transformation fund. The Labour party press notice with details of the plan is here. And our overnight story about the plan is here. On the Today programme this morning Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said this would be an \u201cabsolutely enormous increase\u201d on what the government spends on investment. It would take the UK from near the bottom in international league tables on investment to near the top. He said the plan did raise questions about how much borrowing might have to rise, and about how it would be paid for. But he suggested that the main short-term problem might be whether or not it would be possible for government to spend so much so quickly. He explained: The real question, in the short run, is would it be possible sensibly to spend this scale of money. Moving to a world in which you\u2019re doubling [spending] within a year or two, I would suspect, is actually just physically impossible to get there that quickly. Do we really have tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of construction workers, lying idle at the moment, who would be able next week or next year or even in a couple of years to start doing this? I think the answer is almost certainly no. It obviously takes a long time to go through the planning and sorting out things. If anyone\u2019s ever had to sort out an extension to the house or something, they know that getting the building started isn\u2019t something that happens next week. If you\u2019re talking about hundreds of hospitals and windfarms or whatever else you\u2019re doing, you need to do this gradually. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, dismissed reports that around 20 of the 600-odd candidates he is fielding in the election have decided not to stand. He said he was still committed to standing candidates all over Britain, and he went on: I\u2019ve never fought an election at which at the last minute candidates didn\u2019t pull out because they realise firstly the full responsibility of doing it and secondly they are coming under a huge amount of pressure. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has joined Ian Austin in attacking Jeremy Corbyn for his record on antisemitism, tweeting this front-page editorial addressed to non-Jews from the Jewish Chronicle. All the major newspapers in the north of England are today backing the plans set out in the first Manifesto for the North. In a Guardian article, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, explains what this campaign is about. Here is an extract. The publication of the first Manifesto for the North, resulting from the recent Convention of the North, simply can\u2019t be ignored. It is a positive intervention into an otherwise highly divided political debate. It sets out the terms for a new political settlement, around which all political parties can and should unite, and upon which a badly divided nation might begin to heal in the long term. Crucially, it asks the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal HM Treasury objective, to deliver transformational investment for the north. In the past, it has been all too easy for talk of the north-south divide to be labelled \u201cnorthern whinging\u201d and relegated to the margins of national political debate. But that won\u2019t be possible this time. First, our \u201cpower up the north\u201d call, championed by our newspapers, is a positive, self-confident ask for the power to do more for ourselves, rather than just a plea for resources. Second, it is backed by heavyweight analysis from a commission led by the former head of the UK civil service, Lord Kerslake, which has found that the north-south divide in England today is as stark as the east-west divide in Germany in the early 1990s. And here is Burnham\u2019s full article. Ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to Scotland today, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has called on him to apologise for what he has done to the people of Scotland. She said: The only thing Boris Johnson should be coming to Scotland to do today is apologise for the chaos he and his party have subjected us to for years. He is a prime architect of the Brexit vote and the utter shambles it has now led to. A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit and to put Scotland\u2019s future in Scotland\u2019s hands \u2013 not Boris Johnson\u2019s. On his visit to Scotland today, Boris Johnson should apologise not just for the Brexit mess he has created, but also for a decade of Tory austerity that has caused so much misery for so many. The Jeremy Corbyn rally tonight is in Manchester, not in Scotland as it initially said in the post at 8.58am. I\u2019ve corrected that. Sorry. One other item that was meant to be on the agenda for the day (see 8.58am) was the Office for Budget Responsibility publishing revised borrowing forecasts. Here is the story my colleague Larry Elliott wrote last week about how these were expected to show the public finances in a worse state than when the forecasts were last published in March. But now the OBR has said it has cancelled plans to publish this document, because the cabinet secretary has decided it would not be compatible with election \u201cpurdah\u201d rules (which are meant to stop the civil service making announcements during the election period that could affect the result). This is from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. Here are the main election items in the diary for today. 10am: Unite for Remain holds a press conference in Westminster to announce details of the 60 seats where the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens will operate a pact, standing down in favour of the party with the best chance of winning. 10am: Sajid Javid, the chancellor, gives a speech on the economy. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech giving details of the party\u2019s plans for a \u00a3150bn social transformation fund. 1pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, campaigns in Somerset. 7.30pm: Jeremy Corbyn speaks at a rally in Manchester. And Boris Johnson is campaigning in Scotland. Rebecca Long-Bailey is now being asked about Ian Austin\u2019s declaration that he is urging voters to support Boris Johnson. The Today programme plays a clip from its earlier interview with Austin. Long-Bailey says: I\u2019m very sad. Ian did great work as an MP ... He doesn\u2019t like Jeremy, that\u2019s pretty clear. She says urging people to back Johnson is \u201cabsurd\u201d. She says she hopes that, if Jeremy Corbyn becomes PM, Austin will come round to backing him. Q: Austin says Corbyn isn\u2019t a patriot. That\u2019s wrong, says Long-Bailey. She says Corbyn is a patriot. Q: Austin says you have not done enough on antisemitism. Long-Bailey says initially the party could have responded more quickly, but a lot has changed recently. She says rules have changed and there is now auto-expulsion for these cases. Q: Are you worried that other people who support Tom Watson\u2019s position in Labour will join him in leaving? I hope not, she says. She says she does not accept that description that Watson and his supporters are \u201cmoderates\u201d. She says she would like to think everyone in the party is moderate. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is on the Today programme now. She is explaining Labour\u2019s plans for a \u00a3150bn social transformation fund. Asked whether borrowing costs would go up, Long-Bailey says it makes economic sense for governments to invest in this way. Q: But it also makes sense for government\u2019s to maintain a reputation for fiscal responsibility. Some economists think this will be impossible now given the scale of your borrowing? Long-Bailey does not accept that. She says Labour\u2019s policy would increase GDP (national wealth). Unlike the Tories, Labour believes in using the power of government to assist in this. Senior Conservatives continue to highlight Ian Austin\u2019s attack on Corbyn and endorsement of Johnson. Theo Bertram, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, sees a pattern here... Ian Austin has recorded a video for his local Express and Star on why he thinks Dudley North constituents should back Boris Johnson. Tory MPs have seized on that interview by Ian Austin and his endorsement of Boris Johnson and attack on Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson is heading for the north-eastern Scottish constituency of Moray, where Scottish Tory MP Douglas Ross unseated the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Angus Robertson in 2017, in one of the most shocking results of that election night. You can read more about the constituency here. In quotes released before the visit, Johnson hammered home his warning that Jeremy Corbyn \u201cwould spend next year dancing to the SNP\u2019s tune, wasting the year with two divisive referendums - one on the EU and one to give up on our union. Only a vote for the Conservatives will stop the SNP\u2019s plans to break up the UK.\u201d It\u2019s a message that may well resonate in Euro-sceptic Moray, home to one of the few remaining active fishing ports along the north-east coast. In 2016 this electorate delivered the narrowest margin of victory for the remain vote anywhere in the UK, falling just 112 votes short of ruining Scotland\u2019s unanimous pro-EU tally. In advance of the visit, first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon called on Johnson to apologise to the people of Scotland for Brexit and austerity. She said: \u201cOn his visit to Scotland today, Boris Johnson should apologise not just for the Brexit mess he has created, but also for a decade of Tory austerity that has caused so much misery for so many. He should also come clean on his Brexit deal and his plans for a no-deal exit in barely over a year\u2019s time if a trade deal cannot be agreed. That would be a disaster for Scotland and the rest of the UK, and it underlines the huge threat the Tories pose.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary has urged Labour to remain a \u201cpluralist party\u201d following Tom Watson\u2019s announcement that he is quitting politics. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, while Austin was interviewed on Today, Long-Bailey paid tribute to Watson\u2019s record. She said: Tom was a big figure and commanded a lot of support and respect within the party from people from all wings at the party, not just those who are supposedly on the middle of ground. But we\u2019ve always been a pluralist party. And it\u2019s important that we stay that way, that we represent views right across the centre/left spectrum. Ultimately the Labour Party was created to bring together aspects of the centre/left to make as a credible force to defeat the Conservative Party. And hopefully, that\u2019s what we\u2019re certainly going to do for the next 30 40 50 years. Long-Bailey, who is often tipped as a possible successor to Corbyn, was asked if she would be standing to become the new deputy leader. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m considering at all at the moment.\u201d Asked if she was ruling herself out from a position Labour has indicated should be held by a female MP, Long-Bailey said: It is not something that has even entered my mind at the moment at all. We\u2019ll make that decision and candidates will put themselves forward, I\u2019ve no doubt we\u2019ll have a range of really great candidates after the 12th of December because Tom will be our deputy until after the general election. Austin added: \u201cI think their [Labour\u2019s] economic policies would make our country worse off not better off. I think they would chase away investment. I think they would put businesses and jobs at risk. I think Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit policy is a completely fantasy.\u201d Austin described Tom Watson\u2019s decision to stand down from politics as \u201cenormously significant\u201d. He said: If Tom thought that Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead our country and fit to form a government, would he really be standing down?\u201d Anybody who has spoken to Tom knows what he thinks about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. More importantly, they know how appalled he is, like so many other people, by the scandal of antisemitism that has poisoned the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Austin also revealed that he would not be standing as an independent candidate in his constituency of Dudly North as he had previously indicated. Former Labour MP, Ian Austin, has called on voters to back Boris Johnson in the election saying his former party would make the country worse off. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Today programme Austin said: I\u2019m not a Tory but I wouldn\u2019t say Boris Johnson is unfit to be our prime minister in the way that I say that about Jeremy Corbyn. UPDATE: Here are more quotes from Ian Austin talking about Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson in the interview. Austin said: Look, the public has to make this choice. The British people have to decide this. Lots of traditional Labour voters are going to be grappling with this question. If they have got to face up to that, then I don\u2019t think people like me should have the luxury of running away from it. What Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour party, I don\u2019t want him to be able to do that to the country ... The country faces a big choice - there are only who can be prime minister on December 13 and that\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. And I think Jeremy Corbyn is completely unfit to lead our country and lead the Labour party. I joined the Labour party as a teenager ...so it has really come to something when I tell decent traditional patriotic Labour voters that they should be voting for Boris Johnson at this election. I can\u2019t believe it has come to this but that\u2019s where we are. University lecturers are giving students five minutes at the start of their lectures to register to vote as a nationwide campaign gets under way to ensure that students\u2019 voices are heard in the forthcoming general election. The move was condemned by some on social media as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students. Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, and is being replicated by lecturers elsewhere in the country before the 26 November deadline for registration. This is delightful and features this excellent picture of Tom Watson at Glastonbury in 2017. \u2018Watson quits\u2019: how the papers covered it Boris Johnson heads north today, travelling to Scotland for campaign events. Johnson kicked off the Conservative election campaign yesterday with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days. These include Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire lacked common sense and Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, having to resign over his knowledge of a former aide\u2019s role in allegedly sabotaging a rape trial. Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters. Good morning and welcome to the first day of the official election campaign. It has not yet been 24 hours since Boris Johnson visited the Queen, dissolved parliament, and formally announced that a general election would take place on 12 December, and already we have seen high drama. On the Labour side this came as Tom Watson announced last night that he will step down as deputy leader. Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. His departure is likely to reignite the debate about the direction of the Labour party under Corbyn after one senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January. Here he is, talking about his plans for life post-politics. Meanwhile today, Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are both set to give speeches in the north-west of England. Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, saying the Tories won\u2019t \u201clet Labour off the hook like last time\u201d. In 2017, the Conservatives\u2019 claims that Labour was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d to fund its lavish spending pledges fell flat when Theresa May\u2019s party failed to publish costings of its own policies. But Javid will signal the Tories\u2019 determination to attack Labour on the economy relentlessly over the next five weeks \u2013 although unlike two years ago, the government is touting a series of multibillion pound spending pledges of its own. Meanwhile McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d. As usual, you can get in touch with me via Twitter and email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). I\u2019ll have the reins of the blog for the first hour or so before I hand it over to my excellent colleagues. Day one, off we go.",

      "bodyText": "A majority of the UK public and almost half of Conservative voters support a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle the climate crisis, a poll suggests. YouGov found that 56% of people back the total decarbonisation of the UK economy by 2030 and just under half support public spending to make large swathes of public transport free to use. The findings appear to highlight a growing awareness of the scale of the climate crisis and the increasingly radical policy solutions the public is willing to support. Last week a separate survey found that the climate emergency would influence how most people vote, with almost two-thirds agreeing it was the biggest issue facing humankind. The new poll, commissioned by Green New Deal UK, a non-party-aligned campaign group, found that 47% of Conservative voters back a zero-emissions target by 2030, compared with just 16% who support the government\u2019s current aim of reaching that point by 2050. Labour wants the UK to hit zero carbon by 2030 as part of its Green Industrial Revolution agenda, the Green party also has a target date of 2030, and the Liberal Democrats have set a target of 2045. Aliya Yule, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, which campaigned for Labour to adopt the 2030 target, said the polling showed next month\u2019s vote was becoming the UK\u2019s first \u201cclimate election\u201d. \u201cThe figures demonstrate the huge public appetite for rapid and radical government action on climate change,\u201d he said. Yule said only Labour\u2019s Green Industrial Revolution plans \u2013 which aim to tie radical action on the environment to huge job creation and housing upgrade schemes \u2013 would address the scale of the crisis. \u201cNot even Conservative voters support the Tories\u2019 net zero 2050 target. They have no credibility on climate change, not even with their own supporters,\u201d he added. \u201cA target date of 2030 has been Green party policy for years,\u201d said a Green party spokesperson. \u201cThe fact that the majority of people now support it shows how much concern about the climate emergency is accelerating, and how little support there is for the government\u2019s policy of setting targets for mid-century and using that as an excuse to take very little action to achieve them.\u201d This week student and pensioner groups called on the leaders of all the main parties to take part in a televised leaders\u2019 debate on the climate.

I found revisiting the deathless verse of Brexit party MEP Lance Forman particularly pleasing on Thursday, as the light poured in from the window overlooking my garden which, like the rest of the nation, remained resolutely part of the European Union: \u201cOctober 31st / Is when we burst / Out of the EU\u2019s grip / No ifs.

In it, he describes Kent as \u201cexposing its fat little cock to the east\u201d, which I think is rather good.</p> <p>I myself have had a mistrust of jingoistic verse since our English teacher used Roger McGough\u2019s poem <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1967/no029/mcgough.htm\" title=\"\">Why Patriots are a Bit Nuts in the Head</a>, from the summer 1967 issue of International Socialism, as one of the counterpoints to Rupert Brooke\u2019s snivelling ethnocentricity in <a href=\"https://poetrysociety.org.uk/poems/the-soldier/\" title=\"\">The Soldier</a> (\u201cIf I should die, think only this of me: / That there\u2019s some corner of a foreign field / That is for ever England\u201d). When it comes to state-of-the-nation poetry, I find ambivalence much more appealing.</p> <p>I\u2019ve sought much consolation in poetry recently. It can illuminate where political commentary sometimes falls short. It examines with precision while screaming tabloid headlines cite unnamed sources without question. It aids empathy, and distils emotions in ways that vividly encapsulate a moment in time.</p> <p>When I read Vidyan Ravinthiran\u2019s TS Eliot prize-shortlisted The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here, a book of sonnets for his wife, I gain a glimpse of the life of a mixed-race couple living in the north, and how it must have felt on that day in 2016, standing at Durham station. \u201cWe glance from face to face / guess how each voted,\u201d he writes, in the poem Brexit, before saying that, \u201cIt seems to me my Facebook friends down south are mad / at finding themselves, all of a sudden, a minority / in their own country\u201d. The morning after the referendum, I awoke to the sound of a woman hollering, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken our country back!\u201d That evening, the poet Anthony Anaxagorou was in an Uber, though there is nothing in his poem of the same title \u2013 from the collection After the Formalities \u2013 itself to suggest the day, we learn it in a footnote. He writes: \u201cto our right / a van pulls up / two men / motion / to lower / windows / in rain / he does / we do / go home / home / go home / laughing / up / a storm / front\u201d. In a 2017 special issue of Poem, edited by Fiona Sampson, Mona Arshi and Aisha Gill, collecting women\u2019s responses to Brexit, I read in One of Every Two how Nazneen Ahmed felt: \u201cI step onto the bus more warily today. I keep my head down. I feel my heart beating double time in my chest.\u201d</p> <p>Poetry sales have been booming of late, aided by new audiences offered up by the internet and its shareability through social media platforms. Small presses are flourishing, spoken-word poetry can go viral. The uncertain times in which we live must surely also be a factor in poetry\u2019s newfound popularity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/05/migrant-child-turn-pain-into-poetry-teacher-kate-clanchy\">Teacher who helps migrant children turn pain into prize poetry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Midlands-based poet Jane Commane\u2019s collection, Assembly Lines, tells of life in the post-industrial towns of the Midlands, those so-called left-behind communities. Her poem <a href=\"https://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/assembly-lines-1166\" title=\"\">UnWeather</a> is a response to the referendum result, about language and its origins, how it pilfers and overlaps, \u201cmackled together with flints and flaps\u201d. \u201cEach leaf of English borrowed from / a starry European library of tongues, / library card now revoked,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>\u201cPoetry seemed the only way to explore and comprehend the complexity of Brexit and the referendum result \u2013 but also to process some of the emotions around it \u2013 fear, anger, grief,\u201d Commane tells me. \u201cPoetry is a way of working things out and, because it can contain the kind of contradictions and multiplicities that our more oppositional political and social discourses often can\u2019t, with their binary choices of yes/no, for/against, leave/remain, it\u2019s also space in which language helps us to find a form of truth for ourselves; a way of naming and containing what often feels uncontainable or incomprehensible.\u201d</p> <p>The Brexit debate is one in which we are again and again presented with apparently simple narratives, easy answers to a complex problem. Yet poetry offers no such easy answers, and perhaps slightly paradoxically, that\u2019s why it can be comforting. As Commane suggests, it\u2019s a way of processing, even if we never come to a clear conclusion. In a polemical climate, this is especially appealing.</p> <p>Of course, there is pleasure and catharsis to be found in defiantly political poetry, too, such as <a href=\"https://www.lukewright.co.uk/the-panel-edit/\" title=\"\">Luke Wright\u2019s The Panel</a>, a blistering diatribe written in 2014 that foreshadows Brexit with furious accuracy, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJX5XHnONTI\" title=\"\">Hollie McNish\u2019s Mathematics</a>. Spoken-word poetry lends itself well to politics, and the anger of it can be cathartic. Indeed, a mass sort of catharsis took place at Glastonbury in 2017, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRULtXn6W0s\" title=\"\">Kate Tempest performed People\u2019s Faces</a> and audience members were moved to tears. \u201cWas that a pivotal historical moment we just went stumbling past? / Well, here we are, dancing in the rumbling dark,\u201d says Tempest. But there is hope there: \u201cI can feel things changing / Even when I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m breaking\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s nearly three and a half years since the referendum on leaving the EU. In that time there has been so much poetry written as a real-time response to breaking news \u2013 the <a href=\"https://newbootsandpantisocracies.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">website</a> New Boots and Pantisocracies and <a href=\"https://asburyandasbury.com/realtime-notes\" title=\"\">Nick Asbury\u2019s Realtime Notes</a> being just two examples of this poem-a-day method. From <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-new-european/20190919/282376926289856\" title=\"\">The Brexit Book of the Dead</a> by Rishi Dastidar to Over Seas, by Ed Lvker, and Great again, our island nation, by <a href=\"http://www.marthasprackland.co.uk/poetry/index.php\" title=\"\">Martha Sprackland</a>, Brexit has seen responses by poets from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life, from all over the country and beyond. In her poem, Sprackland writes that \u201cthe pound slumps like a drunk. I\u2019m scared of division, scared of men\u201d. I\u2019ve felt that fear, many of us have, but poetry can be a kind of antidote.</p> <p>\u201cThe country\u2019s / lonely with itself and howls / for something, like a dog gone old / in the head,\u201d writes <a href=\"https://londongrip.co.uk/2019/10/london-grip-poetry-review-david-clarke/\" title=\"\">David Clarke</a> in The Vision of Albion.

I myself have had a mistrust of jingoistic verse since our English teacher used Roger McGough\u2019s poem Why Patriots are a Bit Nuts in the Head, from the summer 1967 issue of International Socialism, as one of the counterpoints to Rupert Brooke\u2019s snivelling ethnocentricity in The Soldier (\u201cIf I should die, think only this of me: / That there\u2019s some corner of a foreign field / That is for ever England\u201d). When it comes to state-of-the-nation poetry, I find ambivalence much more appealing. I\u2019ve sought much consolation in poetry recently. It can illuminate where political commentary sometimes falls short. It examines with precision while screaming tabloid headlines cite unnamed sources without question. It aids empathy, and distils emotions in ways that vividly encapsulate a moment in time. When I read Vidyan Ravinthiran\u2019s TS Eliot prize-shortlisted The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here, a book of sonnets for his wife, I gain a glimpse of the life of a mixed-race couple living in the north, and how it must have felt on that day in 2016, standing at Durham station. \u201cWe glance from face to face / guess how each voted,\u201d he writes, in the poem Brexit, before saying that, \u201cIt seems to me my Facebook friends down south are mad / at finding themselves, all of a sudden, a minority / in their own country\u201d. The morning after the referendum, I awoke to the sound of a woman hollering, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken our country back!\u201d That evening, the poet Anthony Anaxagorou was in an Uber, though there is nothing in his poem of the same title \u2013 from the collection After the Formalities \u2013 itself to suggest the day, we learn it in a footnote. He writes: \u201cto our right / a van pulls up / two men / motion / to lower / windows / in rain / he does / we do / go home / home / go home / laughing / up / a storm / front\u201d. In a 2017 special issue of Poem, edited by Fiona Sampson, Mona Arshi and Aisha Gill, collecting women\u2019s responses to Brexit, I read in One of Every Two how Nazneen Ahmed felt: \u201cI step onto the bus more warily today. I keep my head down. I feel my heart beating double time in my chest.\u201d Poetry sales have been booming of late, aided by new audiences offered up by the internet and its shareability through social media platforms. Small presses are flourishing, spoken-word poetry can go viral. The uncertain times in which we live must surely also be a factor in poetry\u2019s newfound popularity. The Midlands-based poet Jane Commane\u2019s collection, Assembly Lines, tells of life in the post-industrial towns of the Midlands, those so-called left-behind communities. Her poem UnWeather is a response to the referendum result, about language and its origins, how it pilfers and overlaps, \u201cmackled together with flints and flaps\u201d. \u201cEach leaf of English borrowed from / a starry European library of tongues, / library card now revoked,\u201d she writes. \u201cPoetry seemed the only way to explore and comprehend the complexity of Brexit and the referendum result \u2013 but also to process some of the emotions around it \u2013 fear, anger, grief,\u201d Commane tells me. \u201cPoetry is a way of working things out and, because it can contain the kind of contradictions and multiplicities that our more oppositional political and social discourses often can\u2019t, with their binary choices of yes/no, for/against, leave/remain, it\u2019s also space in which language helps us to find a form of truth for ourselves; a way of naming and containing what often feels uncontainable or incomprehensible.\u201d The Brexit debate is one in which we are again and again presented with apparently simple narratives, easy answers to a complex problem. Yet poetry offers no such easy answers, and perhaps slightly paradoxically, that\u2019s why it can be comforting. As Commane suggests, it\u2019s a way of processing, even if we never come to a clear conclusion. In a polemical climate, this is especially appealing. Of course, there is pleasure and catharsis to be found in defiantly political poetry, too, such as Luke Wright\u2019s The Panel, a blistering diatribe written in 2014 that foreshadows Brexit with furious accuracy, or Hollie McNish\u2019s Mathematics. Spoken-word poetry lends itself well to politics, and the anger of it can be cathartic. Indeed, a mass sort of catharsis took place at Glastonbury in 2017, when Kate Tempest performed People\u2019s Faces and audience members were moved to tears. \u201cWas that a pivotal historical moment we just went stumbling past? / Well, here we are, dancing in the rumbling dark,\u201d says Tempest. But there is hope there: \u201cI can feel things changing / Even when I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m breaking\u201d. It\u2019s nearly three and a half years since the referendum on leaving the EU. In that time there has been so much poetry written as a real-time response to breaking news \u2013 the website New Boots and Pantisocracies and Nick Asbury\u2019s Realtime Notes being just two examples of this poem-a-day method. From The Brexit Book of the Dead by Rishi Dastidar to Over Seas, by Ed Lvker, and Great again, our island nation, by Martha Sprackland, Brexit has seen responses by poets from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life, from all over the country and beyond. In her poem, Sprackland writes that \u201cthe pound slumps like a drunk. I\u2019m scared of division, scared of men\u201d. I\u2019ve felt that fear, many of us have, but poetry can be a kind of antidote. \u201cThe country\u2019s / lonely with itself and howls / for something, like a dog gone old / in the head,\u201d writes David Clarke in The Vision of Albion. Poetry is not the solution to that howl, but it helps. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 because an earlier version credited only one of the three editors of a 2017 special issue of Poem.

This is often because of the influence that newspapers with relatively small print circulations have on the BBC, with the national broadcaster\u2019s coverage often following talking points set by the front pages.</p> <p>At the same time British online news consumption has realigned itself around a small handful of well visited news websites and apps. Far out in front is BBC News Online, which reaches around half the population every week while striving for an impartial format that often repeats claims in \u201cquote format\u201d. Second place goes to MailOnline, a key target for politicians trying to reach general audiences and one that has increasingly run anti-Labour headlines. The Guardian is in third place, according to <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-06/DNR_2019_FINAL_0.pdf\">surveys by the Reuters Institute</a>.</p> <p>Many other news sites are left scrabbling for readers, making them easier for campaigns to ignore. Political articles at the online version of established newspapers can attract only a few thousand readers \u2013 unless they have a sufficiently inflammatory headline that makes them go viral or are picked up by aggregator sites.</p> <h2><strong>Passive media consumption</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2bb41200417ed7c6cbb33e30e4c8d6a8dc652cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2bb41200417ed7c6cbb33e30e4c8d6a8dc652cd/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon has a selfie taken with supporters on the election campaign trail in Alloa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon has a selfie taken with supporters on the election campaign trail in Alloa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The challenge for politicians is that much online news consumption is passive \u2013 driven by an activist sharing an article on Twitter, a celebrity uploading something to Instagram, or a story being posted in a neighbourhood Facebook group. Recent research <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/24/bbc-at-risk-of-losing-young-audiences-according-to-ofcom\">carried out for Ofcom</a> found the public increasingly consume their news by scanning dozens of headlines on smartphones through social media feeds, rarely clicking on links, and only occasionally reading and watching articles or videos to the end.</p> <p>This passive way of obtaining information means the instant emotional impact of an amusing meme or a shocking headline is likely to spread far wider and faster than any policy-heavy political speech \u2013 which helps explains the potency of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/sit-up-jacob-rees-mogg-under-fire-for-slouching-in-commons\">an image of Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on a bench in the House of Commons</a>.</p> <p>This is harder for centralised political media units to control, forcing a change in how they operate. One serving Labour political adviser pointed out that just as the editorial whims of the Sun could dictate the political policy of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, so the whims of Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithm inevitably shapes some of the policies chosen by Corbyn\u2019s Labour.</p> <h2><strong>New forms of social media</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f41435f24665dfcfab61243842e93ab9ad2436d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f41435f24665dfcfab61243842e93ab9ad2436d/67_0_1730_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson talks directly to the electorate through a live Facebook feed which he calls the People\u2019s PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson talks directly to the electorate through a live Facebook feed which he calls the People\u2019s PMQs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the last UK election there has been a massive uptick in the use of WhatsApp groups as a news source.

In the same period many pro-Brexit campaign groups have built up substantial audiences on Facebook. The site is increasingly seen by campaign groups as a way of reaching older, less-engaged voters, with younger voters more likely to use Instagram.</p> <p>At the same time the new Johnson-led government has hired a series of 20-something advisers with intimate knowledge of right-wing blogs and experience of making messages go viral in a world where the battle is to grab attention at all costs.

Parties also have to accept that almost all of that will be happening completely outside their control, and it adds a huge degree of unpredictability to the online battle.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 to remove a reference to Sean Topham and Ben Guerin.</p>",

According to political advisers, declining print newspaper circulations, falling audiences for broadcast television bulletins, and a febrile online environment may lead to a focus on divisive \u201cculture war\u201d issues forcing the public to pick a side.

This format requires news stories to be summed up in two- or three-sentence snippets for people who may not be consuming much other news \u2013 removing nuance and rewarding parties with clear, sharp messages. Radio and television stations are subject to strict broadcasting impartiality rules during the election, which Labour believe helped them enormously during the last general election by restricting the ability of the Conservatives to set the agenda.

Far out in front is BBC News Online, which reaches around half the population every week while striving for an impartial format that often repeats claims in \u201cquote format\u201d. Second place goes to MailOnline, a key target for politicians trying to reach general audiences and one that has increasingly run anti-Labour headlines. The Guardian is in third place, according to surveys by the Reuters Institute. Many other news sites are left scrabbling for readers, making them easier for campaigns to ignore. Political articles at the online version of established newspapers can attract only a few thousand readers \u2013 unless they have a sufficiently inflammatory headline that makes them go viral or are picked up by aggregator sites. Passive media consumption The challenge for politicians is that much online news consumption is passive \u2013 driven by an activist sharing an article on Twitter, a celebrity uploading something to Instagram, or a story being posted in a neighbourhood Facebook group. Recent research carried out for Ofcom found the public increasingly consume their news by scanning dozens of headlines on smartphones through social media feeds, rarely clicking on links, and only occasionally reading and watching articles or videos to the end. This passive way of obtaining information means the instant emotional impact of an amusing meme or a shocking headline is likely to spread far wider and faster than any policy-heavy political speech \u2013 which helps explains the potency of an image of Jacob Rees-Mogg reclining on a bench in the House of Commons. This is harder for centralised political media units to control, forcing a change in how they operate. One serving Labour political adviser pointed out that just as the editorial whims of the Sun could dictate the political policy of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, so the whims of Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithm inevitably shapes some of the policies chosen by Corbyn\u2019s Labour. New forms of social media Since the last UK election there has been a massive uptick in the use of WhatsApp groups as a news source. This form of communication is hard for political parties to influence directly, while also allowing disinformation to flourish. Viral news sites The online playing field has also been levelled since 2017. During that snap election a raft of pro-Corbyn websites such as the Canary and Another Angry Voice dominated online debate but they have seen their audiences reduced by changes to Facebook\u2019s algorithm. In the same period many pro-Brexit campaign groups have built up substantial audiences on Facebook. The site is increasingly seen by campaign groups as a way of reaching older, less-engaged voters, with younger voters more likely to use Instagram. At the same time the new Johnson-led government has hired a series of 20-something advisers with intimate knowledge of right-wing blogs and experience of making messages go viral in a world where the battle is to grab attention at all costs. The Times claimed that Downing Street had polled views on issues such as transgender rights \u201cto see whether they can be weaponised against Labour in northern working-class constituencies\u201d. Online political advertising The other, completely distinct, strand of online campaigning is the promotion of paid-for political ads \u2013 largely the preserve of Facebook and Instagram\u2019s combined advertising platform, which attracted \u00a33m of spending in the last election. Tory HQ election planning has been left to Isaac Levido, a protege of long-term Tory adviser Sir Lynton Crosby, who insiders say has inherited a rusty campaign operation from the May era. Levido recently helped to run the successful election campaign for the right-wing coalition in Australia, aided by a relentless focus on message discipline and fake claims about tax rises spread widely on Facebook. Sam Jeffers of transparency group WhoTargetsMe, who is encouraging people to sign up to his service and help his outfit track political Facebook adverts, said the best approach for political parties \u201cis not micro-targeting \u2013 it\u2019s effective messaging, well optimised and repeated ad infinitum\u201d. When Facebook finally released data on Vote Leave\u2019s controversial 2016 campaign it showed that rather than running tens of thousands of micro-targeted adverts as speculated, the successful pro-Brexit campaign spent millions of pounds to promote a relatively small number of core messages on immigration and NHS funding. Craig Elder, who helped pioneer Facebook ad campaigns for the Conservatives in the 2015 general election, said: \u201cIt\u2019s never quite as sophisticated as people think it is. It comes down to the principles of good old-fashioned advertising. When we start to get into the idea of \u2018shadowy mind control with a million data points\u2019 we\u2019re either talking an aspiration or unbelievable bollocks.\u201d He said that Facebook had cracked down on parties using external data sources since the 2017 general election. Instead, the real question was how much parties were willing to commit to online advertising, with hard cash often being the main difference in terms of audience reach. \u201cIt\u2019s more sexy to write about astrophysics and micro-targeting,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s not much more sophisticated than a Colgate ad \u2013 you need a really great message that connects with people and you need to pay to get it in front of as many people as you can.\u201d However, he insisted no advertising can counteract widespread negative coverage: \u201cIf a major figure from outside politics \u2013 a Stormzy, for example \u2013 is using their huge online reach to speak with an authentic voice and mobilise their followers against you, then that can be worth as much or more than great ads, good targeting and a really big budget. Parties also have to accept that almost all of that will be happening completely outside their control, and it adds a huge degree of unpredictability to the online battle.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2019 to remove a reference to Sean Topham and Ben Guerin.",

Watson \u2013 who has spent 35 years in full-time politics, and has represented West Bromwich East as its MP since 2001 \u2013 has repeatedly clashed with Corbyn, including over the Labour leader\u2019s Brexit stance and handling of antisemitism. One senior Labour figure said Watson\u2019s announcement had led to \u201ca great sense of desolation and abandonment sweeping the moderates\u201d in the party. Watson insisted his resignation was \u201cpersonal, not political\u201d and said he would \u201cspend this election fighting for brilliant Labour candidates and a better future for our country\u201d. Corbyn thanked Watson, saying: \u201cFew people have given as much to the Labour movement as you have.\u201d For his part Watson says he has a lot of irons in the fire, including training to become a gym instructor and a book about weight loss coming out in January.</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>has kicked off the Conservative election campaign with a speech in Birmingham that he hopes will give his party some positive momentum after a series of damaging gaffes in recent days.

Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"630912eb19b108c073f3c65f687a810b774eb226\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/630912eb19b108c073f3c65f687a810b774eb226/0_228_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks at the Conservative party election launch in Birmingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaks at the Conservative party election launch in Birmingham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>At a glance</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/lib-dems-plaid-cymru-and-greens-launch-pro-remain-electoral-pact\">have agreed to a plan</a> to step aside for each other in 60 seats in England and Wales, to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency.</p></li> \n <li><p>The Liberal Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/lib-dems-accused-over-misleading-and-irresponsible-leaflets\">defended themselves against accusations</a> they are distributing \u201cmisleading and irresponsible\u201d election leaflets that misrepresent newspaper reports, including a quote from leader Jo Swinson in the Guardian, as endorsements of the party.</p></li> \n <li><p>Experts have hit out at the government for refusing to publish a report into Russian infiltration of British politics, saying Downing Street is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/no-10-accused-of-ignoring-evidence-of-russian-interference\">ignoring evidence of Russian interference</a> in the Brexit referendum.</p></li> \n <li><p>Tom Watson has been lauded as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-an-mp-at-the-heart-of-labours-key-battles\">\u201cimmovable force of Labour politics\u201d</a> \u2013 see his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-career-in-pictures\">career in pictures here</a>.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>The day ahead</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/sajid-javid-and-john-mcdonnell-shift-battle-to-economy\">both set to give speeches in the north-west of England</a> this morning.</p></li> \n <li><p>Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, while McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d.</p></li> \n <li><p>At 10am the Scottish Liberal Democrats will launch their election campaign.</p></li> \n <li><p>Boris Johnson is on a whirlwind trip around the north-east, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p></li> \n <li><p>Jeremy Corbyn will speak at a rally in Manchester at 7.30pm.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Best of the rest</h2> \n<p>&gt; In the Trump-Ukraine scandal: the US president demanded his Kyiv counterpart \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/06/trump-impeachment-inquiry-ukraine-testimony-bill-taylor\">opening investigations of Biden</a> and 2016 election interference\u201d, a top diplomat has testified.</p> \n<p>&gt; Two ex-Twitter employees have been charged with spying for allegedly obtaining <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/06/twitter-spy-saudi-arabia-workers-charged\">account details of critics of the Saudi regime</a>.

Johnson came out swinging at Corbyn, whom he accused of planning tax rises to fund \u201cderanged\u201d nationalism; at parliament, which he said was \u201cparalysed, blocked, generally incapable of digestive function, as an anaconda that has swallowed a tapir\u201d; and without naming him, at Nigel Farage, as the Brexit party leader has refused requests from pro-leave Tories to stand down Brexit party candidates in their seats. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the barricades,\u201d Johnson told supporters. At a glance Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have agreed to a plan to step aside for each other in 60 seats in England and Wales, to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency. The Liberal Democrats have defended themselves against accusations they are distributing \u201cmisleading and irresponsible\u201d election leaflets that misrepresent newspaper reports, including a quote from leader Jo Swinson in the Guardian, as endorsements of the party. Experts have hit out at the government for refusing to publish a report into Russian infiltration of British politics, saying Downing Street is ignoring evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit referendum. Tom Watson has been lauded as an \u201cimmovable force of Labour politics\u201d \u2013 see his career in pictures here. The day ahead Sajid Javid and his Labour shadow, John McDonnell, are both set to give speeches in the north-west of England this morning. Javid is expected to hammer Labour on the economy, while McDonnell will announce a \u00a3100bn \u201csocial transformation fund\u201d to \u201crepair the fabric that the Tories have torn apart\u201d. At 10am the Scottish Liberal Democrats will launch their election campaign. Boris Johnson is on a whirlwind trip around the north-east, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn will speak at a rally in Manchester at 7.30pm. Best of the rest &gt; In the Trump-Ukraine scandal: the US president demanded his Kyiv counterpart \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference\u201d, a top diplomat has testified. &gt; Two ex-Twitter employees have been charged with spying for allegedly obtaining account details of critics of the Saudi regime. The FBI says targets included Omar Abdulaziz, a peer of Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist killed by the Saudi government. &gt; John Lewis says its trucks will run on carbon-neutral cow manure methane by 2021. Heineken is ditching plastic \u201ctoppers\u201d on multipacks of beer and replacing them with cardboard. \u201cClimate strike\u201d is the Collins Dictionary\u2019s word of the year. Today in Focus podcast: Online dirty tricks of the election The Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, tells Anushka Asthana how political parties are pushing the limits of what is allowed in the unregulated space of social media. Plus: Sabine Rennefanz on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lunchtime read: Who is the real Dice Man? A search for the mysterious author of a counterculture classic led to someone else entirely. Or did it? Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re on the hunt for the elusive writer behind a disturbing cult novel. Sport Manchester City held on for a 1-1 draw against Atalanta after an injury to Ederson and a red card to substitute goalkeeper Claudio Bravo forced defender Kyle Walker to go in goal for the final 10 minutes at the San Siro. Elsewhere in the Champions League, two goals from Son Heung-min and one each from Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen gave Tottenham a comfortable 4-0 victory at Red Star Belgrade, but Arsenal were pegged back in their Europa League clash with Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es following Bruno Duarte\u2019s stoppage-time scissor-kick. Saracens face a \u00a350,000 fine after failing to turn up for the launch of the European Champions Cup in Cardiff where, as holders, they would have had prime billing. England are likely to recall Jonny Bairstow and Chris Jordan to help them save the T20 series against New Zealand in Napier but Tom Banton and Matt Parkinson are set for another chance. Racing\u2019s ruling body is mulling over plans to tighten up its regulation of syndicates, a hot topic in the wake of the drama around the Irish-based Supreme Horse Racing Club, which is unable to run its horses. Nicola Adams, the Yorkshire boxer who has announced her retirement, forged her star quality with a mix of ruthlessness in the ring and kindness and optimism outside it. And Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Man\u00e9 has acknowledged Pep Guardiola\u2019s claim that his diving means the spotlight will be on him against Manchester City on Sunday but admitted he would \u201cdive again\u201d if it resulted in a penalty being awarded. Business After Marks &amp; Spencer reported a slump in clothing sales, our City commentator, Nils Pratley, casts a sceptical eye over the numbers and warns that its chief executive, Steve Rowe, is running out of time to fix the deep-seated problems in the retailer\u2019s fashion offer. On the markets, activity in Asia was subdued overnight as investors awaited more details on a possible US-China trade deal (we\u2019ve heard that one before though). That means the FTSE100 is set to open fairly flat while the pound is on $1.285 and \u20ac1.161. The papers The departure of Labour\u2019s un-Corbynite deputy leader is the splash on the front page of the Guardian, which says the resignation takes place as \u201cCorbyn strengthens grip\u201d over the party ahead of the election. The story also leads the Telegraph \u2013 \u201cWatson quits Commons\u201d \u2013 which says Corbyn\u2019s campaign is at risk of \u201csliding into chaos\u201d if other moderate MPs follow. The Times goes very literal: \u201cWatson quits as deputy leader of Labour party\u201d, and cites his clashes with Corbyn as well as the \u201cVIP sex case fiasco\u201d surrounding the lies of Carl Beech. The i says Labour has been left \u201cstunned as Watson quits\u201d. The Mail calls it all an \u201celection calamity\u201d for Corbyn and says: \u201cThree years of infighting has left Mr Watson isolated as Labour\u2019s last senior moderate.\u201d The Mirror puts \u201cWatson quit shock\u201d in a skybox but its lead story takes a positive line on Labour\u2019s election campaign: \u201cPower to the north\u201d as the shadow treasurer, John McDonnell, pledged to \u201cpump $150bn\u201d into the regions. The FT has \u201cLabour\u2019s vow to take borrowing to \u00a3400bn fires spending battle\u201d. The Express leads with Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign launch entreaty to \u201cCome with us or get horror show\u201d. The line feels dated \u2013 wasn\u2019t Halloween, like, a week ago? Lastly we have the Sun with \u201cKnifemen 0, Gunners 1\u201d with a video still of Arsenal footballer Sead Kola\u0161inac seeing off scooter thugs who were trying to rob him and Mesut \u00d6zil.
