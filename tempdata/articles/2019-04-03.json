The meeting is said to have been \u201cconstructive\u201d and further talks are planned.</li> <li>Shadow foreign secretary <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong> wrote a letter to the shadow cabinet ahead of an emergency meeting tonight, telling cabinet members that \u201cnot to insist\u201d on a second referendum would constitute a \u201cbreach\u201d of Labour\u2019s commitments made at the party conference. <br></li> <li><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> meanwhile has said that he had raised the \u201coption\u201d of a confirmatory referendum during his meeting with the PM, which some pundits have interpreted as a potential disagreement between the Labour leader and his frontbench.<br></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s all from me, goodnight.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T23:24:45.403Z\">at 12.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ca53d3e8f08b611124af721\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T23:11:03.400Z\">12.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Leave.EU</strong> campaign seems to be rather cross: <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LeaveEUOfficial/status/1113578552014843909\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The &quot;Conservatives&quot; who voted to block Brexit this evening.<br><br>Are you a Conservative member in one of these constituencies?

I think it was on an amendment relating to the social chapter, and it was an amendment in the name of the then leader of the opposition [John Smith] and Speaker Boothroyd cast her vote in the way that she did, against that amendment.

The use of this power is governed by a long-standing principle aimed at maintaining the Speaker\u2019s impartiality, namely that they should not vote against the overall majority. The Speaker should vote in favour of allowing further discussion and avoid making final decisions by a casting vote. In practice, this means that a tie at second reading should be resolved by the Speaker voting for the bill \u2013 on the basis that there will then be opportunity for further discussion. At third reading they would vote against, on the basis that the law should not be changed except with the will of the entire House.</p> <p>This power was used seven times between 1974 and 1979. It was almost needed when the Callaghan government was defeated on a vote of confidence of 311 versus 310. It was most recently exercised on 22 July 1993 during the parliamentary vote on the Maastricht Treaty, when votes were tied on 317. The then Speaker Betty Boothroyd voted against the leader of the opposition\u2019s amendment on the basis that the decision should only be taken by a majority. But the government lost the vote on the motion itself.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T16:29:57.262Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ca4de448f085a877dffaaf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T16:24:59.792Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From Labour\u2019s <strong>Angela Eagle</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/angelaeagle/status/1113477208511864834\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prob with first vote - must be VERY close Perhaps a tie?

After 12 April, we risk jeopardising the European parliament elections, and so threaten the functioning of the European Union.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the EU was ready to start talks on the future relationship as soon as the withdrawal agreement is agreed.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the EU side, we stand ready to launch the talks and negotiations on the future partnership as soon as the withdrawal agreement is signed.

In his speech Juncker referred to these measures, but he said they would not stop the UK being affected. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The measures we and the member states have taken will mitigate the worst impact of a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario. The protection offered is real. The measures will make sure that EU and UK citizens can continue to live and work where they are at the moment. They make sure that planes can take off and land. We have adapted our financial instrument to make it possible to help fishing communities. We have identified the ways in which law enforcement cooperation can continue. We have taken steps to mitigate disruption on our financial markets.</p> <p>The measures we have taken are time-limited and unilateral. They provide a cushion for key EU interests at least until the end of the year. But disruption will be inevitable for citizens, for businesses and for almost every sector.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60d4150c32871e796cd466692d1f9a72ff325f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60d4150c32871e796cd466692d1f9a72ff325f64/0_95_5198_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, speaking in the European parliament earlier today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, speaking in the European parliament earlier today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca4b4568f085a877dffa86c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T13:26:41.780Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street says the government will be not be supporting the Yvette Cooper bill, my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart </strong>reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1113429624506257408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing Street spox says government has no plans to support the Cooper-Boles bill. &quot;We don\u2019t believe that that is the right way forward,&quot; he says - because it sets a damaging constitutional precedent.</p>&mdash; Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1113429624506257408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca4b1848f085a877dffa857\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T13:23:53.353Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Juncker says UK will face either no-deal or long extension if deal not passed by next Friday</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These are from RTE\u2019s<strong> Tony Connelly.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jean-Claude Juncker,</strong> the European commission, president is confirming that next Friday has become a hard deadline for the EU.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Juncker says MPs must be able to approve the withdrawal agreement by next Friday, or the UK will face either no-deal or a long Brexit delay. </strong>This quashes the very faint prospect that the EU might have agreed another short extension to allow time for the deal to pass parliament.

After a brief and rather gracious statement welcoming her invitation for Brexit talks, Jeremy Corbyn took us into this parallel universe for about 15 minutes or so by devoting all his questions to economy/welfare issues. \u201cParallel universe\u201d is not quite right though, because it\u2019s the real world he was describing - Britain in 2019 - and his questions sounded like a reliable canter through what would be the main issues in a (Brexit-free) election campaign. Theresa May seemed happy to engage with Corbyn on this territory, although his talking points were more compelling than hers. But it all felt like a huge distraction from the crisis engulfing the government, and the country, and May came under much more pressure from her own MPs than she did from Corbyn. By my count, seven Tory Brexiters (Davis Amess, David Jones, Lee Rowley, Julian Lewis, Caroline Johnson, Christopher Chope and Nigel Evans) taunted her with varying degrees of anger over her decision last night to embrace Labour in the hope of getting a Brexit deal through parliament. They weren\u2019t calling for her to quit, because she has promised that already, but nevertheless from that wing of the party all respect for her has now vanished. The best question came from Evans, who tried, and failed, to get an assurance from her that the UK would not fight European elections.

However, by legitimising and turning to Jeremy Corbyn to assist you at this crucial stage, rather than being bold, is a grave error. It is clear that we will now end up in the customs union. That is not the Brexit my constituents were promised, and it is contrary to the pledge we made in our manifesto. </p> <p>It makes no sense to leave the EU and to have a situation where our trade policy and much of our law is made in Brussels - with no say for the UK. </p> <p>I and many others agreed with your previous position that no deal is better than a bad deal. </p> <p>It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal - cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life, put British interests first - is better than no deal. </p> <p>I profoundly disagree with this approach and I have therefore decided that I must reluctantly tender my resignation. </p> <p>It has been a privilege to serve as a minister in the government whips Office, at the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and latterly at the Wales Office and I will always be grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve the people of the UK in your government. </p> <p>I am passionate about my constituency and have always strived to do my best for the people of Selby and Ainsty since 2010. 1 will continue to serve them diligently from the back benches. </p> <p>Yours sincerely, </p> <p>Nigel Adams</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca47ab7e4b0347f70e78aac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T09:20:41.399Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May will also be meeting Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Sky is reporting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1113369492514648064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing Street has confirmed Prime Minister Theresa May will meet Scotland&#39;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today</p>&mdash; Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1113369492514648064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca4797ee4b08334583671dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T09:19:19.957Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the Brexit committee Labour\u2019s <strong>Stephen Timms </strong>is asking the questions now.</p> <p><em>Q: Would the EU have to agree any changes to the political declaration before MPs could vote for it?</em></p> <p>Barclays says the EU has said it could respond quickly to any proposed changes.</p> <p><em>Q: If the UK wanted an extension lasting beyond 22 May, which would involve the UK taking part in the European elections, when would it have to decide?</em></p> <p>Barclay says that is not what the UK wants.</p> <p>But if it were to decide on that, it would have to put in a request to the EU before the summit on 10 April.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca47940e4b0347f70e78aa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T09:14:06.717Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from Sky\u2019s<strong> Sophia McBride.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sophiacmcbride/status/1113368021232386049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW: Irish Deputy PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simoncoveney?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@simoncoveney</a> says Ireland WILL support UK request for a short extension <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a></p>&mdash; Sophia McBride (@sophiacmcbride) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiacmcbride/status/1113368021232386049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca4789ee4b0b4d18bde5396\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-03T09:12:26.120Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is another item for the agenda today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/socbxl/status/1113363631264215040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AndrewSparrow</a> .<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierremoscovici?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pierremoscovici</a> will give a press conference at around 12.30 Brussels time on preparedness for a no-deal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a> in the area of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/customs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#customs</a>.

For months, where at all possible, she avoided taking sides. But last night, in her statement after the day-long cabinet meeting (full text <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-brexit-2-april-2019\">here)</a>, she decisively came off the fence.

He also said the idea of having a second referendum would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the government to accept.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that. if the May/Corbyn talks did not lead to a compromise deal, MPs could be asked to take part in more indicative votes on the way ahead.</strong> But the new votes might be binding, he said.</li> </ul> <p>We are going to hear more from Barclay in a moment because he is giving evidence to the Brexit committee.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.15am:</em> Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee.</p> <p><em>9.45am: </em>Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to a Lords committee about a no-deal Brexit. </p> <p><em>10am:</em> The People\u2019s Vote campaign holds a press conference.<br></p> <p><em>12pm: </em>Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>After 1pm:</em> MPs debate the business motion setting aside today for the debate on Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill requiring the PM to request an article 50 extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m going to wrap up now. Here the latest key developments at a glance: A bill tabled by Labour MP Yvette Copper has been passed dramatically by a majority of one in the House of Commons. If approved by the Lords, it will enshrine in law that Theresa May has to ask EU leaders for a long extension if she fails to get her deal through parliament by April 12, which would rule out a no-deal Brexit - provided Brussels approves a longer extension of Article 50. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn met earlier to discuss a possible compromise on the withdrawal agreement. The meeting is said to have been \u201cconstructive\u201d and further talks are planned. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wrote a letter to the shadow cabinet ahead of an emergency meeting tonight, telling cabinet members that \u201cnot to insist\u201d on a second referendum would constitute a \u201cbreach\u201d of Labour\u2019s commitments made at the party conference. Jeremy Corbyn meanwhile has said that he had raised the \u201coption\u201d of a confirmatory referendum during his meeting with the PM, which some pundits have interpreted as a potential disagreement between the Labour leader and his frontbench. That\u2019s all from me, goodnight. The Leave.EU campaign seems to be rather cross: Irish premier Leo Varadkar will hold Brexit talks with German leader Angela Merkel in Dublin on Thursday, the Press Association reports. The Taoiseach will host Ms Merkel at Farmleigh House in the capital where their discussions are set to focus on the latest developments ahead of the special European Council meeting next week. Prior to their formal sit-down the leaders will take part in round-table discussions with people from Northern Ireland and the border area about their views on the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. It comes as efforts intensify to find a way through the Brexit impasse. [...] On Tuesday Mr Varadkar held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Ahead of Ms Merkel\u2019s visit, an Irish government spokesman said the Chancellor had been a \u201cstrong and unwavering ally of Ireland\u201d as the country responded to the challenges brought about by Brexit. \u201cAhead of their formal meeting, the Taoiseach and Chancellor will participate in a round-table discussion with people from Northern Ireland and the border area, who will share their personal experience and perspectives on the impact any return to a hard border would have on border communities and businesses,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThese are people for whom the border is a very real issue - people from communities along the border, from business, and with direct personal experience of conflict before the Good Friday Agreement. \u201cIt is important to hear their voices as we work together to deal with the challenges that Brexit presents. \u201c The spokesman said the meeting was also an opportunity for the leaders to consider other issues on the EU\u2019s agenda and to reflect on how Ireland and Germany can strengthen \u201cthe already excellent relations\u201d between the two countries. Speaking in the Irish parliament on Wednesday, the Taoiseach said he hoped Mr Corbyn would show leadership and come up with a compromise plan with Mrs May. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam says the Cooper bill is expected to have good chances to get approved by the Lords. Labour and Co-op MP Gareth Thomas on the result: This from The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn: This from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby on the passing of the Cooper bill, which, if passed in the House of Lords, will rule out a crashing out of the EU without a deal once and for all, provided the EU would grant May a longer extension if her deal does not pass by April 12. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan has said on BBC Newsnight that there are \u201cother more qualified candidates\u201d to lead her party, should Theresa May step down as prime minister. This also from the Press Association: Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight, Ms Morgan said Mrs May was the \u201cbest person\u201d to lead discussions with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, but said \u201cnew national leadership\u201d would be needed to handle future negotiations on the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Asked about her own leadership ambitions she said: \u201cIt is very nice to be suggested, I think that there are other more qualified candidates, but I look forward to playing a role in shaping those discussions.\u201d This from the Press Association on the wafer-thin majority in this last vote of today that just rocked the House of Commons: Proposals to further delay the date of Brexit have moved closer to becoming law after they squeaked through the Commons by one vote. MPs supported the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 5) Bill at third reading by 313 votes to 312. The draft legislation tabled by Labour former minister Yvette Cooper requires Prime Minister Theresa May to table a motion seeking MPs\u2019 approval for an extension to the Article 50 process beyond April 12 to a date of her choosing. It is part of a parliamentary bid to prevent a no-deal departure from the EU. Tory Brexiteers strongly opposed the measures and, shortly before the final vote, they expressed their frustration at the Bill clearing all stages in the Commons in a matter of hours. Peter Bone (Wellingborough) urged Speaker John Bercow to \u201cmake this farce stop\u201d and prevent further votes. The Bill will undergo further scrutiny in the Lords at a later date, potentially as early as Thursday. The Cooper bill has passed its third reading with a majority of only one vote, 313:312 Another Peston moment: Chancellor Philip Hammond told Peston that he hopes the cross-party talks with Labour would be able to discover whether there was a \u201clanding zone\u201d where both sides could meet on a deal, the Press Association reports. \u201cWe are going to have further discussions tomorrow. I think both sides need to understand where each other are. But I would hope we can get, very quickly, to an understanding of whether there is a cross-party deal to be done,\u201d Hammond said. Now amendment 1 \u2013 which would limit any extension to 22 May \u2013 has been defeated by a whopping 488 to 123. The government has suffered another defeat and had its own amendment crushed by a majority of 180. Amendment 22 \u201censured the bill does not limit the power of the Brexit secretary in seeking an article 50 extension\u201d. Until MPs will vote on the Cooper bill, they will be voting on a series of amendments. Final vote expected around midnight. I just made an error: the vote hasn\u2019t failed, an amendment by the former minister George Eustice was just defeated by 304 ayes to 313 noes. The amendment would have prevented the government from being forced to hold a vote if the European Council proposes an extension date different than that requested by parliament. Profuse apologies. The previous post has been deleted. This just in from The Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova: MPs are now voting on the Cooper bill amendments. MPs were debating the Cooper bill at Committee stage until just a few minutes ago. In the eyes of the government, the bill represents \u201ca dangerous and perhaps unintended constitutional precedent\u201d that would \u201cconstrain\u201d the PM\u2019s authority in negotiations. \u201cThis bill actually increases the likelihood of an accidental no-deal,\u201d says Robin Walker, Exiting the EU minister. The government has tabled an amendment to the Cooper bill aimed at allowing the PM to agree a new deadline with the EU if necessary. This from the ITV\u2019s Paul Brand: Nick Boles MP, who resigned from the Tory whip yesterday, just tweeted this: By the way, German magazine Der Spiegel published an interview with speaker John Bercow on Monday, in which he talks beheadings, Theresa May being \u201ccourteous\u201d and his power in parliament. A good, entertaining read. Here an excerpt: DER SPIEGEL: Would you agree that you are one of the most powerful people in Britain today? Bercow: It\u2019s amazingly generous of you to confer this sobriquet on me, but I\u2019m not sure it is warranted. Of course, I do have a role, not grabbed by me, but conferred upon me, to select amendments for debate and to keep order. And yes, I won\u2019t be disingenuous. It is true that, in this context, the role of the speaker is more center stage than it would be if we were purely conducting a debate about child support policy. We\u2019re having a debate about a matter which has consumed the political world and dominated the media for the best part of three years. And in this current context, there is a particular significance attached to that. My approach is to try to facilitate perhaps by enabling the fullest and fairest expression of views and the range of views that exists. Stewart McDonald MP has apologised for questioning the absence of John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry in the Commons earlier. My colleague Jessica Elgot points out that situations like this could be avoided if it were to be made visible when absent MPs have paired with another MP to cast their vote that way. While a no-deal Brexit remains in the cards, my colleague Richard Partington writes that Liam Fox\u2019s international trade department is nowhere near Brexit-ready. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell just put out a tweet explaining his absence from the Commons tonight. This just in from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield: Meanwhile at Tory HQ, according to Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: Jeremy Corbyn has urged the PM to ditch her \u201cdead\u201d deal and move in Labour\u2019s direction, the Press Association reports: Theresa May has to accept that her Brexit deal is dead and she needs to move in Labour\u2019s direction, Jeremy Corbyn said after talks with the Prime Minister. The Labour leader said the meeting was \u201cuseful but inconclusive\u201d and said \u201cthere has not been as much change as I expected\u201d in the Prime Minister\u2019s position. Mr Corbyn reiterated his view that another referendum should be held to prevent either a no-deal Brexit or a bad deal but he said no \u201cred lines in the future\u201d on any potential agreement he might reach with the Prime Minister were discussed. His comments came as Emily Thornberry wrote to shadow cabinet colleagues calling for a public vote on any deal. Following his lengthy talks with the Prime Minister, which included senior frontbenchers from both sides, Mr Corbyn said: \u201cI want the Government to understand that the House does not support the deal that she has agreed. \u201cShe has got to come up, even at this very late stage, with something that is acceptable to the House, which does move in the direction that I have said the Labour Party wants in order to reach an agreement with the EU. \u201cThe dangers of crashing out with no deal are very, very serious, very serious indeed - they have to be avoided.\u201d Speaking in his parliamentary office, the Labour leader said: \u201cWe had a discussion and there hasn\u2019t been as much change as I expected but we are continuing to have some discussions tomorrow morning to explore some of the technical issues. \u201cThe meeting was useful but inconclusive.\u201d Mr Corbyn said he put forward Labour\u2019s view that \u201cwe want to achieve a customs union with the European Union, we want to have access to the market and, in particular, we discussed the dynamic regulatory alignment that is guaranteeing European regulations as a minimum on the environment as well as consumer and employment rights\u201d. Asked about whether a referendum on any agreement should be on the table - as shadow foreign secretary Ms Thornberry has reportedly said - Mr Corbyn said: \u201cThere was no deal offered (by the Prime Minister). \u201cThere was no deal offered by us either. We just discussed where we are at. \u201cShe reiterated where she is at at the present time. So red lines in the future didn\u2019t come up.\u201d But Mr Corbyn said he raised the issue of a public vote with Mrs May. \u201cI said this is the policy of our party, that we would want to pursue the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or to prevent leaving with a bad deal. \u201cThere was no agreement reached on that, we just put it there as one of the issues that the Labour Party conference voted on last year.\u201d In her letter, obtained by the Guardian, Ms Thornberry set out her points ahead of an emergency shadow cabinet meeting which she was unable to attend. \u201cIf we look like reaching any other decision than confirmatory vote that would be in breach of the decision made unanimously by conference in Liverpool and overwhelmingly supported by our members and it needs to be put to a vote by the shadow cabinet,\u201d the letter said. She added that if there was a vote \u201ccan I - in writing - confirm that my votes are that yes, any deal agreed by Parliament must be subject to a confirmatory public vote, and yes, the other option on the ballot must be remain\u201d. Mr Corbyn stressed that the Prime Minister was \u201ckeen to get a vote through the House next week\u201d in order to reach an agreement with the EU which would not involve taking part in the May 23 European elections. He pinned the blame for the Brexit impasse on the Prime Minister and her \u201ctotally ridiculous\u201d handling of the process. \u201cWhen the history of the British Parliament is written, this will be a remarkable period and a remarkable week - fascinating in that sense. \u201cBut take the thing back a bit, this is a totally ridiculous process we have got ourselves into. \u201cThe Government started the negotiations with the EU more than two-and-a-half years ago, they didn\u2019t consult anybody, they didn\u2019t involve anybody, they didn\u2019t take any soundings of the House. \u201cThey just steamed ahead with it.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn just tweeted this. Difference in Corbyn\u2019s and Emily Thornberry\u2019s choice of words is revelatory - Corbyn says \u201coption\u201d of a public vote, Thornberry said \u201cinsist\u201d. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has written to the shadow cabinet ahead of an emergency meeting tonight, telling cabinet members that \u201cnot to insist\u201d on a second referendum would constitute a \u201cbreach\u201d of Labour\u2019s commitments made at the conference, Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam reports: Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry abstained in the Cooper vote, as did Labour MP Karen Buck, another ardent campaigner for a confirmatory referendum, which is another sign that People\u2019s Vote campaigners fear that the potential ruling out of no-deal could make it unlikely for Jeremy Corbyn to support a referendum. One of the biggest questions of the evening is whether Jeremy Corbyn will provoke a fallout with his frontbench over the second referendum issue. My colleague Heather Stewart has written an excellent piece on this. She writes: Thornberry\u2019s intervention underlines the balancing act facing Corbyn, who was already under intense pressure to raise the issue of a referendum in talks with the prime minister. Full story below. Parliament is drowning in chaos as MPs complain about confusing or missing lists of amendments, limited time to read them and non-functioning printers. Do tune in if you can, it\u2019s quite something. The Cooper bill will now go on to Committe stage, with more votes scheduled for 10pm. If the vote passes, no-deal is off the table, provided the EU would agree to grant a long extension if no deal is passed in parliament by April 12. Until then, preparations for no-deal remain in full swing. This from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, the Guardian Brexit correspondent: MPs have voted in favour of the Cooper bill with a majority of five votes. Ayes: 315, Noes: 310. A quick reminder that speaker John Bercow said earlier that if the Cooper bill vote would end in another tie and require his vote, he would vote in favour to move it on for further discussion, in accordance with precedent. Various pundits are pointing out that Jeremy Corbyn might have hinted that he would not support a second referendum if a no-deal scenario is prevented - which would be the case if the Cooper bill passes - or if a compromise with the PM is reached that is in line with Labour\u2019s policies. This from Kevin Schofield, editor of PoliticsHome.com: MPs are now voting on the Cooper bill. This from my colleague Jessica Elgot: Jeremy Corbyn has written to Labour MPs to update them about the \u201cconstructive exploratory discussions\u201d he had with the PM earlier. This from the New Stateman\u2019s Patrick Maguire: Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Andrew Sparrow. The drama in the Commons simply refuses to ebb down: Around 7pm, parliament will vote on the Cooper bill - which seeks to enshrine in law that Theresa May has to ask Brussels for a longer extension instead of crashing out without a deal if no withdrawal deal is passed by April 12. A passing of this vote would spell the end of the no-deal Brexit dream many Leavers still hold onto, but it is expected to be another tight one that could be decided by just a handful of votes or abstentions - the motion to move the bill passed by just a single vote earlier at 312:311. Yvette Cooper just described her bill as a \u201csimple, practical and transparent\u201d way to support the PM in the withdrawal process, while Caroline Lucas MP referred to it as a \u201cvital safety-net\u201d in the Commons. The \u201clife-long\u201d Brexit-supporter Martin Wickers MP urged MPs to vote against it. Remain-backing ministers could resign to push the bill over the line. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. And that\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is now taking over. The Scottish parliament will be recalled from its Easter holidays for an emergency meeting next week but only if it is clear the UK will be crashing out of the EU with a no deal Brexit after next week\u2019s EU summit. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, had originally suggested to her cabinet on Tuesday that Holyrood could be asked to sit for much of next week because of the significance of an imminent threat of a no deal Brexit, scrapping their Easter break. While the Scottish Greens backed that proposal, it was understood it was resisted by Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories, who said they could support an emergency recall but only in the certainty a no-deal Brexit would be taking place. Ken Macintosh, Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer, said these options had been discussed by the parties this week, who had agreed there should be an emergency session on Thursday 11 April instead of suspending the Easter recess entirely. He said: I can confirm that my intention is to recall parliament next week to meet at 1.00pm on Thursday 11 April in the circumstances that the UK is due to leave the EU without a deal on the following day. I indicated last week that I would try and give members at least two days\u2019 notice of the decision whether or not to recall. This is clearly an ongoing, developing situation and I may therefore not be in a position to confirm a recall to members until after decisions are taken at the EU summit on Wednesday 10 April. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said recent wrangling in parliament meant the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal was \u201calarmingly high\u201d. Speaking on Sky News Carney warned that a no-deal Brexit was now \u201cthe default option\u201d and would cause havoc at British ports. He said: No-deal would happen by accident, it would happen suddenly, there would be no transition - it is an accidental disorderly Brexit. His comments were seen as a swipe at his predecessor Lord King, who last week said the UK could leave the EU on World Trade Organisations terms and maintain zero tariffs and concerns about queues of lorries on the M20 were \u201cpretty absurd.\u201d Carney said: \u201cForget the fiction\u2026 (it\u2019s) absolute nonsense. It needs to be called out.\u201d Unison, the public services union, is calling for any final Brexit deal to be put to a public vote. In a statement, Dave Prentis, its general secretary, said: A general election is our preferred option, but until that time, the so-called Norway plus plan, allowing the UK to remain in the customs union and the single market is the next best bet. Whatever deal emerges in the coming days should be put to the country. We cannot allow the UK\u2019s future to be dashed on the rocks of a no-deal Brexit. This is what Labour said in the statement that it issued after the May/Corbyn talks. A party spokesman said: We have had constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock. We have agreed a programme of work between our teams to explore the scope for agreement. And this is what a Number 10 spokesman said about the meeting. Today\u2019s talks were constructive, with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close. We have agreed a programme of work to ensure we deliver for the British people, protecting jobs and security. Theresa May was joined by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Julian Smith, the chief whip. Jeremy Corbyn was joined by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, Nick Brown, Labour\u2019s chief whip, and Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s director of communications and strategy. Each side is going to appoint a negotiating team. Those teams will meet tonight to agree a programme of work, and then again tomorrow, for what government sources are saying will be \u201ca full day of intensive discussion\u201d John Bercow, the Speaker, is now taking points of order. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says the Cooper bill should not be allowed without a money resolution - a resolution that has to be moved by a government minister authorising government spending. Bercow says he has been advised that that is not necessary. Here is a Guardian graphic showing how the rate of ministerial resignations under Theresa May compares with the rate under her predecessors. The main business motion has been passed by 312 votes to 311 - a majority of one. That means the debate on the Cooper bill will go ahead. And here is more from what John Bercow told MPs about why he used his casting vote as he did. My recollection - and I\u2019ve been saying this for years across the country to audiences, so I hope it\u2019s right - is that the last occasion on which the speaker had to exercise a casting vote was in 1993, and I believe it was appertaining to the Maastricht Treaty bill ... I think it was on an amendment relating to the social chapter, and it was an amendment in the name of the then leader of the opposition [John Smith] and Speaker Boothroyd cast her vote in the way that she did, against that amendment. And the rationale ... for the exercise of the casting vote is that it is not for the chair to create a majority that doesn\u2019t otherwise exist. The way in which the casting vote is exercised does also depend upon the stage at which the matter is being aired. So, for example, it would be exercised differently on the second reading of a bill, where there is an important principle of encouraging further debate ... but if it\u2019s the final stage of a bill, the casting vote would be against. In a situation in which a decision would be made that a day would be allocated for particular business [ie, the Benn amendment], I judge that it is not right for me to make that decision if the house hasn\u2019t by a clear majority done so. This is what John Bercow told MPs when explaining his casting vote. In accordance with precedent, and on the principle that important decisions should not be taken except by a majority, I cast my vote with the noes. So the final vote was 311 to 310. MPs are now voting on the main business motion - setting out the arrangements to this afternoon\u2019s debate on the Cooper bill. But if the Benn amendment was defeated, there must be a strong chance that this will get defeated too. Bercow says, in accordance with precedent, and with the principle that important votes should not be taken except by a majority, Bercow votes with the noes. It is a tie - 310 votes on each side. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says there are rumours it\u2019s a tie. \u201cSo can we have a people\u2019s vote and do it twice?\u201d Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory former chief whip, asks John Bercow, the Speaker, what is happening. Bercow says there was a delay, and he asked the two chief whips to confer. He asked them to be brief. He will update MPs soon, he says. This is from an Institute for Government briefing on what the Speaker should do if there\u2019s a tie. One of the most important, albeit very rarely used, powers the Speaker has is to exercise the casting vote in the event of a draw. The use of this power is governed by a long-standing principle aimed at maintaining the Speaker\u2019s impartiality, namely that they should not vote against the overall majority. The Speaker should vote in favour of allowing further discussion and avoid making final decisions by a casting vote. In practice, this means that a tie at second reading should be resolved by the Speaker voting for the bill \u2013 on the basis that there will then be opportunity for further discussion. At third reading they would vote against, on the basis that the law should not be changed except with the will of the entire House. This power was used seven times between 1974 and 1979. It was almost needed when the Callaghan government was defeated on a vote of confidence of 311 versus 310. It was most recently exercised on 22 July 1993 during the parliamentary vote on the Maastricht Treaty, when votes were tied on 317. The then Speaker Betty Boothroyd voted against the leader of the opposition\u2019s amendment on the basis that the decision should only be taken by a majority. But the government lost the vote on the motion itself. From Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle From the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake From the Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson This is from Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh. During the debate on the business motion Tory Brexiters objected to the procedure being used to pass the Yvette Cooper bill (using a motion to all backbenchers, not the government, to decide Commons business for a day). Here are extracts from two of the Brexiter speeches. From Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader I recall when I first came here that it was always a requirement that every bill should have 100 hours in committee before they are allowed as a government to bring back to the floor of the house any kind of guillotine motion. So debate and scrutiny took place in the committees, or on the floor of the house for that matter, at great length. I think the quality of our examination of our bills was infinitely better than what followed under the subsequent Labour government that introduced these programme motions immediately on the back of the bill. That has meant this House has fallen into disrepute for its inability to properly scrutinise legislation in the way it should have done. From Sir Bill Cash I think [the procedure being used] is reprehensible, I think it is a constitutional revolution, and I also believe that is a very, very undesirable precedent. (In the past, when Labour was in office, Cash used to be in favour of the backbenchers having more control over Commons business.) The debate on the business motion is now over, and MPs are now voting. The first vote is on Hilary Benn\u2019s amendment, which says next Monday should be set aside for more indicative votes. The government has said it is planning its own indicative votes, if Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn cannot agree a unified Brexit plan, but under the Benn amendment the government would lose control of the Commons business on Monday. And here is the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar on the May/Corbyn meeting. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s meeting with Theresa May is over, the Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova reports. Here is the joint statement released by Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, Chuka Umunna, the Independent Group spokesperson, Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader, and the Green MP Caroline Lucas demanding a second referendum. (See 4.05pm.) They said: The UK is in the midst of a Brexit crisis led by a government dictated by incompetence. Given everything we now know - and the detrimental impact Brexit will have on the UK\u2019s economy, job opportunities and people\u2019s livelihoods, the priority must be bringing the issue back to the people in a people\u2019s vote \u2013 with the option to remain on the ballot paper. We are in agreement that there is no such thing as a good Brexit and that people across the UK face being worse off. We have shown over the past three years we are willing to find a compromise position to end the impasse. Time is fast running out and any compromise that is reached must be brought back to the people through a fresh referendum, and keep the option to revoke article 50 on the table to avoid a no-deal Brexit. In his resignation letter (see 4.12pm) Chris Heaton-Harris, the now former Brexit minister, says he does not think Theresa May is fully aware of quite how much has been done within government to prepare the UK for no-deal. He says: Whilst I would have preferred to leave the European Union with your deal, I truly believe our country would have swiftly overcome any immediate issues of leaving without a deal and gone on to thrive. It has been a privilege to work with some quite brilliant civil servants in my department and across government. They have moved mountains to prepare our country for leaving the European Union without a negotiated deal. Unfortunately, I do not believe the briefings you have received on these matters recently have reflected all they have achieved or the preparations our European partners have made. The Brexit minister Chris Heaton-Harris has resigned. Heaton-Harris is an enthusiastic Brexiter and there has been speculation all day that he might follow Nigel Adams, who resigned as a junior minister earlier because he thought Theresa May was making a \u201cgrave error\u201d in trying to seek a compromise with Jeremy Corbyn. In his resignation letter Heaton-Harris says that he thought the UK should have left the EU on 29 March, as planned, and that he cannot support any further extension. As a Brexit minister he was responsible for no-deal planning. He also tells May that her determination to avoid no-deal \u201cobviously makes my job in government irrelevant\u201d. The leaders of five of the smaller parties or groups at Westminster, the SNP, the Lib Dems, the Independent Group, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, are giving a joint statement to the BBC in central lobby at Westminster. They are all in favour of another referendum on Brexit, and they are expressing their concern that that this will not feature in any plan that might be endorsed by Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. They also made the argument that, if MPs are allowed to vote more than once on Brexit, the public should have this right too. This is from the Institute for Government\u2019s Alasdair de Costa on Nigel Adams\u2019 resignation. These are from the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy. As the Irish Times reports, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner responsible for economic and financial affairs, also said that there was \u201can increasing risk of no-deal Brexit on April 12\u201d at his press conference earlier. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, tweeted this after a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn. She does not seem to think Labour will strike a deal on Brexit with Theresa May. From the FT\u2019s George Parker From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg These are from Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. In the Commons Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just said that the government will oppose the business motion. She says that is because the government does not approve of this process allowing backbenchers to take control of the Commons business. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart is speaking now. He starts by asking Leadsom to say whether or not the government will be voting against the actual Cooper bill at second reading, but Leadsom chooses not to respond. Here is the full text of the speech Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission, gave in the European parliament earlier today. And here are the main points he made. Juncker said MPs must be able to approve the withdrawal agreement by next Friday, or else the UK would either face either no-deal or a long Brexit extension. He said: In light of prime minister May\u2019s statement last night, I believe we now have a few more days. If the United Kingdom is in a position to approve the withdrawal agreement with a sustainable majority by 12 April, the European Union should be prepared to accept a delay until 22 May. But 12 April is the ultimate deadline for the approval of the withdrawal agreement by the House of Commons. If it has not done so by then, no further short extension will be possible. After 12 April, we risk jeopardising the European parliament elections, and so threaten the functioning of the European Union. He said the EU was ready to start talks on the future relationship as soon as the withdrawal agreement is agreed. He said: On the EU side, we stand ready to launch the talks and negotiations on the future partnership as soon as the withdrawal agreement is signed. Before the ink is dry. The commission\u2019s negotiating team is in place. Michel Barnier, our chief negotiator, is ready. I would expect the same level of readiness on the United Kingdom side. He said that a no-deal Brexit on 12 April was now \u201cvery likely\u201d. He said: I believe that a \u201cno deal\u201d at midnight on the 12 April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the European Union is ready. He said there was no such thing as a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d. The United Kingdom will be affected more than the European Union because there is no such thing as a \u201cmanaged or negotiated no-deal\u201d and there is no such thing as a \u201cno-deal transition\u201d. The concept of a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d is one promoted by some Brexiters, who argue that the various mitigating measures drawn as part of no-deal planning would make no-deal acceptable. In his speech Juncker referred to these measures, but he said they would not stop the UK being affected. He said: The measures we and the member states have taken will mitigate the worst impact of a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario. The protection offered is real. The measures will make sure that EU and UK citizens can continue to live and work where they are at the moment. They make sure that planes can take off and land. We have adapted our financial instrument to make it possible to help fishing communities. We have identified the ways in which law enforcement cooperation can continue. We have taken steps to mitigate disruption on our financial markets. The measures we have taken are time-limited and unilateral. They provide a cushion for key EU interests at least until the end of the year. But disruption will be inevitable for citizens, for businesses and for almost every sector. Downing Street says the government will be not be supporting the Yvette Cooper bill, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. These are from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission, president is confirming that next Friday has become a hard deadline for the EU. Juncker says MPs must be able to approve the withdrawal agreement by next Friday, or the UK will face either no-deal or a long Brexit delay. This quashes the very faint prospect that the EU might have agreed another short extension to allow time for the deal to pass parliament. But, if MPs were to agree a deal by next week, Theresa May is hoping that the EU would agree to another short extension, lasting not beyond 22 May. This, from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire, is interesting. Nikki da Costa, who used to be director of legislative affairs for Theresa May in Number 10, is horrified. David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, intervenes. He says he is worried about the idea of passing a bill like this in one day. He says the last time the government did this was when it passed the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Davis says he later spent a long time challenging that in court. Oliver Letwin says that was a much more complicated piece of legislation. MPs are now debating the business motion for today\u2019s proceedings in the Commons. This is the third day that backbenchers have effectively hijacked Commons business (which is normally under the control of the government) to allow for Brexit debates. On Wednesday last week, and on Monday this week, it was for indicative votes. Today it is to allow MPs to pass Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill requiring the PM to seek an article 50 extension. The business motion is on the order paper here (pdf). As well as setting aside today for a debate allowing the Cooper bill to pass its Commons stages by 10pm tonight, the business motion also says MPs must get time to debate it when it comes back from the Lords. And Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn has tabled an amendment to the business motion saying next Monday should be set aside for another round of indicative votes. John Bercow, the Speaker, has announced that he will call the Benn amendment. And Sir Oliver Letwin, the Tory former cabinet minister behind the indicative votes process who is opening the debate now, has just said he accepts the Benn amendment. Theresa May has been warned that a pact with Jeremy Corbyn to deliver a Brexit deal could destroy the Conservative party, as Eurosceptic MPs reacted with horror to her offer to work with Labour. One, Nigel Adams, resigned as a junior minister for Wales this morning saying that, in trying to do a deal with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first\u201d, May was making a \u201cgrave error\u201d. (See 9.46am.) And during PMQs seven Tory Brexiters stood up to criticise what May was doing. (See 1.20pm.) David Jones, the former Brexit minister, asked: Does it remain the position of the prime minister that the leader of the opposition is not fit to govern? And his fellow Tory Brexiter Caroline Johnson said: If it comes to the point when we have to balance the risk of a no-deal Brexit versus the risk of letting down the country and ushering in a Marxist, antisemite-led government, what does she think at the point is the lowest risk? Corbyn is under intense pressure from supporters of a second referendum to block any deal that comes without a public vote when he holds Brexit talks with May this afternoon. A key ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has called for EU leaders to reject Theresa May\u2019s appeal for a further short delay to Brexit, in a sign of the dangers of the prime minister\u2019s strategy. May has refused to rule out the UK taking part in European elections if the EU insists on a long article 50 extension. (See 12.53pm.) May has been accused of only inviting Corbyn to Brexit talks as \u201ca trap\u201d. The SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie made this charge at PMQs. (See 1.20pm.) And Ben Bradshaw is one of the Labour MPs who have made the same argument. Corbyn tackled May over rising poverty in Britain at prime minister\u2019s questions, as he pressed her on the government\u2019s neglect of domestic policies as the Brexit impasse continues. The British economy is at risk of sliding into a deepening downturn after stalling in the first quarter, following the weakest performance in the private sector in almost seven years as Brexit approaches. Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused the BBC of having a \u201clefty obsession\u201d during heated questioning over his tweet of a video of a speech by a senior member of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland. The Scottish government will use Brexit talks with the prime minister to try to push for voters to be given another say on staying in the European Union, Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Brexit Secretary has said. As the Press Association reports, with the first minister in London for discussions with Theresa May, Mike Russell suggested the \u201cbest outcome\u201d to the Brexit deadlock would be a People\u2019s Vote. He told MSPs in Edinburgh: If I were able to wave a magic wand and get what I want - apart from no Brexit, which has been a complete distraction and disaster for the last two and half years of massively damaging proportions - then it would have to be a very long delay, a referendum, the European elections taking place and perhaps some calmness coming into this to look at the damage that would be done by proceeding along the present lines. That PMQs was the second longest on record, according to the Press Association. Today\u2019s lasted 55 minutes. The longest took place on April 26 2017 and lasted 56 minutes. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. PMQs - Snap verdict: There is an alternate universe where perhaps David Cameron never announced a referendum, or remain won, and politics in 2019 is devoted to the usual arguments about things like the economy, wages, poverty and welfare reform. After a brief and rather gracious statement welcoming her invitation for Brexit talks, Jeremy Corbyn took us into this parallel universe for about 15 minutes or so by devoting all his questions to economy/welfare issues. \u201cParallel universe\u201d is not quite right though, because it\u2019s the real world he was describing - Britain in 2019 - and his questions sounded like a reliable canter through what would be the main issues in a (Brexit-free) election campaign. Theresa May seemed happy to engage with Corbyn on this territory, although his talking points were more compelling than hers. But it all felt like a huge distraction from the crisis engulfing the government, and the country, and May came under much more pressure from her own MPs than she did from Corbyn. By my count, seven Tory Brexiters (Davis Amess, David Jones, Lee Rowley, Julian Lewis, Caroline Johnson, Christopher Chope and Nigel Evans) taunted her with varying degrees of anger over her decision last night to embrace Labour in the hope of getting a Brexit deal through parliament. They weren\u2019t calling for her to quit, because she has promised that already, but nevertheless from that wing of the party all respect for her has now vanished. The best question came from Evans, who tried, and failed, to get an assurance from her that the UK would not fight European elections. (See 12.53pm.) Expect to hear a a lot more about this in the coming days. And the other standout question came from the SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie. He asked May: After two years of Brexit deadlock, intransigence and a seven-hour cabinet meeting, the best the prime minister can do is invite the leader of the British Labour party to become the co-owner of her Brexit failure. Let me ask her, had she been the leader of the opposition, and invited into a trap like this, would she have been foolish enough to accept? Hosie did not get a proper answer, but many Labour MPs were probably thinking his analysis was spot on. And that\u2019s it. PMQs has finally ended, after 56 minutes - almost double the amount of time for which it is scheduled. I\u2019m not keeping count, but that could be a record. Nick Boles, who resigned the Tory whip, says sitting next to the Lib Dems and the SNP is unusual for him. But he remains a progressive conservative, he says. He asks for an assurance that May will enter the talks with Corbyn without the red lines that have bedevilled the talks so far. May says she wants to find a resolution to this issue. Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, asks May if she will say \u201cno, no, no\u201d if the EU insist that the UK has to fight European elections to get another article 50 extension. May says she wants a deal that enables the UK to leave on 22 May, so it does not have to fight the European elections. But that will only happen if MPs vote for a deal, she ways. May refuses to rule out the UK holding European elections if the EU insists on a long article 50 extension. The SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman says freedom of movement is good socially and economically, and it is good for young people. Will May be honest about those benefits, and retain them? May says she wants an immigration system that means people are admitted on the basis of their skills, not on the basis of coming from the EU. Labour\u2019s Karin Smyth says some government suggestions for schools, like cutting the size of lunches, are unacceptable. They belong in the days of the workhouse. May says funding for schools is going up. Labour\u2019s Naz Shah says Sadiq Khan has never had an apology for the Islamophobic campaign the Tories ran against him in 2016. Will May apologise now? May sidesteps the question, but says the government takes Islamphobia very seriously. It recently held a summit on how to tackle it. Sir Chrisopher Chope, a Tory Brexiter, says he agrees with the 14 members of the cabinet who said the UK should leave the EU next week with no-deal. What benefits does May expect to see from no-deal? May says Chope should not believe everything he reads in the papers. (See 10.59am.) She says the cabinet took a decision collectively yesterday to back her approach. The DUP\u2019s Jim Shannon asks which of the Labour policies on Brexit May supports. May says she and Corbyn both want to deliver on Brexit. Caroline Johnson, a Tory, asks about the risk of a no-deal Brexit compared to the risk to the country from a \u201cMarxist, antisemite-led government\u201d. May says she wants a Brexit deal. Labour\u2019s Martin Whitfield asks about toilet facilities for people with disabilities. May says this is a very important issue. The government wants to help people with invisible disabilities who suffer abuse if they use toilets for the disabled (the issue specifically raised by Whitfield). Julian Lewis, a Tory Brexiter, asks why a PM who repeatedly said no deal was better than a bad deal is now asking Labour MPs to block a WTO Brexit. May says no deal is better than a bad deal, but she has a good deal. Last Friday MPs had a chance to vote for that. She says she wants the UK to leave the EU in an orderly way. That is why she has been sitting down with MPs from across the house. The SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie says, after two years of deadlock and a seven hour cabinet meeting, the best she can do is invite Corbyn to become co-owner of her failure. If she were leader of the opposition, would she fall into a trap like this. May says all MPs should be working on a Brexit solution. Lee Rowley, a Tory Brexiter, says May said last week Corbyn was the biggest threat to the UK. What qualifies him to be involved in Brexit? May says every member of the house is involved in Brexit. She wants it to happen in an orderly way, as soon as possible, and without the need for the UK to fight European elections. Labour\u2019s Preet Kaur Gill asks May if she will speed up the diagnosis time for children with autism. May says some parents find it very difficult to get help for their children if they have autism. She says the government is reviewing its autism strategy. Philip Lee, a Conservative pro-European, says over 58% of the public want a final say on Brexit. Are they right? May says the government should be delivering on the result of the first referendum. David Jones, a Conservative, asks if May still thinks Corbyn is \u201cnot fit to govern\u201d. May says she said earlier what Labour would do to the economy. She does not think Labour should be in government. After the Salisbury novichok attack, she stood up to Russia. But Corbyn said he would prefer to believe the Russian government than the intelligence services. Labour\u2019s Afzal Khan says there is a reception in the Commons today to commemorate teh 51 Muslims killed in Christchurch. There is a problem in the Tory party with Islamophobia. But the party won\u2019t acknowledge that. When will May deal with it and accept the MCB definition of Islamophobia? May says her party takes these incidents very seriously. On attacks against mosques, she says the home secretary has announced extra funding to protect them. Labour\u2019s Owen Smith says, when May sits down with Corbyn, she will hear that Labour\u2019s policy is for a people\u2019s vote on her deal. If she agrees, it will pass. Will she? (It is not obvious that she will hear that from Corbyn.) May sidesteps the question, and she and Corbyn both want to deliver on the result of the referendum. Nigel Adams, who resigned as a minister earlier over Brexit (see 9.46am), urges May to back a campaign for step-free access for Selby railway station. This is important for his constituents, he says. The people of Selby demand action, he says. May thanks Adams for his work as a minister and says she is sorry he has resigned. She says Adams\u2019 \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d has been behind this campaign for a long time. His weight \u201cas a campaigner\u201d, she clarifies. She says there will be an announcement about new funding for stations tomorrow. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says although the SNP wants a people\u2019s vote, it has sought compromise. Why has it been ignored? Why is May just inviting Corbyn in? Why are the voices of Scotland being ignored? May says she is meeting Nicola Sturgeon later today. She says she and Corbyn want to leave the EU with a deal. But the SNP wants to revoke article 50, she says. Blackford say he knew Sturgeon was meeting May. But he was talking about the SNP being excluded from formal talks. Scotland will not accept a Tory or Labour Brexit, he says. It voted to remain in the EU and it will not be dragged out against its will. May says she is always happy to meet party leaders. She wants to find a way forward that delivers Brexit as soon as possible. Dame Cheryl Gillan, a Conservative, asks May to encourage more government departments to introduce autism awareness measures. And she urges more MPs to undertake autism training. May praises the achievement of the Autism Act, introduced by Gillan 10 years ago. The government will continue to look at this, she says. Corbyn says Waspi women (Women Against State Pension Inequality) will be alarmed by what May said. He asks if the government will guarantee free TV licences for the over-75s. May says the BBC is in a position to do that with the money it gets. Corbyn says the last Labour government promised this. May is now outsourcing this to the BBC. It should be government policy, he says. He contrasts the record of the last Labour government with the record of this government. This government has made a political choice. There is nothing inevitable about rising poverty. Unless this government tackles rising poverty and low pay, her government will be a failure. May says she did not realise Corbyn was such a fan of the last Labour government. He spent his time voting against it. This government has introduced the biggest upgrade in workers\u2019 rights for 20 years. Councils are free to build more homes. There are world-class public services. The Tories are delivering on things that matter. Corbyn says May should think about what she says. The last Labour government halved child poverty, and brought in Sure Start centres. The Trussell Trust says food bank use has increased by more than 50% where universal credit has been introduced. Why is the government pushing ahead with cuts to pension credit for couples where one person is below pension age. May says under Labour we saw a 75p pension rise. Corbyn says the last Labour government lifted 2 million pensioners out of poverty. He says the Tories promised to scrap the triple-lock at the last election. Will May rules this out as government policy, and rule it out for the next manifesto? May says the government has made its commitments to pensioners. Pensions have gone up, he says. Jeremy Corbyn welcomes May\u2019s offer of talks and her \u201cwillingness to compromise\u201d, and says he looks forward to seeing her later. Why has poverty risen under May\u2019s administration? May says no one wants to see poverty rise. But the only way to stop this is with strong employment, with welfare, and by making sure work pays. In 2010 someone on the minimum wage working full time would have taken home \u00a39,200. Now it is \u00a313,700. Corbyn says the Tories strongly opposed the introduction of the minimum wage. But people on these wages are on poverty wages. Universal credit is failing. Will May halt its roll-out and agree to a thorough review of it. May says the government has changed it. The taper rate has changed, and the seven-day waiting list has been abolished. She says the only sustainable way to deal with poverty is to have a strong economy delivering better jobs for people. She says a Labour government would spend \u00a31,000bn more than the Tories. It would put up taxes. Labour has opposed tax cuts. Tax cuts keep people in work. Sir David Amess, a Tory Brexiter, says party loyalty is being stretched. He says Brexit should mean Brexit. And then, with a reference to Southend-on-Sea wanting city status, he calls for a meaningful vote (on Brexit, presumably, not the status of Southend). May says when Brexit gets delivered, places like Southend will have a better future. Southend will be a leading part of that better future, she says. Theresa May starts by saying April marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the UK\u2019s longest-running military operation - Operation Relentlessness, the nuclear submarine deployment at sea. But \u201crelentless\u201d could apply to Brexit too ... PMQs is about to start. I will post my snap summary when it is over. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, is also meeting Theresa May today. He has been tweeting about what he will say to her. Presumably Drakeford has been invited because Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is seeing May too. But they are not equivalent. Although they both run devolved administrations, Sturgeon is leader of the SNP, a party with 35 MPs in the Commons. Drakeford is a Labour politician, but May has already arranged to see the leader who decides how Labour MPs vote, Jeremy Corbyn. This is from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole. My colleague Jonathan Freedland has written a column on Theresa May\u2019s decision to hold Brexit talks with Jeremy Corbyn. Here\u2019s an extract. The question now is: will this move work? Will May and Corbyn strike a grand bargain, agreeing a national unity Brexit? To which the answer is: don\u2019t hold your breath. For some in Labour, that\u2019s because they assume the worst of May and suspect this is no more than a cynical ruse to land the blame for Brexit\u2019s failure on them. And yet one senior shadow cabinet minister told me this morning that May is acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d and that the prime minister is \u201cgenuinely looking for a concessionary strategy\u201d, albeit one born of necessity. Still, even that shadow minister doesn\u2019t think this will lead to a May-Corbyn deal, not least because, in their view: \u201cJeremy is not capable of it.\u201d Even without taking a position on the Labour leader\u2019s skill set, there are good reasons to be sceptical. For one thing, just because May has opted for a change in strategy, it doesn\u2019t mean Corbyn has done the same. His goal has always been for Brexit to happen, but not to be blamed for it. May has just invited him to become co-author of Brexit, with his fingerprints all over it. There is no reason why that should appeal to him. He is, after all, the leader of an overwhelmingly pro-remain party: its members will not look kindly on him acting as the midwife of Brexit. And here is his full article. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, goes next. Q: If the PM agrees a new approach with Jeremy Corbyn, will the government try to amend the political declaration to include that? Barclay says that will be part of the discussion between May and Corbyn today. The EU would need to agree any change to the political declaration, he says, although he would expect them to do that. But he says the government can also decide unilaterally to put extra material into the EU withdrawal agreement bill. Q: Why would the government not want a new political declaration? Barclay says the two options are not mutually exclusive. And that\u2019s it. The hearing is over. In the committee the Tory MP Richard Graham is asking the question now Q: What do you think the UK will be able to take to the European council next Wednesday? An agreement, and legislation already passed? Or just an agreement? Stephen Barclay says the UK will need to be able to show \u201cclear purpose\u201d. He does not expect the withdrawal legislation, the EU withdrawal agreement bill, to be passed by then. But the government would want to be able to say what it is doing. This is what Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister and foreign minister, is saying about Ireland backing a UK request for a further, short article 50 extension. (See 10.20am.) Coveney said: They will look for a short extension next week, and I think Ireland will support that. It is very unlikely that there will be any crash out at the end of next week with the prime minister looking for an extension with a plan to go with that. Sir Christopher Chope, the Tory Brexiter, goes next. Q: Were you one of the 14 cabinet ministers yesterday who voted for a no-deal? Chope is referring to the Telegraph splash. Barclay says he will not discuss what happened at cabinet. The Telegraph has been accused of misrepresenting the cabinet discussion by implying that all 14 wanted a no-deal. Here is the Guardian\u2019s account, which of course is more reliable. Several of those present said that 14 ministers, including Leadsom, Liz Truss and Gavin Williamson, opposed a long extension to leaving the EU and 10 were in favour, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who made the case for keeping a second referendum on the table. But others claimed only four cabinet ministers were actually arguing for no deal and the rest of the 14 simply made a case against a long delay while accepting the probable need for another shorter one. Q: Do you agree with what Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, said in a letter to ministers about the disastrous effects of a no-deal Brexit? Barclay says he will not comment on leaked documents. But he has always accepted that a no deal poses risks, he says. Back in the committee Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock is asking the questions now. Q: The EU Withdrawal Act says MPs must vote on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration at the same time. So why did the government separate the issues? Barclay says it was not the government that decided that. It was the EU, he says, because its article 50 extension offer (see 10.44am) just talked about the MPs passing the withdrawal agreement by the end of last week. This is probably worth clarifying. What has the EU said about offering the UK another article 50 extension? The conclusions of the EU summit on 21 March are here. And this is what Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said explaining what they meant. In the first scenario, that is, if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until the 22nd of May. In the second scenario, that is, if the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council agrees to an extension until the 12th of April, while expecting the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward. What this means in practice is that, until that date, all options will remain open, and the cliff-edge date will be delayed. The UK Government will still have a choice of a deal, no-deal, a long extension or revoking article 50. The 12th of April is a key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European parliament elections. If it has not decided to do so by then, the option of a long extension will automatically become impossible. The first scenario has gone. The automatic extension until 22 May has gone, and at the moment the extension deadline is 12 April. If the UK wants an extension going beyond 22 May, it will have to take part in the European elections. At the moment the government is saying it does not want this. Instead Theresa May is hoping that the EU will agree an extension going beyond next Friday, but ending at some point before 22 May. This would not require a commitment to take part in the European elections. But whether the EU would agree to this remains to be seen. The SNP has described Theresa May\u2019s offer of Brexit talks with Jeremy Corbyn as \u201cBetter Together 2.0\u201d, as the BBC reports that Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is seeking urgent talks herself with the prime minister. SNP MP Douglas Chapman told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that it would be \u201cfoolish of the prime minister not to include the third party in parliament\u201d in her compromise discussions, likening her planned talks to the alliance between Labour and Tories during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign. The BBC is reporting that Sturgeon is willing to travel to London today to put her case directly to May, after accusing her of \u201ckicking the can and, yet again, delaying making any decision that could break her cabinet\u201d. Yesterday the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford announced that the party\u2019s 35 MPs would support Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill which calls on the UK government to bring forward proposals to extend Article 50 in order to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal. Blackford said: The SNP has consistently sought to reach a cross-party position to end the Brexit impasse, including options for a second EU referendum, as well as the common market 2.0 proposal, which came closest to the compromise position proposed by the Scottish government back in December 2016, and we will continue to do so. After yesterday\u2019s cabinet, for a brief moment people thought Penny Mordaunt, the Brexiter international development secretary, might have resigned. But she hadn\u2019t, and this morning, speaking to reporters outside her home, she said she still hoped the PM\u2019s deal would be passed with Tory and DUP voters. She said: The only way to leave is with the withdrawal agreement. The prime minister is trying to get it through on Conservative votes and has not been able to, she\u2019s now trying to do it with Labour votes. I would say to colleagues who want a truer Brexit, I still hope we can do this with Conservative and DUP votes. But above all else, the public are fed-up of the limbo and business needs certainty. That implies she thinks the prospect of a softer Brexit might persuade Tory Brexiters and DUP MPs who have opposed to deal until now to change their minds. One problem with this strategy is that the DUP are more opposed to the backstop than they are to the idea of a soft Brexit. Here is the full text of Nigel Adams\u2019s resignation letter. (See 9.46am.) Dear Prime Minister, It has been an honour to serve in your government as a minister since 2017 and I remain a firm admirer of your courage and stoicism during one of the most difficult crises this country has faced for a generation. I believe we have two great challenges. We must deliver the Brexit the people voted for. And we must prevent the calamity of a Corbyn government. Sadly, I fear that we are now at risk of simultaneously failing in both. I have been loyally supportive of your negotiated deal with the EU at every stage as I believe an orderly exit is preferable to leaving without a deal. However, I believe the UK would have coped with leaving with a managed no deal. At cabinet yesterday, there was an opportunity to get onto the front foot for once. However, by legitimising and turning to Jeremy Corbyn to assist you at this crucial stage, rather than being bold, is a grave error. It is clear that we will now end up in the customs union. That is not the Brexit my constituents were promised, and it is contrary to the pledge we made in our manifesto. It makes no sense to leave the EU and to have a situation where our trade policy and much of our law is made in Brussels - with no say for the UK. I and many others agreed with your previous position that no deal is better than a bad deal. It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal - cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life, put British interests first - is better than no deal. I profoundly disagree with this approach and I have therefore decided that I must reluctantly tender my resignation. It has been a privilege to serve as a minister in the government whips Office, at the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and latterly at the Wales Office and I will always be grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve the people of the UK in your government. I am passionate about my constituency and have always strived to do my best for the people of Selby and Ainsty since 2010. 1 will continue to serve them diligently from the back benches. Yours sincerely, Nigel Adams Theresa May will also be meeting Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Sky is reporting. In the Brexit committee Labour\u2019s Stephen Timms is asking the questions now. Q: Would the EU have to agree any changes to the political declaration before MPs could vote for it? Barclays says the EU has said it could respond quickly to any proposed changes. Q: If the UK wanted an extension lasting beyond 22 May, which would involve the UK taking part in the European elections, when would it have to decide? Barclay says that is not what the UK wants. But if it were to decide on that, it would have to put in a request to the EU before the summit on 10 April. This is from Sky\u2019s Sophia McBride. Here is another item for the agenda today. Pierre Moscovici is the European commissioner covering economic and financial affairs. And 12.30pm Brussels time is 11.30am UK time. Jonathan Djanogly, a Conservative remainer, asks about reports that the EU has been war-gaming what might happen in the event of no-deal. He says it has been reported that the EU would expect the UK to go back to Brussels quickly seeking to mitigate the consequences. Barclay says it would be in the interests of both sides to minimise the negative consequences. My colleague Daniel Boffey explains what Stephen Barclay was talking about when he referred to EU leaders and the Guardian splash last week. (See 9.58am.) The Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse goes next. Q: If a confirmatory referendum were attached to the PM\u2019s deal, would you vote against it? Barclay says there are no preconditions to the talks with Labour. But he says a second referendum would prolong uncertainty, and could take the UK back to the starting point. He goes on: But we will need to look at this. He has his own views, he says. Q: Is it a red line for you? Barclay says he does not think there should be a second referendum. That is his personal view. The prime minister will have the discussions and we will see where they lead. Back in the Brexit committee, Stephen Crabb, the Conservative former cabinet minister, is asking the questions now. Q: Are you preparing for the possibility that the EU refuses a further extension? Barclay says that is possible. Any one EU leader could veto a further extension. Q: Do you feel patience with the UK is running out? Barclay says many EU leaders have expressed their frustration. He refers to EU leaders with last week\u2019s Guardian headline after the failure of the first round of indicative votes (the \u201cNo. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.\u201d headline.) (Presumably he is referring to EU leaders tweeting it.) Q: What are the Brexit compromises you would refuse to accept? Barclay does not give a specific answer. But he says it is important to look at Brexit as a whole, not single issues in isolation. He says he felt people were overstating the dangers of the backstop. With regard to a soft Brexit generally, he says it will be important to compare the balance of risks between alternative approaches. Nigel Adams has resigned as a whip and a junior minister for Wales because he is opposed to Theresa May\u2019s decision to try to reach a deal with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit. In his resignation letter, he says he thinks that May has made a \u201cgrave error\u201d that will lead to the UK staying in the customs union. He says: I and many others agreed with your previous position that no deal is better than a bad deal. It now seems that you and your cabinet have decided that a deal - cooked up with a Marxist who has never once in his political life put British interests first \u2013 is better than no deal. I profoundly disagree with this approach and I have therefore decided that I must reluctantly tender my resignation. Q: Will the talks with Corbyn start today? Yes, says Barclay. Q: Will the government be talking to other parties? Barclay says the government has spoken to other parties already. But the Conservatives and Labour both promised in their manifesto to honour the results of the 2016 referendum. And \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d. And agreement between the Tories and Labour would be the best way forward, he says. He says there are \u201careas of common ground\u201d between Labour and the Tories that are not reflected in the public debate. For example, many Labour MPs accept the withdrawal agreement, but have problems with the political declaration. On dynamic alignment (ensuring that, if the EU improves workers\u2019 rights, the UK would match those improvements), Barclay says the government has already given a commitment to match the EU during this parliament. So the gap between Labour (which is insisting on dynamic alignment for the future) and the government is smaller than people think, he says. Q: You talk about binding indicative votes. So, if the Commons voted for a customs union, would the government accept that? Barclay says the government wants to reach agreement with Labour. Q: The PM said in her statement that the government would abide by what MPs voted for. Benn reads out from what May said last night. She said: However, if we cannot agree on a single unified approach, then we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the house in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue. Crucially, the government stands ready to abide by the decision of the house. Barclay says he would have concerns about a customs union. But, as he said on Today, there is \u201cremorseless logic\u201d from the Commons numbers. The government could end up with an \u201cunpalatable choice\u201d between a softer Brexit and an everlasting extension. Q: Will a new statutory instrument be required to change exit day? Barclay says he does not want to point out potential flaws in the Cooper bill. Q: But if exit day changes, won\u2019t there have to be a new statutory instrument? Barclay says that is correct. Q: What will happen if the EU does not offer the extension the UK wants, but a long one instead? Would the government come back to parliament? Barclay jokes that Benn himself should be answering questions himself, because he is backing the Cooper bill going through the Commons today. He refers to the Cooper bill as \u201cyour legislation\u201d when addressing Benn. He says the bill says, if the EU offers an alternative length extension to the one proposed by the government, the PM would have to return to the Commons to put that to a vote. Q: If the UK does not hold European elections, will it have to leave by 22 May? Barclay says, if the UK wanted an extension beyond 22 May, EU leaders would want to know why. They would want to know why, after three years of not reaching an agreement, the UK might agree something after May. He says the government does not want an extension beyond 22 May. And he says Theresa May is on record as saying she is opposed to an extension going beyond the end of June. Q: Why is the government making contingency plans for European elections? Barclay says, if there were a general election, the cabinet secretary might insist on the European parliamentary elections going ahead, in order not to fetter a possible future government. Barclay says, if the UK does not hold European elections, it will not be able to get a long extension. It is not the intention to hold a general election. But if there was a scenario where a general election, for whatever reason, were triggered, I suspect \u2013 and it would be a matter for the cabinet secretary \u2013 that the cabinet secretary might say in that instance, in order not to fetter a future government, the European parliamentary elections would need to be held. That\u2019s why the contingency has been put in place, to ensure that returning officers are able to prepare. The Brexit committee hearing with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has started. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, starts by asking about a tweet from Barclay\u2019s department criticising the common market 2.0 amendment. It was quickly deleted. Why was that? Barclay says he does not know why. He accepts it might have been because that was judged too political. Q: When will the PM apply for an article 50 extension? Barclay says Theresa May intends to meet Jeremy Corbyn today, to see if there is scope for common ground on Brexit. The PM would have to ask for a further extension at the EU summit on Wednesday next week. But it would be normal to submit papers before. Q: So when might that happen? Barclay says first there will be talks with Corbyn. Then there might be binding indicative votes. He says the UK still wants to be out of the EU by 22 May. But it has no automatic right to an extension until then, he says. Barclay says UK still wants to leave EU by 22 May. With her deal failing in parliament, for months Theresa May has a choice: reconcile herself to a no-deal, which is what her Brexiter party wanted; or tack towards a softer Brexit, which is what the remainer parliament would prefer. For months, where at all possible, she avoided taking sides. But last night, in her statement after the day-long cabinet meeting (full text here), she decisively came off the fence. By proposing to negotiate a Brexit compromise with Jeremy Corbyn, she chose a soft Brexit over no deal. Or, at least, she appeared to. Nothing has been very definitive in this process, and we still have no idea where this will end up. Here is our overnight summary of the story. This morning Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has been giving interviews. Here are the main points. Barclay said the \u201cremorseless logic\u201d of the House of Commons was pushing the UK towards a softer Brexit. He told the Today programme: It\u2019s undesirable but it\u2019s the remorseless logic of the numbers of the House of Commons. The prime minister\u2019s deal won\u2019t go through and no deal in law is taken off the table, then the consequence of that is either a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all. And he used the phrase a second time too. It\u2019s regrettable that what we have been saying for several months now is coming to pass but that is the remorseless logic of not backing the prime minister\u2019s deal. Because the alternative then is to have to seek votes from the opposition benches because 35 of my own colleagues would not support the prime minister\u2019s deal. He implied that the government was resigned to the Yvette Cooper bill, that would require the PM to request an article 50 extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit, becoming law. He said: The prime minister cannot ignore the law, and parliament will seek to pass a law on the issue of no deal. It has already voted to take no deal off the table. So that is the reality, and if that is the legal position reached by parliament, that is something ministers cannot ignore. He said there were no preconditions for May\u2019s talks with Corbyn. But that does not mean the government was offering him \u201ca blank cheque\u201d, said Barclay, stressing that he found the idea of a customs union \u201chighly undesirable\u201d. He also said the idea of having a second referendum would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the government to accept. He said that. if the May/Corbyn talks did not lead to a compromise deal, MPs could be asked to take part in more indicative votes on the way ahead. But the new votes might be binding, he said. We are going to hear more from Barclay in a moment because he is giving evidence to the Brexit committee. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 9.45am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to a Lords committee about a no-deal Brexit. 10am: The People\u2019s Vote campaign holds a press conference. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 1pm: MPs debate the business motion setting aside today for the debate on Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill requiring the PM to request an article 50 extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit. There is also an amendment saying next Monday should be set aside for another indicative votes debate. 1.30pm: The National Police Chiefs Council hold a briefing on police preparations for Brexit. After 5pm: MPs are due to start debating the Cooper bill (assuming the business motion passes). The second reading vote would be at 7pm, and the final votes at 10pm. Afternoon: May is due to meet Corbyn to discuss Brexit. Today I will be focusing exclusively on Brexit and I will be covering breaking news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

The chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, Martin Hewitt, warned \u201cprominent individuals\u201d involved in the protracted Brexit debate should avoid inciting anger given the \u201cfebrile\u201d and \u201cemotive\u201d atmosphere, amid concerns of violence and disorder. Hewitt said: \u201cThis is highly emotive ... I think there is a responsibility on those individuals that have a platform, and have a voice, to communicate in a way that is temperate and is not in any way going to inflame people\u2019s views or cause any actions out of there. \u201cI think we are in an incredibly febrile atmosphere. There is a lot of angry talk that you can pick up if you look across social media.\u201d He said it was \u201cincumbent on anybody in a position of responsibility and who has a voice to just think carefully about the way they express their views\u201d to avoid inciting unwanted behaviour. The NPCC lead for Brexit planning, chief constable Charlie Hall, said at least 10,000 officers trained in quelling disorder were ready for deployment across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and trained in tactics to tackle looting in the event of shortages and violence if tensions spill over. That was a greater contingent of officers, Hall said, than deployed to reinforce local forces during the 2011 riots across England, the worst since the end of the second world war. Police have refreshed tactics in case they are pitched into conflicts between citizens triggered by Brexit, amid fears a no-deal could lead to shortages of medicines, some food and other key goods. Hall said reinforcements to forces of at least 10,000 could start within an hour of a request and take eight hours to fully deliver. He stressed police had no intelligence of disorder but he insisted, given the uncertainty, forces had to plan for a worst-case scenario. Some in policing fear regular services would be decimated if a national mobilisation was needed. Hall said: \u201cWe would easily run at that pace for the first seven days.\u201d But after that officers may have to work 12-hour shifts and \u201cnon-core\u201d police activity could be cut, such as training, community work and crime prevention work. The military could be used and police and army chiefs have held talks about how they could be used if needed. Hall said police would not guard supply chains for medicines and food because those responsible had enough time to put plans into place and police feared being stretched too thin. Ports would be expected to \u201cpolice\u201d any queues themselves with uniformed police officers on standby if crimes were committed.

It\u2019s your responsibility to look at your individual supply chains and you should not be looking to police to come in and supplement to keep your supply chains running.\u201d Officers are being trained in case Northern Ireland needs reinforcements, with up to 1,000 mainland officers being taught tactics needed in the region. Hall said 15 out of 43 forces in England and Wales had put some restrictions on leave, and two forces, Kent and Hampshire, had requested mutual aid and discussions had been held with others in case they needed it. He said there had been 37 Brexit-related crimes in the last fortnight, half of which were malicious communication, with other offences including verbal abuse and harassment.
