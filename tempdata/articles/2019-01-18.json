      "bodyText": "The Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley Jr has been urged by a fellow MP to reimburse a charity for the price of a first-class plane ticket to New York. The North Antrim MP travelled to the city in February 2018 to participate in a seminar about Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. According to the House of Commons register of interests, he received \u00a36,327 to cover a \u00a35,925 flight and \u00a3402 for accommodation from the peace-building charity Co-operation Ireland. The Republic of Ireland\u2019s deputy premier, Simon Coveney, flew economy on the budget airline Norwegian Air to attend the seminar, with his expenses covered by the Irish government. Norwegian Air economy return flights to New York from Dublin this month are advertised for as little as \u20ac193 (\u00a3170). The SDLP said the former Foyle MP Mark Durkan had also flown economy to New York with the cost covered by Co-operation Ireland. The Sinn F\u00e9in MP Michelle Gildernew called on Paisley to reimburse the costs to the charity after being contacted by people who had taken part in Co-operation Ireland fundraising events and said they were \u201cabsolutely disgusted and sickened that this expense was covered\u201d. Co-operation Ireland said it did not wish to comment on the figures, which were disclosed by the Irish News, a Belfast-based newspaper. Paisley refused to comment on the matter as he attended an event at Ballymena town hall on Friday. The DUP also declined to comment. Last year the politician was suspended from the Commons for 30 days for \u201cserious misconduct\u201d for failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka, paid for by the country\u2019s government, in 2013. The controversy led to the first recall petition in British parliamentary history being launched in an attempt to unseat Paisley and trigger a byelection in his North Antrim constituency. But the recall petition fell just short of the number of signatures required to force a byelection. Paisley would have lost his seat if 10% of the electorate \u2013 7,543 \u2013 signed the petition.

No one is going to tell me that is helping us prepare for Europe.\u201d Exeter, either way, are determined not to die wondering, having underperformed at Glasgow at this point last year. \u201cAs we see it, this weekend\u2019s game is effectively a last-16 knockout game,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cYes, there have been frustrations with earlier parts of the competition but now we\u2019ve given ourselves a genuine shot of progressing. Undoubtedly, if we were to win and get through to the quarter-finals, it would rank as our best moment in the competition so far.\u201d The Chiefs have made only one enforced change to their starting XV, with England prop Harry Williams replacing the indisposed Tomas Francis at tight-head, and Baxter would love his side to atone for several narrow pool defeats in Ireland over the years. \u201cIf someone said to me what\u2019s the difference between the Irish and the English clubs at the moment I\u2019d say their playing groups are just a bit different in their level of maturity. It\u2019s fairly cyclical.\u201d The Chiefs, however, have already played Munster twice this season, including a pre-season fixture in Cork, and have yet to be beaten. \u201cWinning this game will be tough and needing to win by four clear points makes it even tougher,\u201d acknowledged Baxter. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a fantastic challenge but I kind of want it to be. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in celebrating these competitions because they\u2019re good. People watch them and go: \u2018Crikey, what a game of rugby.\u2019 There are all kinds of challenges but people forget that\u2019s what makes the Heineken Cup so good. If it means not so many English clubs get through is that necessarily a bad thing? Are we trying to create a competition between teams who are all exactly the same? If we lose a hugely intense game so be it but at least we\u2019ll have taken part in something worth taking part in.\u201d The Chiefs\u2019 England loosehead Ben Moon, set to play a crucial second-half role off the bench, also predicts Exeter will be right up for it. \u201cWe do seem to play well when there\u2019s a bit riding on it and we can go for it. We\u2019ll be going in all guns blazing. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t have a good result.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un will hold a second summit near the end of next month, the White House has announced, after the president held an Oval Office meeting with a North Korean emissary. Kim Yong-chol, North Korea\u2019s top negotiator and a veteran spy chief, met the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for about an hour in a Washington hotel, and then spent a bit more than an hour and a half with Trump in the Oval Office, before leaving for a lunch with Pompeo, to discuss more details. After the envoy left the White House, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, put out a statement confirming that another summit with Kim Jong-un would take place, but a venue had not yet been decided. Sanders said Trump and Kim Yong-chol had discussed \u201cdenuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February\u201d. \u201cThe president looks forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at a place to be announced at a later date,\u201d she added. US diplomats have been scouting locations in the Pacific for the second summit, including Hanoi, Bangkok and Hawaii, with the Vietnamese capital currently seen as the more likely. As one of the outcomes of Friday\u2019s Oval Office meeting, the US special envoy, Stephen Biegun, is due to meet his North Korean counterpart, Choe Son-hui, in Stockholm over the weekend to try to develop an agenda for the summit. The North Koreans had hitherto declined to meet with Biegun. \u201cSince Singapore, the negotiations have consistently hit a brick wall,\u201d Suzanne DiMaggio, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. \u201cBiegun meeting with Choe is progress. The key will be to see how those talks go \u2013 if they meet regularly and interact closely. They don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d Since the first summit in Singapore in June, North Korea has continued its pause in nuclear and missile tests, and Trump has called off joint military exercises between US and South Korean forces, but it has not led to any substantial dismantling of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme that Trump claimed would follow from the Singapore summit. Instead, there has been evidence that North Korea is continuing uranium enrichment and has stepped up missile production. This week the vice-president, Mike Pence, conceded that Washington was still \u201cwaiting for concrete steps\u201d from the Kim\u2019s regime, and the US unveiled a plan for a significantly expanded missile defence system, much of it designed to counter what the Pentagon termed \u201can extraordinary threat\u201d from North Korea. For its part, the Pyongyang regime has insisted that it will not unilaterally disarm, and has demanded the relaxation of international sanctions before offering any more concessions on its nuclear programme. Kim Jong-un is also demanding security guarantees from the US, and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean conflict. Asked on Friday what had been achieved since Singapore, Sanders said there had been \u201cvery good steps in good faith from the North Koreans\u201d, but she added that pressure and sanctions would continue until \u201cwe see fully and verified denuclearization\u201d. DiMaggio, who has taken part in backchannel contacts with Pyongyang in the past, said that both sides would aim for an \u201cinterim agreement\u201d, well short of complete disarmament. She thought that the US would put less emphasis on a demand for an inventory of North Korean arsenal, and could accept a North Korean offer to close down its reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. In return, DiMaggio added, the US could offer to make a \u201cpeace declaration\u201d ending the 1950-53 Korean war, paving the way eventually for a formal peace treaty, and relax enforcement of some sanctions. The North Korean former spy chief returned to the US capital at a time when Trump is under intense pressure from a special counsel investigation into his campaign\u2019s links to the Kremlin, and he is locked into a struggle with Congress that has led to a partial government shutdown. \u201cI sense a little bit of desperation on the part of the president to try and get a meeting to take all of the attention away from everything else,\u201d Victor Cha, a former national security council official, told NBC News.",

Of course it\u2019s possible to win some games defending 250, or 220, or 180. It\u2019s just less likely than it ever was. Players are schooled in acceleration and have lost any reservation about attack, and that will define the coming World Cup.</p> <p>The way England have played for the last couple of years is relentless: a wave of players coming out to drive the pace, each sure of their place in the team and unconcerned with losing their wicket. These are no wild sloggers but controlled hitters. Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy give way to Alex Hales, to Eoin Morgan, to Jos Buttler, all the way down the order. This is how they rattled up a world-record 481 against Australia less than nine months ago.</p> <p>Finch is this kind of player, and Australia desperately need their captain to rediscover his best. He was outstanding last year until he was picked in Australia\u2019s Test side, then his white-ball form vanished. \u201cHe\u2019s got 11 one-day hundreds, he\u2019ll be right,\u201d said Langer. He can have a rest during this Test series, spend a bit more time in his own bed.\u201d And that\u2019s probably what he needs, a rest after a taxing few months. But the intense months of lead-up to the World Cup won\u2019t allow much of it.</p> <p>Equally, the bowling in this series looked piecemeal. Billy Stanlake plays like T20 is his game: outstanding for a couple of early overs, fading thereafter. Peter Siddle was a curious selection that didn\u2019t come off. Jason Behrendorff and Jhye Richardson had their moments, with Richardson knocking over Kohli a couple of times, but both were largely handled fairly comfortably. The Test pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Patrick Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will return, but whether they can click together in the 50-over format is largely untested.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/09/australia-sri-lanka-test-series-squad-announcement\">Pucovski, Burns and Renshaw in Australia squad for Sri Lanka series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spin will be key at the World Cup, with most teams likely to play a couple of specialists. Australia currently can\u2019t play spin and isn\u2019t much good at bowling it. The reluctance to pick more than one spinner also reflects in a shortfall of ready candidates. Adam Zampa has as much ability as anyone but has been left out of these sides more often than he\u2019s been picked. Ditto Nathan Lyon, who has pedigree with the white ball domestically but has never been persisted with internationally. Neither took a wicket in their limited chances this series.</p> <p>Langer took a worldly view about playing such a good Indian side. \u201cThey give us really great role models for what we should be aspiring to. As hard as it is to lose, I\u2019ll be amazed if our young guys don\u2019t learn a lot from playing against these guys this summer. There is no better lesson for a young player than to rub shoulders with great players of the game.\u201d</p> <p>This is sensible, and true. But with the 50-over game evolving as it always has, there\u2019s a need to look to the rest of the world in how teams are assembled, not just how they play on the field.</p>",

The way England have played for the last couple of years is relentless: a wave of players coming out to drive the pace, each sure of their place in the team and unconcerned with losing their wicket. These are no wild sloggers but controlled hitters. Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy give way to Alex Hales, to Eoin Morgan, to Jos Buttler, all the way down the order. This is how they rattled up a world-record 481 against Australia less than nine months ago. Finch is this kind of player, and Australia desperately need their captain to rediscover his best. He was outstanding last year until he was picked in Australia\u2019s Test side, then his white-ball form vanished. \u201cHe\u2019s got 11 one-day hundreds, he\u2019ll be right,\u201d said Langer. He can have a rest during this Test series, spend a bit more time in his own bed.\u201d And that\u2019s probably what he needs, a rest after a taxing few months. But the intense months of lead-up to the World Cup won\u2019t allow much of it. Equally, the bowling in this series looked piecemeal. Billy Stanlake plays like T20 is his game: outstanding for a couple of early overs, fading thereafter. Peter Siddle was a curious selection that didn\u2019t come off. Jason Behrendorff and Jhye Richardson had their moments, with Richardson knocking over Kohli a couple of times, but both were largely handled fairly comfortably. The Test pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Patrick Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will return, but whether they can click together in the 50-over format is largely untested. Spin will be key at the World Cup, with most teams likely to play a couple of specialists. Australia currently can\u2019t play spin and isn\u2019t much good at bowling it. The reluctance to pick more than one spinner also reflects in a shortfall of ready candidates. Adam Zampa has as much ability as anyone but has been left out of these sides more often than he\u2019s been picked. Ditto Nathan Lyon, who has pedigree with the white ball domestically but has never been persisted with internationally. Neither took a wicket in their limited chances this series. Langer took a worldly view about playing such a good Indian side. \u201cThey give us really great role models for what we should be aspiring to. As hard as it is to lose, I\u2019ll be amazed if our young guys don\u2019t learn a lot from playing against these guys this summer. There is no better lesson for a young player than to rub shoulders with great players of the game.\u201d This is sensible, and true. But with the 50-over game evolving as it always has, there\u2019s a need to look to the rest of the world in how teams are assembled, not just how they play on the field.",

      "bodyText": "When Adriana Buccianti\u2019s son Daniel died of a drug overdose at the Rainbow Serpent music festival in 2012, she wanted to blame someone. \u201cI was just so distressed that I guess I wanted someone hung and quartered,\u201d she told Guardian Australia from her home in Victoria this week. \u201cI think that kind of knee-jerk reaction from grief makes you do all sort of stuff. I called initially for the festival to be closed. I think I said things like, \u2018if the police didn\u2019t find drugs on people, they weren\u2019t looking hard enough\u2019. I was in a terrible headspace.\u201d But in the seven years since her son died, Buccianti has managed to put her anger behind her. She\u2019s now an advocate for the introduction of pill testing, and has spoken at the opening of the Rainbow Serpent festival to caution festival-goers to take of themselves and each other. She\u2019s also the author of a petition on Change.org with more than 93,000 signatures calling for the New South Wales and Victorian premiers Gladys Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews to allow pill testing at music festivals. She puts part of the change down to a conversation with a friend of her son\u2019s, who asked whether she wanted to \u201cdestroy everything that he loved\u201d. \u201cAnd I thought, no, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the year after Daniel died I got an automated call to purchase early-bird tickets for Rainbow, and I had to make this sliding-doors decision of what do I do here. \u201cI just said, \u2018please don\u2019t forget my son died on your grounds\u2019, and it set off this chain of events.\u201d On Friday, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians joined the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners as well as the former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Palmer in calling for pill testing to be allowed at festivals. There have been five deaths from suspected drug overdoses at music festivals in NSW since the middle of September. Central coast teenager Alex Ross-King, 19, became the latest victim after she was rushed from the FOMO festival at Parramatta park last Saturday. Ross-King\u2019s grandmother, Denise Doig, has also called for Berejiklian to allow pill-testing. \u201cPremier, please can we have this pill-testing done?\u201d Doig told Channel Ten after Ross-King\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s such a small thing to do. It\u2019s not hard [and], if it saves one life, one life is a life.\u201d Saturday would have been Daniel Buccianti\u2019s 41st birthday, and Adriana admits to feeling frustrated by the lack of action since his death. She said seeing the number of deaths still occurring at festivals sometimes acted as a trigger. \u201cDo you get re-traumatised again? Yeah, you do,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no two ways about it. You get re-traumatised in the sense that you know what those people are going to go through. There\u2019s the autopsy, and the coroner, and the toxicology report. It\u2019s brutal, it tells you everything, not just, \u2018your son died of this\u2019. \u201cAnd it all takes months to come back so you\u2019re left just wondering \u2018how could this have happened\u2019? \u201cThen there\u2019s the stigma of losing your child to an overdose. The comments you get whenever a story comes out. The horrific stuff people say to you, like \u2018your son deserved this\u2019, that \u2018it was natural selection\u2019.\u201d She said Berejiklian should \u201cput herself in any of our positions, those of us who have lost children to something avoidable\u201d. Not every parent of a drug overdose victim feels the same, however. Tony Wood, the father of 15-year-old Anna Wood who died in 1995, has been a vocal opponent of pill testing, saying it would not make taking drugs safer. \u201cPill testing is another lark thought up by the pro-legalisation lobby,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph in January. \u201cIf it was going to save any parent from the heartache of losing a child, I would be all for it. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any situation where it would work.\u201d Julie Davis, whose son Stefan Woodward died of an overdose at the Stereosonic festival in Adelaide in 2015, also told Guardian Australia she did not support pill testing. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018say no to drugs\u2019?\u201d she asked. She said festival organisers should be \u201caccountable for deaths that occur\u201d on their watch, and called for \u201cmore first aid tents so no one waits in line waiting to be helped \u2026 free water, more paramedics walking around [who] know the signs of dehydration [and] huge fines or jail time [for people caught] with drugs.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Few people are shopping at the Beijing Yintai Centre, a high-end mall in the Chinese capital\u2019s central business district. Store clerks say foot traffic has been low, even when holiday discounts were offered. Office workers walk past empty shops like Hermes, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Cartier, eating fruit they have brought for lunch. Li Xin, 33, who works for a security company nearby, likes to check out the selection of handbags. Her favourites are Chanel and Tom Ford. But recently, she has decided to cut back. \u201cThis year I didn\u2019t buy any new bags, because everyone has been saying: \u2018Winter is coming\u2019,\u201d she said. For the many businesses that depend on the spending power of China\u2019s middle class, winter has already arrived. After decades of breakneck growth, the world\u2019s second largest economy is slowing down, and Chinese consumers are feeling the pinch. As their country goes into what could be its slowest year of growth in decades, just above 6%, Chinese residents face rising living costs and debt, stagnating wages and worries about job security. Many have seen their savings wiped out in peer-to-peer lending scams, as Chinese stocks reached new lows last year, and as the property market, the largest store of household wealth in China, declined. As a result, Chinese shoppers are abandoning iPhones for cheaper Chinese-made smartphones, buying fewer Swiss watches and travelling less. Many couples have decided against having a second child because of the cost. The term \u201cconsumption downgrade\u201d has become popular online, as netizens swap advice about how to save money. China\u2019s slowdown is the result of a government campaign to rein in excessive debt and calm property prices. \u201cThen came the trade war, which hasn\u2019t had a huge direct effect on the economy, but has eliminated the sense of certainty and stability central to business and consumer confidence,\u201d said Scott Kennedy of CSIS in Washington. What Chinese consumers can and cannot spend matters. Domestic consumption accounted for a little more than three-quarters of economic growth last year. As manufacturing and trade are hit by the US tariffs, the country\u2019s policymakers are looking to its citizens to offset those losses. \u201cConsumer spending plays a very important role. If it falls, the impact on the economy will be large,\u201d said Ye Tan, an independent economist and analyst based in Shanghai. In theory, spending begets more spending as companies take more orders, produce more, and workers go home with more money in their pockets, according to Ye. \u201cThe whole process forms a virtuous cycle and people will have more confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cConfidence is really important.\u201d Yet confidence is thin on the ground. The core areas of Chinese consumption \u2013 property, durable goods such as electronics, and cars \u2013 have all seen sharp declines over the past year. Last year, car sales contracted in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, for the first time since 1990. Retail sales in November grew at their weakest rate in 15 years. And at least one in five apartments in China are empty, according to Gan Li, a professor at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu. International companies that rely on Chinese shoppers have begun to sound the alarm. Apple issued its first profit warning since 2002 on the back of slowing demand in China. Ermenegildo Zegna said it would be holding back store expansion in the country, one of its largest markets, because of the expected downturn. \u201cThere is a need for some other sector to step up and provide leadership of the economy. The much hyped Chinese consumer should be the most obvious candidate to do so, but rather than pick up the slack, retail and services appear to be following manufacturing down the rabbit hole,\u201d said Shehzad Qazi, managing director of China Beige Book International. The government is trying to restore confidence by cutting individual taxes and lowering mortgage requirements. In the northern province of Hebei, the government has proposed a four-day working week to encourage spending. City officials in Beijing are asking retailers to stay open for longer to foster a \u201cnight economy\u201d. Property developers have slashed prices, while electronics retailers have begun offering discounts on iPhones. Economists say these measures will take time to have any meaningful impact and some analysts expect further stimulus measures to boost the economy. Others say the structural problems in the Chinese economy cannot be fixed so easily. \u201cTurning on the credit spigots alone won\u2019t fix the problem,\u201d said Kennedy. On a Friday afternoon, the Apple store in the Sanlitun shopping district in Beijing is full, while a nearby store selling Huawei phones sits mostly empty. A worker at the Genius Bar says the store is usually even busier that today. Another store clerk says that while traffic is as much as it usually is, there is not the same clamour for new iPhones. When the latest model came out in October, there was no queue outside the store. Some argue that the idea of a \u201cconsumption downgrade\u201d is overblown and that falling iPhone sales are no barometer of the broader economy. \u201cApple has been losing relevance in the Chinese market for a variety of reasons in recent years. The brand no longer excites Chinese consumers,\u201d said Pan Yiling, senior editor of Jing Daily, which focuses on the Chinese luxury market. Pan says China\u2019s middle class consumers are becoming more strategic. Those who enjoy luxury brands are cutting back on impulsive purchases and choosing more carefully. Lu Wei, 28, who works in a radio station in Beijing, decided to opt for a fake Louis Vuitton bag to add to her collection.

      "bodyText": "For three decades, the Canadian city of Moose Jaw took pride in its status as the home of the world\u2019s largest moose statue. Standing at a majestic 10 meters tall, Mac the Moose has weathered brutal winters, graffiti and even the inglorious loss of his jaw. His recognition was so great that in 2013, he was named the city\u2019s most popular celebrity. But status and renown can be fleeting. In 2015, Norway responded with its own moose sculpture \u2013 Storelgen, or \u201cBig Elk\u201d \u2013 a glitzy stainless steel bull, erected with the explicit aim of surpassing Mac\u2019s height and stealing his place in the record books. Now, however, the Canadians are fighting back, after a pair of comedians called Norway\u2019s statue \u201can egregious offence\u201d and pleaded with Moose Jaw residents to restore the city\u2019s stolen glory. \u201cYou are a city famous around the world for the glorious name of Moose Jaw,\u201d Justin Reves told residents in a video posted to Facebook. \u201cAnd everyone that comes by, knows that this should be the world\u2019s tallest moose.\u201d Standing in front of a forlorn Mac, Reves and colleague Greg Moore implored the residents to act quickly by adding 31cm to Mac, to \u201cstick it to Oslo\u201d. The city\u2019s mayor, Fraser Tolmie, answered the call to arms. \u201cYou may not know this, but it\u2019s personal for me,\u201d he said in a Facebook video in which he divulged that the moose was named after his wife\u2019s great uncle. \u201cMac the Moose was the tallest in the world, and the people of Norway have taken that from us. I\u2019m not going to stand for it.\u201d The Norwegian moose, which stands midway between Oslo and Trondheim, measures a full 30cm taller than Mac. And Stor-Elvdal, the Norwegian municipality where it stands, has shown little appetite for backing away from the fight. \u201cWe\u2019re not letting this one go. Not a chance. We\u2019re going to do whatever we can to make sure this is the world\u2019s tallest moose \u2013 or biggest moose in the future, as well,\u201d said Linda Otnes Henriksen, Stor-Elvdal\u2019s deputy mayor, in a video posted to Facebook. Staff in the municipality have said their moose \u2013 with the artist\u2019s permission \u2013 could be doubled in size if needed, to a full 20 meters. \u201c[The Norwegians] purposely built a moose bigger than ours, but we\u2019re going to be dignified and we\u2019re going to win,\u201d Tolmie told the National Post on Thursday. Reves and Moore have set up a GoFundMe page to help hire an engineer to increase Mac\u2019s size, hoping to raise $50,000. So far, proposals include increasing the size of his antlers or putting a helmet on him. This is not the first time Mac has required intervention: in 2007, the statue was repaired at the cost of $30,000 after holes caused by vandalism and neglect opened up in its jaw. Potentially creating more headaches for Moose Jaw residents, Henriksen said she was open to crowdfunding for their sculpture, but the Norwegians were waiting to see Canadian plans for \u201cenlarging their moose\u201d. This isn\u2019t the first time Canadians have been in battle about an oversized work of public art. For two decades, the city of Duncan in British Columbia has feuded with the US town of Eveleth, Minnesota, over which is home to the world\u2019s largest hockey stick. Residents of Eveleth argue that their stick, erected in 1995, is the world\u2019s largest. But in 2008 Guinness World Records sided with Canada, handing the title to Duncan. The Minnesota town continues the fight, arguing that theirs is a real hockey stick whereas the Canadian version was merely a sculpture. To this day, they still call it the \u201cworld\u2019s largest free-standing hockey stick\u201d. The New Brunswick town of Shediac \u2013 home of an outsized concrete sculpture of a lobster \u2013 was probably asking for trouble when they named their tourist attraction \u201c\u2018the World\u2019s Largest Lobster\u201d. In a surprise to few, it was also overtaken in 2015 by Rosetown, Australia. Their contribution, only 10% larger, was named \u201cBig Lobster\u201d.",

Kelly has only appeared before a judge once, in 2008, when he was accused of making child abuse images by filming sexual encounters, including one in which he allegedly urinated over an underage girl. A jury couldn\u2019t identify the man or the girl in the video without doubt, and Kelly was acquitted. After the Lifetime series Surviving R Kelly aired, fresh investigations were launched in both Chicago and Atlanta, with prosecutors appealing for new information. Calls to the US National Sexual Assault Hotline rose by 20% and this week has also seen Kelly\u2019s former manager Henry James Mason surrendering to authorities on charges of terrorism. Mason has been accused of making threats to Timothy Savage, the father of Jocelyn Savage, a woman living with Kelly. Savage was also allegedly threatened by R Kelly\u2019s current manager, Don Russell. Kelly\u2019s lawyer Steve Greenberg called the documentary \u201canother round of stories\u201d that were created \u201cto fill reality TV time\u201d. Kelly and Sony Music have both yet to release an official statement.",

      "bodyText": "The crisis on the Lower Darling, which has seen up to 1 million fish die, is largely due to the decisions by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority on instructions from the New South Wales government, a report by the Australia Institute finds. It says the reasons for those decisions appear to be about building the case for the new Broken Hill pipeline and the Menindee Lakes project, which will see the lakes shrink and \u201csave\u201d water by reducing evaporation. \u201cIt is clear what has caused the Darling River fish kill \u2013 mismanagement and repeated policy failure,\u201d said Maryanne Slattery, senior water researcher with the Australia Institute. \u201cTo blame the fish kill on the drought is a cop-out, it is because water releases were made from the lakes when this simply shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop passing the buck. \u201cDrought and high temperatures are a factor, but a key issue is that smaller flow events now rarely reach Menindee,\u201d the institute says after a detailed analysis of flows and releases from the Menindee Lakes system. \u201cLarge floods still occur, but smaller flows to regularly replenish the system have largely stopped.\u201d Since the fish kills, Slattery, a former MDBA employee with expertise in analysing river data, has closely analysed the inflows and outflows from Menindee Lakes and and how the lakes have been managed compared with previous years. \u201cThe lakes were drained in late 2016 and 2017, with a total of 819GL released from Menindee Lakes, almost the equivalent of two Sydney harbours,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a natural phenomenon, but a management decision. \u201cSuch releases have been made in the past, but in recent times inflows from the northern basin to refill the lakes have declined significantly.\u201d According to the MDBA\u2019s own reports, 2017-18 was the third-largest cotton crop on record. \u201cWhile this year is likely to be much smaller, a substantial amount of irrigation is still occurring,\u201d she said. Meanwhile there have been decisions to release water from the lakes downstream. The full capacity of Menindee Lakes is quoted as 1,730GL, although it can hold up to 2,000GL during flood, the institute says. Under the Murray-Darling basin agreement, the management of Menindee Lakes is shared between MDBA and the NSW government. The MDBA \u201ccontrols\u201d the lakes until the lake volumes drop to 480GL, then control reverts to NSW. But the institute says when the the MDBA is in control it is guided by the basin committee made up of state ministers and by the states themselves. The decisions of this body are not public. The releases were not just about about keeping the river healthy downstream. The Australia Institute\u2019s analysis showed that a total of 89GL of environmental water \u2013 water to keep the river system healthy \u2013 was released from Menindee in the 2016-17 year. \u201cThis represents just 11% of the total releases to the Lower Darling,\u201d she said. \u201cFurthermore, no Menindee environmental releases were badged in the delivery to South Australia.\u201d Nor were they drained to meet South Australia\u2019s needs, as the NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, has suggested, Slattery said. \u201cReleases were made from Menindee Lakes in excess of South Australia\u2019s requirements,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, parts of South Australia were recovering from flooding and months of wet weather at that time.\u201d Instead, Slattery said, the lakes were drained to \u201csave evaporation\u201d. \u201cLong-standing practice by the MDBA is to prioritise releases from Menindee Lakes above other storages to minimise evaporation,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, causing an ecological disaster to avoid evaporation can hardly be described as good environmental management, particularly when downstream areas were in flood.\u201d There is nothing in the laws and regulations guiding the management of the basin that directs its managers to prioritise evaporation efficiency over environmental and community outcomes. \u201cA possible part of the answer is that the lakes were drained to justify the Menindee Lakes water-saving project, related changes to the basin plan and the related Broken Hill pipeline project,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are opposed locally and have proceeded with minimal transparency around business cases, cultural and environmental impacts. They are easier to justify if the lakes are empty and Broken Hill appears at risk of running out of water.\u201d The report also tries to answer the question who is to blame. \u201cThe MDBA coordinated the management of the lakes for most of this time and is partly responsible,\u201d Slattery said. \u201cHowever, claims by the NSW water minister that this crisis was \u2018under the control of Canberra\u2019 are false. \u201cThe MDBA coordinates the management of the lakes but does not \u2018control\u2019 it. In fact, states can direct the management of the lakes via the Ministerial Council and Basin Officials Committee.\u201d The Australia Institute report called for a full inquiry, like a royal commission, and much greater transparency on decision making by the MDBA. \u201cThere is very little transparency around exactly why the lakes were drained by the MDBA with the consent of the BOC and state governments,\u201d she said. Cotton Australia said earlier this month its crop this season would be half of the previous year\u2019s and that it was wrong to blame the industry for the fish kill. The general manager of Cotton Australia, Michael Murray, said \u201cas an industry, we are growing very tired of being \u2018the whipping boy\u2019 for all the problems that are being brought on by this crippling drought\u201d. The minister has also blamed the extreme conditions for the crisis. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss the impact of drought when in the last six months, we have had record low inflows into northern NSW rivers, with many waterways ceasing to flow and the summer heat placing further pressure on the dwindling water supplies,\u201d he said in a statement this week. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 January 2019 to correct the capacity of the Menindee Lakes from 1,730ML to 1,730GL.",

There are worries that if there is a shortage, suppliers will choose to sell in Germany or the US over the UK because they will make more money.</p> <p>Branded medicines are repriced every few years following negotiations between the government and major manufacturers. One industry figure described it as a well-oiled machine balancing companies\u2019 need for profit with the state\u2019s desire for affordability.</p> <p>Two categories of drug wholesalers come into play for most medicines: full line wholesalers, which effectively guarantee a full stock of a wide range of products and often deliver daily to pharmacists, and short line wholesalers, which specialise in high volumes of generic drugs, often at keener prices.</p> <p>At street level, there is broadly a 50/50 split between the large chains such as Boots and independent pharmacies.</p> <p>Like supermarket food, a \u201cjust in time\u201d system applies to the supply and stocking of medicines. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have real worries about the potential chaos at ports,\u201d said Mark Burdon, a pharmacist in Newcastle. \u201cThe government keeps on talking about stockpiles of several months, but that involves potentially millions of items. On the one hand, it\u2019s going to be a challenge to manage that quantity, and it\u2019s also a lot of medicines to run through what is a very lean and efficient supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>Independent pharmacies of the type run by Burdon typically get multiple deliveries each day from several suppliers. \u201cIt\u2019s based on quite thin margins, so if you dispense one pack of something, then you reorder another. You can imagine how the ripples could be felt from, say, any sort of problems at ports.

Unlike painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs, these cannot often be easily substituted with a generic alternative.</p> <p>Warrick Smith, of the BGMA, noted that the government was talking about expanding ferry capacity with different routes and giving priority lanes for medicines if needed. \u201cThe government has done a lot of preparation work for this and put in place a lot of measures to ensure the continued supply of high-quality medicines for the UK. The best way to ensure this, however, is to remain in the European regulatory system for medicines, and not to have issues at the border.\u201d</p> <p>Burdon has similar concerns. \u201cI\u2019m reminded these days of what they say about humanitarian crises.

Drugs in the UK are now significantly cheaper than in other countries as competition from more generics has driven the price down. There are worries that if there is a shortage, suppliers will choose to sell in Germany or the US over the UK because they will make more money. Branded medicines are repriced every few years following negotiations between the government and major manufacturers. One industry figure described it as a well-oiled machine balancing companies\u2019 need for profit with the state\u2019s desire for affordability. Two categories of drug wholesalers come into play for most medicines: full line wholesalers, which effectively guarantee a full stock of a wide range of products and often deliver daily to pharmacists, and short line wholesalers, which specialise in high volumes of generic drugs, often at keener prices. At street level, there is broadly a 50/50 split between the large chains such as Boots and independent pharmacies. Like supermarket food, a \u201cjust in time\u201d system applies to the supply and stocking of medicines. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have real worries about the potential chaos at ports,\u201d said Mark Burdon, a pharmacist in Newcastle. \u201cThe government keeps on talking about stockpiles of several months, but that involves potentially millions of items. On the one hand, it\u2019s going to be a challenge to manage that quantity, and it\u2019s also a lot of medicines to run through what is a very lean and efficient supply chain.\u201d Independent pharmacies of the type run by Burdon typically get multiple deliveries each day from several suppliers. \u201cIt\u2019s based on quite thin margins, so if you dispense one pack of something, then you reorder another. You can imagine how the ripples could be felt from, say, any sort of problems at ports. A minor delay would really be felt down the line.\u201d Burdon is most worried about the supply of items such as anti-psychotic medications and anti-depressants. Unlike painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs, these cannot often be easily substituted with a generic alternative. Warrick Smith, of the BGMA, noted that the government was talking about expanding ferry capacity with different routes and giving priority lanes for medicines if needed. \u201cThe government has done a lot of preparation work for this and put in place a lot of measures to ensure the continued supply of high-quality medicines for the UK. The best way to ensure this, however, is to remain in the European regulatory system for medicines, and not to have issues at the border.\u201d Burdon has similar concerns. \u201cI\u2019m reminded these days of what they say about humanitarian crises. They arise if there are shortages of food, water and medicine. Disruption to any one of those things can very soon lead to crises.\u201d",

Over the course of the tourists\u2019 four days of warm-up cricket against the Board President\u2019s XI there have been clues as to which way Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss (as well as the recently arrived Ed Smith) are leaning and it could well see two key players from the victory in Sri Lanka \u2013 Jack Leach and Adil Rashid \u2013 mixing the drinks. Jonny Bairstow\u2019s new role at No 3, one which he is dutifully (and thus far successfully) trying to crack despite a yearning to reclaim the gloves, points to an extended batting line-up. And while the pitch produced by the Kensington Oval\u2019s head groundsman, Henderson Davis, is yet to be seen, the venue\u2019s recent leaning towards seam suggests Moeen Ali may be the solitary spinner among five bowlers. In this scenario Root, who drew a 10-strong crowd of would-be Marcelo Bielsas from the travelling support as he grooved his brand of darters in the Malcolm Marshall nets on Friday , may well provide the support for a spinner who tends to prefer not being the only specialist headliner on the bill.

Marwa resettled with her family in Germany, but doctors there encouraged her to seek more sophisticated medical treatment in America following 13 operations to repair trauma from third-degree burns to her face, arms and chest. Shriners Hospitals for Children in Boston scheduled an appointment to treat Marwa in November 2018 and a volunteer agency in Massachusetts offered to provide temporary housing for her and her father.

Consular offices can issues visa waivers on a case-by-case basis, but advocates have warned these waivers are rarely granted and the process for getting one lacks transparency. Of the more than 33,176 visa applications from countries covered by the ban, about 2% were granted waivers from December 2017 to 31 May 2018, according to the state department. Last month, a Yemeni mother was only granted a visa to visit her dying two-year-old son in California after her case received worldwide attention. She had been repeatedly denied the visa before, but made it to California a week before he died. The state department said in a letter to Marwa that her visa was rejected because her application did not prove she would return to Germany.

The state department said Marwa can reapply for the visa, but it is unclear how she can provide further proof of her ties to Germany. Two members of German parliament, Britta Dassler and Martina Stamm-Fibich, wrote in support of Marwa\u2019s case this week and said there was no reason to believe she would seek to stay in the US because of her and her family\u2019s strong ties to their community in Germany. \u201cWe are impressed by the bravery Marwa has demonstrated and her exemplary integration into our city and community,\u201d their letter said. \u201c Marwa and her family epitomize the potential of a family that has suffered much hardship to integrate into their new life here in Germany,\u201d they continued. \u201cThe family has overcome significant obstacles in order to remain together.\u201d But a similar message sent in August 2018 by US senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey failed to sway the US government. \u201c Marwa\u2019s story, in the way that she continues to carry herself as a beacon of hope and support after experiencing such trauma, is one of outstanding resilience and courage,\u201d the senators wrote. In response, the state department told Warren\u2019s office it was Marwa\u2019s responsibility to prove she would return to Germany.",

      "body": "<p>It is natural that the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s age \u2013 97 \u2013 has been the focus of attention alongside other details of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/18/prince-philip-car-crash-norfolk-police-to-investigate\" title=\"\">this week\u2019s collision in Norfolk</a>, when a Land Rover he was driving turned over after hitting a car carrying a baby and two women, one of whom was treated for a broken wrist. Most 97-year-olds, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/ageing/bulletins/estimatesoftheveryoldincludingcentenarians/2015-09-30\" title=\"\">more than three-quarters of whom are women</a>, do not drive, so Prince Philip is unusual. Since the senses of sight and hearing decline as we age, and reactions get slower, it is reasonable to wonder \u2013 as the duke\u2019s family surely will, whatever the outcome of the police\u2019s investigation \u2013 if now might be a good time to hang up the driving gloves.</p> <p>There have been fatal crashes in which age-related conditions were a factor. The charity Brake has called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/18/charity-renews-call-for-elderly-driver-eye-tests-after-prince-philip-crash\" title=\"\">older drivers to take annual eye tests</a>, while the parents of Poppy-Arabella Clarke, who was three when she was killed by a pensioner who had been told to stop driving, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-44210583\" title=\"\">want doctors to report people unfit to drive</a> to the DVLA. A campaign following another fatal crash led to police being given more <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/driving-eyesight-test-lose-licence-dvla-police-a8520181.html\" title=\"\">power to revoke licences</a>. But while such cases exist, the evidence does not support the idea that older drivers are in general more dangerous than other drivers. On the contrary, young male drivers were found by one study to be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46916429\" title=\"\">four times as likely to crash</a> as the over-70s (5.3 million of whom hold licences).</p> <p>The more useful lesson to be drawn from this week\u2019s events \u2013 apart from the reminder it provides of the lifesaving power of seatbelts and baby harnesses \u2013 is that roads remain dangerous places, where a momentary lapse of attention or error of judgment can have terrible consequences. After decades of steady improvements in road safety, during which deaths in the UK were reduced from 7,985 a year in 1966 to 1,857 in 2010, progress has stalled if not stopped in the last few years. The first increase in fatalities for a decade was seen in 2011, and the most recent figures show <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-in-great-britain-provisional-estimates-year-ending-june-2018\" title=\"\">another increase in deaths</a>, although this was offset by a decrease in injuries. Vulnerable pedestrians, a category that includes older people and children, are among the groups who have fared particularly poorly, when compared with other groups including motorists, who have benefited from new vehicle safety measures.</p> <p>There is no single reason behind this change. As well as cuts to policing and justice budgets there are behavioural factors such as the use of mobile phones by drivers. Meanwhile, important initiatives, including a long-discussed government review of road traffic offences, and another review by the Sentencing Council, have got stuck in the pipeline. That this has happened while <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-safety-review\" title=\"\">a separate piece of research exclusively concerned with law-breaking cyclists</a> was rushed through last year, following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/cyclist-charlie-alliston-jailed-for-18-months-over-death-of-pedestrian\" title=\"\">high-profile trial of Charlie Alliston</a>, reflects poorly on the government. Policymakers, it appears, were more concerned to score political points than to grasp the big issues.</p> <p>Recent remarks from the prisons minister, Rory Stewart, about <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-01-12/scrap-prison-sentences-under-six-months-suggests-prisons-minister/\" title=\"\">ending short sentences</a> makes the issue more urgent. If law-breaking drivers are not to be jailed, alternatives must be developed. The increased use of driving bans is one strong option. Data collection must also be improved. Currently, roads policing is not properly inspected, while many injuries are not reported. The subject is not glamorous. But it only takes one encounter with a family bereaved in traumatic circumstances to remind any of us how much it matters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is natural that the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s age \u2013 97 \u2013 has been the focus of attention alongside other details of this week\u2019s collision in Norfolk, when a Land Rover he was driving turned over after hitting a car carrying a baby and two women, one of whom was treated for a broken wrist. Most 97-year-olds, more than three-quarters of whom are women, do not drive, so Prince Philip is unusual. Since the senses of sight and hearing decline as we age, and reactions get slower, it is reasonable to wonder \u2013 as the duke\u2019s family surely will, whatever the outcome of the police\u2019s investigation \u2013 if now might be a good time to hang up the driving gloves. There have been fatal crashes in which age-related conditions were a factor. The charity Brake has called for older drivers to take annual eye tests, while the parents of Poppy-Arabella Clarke, who was three when she was killed by a pensioner who had been told to stop driving, want doctors to report people unfit to drive to the DVLA. A campaign following another fatal crash led to police being given more power to revoke licences. But while such cases exist, the evidence does not support the idea that older drivers are in general more dangerous than other drivers. On the contrary, young male drivers were found by one study to be four times as likely to crash as the over-70s (5.3 million of whom hold licences). The more useful lesson to be drawn from this week\u2019s events \u2013 apart from the reminder it provides of the lifesaving power of seatbelts and baby harnesses \u2013 is that roads remain dangerous places, where a momentary lapse of attention or error of judgment can have terrible consequences. After decades of steady improvements in road safety, during which deaths in the UK were reduced from 7,985 a year in 1966 to 1,857 in 2010, progress has stalled if not stopped in the last few years. The first increase in fatalities for a decade was seen in 2011, and the most recent figures show another increase in deaths, although this was offset by a decrease in injuries. Vulnerable pedestrians, a category that includes older people and children, are among the groups who have fared particularly poorly, when compared with other groups including motorists, who have benefited from new vehicle safety measures. There is no single reason behind this change. As well as cuts to policing and justice budgets there are behavioural factors such as the use of mobile phones by drivers. Meanwhile, important initiatives, including a long-discussed government review of road traffic offences, and another review by the Sentencing Council, have got stuck in the pipeline. That this has happened while a separate piece of research exclusively concerned with law-breaking cyclists was rushed through last year, following the high-profile trial of Charlie Alliston, reflects poorly on the government. Policymakers, it appears, were more concerned to score political points than to grasp the big issues. Recent remarks from the prisons minister, Rory Stewart, about ending short sentences makes the issue more urgent. If law-breaking drivers are not to be jailed, alternatives must be developed. The increased use of driving bans is one strong option. Data collection must also be improved. Currently, roads policing is not properly inspected, while many injuries are not reported. The subject is not glamorous. But it only takes one encounter with a family bereaved in traumatic circumstances to remind any of us how much it matters.",

      "body": "<p>The Duke of Edinburgh has undergone hospital checks on his doctor\u2019s advice following his car accident in which two women received minor injuries and a baby escaped unhurt.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip, 97, went to the local hospital near the Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Friday, but was found to have no injuries of concern.</p> <p>Norfolk police are investigating Thursday\u2019s accident and said \u201cappropriate action will be taken\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement, the palace said: \u201cOn doctor\u2019s advice, the Duke of Edinburgh visited the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King\u2019s Lynn this morning for a precautionary check-up. This confirmed His Royal Highness had no injuries of concern. The Duke has returned to Sandringham.\u201d Philip is also said to have been in contact privately with the two women who were injured, and exchanged \u201cwell-wishes\u201d.</p> <p>As Philip recovered at Sandringham on Friday, further details emerged of the collision which left him \u201cvery shaken and shocked\u201d , but otherwise uninjured.</p> <p>Roy Warne, 75, who was driving home, described seeing the prince\u2019s Land Rover Freelander tumbling across the road after the collision, as he pulled out of the B1439 near the Queen\u2019s Norfolk estate on to the A149.</p> <p>The car flipped on to its side after colliding with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old baby. The women sustained minor injuries and required hospital treatment, but were later discharged, police said.</p> <p>Both drivers were breath-tested and provided negative readings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/17/prince-philip-involved-in-car-accident-near-sandringham\">Prince Philip involved in car crash near Sandringham estate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Norfolk police confirmed the baby boy in the Kia was uninjured.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \u201cThe driver of the Kia, a 28-year-old woman, suffered cuts to her knee, while the passenger, a 45-year-old woman, sustained a broken wrist. Both casualties were treated at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King\u2019s Lynn and were discharged last night.</p> <p>\u201cAs is standard procedure with injury collisions, the incident will be investigated and any appropriate action taken. We are aware of the public interest in this case, however, as with any other investigation, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out.\u201d</p> <p>Warne told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he and another man helped free the baby from the first vehicle. Warne then helped get the prince out of his wrecked Land Rover.</p> <p>\u201cI was driving home and I saw a car come out from a side road and it rolled and ended up on the other side of the road, and there was a huge collision with another car,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said the prince was trapped with his legs in the well of the car. \u201cI asked him to move his left leg and that freed his right leg and then I helped him get out,\u201d Warne said.</p> <p>\u201cThe roof was where the window should have been because it was on its side. I think I helped him out through either the sunroof or the front windscreen, but I\u2019m a bit blurred about that.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what the prince had said during the rescue, Warne replied: \u201cI can\u2019t remember, but it was nothing rude. He was obviously shaken, and then he went and asked if everyone else was all right.\u201d</p> <p>Prince Philip was able to stand and walk, but there was \u201ca little blood\u201d, he said, suggesting the prince had been cut, possibly by broken glass.</p> <p>Warne said of the crash: \u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt that it was hit [by the prince\u2019s car] . That\u2019s my recollection.\u201d</p> <p>Of Prince Philip\u2019s vehicle, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see it come from the side road. I saw it careering and tumbling across the road and ending up on the other side. It would take a massive force and it had rolled on the other side as well.\u201d</p> <p>The prince was taken to Sandringham, where he was seen by a doctor as a precautionary measure, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday.</p> <p>On Friday, Norfolk county council, which coincidentally had been scheduled to discuss safety measures on the A149 where the collision took place, approved plans for the speed limit to be lowered from 60mph to 50mph and to implement an average speed monitoring system.</p> <p>Older drivers must renew their driving licence every three years after they turn 70, but are not required to retake a driving test, and there are no laws on what age you must stop driving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-18T10:51:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Age chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2019-01-18T10:51:59/embed.html\">Age chart</a> </figure>  <p>Buckingham Palace said: \u201cThe Duke of Edinburgh has a valid driving licence and completes all the usual DVLA processes.\u201d It would not give further specifics on the prince\u2019s licence.</p> <p>The Queen does not have a driving licence, as she is exempt from the law and learned to drive with the army in 1945, when she was 19 and joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service during the second world war.</p> <p>Princess Anne, asked by journalists how her father was during an engagement at Edge Hill University in Lancashire on Friday, replied: \u201cNo idea.

      "bodyText": "The Duke of Edinburgh has undergone hospital checks on his doctor\u2019s advice following his car accident in which two women received minor injuries and a baby escaped unhurt. Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip, 97, went to the local hospital near the Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Friday, but was found to have no injuries of concern. Norfolk police are investigating Thursday\u2019s accident and said \u201cappropriate action will be taken\u201d. In a statement, the palace said: \u201cOn doctor\u2019s advice, the Duke of Edinburgh visited the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King\u2019s Lynn this morning for a precautionary check-up. This confirmed His Royal Highness had no injuries of concern. The Duke has returned to Sandringham.\u201d Philip is also said to have been in contact privately with the two women who were injured, and exchanged \u201cwell-wishes\u201d. As Philip recovered at Sandringham on Friday, further details emerged of the collision which left him \u201cvery shaken and shocked\u201d , but otherwise uninjured. Roy Warne, 75, who was driving home, described seeing the prince\u2019s Land Rover Freelander tumbling across the road after the collision, as he pulled out of the B1439 near the Queen\u2019s Norfolk estate on to the A149. The car flipped on to its side after colliding with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old baby. The women sustained minor injuries and required hospital treatment, but were later discharged, police said. Both drivers were breath-tested and provided negative readings. Norfolk police confirmed the baby boy in the Kia was uninjured. A spokesman said: \u201cThe driver of the Kia, a 28-year-old woman, suffered cuts to her knee, while the passenger, a 45-year-old woman, sustained a broken wrist. Both casualties were treated at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King\u2019s Lynn and were discharged last night. \u201cAs is standard procedure with injury collisions, the incident will be investigated and any appropriate action taken. We are aware of the public interest in this case, however, as with any other investigation, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out.\u201d Warne told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he and another man helped free the baby from the first vehicle. Warne then helped get the prince out of his wrecked Land Rover. \u201cI was driving home and I saw a car come out from a side road and it rolled and ended up on the other side of the road, and there was a huge collision with another car,\u201d he said. He said the prince was trapped with his legs in the well of the car. \u201cI asked him to move his left leg and that freed his right leg and then I helped him get out,\u201d Warne said. \u201cThe roof was where the window should have been because it was on its side. I think I helped him out through either the sunroof or the front windscreen, but I\u2019m a bit blurred about that.\u201d Asked what the prince had said during the rescue, Warne replied: \u201cI can\u2019t remember, but it was nothing rude. He was obviously shaken, and then he went and asked if everyone else was all right.\u201d Prince Philip was able to stand and walk, but there was \u201ca little blood\u201d, he said, suggesting the prince had been cut, possibly by broken glass. Warne said of the crash: \u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt that it was hit [by the prince\u2019s car] . That\u2019s my recollection.\u201d Of Prince Philip\u2019s vehicle, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see it come from the side road. I saw it careering and tumbling across the road and ending up on the other side. It would take a massive force and it had rolled on the other side as well.\u201d The prince was taken to Sandringham, where he was seen by a doctor as a precautionary measure, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday. On Friday, Norfolk county council, which coincidentally had been scheduled to discuss safety measures on the A149 where the collision took place, approved plans for the speed limit to be lowered from 60mph to 50mph and to implement an average speed monitoring system. Older drivers must renew their driving licence every three years after they turn 70, but are not required to retake a driving test, and there are no laws on what age you must stop driving. Buckingham Palace said: \u201cThe Duke of Edinburgh has a valid driving licence and completes all the usual DVLA processes.\u201d It would not give further specifics on the prince\u2019s licence. The Queen does not have a driving licence, as she is exempt from the law and learned to drive with the army in 1945, when she was 19 and joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service during the second world war. Princess Anne, asked by journalists how her father was during an engagement at Edge Hill University in Lancashire on Friday, replied: \u201cNo idea. You know where I am? Same place as you.\u201d If the prince is thought to be liable, he could face prosecution for driving without due care and attention. The lawyer Nick Freeman, known as Mr Loophole, who has represented celebrities prosecuted over alleged traffic offences, said he believed Prince Philip could have a good defence if he blamed being blinded by the sun, as one witness claimed. He could also avoid prosecution by surrendering his licence, Freeman told the Press Association. \u201cIf the sun was so low and right in your eyes, sometimes it is impossible to see, and that may well have been the case and that would afford him a defence,\u201d Freeman said. The Crown Prosecution Service would consider if it was in the public interest to prosecute, were the royal thought to be at fault, he added. \u201cIn my view, even if he\u2019s found to be at fault, I think anyone advising him would contact the CPS and say, look, he now accepts he shouldn\u2019t be driving and he\u2019s going to undertake to surrender his licence and not drive again,\u201d Freeman said. But the decision had to be balanced with the wishes of those in the other car, he added. \u201cThey may say, \u2018We don\u2019t care who he is.\u2019 They might think at his age, at his position, he could afford a driver.

And I thought that going to a police station would sober me up as there would be plenty of lights and people,\u201d the Canadian said.</p> <p>But after she went upstairs at the celebrated 36 <em>Quai des Orf\u00e8vres</em> to the fifth floor and entered room 461, Spanton said she walked into \u201cthe worst night of my life\u201d.</p> <p>What allegedly happened in the next 80 minutes in the early hours of 23 April 2014 is at the centre of an ongoing court case in chamber three of the assize court in Paris\u2019s imposing Palais de Justice, and has left France shocked.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Spanton, 39, cried as she told the three judges and nine members of the jury she was gang-raped by at least two men. As she tried to leave, she says, she was dragged into another office and raped again.</p> <p>In the dock are two members of the <em>Brigade de Recherches et d\u2019Intervention</em> (BRI), an elite unit specialising in tracking down gang members and terrorists. Maj Nicolas R, 49, and Capt Antoine Q, 40, (French law prevents the names of the police officers being given) deny the charges, claiming Spanton consented to sex.</p> <p>The shock in France is as much over the details of the case as the idea that the allegations are not just targeted at individual officers but at the reputation of this prestigious police unit.</p> <p>L\u2019Express magazine suggested the case had \u201cpoisoned\u201d the Paris police force for almost five years and nearly signed the death warrant of the BRI.</p> <p>Spanton\u2019s legal team had battled to have the officers brought to trial after investigating judges decided there was no case to answer, citing \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in her testimony.

      "bodyText": "Emily Spanton grew up with police officers \u2013 her father had been a high-ranking officer in the Toronto force \u2013 so when two French officers she met while drinking in a Paris bar invited her to see their famous headquarters, she agreed. Spanton was, she says, drunk and shaky on her feet. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t in a state to find my hotel. And I thought that going to a police station would sober me up as there would be plenty of lights and people,\u201d the Canadian said. But after she went upstairs at the celebrated 36 Quai des Orf\u00e8vres to the fifth floor and entered room 461, Spanton said she walked into \u201cthe worst night of my life\u201d. What allegedly happened in the next 80 minutes in the early hours of 23 April 2014 is at the centre of an ongoing court case in chamber three of the assize court in Paris\u2019s imposing Palais de Justice, and has left France shocked. On Wednesday, Spanton, 39, cried as she told the three judges and nine members of the jury she was gang-raped by at least two men. As she tried to leave, she says, she was dragged into another office and raped again. In the dock are two members of the Brigade de Recherches et d\u2019Intervention (BRI), an elite unit specialising in tracking down gang members and terrorists. Maj Nicolas R, 49, and Capt Antoine Q, 40, (French law prevents the names of the police officers being given) deny the charges, claiming Spanton consented to sex. The shock in France is as much over the details of the case as the idea that the allegations are not just targeted at individual officers but at the reputation of this prestigious police unit. L\u2019Express magazine suggested the case had \u201cpoisoned\u201d the Paris police force for almost five years and nearly signed the death warrant of the BRI. Spanton\u2019s legal team had battled to have the officers brought to trial after investigating judges decided there was no case to answer, citing \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in her testimony. After the Paris public prosecutor stepped in, this decision was overturned on appeal. Police colleagues had suggested that because Spanton had allegedly been flirting and kissed the two officers during the evening, they believed she was happy to go further. \u201cTheir mistake was to have let the truth come out bit by bit because they were afraid of the consequences on their families and their careers,\u201d one police officer told L\u2019Express. \u201cThis has led to questions about their credibility.\u201d Spanton\u2019s lawyer said the judges had travelled to Canada to interview her friends and family and \u201cdig around\u201d in her personal life, but had not done the same for the accused. The building at 36 Quai des Orf\u00e8vres is a place of fact and fiction. Known to officers simply as \u201c36\u201d, its mythical reputation was immortalised by Georges Simenon\u2019s celebrated detective Maigret and in French films. For real-life police, \u201c36\u201d is the top rung of the career ladder. Attached to the Palais de Justice, the building was home to the Paris police force from 1913, when officers chased criminals on horses or bicycles, until 2017, when it moved to more modern buildings. Spanton, who was working as an estate agent, said she had been drinking in Le Galway, an Irish bar near 36, when some time around midnight she agreed to go to the officers\u2019 headquarters. \u201cThey explained the police station had been the subject of films and made it sound like something I would want to see,\u201d she said. Even the softly spoken translator was unable to diminish the violence of the testimony of what happened after Spanton entered room 461. \u201cSomeone was forcing himself inside my mouth,\u201d Spanton said. \u201cSomeone penetrated me. Then someone else. When it finished, I gathered up my belongings, but I couldn\u2019t open the door. I was pulled into another office and everything happened again.\u201d Spanton said she remembered being raped by up to three men, but said she could not identify the third. She told the jury her glasses were taken from her and she was unable to see clearly. \u201cI just gave up; just wanted it to be over \u2026 I kept my eyes closed.\u201d She was, she insists, in \u201cno fit state to consent\u201d to anything. She says when she left the building 90 minutes later, barefoot and without her tights, she told the guards at the door she had been raped and they told her to \u201cgo home\u201d. DNA from both the accused was found on Spanton\u2019s underwear. Her DNA was found on Antoine Q\u2019s. No match was found for the DNA of a third man. The two accused wiped all messages and videos from the night off their mobiles, but one found on a colleague\u2019s phone read: \u201cShe likes an orgy, hurry up.\u201d Asked by the public prosecutor on Friday if it was \u201cusual to take young women to your office\u201d, Antoine Q, replied: \u201cNot at all\u201d.

Drones have been spotted around courses covered by both Racing TV and Sky Sports Racing, the sport\u2019s two non-terrestrial broadcasters, in recent months, providing instant feeds of action to a handful of punters and a priceless edge in the volatile in-running markets. However, the time-lag \u2013 or latency \u2013 on Sky Sports Racing\u2019s coverage is significantly longer than that for Racing TV\u2019s viewers, which could make drones activity a particular problem for tracks signed up with the newly relaunched channel, formerly At The Races.

Instead Solskj\u00e6r offered what newspapers like to call \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in the gangling Belgian utility-menace, talking up Fellaini\u2019s continued presence through this, his sixth year as a Manchester United player.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t hard to see why some said his time was up. Under Solskj\u00e6r Fellaini has played three minutes in the Premier League. His basic footballing presence has seemed at odds with a more mobile, fluid style. Plus there is of course a wider symbolic aspect to all this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/18/manchester-united-solskjaer-fellaini-brighton\">Marouane Fellaini brings X-factor to Manchester United, says Solskj\u00e6r</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fellaini will never really shake his status as the first big signing of the post-Ferguson years. Through successive managerial eras he has fronted up gamely, but remained the embodiment of something stubborn and stuck, an inherited burden, like a particularly oppressive antique mahogany Victorian sideboard nobody ever has the will or the guts to throw away.</p> <p>How to characterise the Fellaini years? In his book The Last Empire Gore Vidal offers up a wryly crushing list of the official codenames of every 20th century US overseas military operation, a line-up that reads now like a stock list of the top-selling Macedonian erectile dysfunction drugs currently being advertised up in your spam email folder.</p> <p>Operation Shining Hope. Operation Decisive Enhancement. Operation Golden Python. Operation Noble Obelisk, Urgent Fury, Provide Relief, Provide Hope, Continue Hope, and of course \u2013 a personal favourite \u2013 Operation Frequent Wind. What codename would best capture Fellaini\u2019s own five-and-a-half-year campaign at Old Trafford, you wonder. Operation Shin-Bobble. Operation Crowd-Slice. Operation Panic Hoof. Operation Slow Clanking Midfield Death?</p> <p>And yet, this is of course unfair in many ways. Fellaini is also the easiest of targets. There is no doubt he has been over-blamed, has become disproportionately symbolic of United\u2019s recent difficult years.</p> <p>Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds: in the five years before Fellaini\u2019s arrival United won four Premier Leagues and one Champions League. In five seasons since they haven\u2019t come close to winning either. The failings have been systemic and structural. Other, more talented players have underperformed more spectacularly. But it is Fellaini who will be most marked by this, and most closely associated as a symbol of the dark times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb663ab45bc639340bee5b74c7dc2dea5fbe870d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb663ab45bc639340bee5b74c7dc2dea5fbe870d/216_23_2781_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marouane Fellaini pulls the hair of Arsenal\u2019s Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi at Old Trafford in another of his late cameo substitute appearances.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marouane Fellaini pulls the hair of Arsenal\u2019s Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi at Old Trafford in another of his late cameo substitute appearances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then, he was signed under a false premise in the first place. For years United had craved a proper midfielder, a player with the craft and the touch to control the spaces and work the angles, to drive the deeper rhythms of a game.</p> <p>In Fellaini they got someone who\u2019d had his most spectacular times for Everton as a kind of improvised target-man, a No 10 of the skies, making use of his one really outstanding attribute, that incredible Velcro-touch chest control, the ability to catch long passes with those invisible chest-fingers and roll the ball down his neck, wearing it like a scarf, all the while clearing the area around him with a head-high, studs-up roundhouse ninja lunge.</p> <p>Fellaini\u2019s strength and awkwardness remain his awkwardly-embraced strengths, that feeling he is always on the verge of kicking over a side-table, falling through a plasterboard wall, wrenching down the curtains. Otherwise he is a strange A-list midfielder: not fast, agile, notably creative or notably defensive; not renowned for his passing, dribbling, tackling, vision, finishing or any other of the more standard qualities.</p> <p>At which point it would be hipper, and more in keeping with the traditions of the sideways football column to start a sentence with the words \u201cBut still somehow\u201d. To find a way of saying that in fact Fellaini has secretly been better than anyone thought, that he has at least been a fan favourite, an object of more profound and personal inspiration.</p> <p>Except, this isn\u2019t really true, or at least not yet. Fellaini did play every minute of a couple of successful cup finals. He has scored vital goals. But he has also racked up two \u2013 yes: two \u2013 assists in five and a half years as a Manchester United midfielder. He has been the king of the bad times, played in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/13/manchester-united-sevilla-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">loss at home to Sevilla</a> last year and in the four straight defeats to Wolfsburg, Norwich, Bournemouth and Stoke in December 2015.</p> <p>Plus the way managers have used him has seemed to sum up something more insidious. From Moyes to Mourinho Fellaini has been the bad habit you fall back on when there is no other sensible plan, the big red panic button you grope for under the desk, the sodden kebab spread across your chest in the first light of dawn.</p> <p>It is still hard not to associate him with United\u2019s second signing of the post-Fergie age \u2013 Juan Mata \u2013 his own laughably disconnected tactical opposite. For a while they seemed always to be yoked together on the touchline, Fellaini a stirringly primal figure, United\u2019s giant wicker football-man, Mata scampering around his ankles like the king of the gnomes. Together they made a perfect emblem of the lack of a guiding hand or long-term plan, a general absence of care and close expertise. Got a big bloke? Get a small bloke in next.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/18/manchester-united-brighton-match-preview-premier-league\">Manchester United v Brighton: match preview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has at least been a genuinely fascinating United career, and a rebuttal to the notion that the only interesting stories are success stories. The news that Fellaini may now be staying after all is to be welcomed too, a chance for him to play for the first time in a team not leaning, a little exhaustedly, on his height and power; and, who knows, perhaps to finish all this \u2013 Operation Desperate Flick-On, Operation Knee In the Chest \u2013 on an unexpectedly happy note.</p>",

Instead Solskj\u00e6r offered what newspapers like to call \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d in the gangling Belgian utility-menace, talking up Fellaini\u2019s continued presence through this, his sixth year as a Manchester United player. It isn\u2019t hard to see why some said his time was up. Under Solskj\u00e6r Fellaini has played three minutes in the Premier League. His basic footballing presence has seemed at odds with a more mobile, fluid style. Plus there is of course a wider symbolic aspect to all this. Fellaini will never really shake his status as the first big signing of the post-Ferguson years. Through successive managerial eras he has fronted up gamely, but remained the embodiment of something stubborn and stuck, an inherited burden, like a particularly oppressive antique mahogany Victorian sideboard nobody ever has the will or the guts to throw away. How to characterise the Fellaini years? In his book The Last Empire Gore Vidal offers up a wryly crushing list of the official codenames of every 20th century US overseas military operation, a line-up that reads now like a stock list of the top-selling Macedonian erectile dysfunction drugs currently being advertised up in your spam email folder. Operation Shining Hope. Operation Decisive Enhancement. Operation Golden Python. Operation Noble Obelisk, Urgent Fury, Provide Relief, Provide Hope, Continue Hope, and of course \u2013 a personal favourite \u2013 Operation Frequent Wind. What codename would best capture Fellaini\u2019s own five-and-a-half-year campaign at Old Trafford, you wonder. Operation Shin-Bobble. Operation Crowd-Slice. Operation Panic Hoof. Operation Slow Clanking Midfield Death? And yet, this is of course unfair in many ways. Fellaini is also the easiest of targets. There is no doubt he has been over-blamed, has become disproportionately symbolic of United\u2019s recent difficult years. Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds: in the five years before Fellaini\u2019s arrival United won four Premier Leagues and one Champions League. In five seasons since they haven\u2019t come close to winning either. The failings have been systemic and structural. Other, more talented players have underperformed more spectacularly. But it is Fellaini who will be most marked by this, and most closely associated as a symbol of the dark times. But then, he was signed under a false premise in the first place. For years United had craved a proper midfielder, a player with the craft and the touch to control the spaces and work the angles, to drive the deeper rhythms of a game. In Fellaini they got someone who\u2019d had his most spectacular times for Everton as a kind of improvised target-man, a No 10 of the skies, making use of his one really outstanding attribute, that incredible Velcro-touch chest control, the ability to catch long passes with those invisible chest-fingers and roll the ball down his neck, wearing it like a scarf, all the while clearing the area around him with a head-high, studs-up roundhouse ninja lunge. Fellaini\u2019s strength and awkwardness remain his awkwardly-embraced strengths, that feeling he is always on the verge of kicking over a side-table, falling through a plasterboard wall, wrenching down the curtains. Otherwise he is a strange A-list midfielder: not fast, agile, notably creative or notably defensive; not renowned for his passing, dribbling, tackling, vision, finishing or any other of the more standard qualities. At which point it would be hipper, and more in keeping with the traditions of the sideways football column to start a sentence with the words \u201cBut still somehow\u201d. To find a way of saying that in fact Fellaini has secretly been better than anyone thought, that he has at least been a fan favourite, an object of more profound and personal inspiration. Except, this isn\u2019t really true, or at least not yet. Fellaini did play every minute of a couple of successful cup finals. He has scored vital goals. But he has also racked up two \u2013 yes: two \u2013 assists in five and a half years as a Manchester United midfielder. He has been the king of the bad times, played in the loss at home to Sevilla last year and in the four straight defeats to Wolfsburg, Norwich, Bournemouth and Stoke in December 2015. Plus the way managers have used him has seemed to sum up something more insidious. From Moyes to Mourinho Fellaini has been the bad habit you fall back on when there is no other sensible plan, the big red panic button you grope for under the desk, the sodden kebab spread across your chest in the first light of dawn. It is still hard not to associate him with United\u2019s second signing of the post-Fergie age \u2013 Juan Mata \u2013 his own laughably disconnected tactical opposite. For a while they seemed always to be yoked together on the touchline, Fellaini a stirringly primal figure, United\u2019s giant wicker football-man, Mata scampering around his ankles like the king of the gnomes. Together they made a perfect emblem of the lack of a guiding hand or long-term plan, a general absence of care and close expertise. Got a big bloke? Get a small bloke in next. It has at least been a genuinely fascinating United career, and a rebuttal to the notion that the only interesting stories are success stories. The news that Fellaini may now be staying after all is to be welcomed too, a chance for him to play for the first time in a team not leaning, a little exhaustedly, on his height and power; and, who knows, perhaps to finish all this \u2013 Operation Desperate Flick-On, Operation Knee In the Chest \u2013 on an unexpectedly happy note.",

I didn\u2019t say a thing about Turkey,\u201d and began to argue that he was \u201cin the camp\u201d of those who supported the principle of immigration.</p> \n<p>Asked to disown the idea of Turkish EU membership as a threat or scare tactic, Johnson said he had nothing to apologise for. \u201cSince I made no remarks, I can\u2019t disown them,\u201d he said. Pressed again, he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t make any remarks about Turkey, mate.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, during the 2016 referendum campaign, Johnson repeatedly raised the idea that Turkey \u2013 whose application to join the EU had stalled \u2013 could eventually become an EU member and its citizens would eventually able to migrate to the UK.</p> \n<p>A week before referendum day in June 2016, Johnson and Michael Gove wrote a joint letter to David Cameron claiming that the government supported the idea of Turkish membership of the EU. \u201cThe public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to vote leave and take back control on 23 June,\u201d the letter stated.</p> \n<p>And during the BBC\u2019s EU referendum debate, two days before the poll, Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s government policy to accelerate Turkish accession.\u201d A couple of weeks earlier, interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show, he said: \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t mind whether Turkey joins the EU, provided the UK leaves the EU.\u201d</p> \n<p>Warnings about the consequences of a possible Turkish accession to the EU were a core message in the campaign run by Vote Leave, alongside the discredited claim that Brexit would allow an extra \u00a3350m a week to be spent on the NHS.</p> \n<p>Johnson was the figurehead of Vote Leave, easily its most popular political backer. But despite his central role in the campaign, Johnson tried to claim on Friday that he was somewhat peripheral.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou do me too much honour. I was happy to support leave, and I do and I did,\u201d he said after the speech, given at the headquarters of JCB, the digger and tractor maker, which is owned by a Vote Leave and Conservative donor, Anthony Bamford.</p> \n<p>Unlike Johnson, Gove has partially apologised for Vote Leave\u2019s tactics. When asked, for a political book published in the summer, if he had been happy making appeals to \u201csome very low sentiments\u201d, Gove replied: \u201cIf it had been left entirely to me, the leave campaign would have a slightly different feel.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turkey\u2019s EU membership talks have been in the deep-freeze for years, with no imminent prospect of change. Relations worsened in 2016 after the country\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, cracked down on his opponents after a failed coup. Every EU member state holds a veto over Turkey\u2019s EU membership, contrary to the claims of Brexit supporters during the referendum.</p> \n<p>Johnson has some Turkish ancestry, but this has not stopped him from getting into trouble when talking about the country. He once called Erdo\u011fan a \u201cwankerer\u201d in an offensive limerick that won him a competition organised by the Spectator magazine, of which he was formerly the editor.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/18/germany-politicians-business-leaders-letter-brexit-the-times\">Ditch Brexit, German leaders urge UK in paean to ale and milky tea</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The row about Johnson and Vote Leave\u2019s use of the Turkey issue to persuade the public to vote in favour of Brexit overshadowed an undisguised leadership pitch in which Johnson accused May of \u201cwasting our time\u201d trying to get MPs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/may-will-stick-to-brexit-principles-in-cross-party-talks-says-no-10\">change their minds</a> about her \u201cex-deal\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cI fear that at present we are facing the wrong direction and trying to change the wrong bit of the landscape, and if we spend the next few weeks hydraulically straining to move MPs from one camp to the other, pointlessly trying to get Corbyn to parley at No 10, we will be wasting our time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pointedly reminding his audience that \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s deal was thrown out by a record 230 votes, the largest majority in parliamentary history\u201d, Johnson argued that May should go back the EU \u201cfortified with the emphatic and conclusive mandate of parliament and demand real change to that backstop\u201d.</p> \n<p>The former minister, who resigned last summer unhappy with the drift of May\u2019s negotiating strategy, said the UK should hold back \u201cat least half of the \u00a339bn\u201d that the prime minister had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/uk-brexit-bill-could-rise-as-eu-reveals-record-spending-promises\">agreed to pay</a> Brussels until it agreed to a deal on revised terms.</p> \n<p>May has been meeting some party leaders and Tory backbenchers as she tries to work out how to resolve the Brexit impasse.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has wrongly claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t make any remarks about Turkey, mate\u201d during the EU referendum campaign, in comments that overshadowed a speech in Staffordshire intended to burnish his leadership credentials. The former foreign secretary\u2019s clumsy attempt to rewrite history eclipsed a speech highly critical of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiating strategy, and earned him criticism for his refusal to disown or even recognise what he once said. While taking questions after his speech, Johnson was asked about his views on immigration and why he and the Vote Leave campaign he fronted had pushed so heavily the potential impact on immigration of Turkey being allowed to join the European Union. Johnson initially said: \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about Turkey in the referendum campaign. I didn\u2019t say a thing about Turkey,\u201d and began to argue that he was \u201cin the camp\u201d of those who supported the principle of immigration. Asked to disown the idea of Turkish EU membership as a threat or scare tactic, Johnson said he had nothing to apologise for. \u201cSince I made no remarks, I can\u2019t disown them,\u201d he said. Pressed again, he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t make any remarks about Turkey, mate.\u201d However, during the 2016 referendum campaign, Johnson repeatedly raised the idea that Turkey \u2013 whose application to join the EU had stalled \u2013 could eventually become an EU member and its citizens would eventually able to migrate to the UK. A week before referendum day in June 2016, Johnson and Michael Gove wrote a joint letter to David Cameron claiming that the government supported the idea of Turkish membership of the EU. \u201cThe public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to vote leave and take back control on 23 June,\u201d the letter stated. And during the BBC\u2019s EU referendum debate, two days before the poll, Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s government policy to accelerate Turkish accession.\u201d A couple of weeks earlier, interviewed on the Andrew Marr Show, he said: \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t mind whether Turkey joins the EU, provided the UK leaves the EU.\u201d Warnings about the consequences of a possible Turkish accession to the EU were a core message in the campaign run by Vote Leave, alongside the discredited claim that Brexit would allow an extra \u00a3350m a week to be spent on the NHS. Johnson was the figurehead of Vote Leave, easily its most popular political backer. But despite his central role in the campaign, Johnson tried to claim on Friday that he was somewhat peripheral. \u201cYou do me too much honour. I was happy to support leave, and I do and I did,\u201d he said after the speech, given at the headquarters of JCB, the digger and tractor maker, which is owned by a Vote Leave and Conservative donor, Anthony Bamford. Unlike Johnson, Gove has partially apologised for Vote Leave\u2019s tactics. When asked, for a political book published in the summer, if he had been happy making appeals to \u201csome very low sentiments\u201d, Gove replied: \u201cIf it had been left entirely to me, the leave campaign would have a slightly different feel.\u201d Turkey\u2019s EU membership talks have been in the deep-freeze for years, with no imminent prospect of change. Relations worsened in 2016 after the country\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, cracked down on his opponents after a failed coup. Every EU member state holds a veto over Turkey\u2019s EU membership, contrary to the claims of Brexit supporters during the referendum. Johnson has some Turkish ancestry, but this has not stopped him from getting into trouble when talking about the country. He once called Erdo\u011fan a \u201cwankerer\u201d in an offensive limerick that won him a competition organised by the Spectator magazine, of which he was formerly the editor. The row about Johnson and Vote Leave\u2019s use of the Turkey issue to persuade the public to vote in favour of Brexit overshadowed an undisguised leadership pitch in which Johnson accused May of \u201cwasting our time\u201d trying to get MPs to change their minds about her \u201cex-deal\u201d. He said: \u201cI fear that at present we are facing the wrong direction and trying to change the wrong bit of the landscape, and if we spend the next few weeks hydraulically straining to move MPs from one camp to the other, pointlessly trying to get Corbyn to parley at No 10, we will be wasting our time.\u201d Pointedly reminding his audience that \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s deal was thrown out by a record 230 votes, the largest majority in parliamentary history\u201d, Johnson argued that May should go back the EU \u201cfortified with the emphatic and conclusive mandate of parliament and demand real change to that backstop\u201d. The former minister, who resigned last summer unhappy with the drift of May\u2019s negotiating strategy, said the UK should hold back \u201cat least half of the \u00a339bn\u201d that the prime minister had agreed to pay Brussels until it agreed to a deal on revised terms. May has been meeting some party leaders and Tory backbenchers as she tries to work out how to resolve the Brexit impasse. Allies of Johnson said he was not on the invite list. Few believe the EU will concede on the Irish backstop. Boris Johnson and Turkey: what he said \u201cI am very pro-Turkish, but what I certainly can\u2019t imagine is a situation in which 77 million [his estimate] of my fellow Turks and those of Turkish origin can come here without any checks at all. That is really mad\u201d \u2013 Daily Express, 18 April 2016 \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t mind whether Turkey joins the EU, provided the UK leaves the EU\u201d \u2013 BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, 5 June 2016 \u201cThe public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to vote leave and take back control on 23 June\u201d \u2013 letter with Michael Gove to David Cameron, 16 June 2016 \u201cIt\u2019s government policy to accelerate Turkish accession\u201d \u2013 BBC EU referendum debate, 21 June 2016 What Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave\u2019s campaign director, said on 9 January 2017: \u201cIf Boris, Gove and Gisela [Stuart, Vote Leave\u2019s chair] had not supported us and picked up the baseball bat marked \u2018Turkey/NHS/\u00a3350m\u2019 with five weeks to go, then 650,000 votes might have been lost.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of activists remain in hiding in Zimbabwe, on the fifth day of the worst government crackdown since the ousting of Robert Mugabe. Soldiers and unidentified armed men conducted door-to-door searches in poor areas of cities on Friday, dragging \u201crandom\u201d residents out of homes to be beaten and often detained, activists said. The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said it had treated 68 cases of gunshot wounds and 100-plus other cases of \u201cassaults with sharp objects, booted feet, baton sticks\u201d and more in recent days. Security forces have arrested between 400 and 600 suspects since Monday, the start of a national \u201cstay-at-home\u201d protest called by unions after a massive increase in the price of fuel began on Monday, well-informed NGOs estimate. Twelve people are thought to have died after being shot. \u201cI\u2019m just moving from house to house every day, trying to limit my contacts, telling no one where I am. I\u2019m trying to keep ahead of the intelligence services and the spies \u2026 It\u2019s a very tough period,\u201d said one activist who publicly backed the protests, speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location in Zimbabwe on Friday evening. Many of those detained are being held without charge in overcrowded prisons and police cells. Some may face new fast-track trials, ordered earlier this week, on charges that could bring long prison sentences. Four hundred detainees, largely charged with public order offences, were produced in batches of 50 before magistrates in Harare on Friday afternoon and denied bail. Though some are leading trade unionists and organisers in the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), many are ordinary people swept up in the biggest security operation seen in Zimbabwe for many years. Pastor Evan Marawire, a high-profile social media activist arrested on Wednesday, told reporters as he was brought to magistrates court that the crackdown was reminiscent of the Mugabe era. Mugabe\u2019s authoritarian 37-year rule was ended in November 2017 by a military takeover, prompting widespread optimism that the repression of previous decades was over. But any faint hopes of political reform under Emmerson Mnangagwa, the ruling Zanu-PF party stalwart who took power and won elections in July, have been extinguished. The crisis has attracted fierce criticism from western powers, and will undermine Zimbabwe\u2019s efforts to rejoin the international community after decades as a pariah. Mnangagwa is currently travelling in central Asia, Russia and Europe in an attempt to rally international support and investment that might stave off the total collapse of the country\u2019s economy. Vice-president Constantino Chiwenga, a hardliner who is blamed for the shooting of six civilians during protests days after last year\u2019s elections, is in charge. \u201cThey must have anticipated what was going to happen so the suspicion is that this is part of a good cop, bad cop routine. Chiwenga can deal with [the protests] with a very heavy hand and then Mnangagwa can say: \u2018Very sorry, we\u2019ll have an investigation,\u2019 and still seem to be Mr Nice Guy,\u201d said Derek Matyszak, an analyst in Harare. Marawire, denied bail on Friday, faces the same charges of incitement to violence and subversion now as he did two years ago before Mugabe\u2019s resignation. He said he was innocent. He announced the protest on Sunday in a video clip alongside Peter Mutasa, the president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). Mutasa, an outspoken critic of the new government, has not been heard from since Tuesday, when he contacted colleagues to tell them his house had been raided. \u201cWe are worried about Peter and we hope he hasn\u2019t been arrested,\u201d said Tiri Marimo, a senior official of the ZCTU. Marawire\u2019s sister, Telda, said she had discussed the possible consequences of her brother\u2019s actions with him at the weekend. \u201cThe conditions in prison are deplorable and can break even the strongest man. That is a frightening thing for him to go through. He was very worried about how this would go but resolute that there was no way he could keep quiet,\u201d she said. Energy Mutodi, the deputy information minister, said the police had \u201cinitially applied minimal force to disperse marauding crowds\u201d before escalating their response to stop \u201ca looting spree by hooligans\u201d. Mugabe\u2019s rule left Zimbabwe with vast debts, a crumbling infrastructure and soaring unemployment, especially among young people. Most of its 16 million people live hand-to-mouth, or survive on remittances from the extensive diaspora. The fuel price rise, of about 250%, is the latest blow to millions of citizens who are increasingly unable to buy basics such as fuel, food and medicines. Inflation is running at 40% \u2013 its highest rate since hyperinflation forced Zimbabwe to abandon its own currency 10 years ago in favour of dollars, electronic cash and so-called \u201cbond notes\u201d issued by the central bank. \u201cPeople came on to the streets spontaneously, and in anger, which is rare for Zimbabwe. What then appears to have happened was that activists got together to try to channel that anger,\u201d said Matyszak. The response \u201cwas a continuation of the Mugabe style of dealing with dissent\u201d. The southern city of Bulawayo was badly hit by looting and rioting earlier in the week. Though there has been limited public disorder since Wednesday, few inhabitants are venturing on to the streets patrolled by armed soldiers unless desperate. \u201cIt is getting very complicated. People are running out of food but there have been almost no deliveries of bread. There are very long queues to just get anything. There is a huge number of people who need medicine too. So everyone is afraid,\u201d said one activist in the city. In Harare, the atmosphere was calmer than on previous days, but police still controlled queues for food and fuel while injured people streamed into a private hospital in the capital. Joelson Mugari, an MDC organiser, said a group of 10 men, including two soldiers, had assaulted him after banging on his door at 7.30am on Friday morning in Ngwenya, an outlying district of Harare. \u201cThey told me: \u2018You are the ones organising the stay-away and we will teach you a lesson.\u2019 Then they started hitting me on the head and all over,\u201d said Mugari, who was treated secretly at a clinic in Harare. Mainstream opposition politicians appear to have been caught unprepared by the crisis. Mutodi said the government had temporarily blocked the internet to stop protesters making organised movements and inflammatory statements encouraging the looting and burning of police stations. \u201cWe advised them not to take part in the protests but the youth, because of drug abuse, were coerced into it \u2026 and the consequences have been serious,\u201d he said. Officials have described those responsible for looting and blocking roads in major cities with makeshift barricades earlier in the week as \u201cterrorists\u201d. Activists say responsibility for the crisis lies with authorities. \u201cThose who took to the streets during the shutdown were young people who don\u2019t see any hope for their future,\u201d said Samm Farai Monro. \u201cThe government can switch off the internet but not the frustrations of millions of people.\u201d \u2022 On 25 January 2019 \u201cchallenge that anger\u201d was amended to the correct phrase used, \u201cchannel that anger\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Trade optimism has swept the UK stock market to its highest closing level in six weeks. The FTSE 100 ended a wild week with a near 1% gain, closing 133 points higher at 6968. Equipment supplier Ashtead group gained most 4.5%, supermarket chain Morrison\u2019s rose by 4%, Prudential gained 3.7% and Rolls Royce picked up 3.6%. Nearly every share on the Footsie closed higher. Europe\u2019s main markets also had a good day, with Germany\u2019s DAX racking up a 2.6% gain. Investors were cheered by two factors 1) The WSJ\u2019s report that Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin was pushing for some tariffs on China to be lifted. 2) Bloomberg\u2019s report that China had offered to boost US imports over the next six years. Neither is confirmed. Both are encouraging signs, especially for markets thirsty for good news. Over in New York, the Dow is now up by 330 points, or 1.3%, with every member up (led by construction and machinery giant Caterpillar). That may be all for today. If so, have a great weekend. GW Beijing\u2019s offer to boost US imports was made at the start of January, according to Bloomberg. Amusingly, US officials are apparently unconvinced by the (undoubtedly challenging) plan.... and also want China to do even better! Bloomberg says: The offer, made during talks in Beijing earlier this month, was met with skepticism by U.S. negotiators who nonetheless asked the Chinese to do even better, demanding that the imbalance be cleared in the next two years, the people said. Economists who\u2019ve studied the trade relationship argue it would be hard to eliminate the gap, which they say is sustained in large part by U.S. demand for Chinese products. Bloomberg is reporting that China has offered to ramp up its purchases of U.S. imports over six years to reach more than $1 trillion per year. They\u2019re citing officials familiar with the negotiations. If accepted, the move would end the U.S. trade gap with China by 2024, the report claims. That\u2019s a big ask, given China sold more than $300bn more to America in 2018 than it imported. But the markets are interested, sending stocks even higher on both sides of the Atlantic... As stocks rise on Wall Street, Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the markets are \u201changing on every headline\u201d about the US-China trade talks. This would not be the first time that we have heard reports of thawing trade tensions. The markets have been here before, so there is going to be a level of caution. That said, the jump higher reflects the extent of the damage trade tensions are causing from the markets view. Any evidence that the US and China are close to a trade agreement will result in a sustained move higher in riskier assets. Ding ding! The New York stock market is open, and shares are catching an early bid. Those (disputer) reports that Treasury secretary Mnuchin wants to ease tariffs on China helped to push the Dow Jones industrial average up by 0.7% at the open, a gain of 160 points to 24,530. The S&amp;P 500 index (a broader measure of US stocks) is up 0.5%, which drags it out of correction territory (defined as 20% below the recent high). Wall Street is expected to rally today, picking up where it ended last night. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says optimism is building in the markets.... but investors should stay wary: It was a week defined by Brexit drama, US-China trade developments and ongoing political uncertainty in Washington. Renewed optimism over US-China trade talks stimulated global risk sentiment on Friday with Asian stocks ending mostly higher. Although European markets are benefiting from the improved market mood, investors must remain alert and guarded. Geopolitical risks in the form of Brexit uncertainties, a partial government shutdown in the United States and the unpredictable nature of trade negotiations have left market sentiment fragile. With concerns over slowing global growth adding to the cocktail of fundamental themes impacting risk appetite, stock markets remain vulnerable to downside shocks. 2019 just turned into a grim new year for thousands of Tesla workers. More than 8% of the workforce (3,000 jobs) are being cut, as CEO Elon Musk tries to rein in costs. Musk warned that Tesla faces a tough time, telling staff: \u201cTesla will need to make these cuts while increasing the Model 3 production rate and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months. \u201cAttempting to build affordable clean energy products at scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity, but succeeding in our mission is essential to ensure that the future is good, so we must do everything we can to advance the cause. Back in the City, stocks are rattling higher as investors cling onto optimism of a trade war breakthrough. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has now leapt by 1.5%, or over 100 points, to 6,943. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC have both jumped by 1,7%, on hopes that Washington and Beijing could reach a ceasefire before the end of February deadline. Despite those swift denials, traders are encouraged by the WSJ\u2019s report that Treasury secretary Mnuchin has suggested cutting China some slack by cutting tariffs. Some analysts are also more optimistic about market prospects, after the wild turmoil a few weeks ago. Fidelity International, for example, have decided to move \u2018overweight\u2019 on equities (especially in emerging markets) and fixed income (bonds), rather than hiding in cash. James Bateman, CIO for Multi Asset at Fidelity, says: Christmas Eve was the worst in recorded history for stock markets, followed by the largest move in percentage terms for stocks since 2009 two days later. But with heightened volatility comes opportunity for active investors, and we believe it makes sense to put some risk back on the table. Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, reckons it\u2019s too early to say exactly how Christmas went for UK retailers: It\u2019s a complicated trading environment, with comparisons remaining difficult due to a constantly evolving discounting season. Although the industry will certainly have been hoping for a stronger December overall, there were some winners out there and it\u2019s important to caution that we need to see January\u2019s data before we can entirely judge the festive sales period. But don\u2019t go blaming it all on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU... Brexit uncertainty is weighing on consumer confidence and making it difficult for retailers to plan for the future, but they have to simply get on with it and try to influence the factors within their control; retaining a focus on product innovation, controlling costs and making sure their online and physical platforms complement each other and boost sales.\u201d Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the retail sales data: Richard Potter, CEO of retail AI firm Peak, has spotted an interesting line in the retail sales data -- people bought more bargains than ever before in December. He also points out that the move to online shopping does pose problems for web-savvy retailers: \u201cThe volume of goods purchased at a discounted rate stands at an all-time high. Some might say this is self-harm given the big margin squeeze we\u2019re seeing retailers struggle to unlock. It\u2019s a fact that for many high street retailers the cost to fulfil an online order is higher than in store. So couple this with the Brexit effect one thing is for sure, retail has a transformational year ahead.\u201d This push towards discounting has hurt a swathe of retailers, such as John Lewis (it might not pay staff a bonus this year) and Debenhams (fighting for survival). The slowdown in retail spending may also show that materialism is fading, and some consumers simply don\u2019t need more things in their lives. Andrew Westbrook, head of retail at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM, thinks we may have reached \u2018peak stuff\u2019 There is undoubtedly significant distress on the high street with retailers having to compete through heavy discounting to gain their fair share of the market, leading to pressure on margins and profitability. For the retailers that struggled over Christmas, the pressure will now be on to convert stock into cash ahead of the quarterly rent payment date which falls at the end of March. \u2018Today\u2019s numbers also point to one concerning trend. If you look at annual rate of growth in terms of the quantity of goods bought, this appears to be flatlining, adding some weight to the notion that we have reached \u2018peak stuff\u2019. The retail sales report also highlights the move away from high streets, and onto e-commerce sites, with one in five pounds spend online in December. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, says: A record proportion of sales were made online over this period: 20% of overall sales, making December 2018 the most digital Christmas ever. It is worth acknowledging that the period includes Cyber Monday, the biggest on record, which may have boosted overall sales and could explain why December had a slow start for many retailers. This slowdown highlights a shift in consumers making many of their Christmas purchases before December. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, argues that a cocktail of factors - including Brexit - are to blame for the slowdown in spending: \u201cRetailers have learnt that Christmas is not just a December phenomenon and we must look at the performance of the UK High Street in both November and December for a better idea as to just how much pressure the retailing sector is under. Over the course of the 4th quarter, retail sales has fallen by 0.2%. Everything from lower consumer confidence, Brexit fears, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, slowing consumer credit take-up and business rates made 2018 a really tough year for retailers and 2019 could easily repeat such pain. December\u2019s UK retail sales are even worse than expected, says David Madden of CMC Markets, especially if you strip fuel out. Economist Rupert Seggins explains that the retail sector hasn\u2019t provided any economic growth this quarter -- not a good omen. Grace Blakeley, the New Statesman\u2019s economics commentator, argues that people are too indebted and ground down by austerity to keep the high street in good health: Here are the key points from the retail sales data, just released (and online here) In the three months to December 2018, estimates in the quantity bought decreased by 0.2% with declines across all main sectors except fuel. When compared with the previous month, the quantity bought in December 2018 decreased by 0.9%, as all sectors except food stores and fuel stores declined on the month. Looking at annual growth rates, the whole of 2018 increased by 2.7% in the quantity bought; an annual slowdown in comparison with the peak of 4.7% experienced in 2016. In December 2018, online retailing accounted for 20% of total retailing, with an overall growth of 13.9% when compared with the same month a year earlier. Newsflash: UK retail sales fell in December as shoppers reined in their spending. Retail sales volumes declined by 0.9% month-on-month in December, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. Stripping out spending on petrol (which is volatile), and retail sales were down 1.3% during December, compared with November. That\u2019s partly due to the Black Friday sales (23th November), which dragged some Christmas spending forwards. But over the last thee months, retail sales volumes declined by 0.2% - the first quarterly decline since March. This will fuel concerns that the UK economy - so long driven by consumer spending - is faltering. The ONS\u2019s head of retail sales, Rhian Murphy, says: \u201cFollowing the increased growth in November, where shoppers snapped up more Black Friday offers as they continue to bring forward their Christmas shopping, retail sales weakened in December.\u201d \u201cRetail sales fell back slightly in the last three months of 2018 with only petrol stations seeing significant growth. More to follow.... Mnuchin\u2019s apparent offer of help to China comes just a few days after Beijing announced it would cut taxes to help businesses, many of whom are struggling in the trade war. Airline stocks aren\u2019t joining today\u2019s rally, after Ryanair hit shareholders with another profits warning. The budget airlines shares are down 1.5%, after it revealed that winter fares are below forecast. EasyJet have lost 2.5%. A trade war breakthrough may be coming, but it won\u2019t be coming at Davos next week. President Donald Trump has cancelled plans to send US officials, including treasury secretary Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer, to the World Economic Forum. This means the US won\u2019t be able to discuss trade with China\u2019s representatives. Trump has also blocked House speaker Nancy Pelosi from using a military plane to visit troops in Afghanistan, as the feud between the White House and Democrats over the government shutdown intensifies (something else for markets to worry about...) European stocks have opened higher, hitting their highest level since early December.... Optimism over the US-China trade talks have pushed commodity prices to their highest levels in months. Investors are anticipating higher demand for steel and iron ore, if a breakthrough is found. Reuters has the details: The most traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange gained 3.2% to close at 528 yuan ($78.01) a tonne, just below the day\u2019s peak of 530 yuan, its highest since early March last year. \u201cThe signs out of the recent trade talks in China are promising and have boosted market optimism, despite the lack of concrete outcomes,\u201d ANZ Research said in a note. Stocks jumped across the Asia-Pacific region overnight, following the WSJ\u2019s report. China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite rallied by almost 1.5%, with Japan gaining 1%. Investors are hopeful that Steve Mnuchin could calm the trade war, says Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada: Optimism of trade policy again dominates overnight price action, with a report in the Wall Street Journal that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin (a free trade proponent, in contrast to Lighthizer and Trump) has proposed easing tariffs on China to support markets. The Treasury denied the report, but stock futures are still 0.3% higher. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are grabbing onto any straws of optimism in the US-China trade wars, as the clock ticks down. Overnight, the Wall Street Journal has handed the markets fresh crumbs of comfort, reporting that US treasury secretary has discussed lifting some of the tariffs imposed on China. Steven Mnuchin\u2019s logic is that offering Beijing a carrot might help deliver a breakthrough in the ongoing trade war, ahead of fresh negotiations at the end of January. As the Journal puts it: U.S. officials are debating ratcheting back tariffs on Chinese imports as a way to calm markets and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions in a trade battle that has rattled global economies. A swath of Chinese products now incur hefty tariffs at the US border, from food and chemicals to machinery. These levies seem to be contributing to a sharp deceleration in China. However, the Journal also reckons that Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is resisting Mnuchin\u2019s idea. And overnight, the White House has poured cold water in the notion, saying: \u201cNo new tariff decisions have been made. We are focused on the current 90 day period and the expected high level visit by China Vice Premier Liu He at the end of this month.\u201d But still, hopes of a breakthrough lifted Wall Street last night, with the Dow closing 162 points higher at 24,370 - extending its 2019 rally. It will push European stocks higher this morning too: Also coming up today: UK retail sales figures will show whether consumer spending held up over the crucial Christmas trading period. Economists expect sales fell by around 0.8% month-on-month, as Black Friday dragged spending into November. We also get new US consumer morale data, which may indicate if the government shutdown is hurting the economy.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have been urged by top doctors to reveal the extent of national drug stocks, amid growing evidence patients are stockpiling medication in preparation for a no-deal Brexit. The Royal College of Physicians (RCP), which represents tens of thousands of doctors, urged the government to be more \u201ctransparent about national stockpiles, particularly for things that are already in short supply or need refrigeration, such as insulin\u201d. Prof Andrew Goddard, the RCP president, said: \u201cFaith in the system will be created by openness and regular updates to trusts and clinicians; this will allow clinicians to reassure patients.\u201d The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) has warned medical shortages have increased in recent months. Generic drugs are usually bought through nationally set tariff prices. However, pharmacies can apply for price concessions under which the NHS will temporarily pay more when the drugs are in short supply. The number of concessions the PSNC applied for went up from 45 in October, to 72 in November and 87 in December. The Guardian has also found evidence some patients are stockpiling drugs, against official guidance. They said they were doing so by ordering drugs from abroad, and by asking their GPs for emergency prescriptions. One diabetic patient has been stockpiling insulin for four months, ordering twice the amount he needs for each of his drugs from the pharmacist. Robin Hewings, the head of policy at Diabetes UK, backed calls for more transparency from the government about current stock levels to reassure patients. \u201cThere is a level of concern that has risen quite a lot [in the last few months] and people with diabetes are talking about stockpiling. The government needs to be more transparent about insulin supplies.\u201d Hewings said people with diabetes in particular needed more reassurance. He added the risks associated with patients stockpiling drugs meant NHS resources could be wasted. \u201cIf we are in a situation where supplies are constrained and people then start trying to get a lot more insulin than they need ... I worry about the way that might play out.\u201d One diabetic patient, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: \u201cI am T1D and everyone on the diabetes forums are stockpiling insulin. People are reporting shortages due to this. We are used to getting insulin dispensed immediately or next day, but people say they are being asked to leave it a week.\u201d Another woman, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: \u201cI\u2019m really nervous about medical supplies and have scouted out both how to do day trips to France to get meds, or illegal postal supplies from India.\u201d Patients have also reported their GPs helping them to stockpile, with a 37-year-old woman saying she was given an emergency prescription. \u201cI saw my GP just before Christmas and said I was freaking out about a no deal and medicine shortages \u2026 She said that, since I was anxious about it, she\u2019d give me a six-week supply of each of the medicines to keep in a cupboard and hopefully any interrupted supplies would be smoothed over by then. If nothing happens, I can just use it as normal, but she said it was entirely reasonable for me to be afraid,\u201d she said. Speaking anonymously, the owner of a chemist in London said: \u201cThe cases I\u2019ve seen were just patients getting large supplies when it wasn\u2019t because they were going on holiday. The patient who received a private prescription got it from their regular GP.

It has been suggested in Italy that, according to the deal struck with Juve, Chelsea would be compelled to retain the Argentina international if he fulfils certain goal and appearance targets.</p> <p>Sarri claimed he had instructed the influential Chelsea board member and de facto director of football, Marina Granovskaia, that Higua\u00edn was his preferred option up front when they spoke two weeks ago and, uncharacteristically, namechecked the director four times in his media duties on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cMarina knows my opinion on how to improve the team,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident because I know Marina is working very hard, but I don\u2019t know the market at all. I want to be focused on the matches. So I don\u2019t call her every evening, otherwise I\u2019d spend all my mental energy on the market.\u201d</p> <p>The Italian is still hopeful a midfielder will also be bought to fill the void left by Cesc F\u00e0bregas, who has joined Monaco, not least because Jorginho, whom Sarri considers his only option in the middle, has recently shown signs of fatigue. \u201cWe need a replacement [for F\u00e0bregas], in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cMarina knows very well my opinion. So I\u2019m not frustrated at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it remains to be seen whether Chelsea follow up their initial interest in either Nicol\u00f2 Barella at Cagliari or, more likely, Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Leandro Paredes. Deals were agreed in principle in initial talks with the players\u2019 respective clubs as the Premier League side considered their options, though it is understood members of Chelsea\u2019s hierarchy are not necessarily convinced another midfielder is required. They already boast players such as Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and they could attempt to make Mateo Kovacic\u2019s loan from Real Madrid permanent in the summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are conscious, too, that recruiting another midfielder may block a potential pathway into the first team for Mason Mount, on loan at Derby County, or others.

The striker is coveted by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he began his career in the youth set-up. For now, Morata is technically available for Saturday\u2019s game at Arsenal. \u201cFor him, I think it\u2019s a very difficult moment,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cBut it\u2019s normal for a player in January to be involved in the market.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gonzalo Higua\u00edn is expected in London over the next 48 hours to undertake a medical and complete the formalities of his move to Chelsea from Juventus, initially on a six-month loan, with Maurizio Sarri still keen for the striker to be joined by a midfielder at Stamford Bridge. Higua\u00edn, who has spent the first half of the season on loan at Milan, has said his goodbyes to his Rossoneri teammates having pushed to be reunited with Sarri, under whose stewardship he scored 36 goals for Napoli in Serie A two seasons ago. The 31-year-old would join until the end of this campaign, though there is the potential for the arrangement to be extended for a further 12 months. It has been suggested in Italy that, according to the deal struck with Juve, Chelsea would be compelled to retain the Argentina international if he fulfils certain goal and appearance targets. Sarri claimed he had instructed the influential Chelsea board member and de facto director of football, Marina Granovskaia, that Higua\u00edn was his preferred option up front when they spoke two weeks ago and, uncharacteristically, namechecked the director four times in his media duties on Friday. \u201cMarina knows my opinion on how to improve the team,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident because I know Marina is working very hard, but I don\u2019t know the market at all. I want to be focused on the matches. So I don\u2019t call her every evening, otherwise I\u2019d spend all my mental energy on the market.\u201d The Italian is still hopeful a midfielder will also be bought to fill the void left by Cesc F\u00e0bregas, who has joined Monaco, not least because Jorginho, whom Sarri considers his only option in the middle, has recently shown signs of fatigue. \u201cWe need a replacement [for F\u00e0bregas], in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cMarina knows very well my opinion. So I\u2019m not frustrated at the moment.\u201d Yet it remains to be seen whether Chelsea follow up their initial interest in either Nicol\u00f2 Barella at Cagliari or, more likely, Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Leandro Paredes. Deals were agreed in principle in initial talks with the players\u2019 respective clubs as the Premier League side considered their options, though it is understood members of Chelsea\u2019s hierarchy are not necessarily convinced another midfielder is required. They already boast players such as Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and they could attempt to make Mateo Kovacic\u2019s loan from Real Madrid permanent in the summer. They are conscious, too, that recruiting another midfielder may block a potential pathway into the first team for Mason Mount, on loan at Derby County, or others. With Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s future beyond January far from certain in the wake of persistent interest from Bayern Munich, Chelsea will not necessarily want to frustrate another promising youngster\u2019s route to first-team involvement. They may have to deflect interest from Paris Saint-Germain in Paredes, amid suggestions the French champions have offered around \u00a334m for the Argentinian. The hope is that Higua\u00edn, who earns around \u00a3170,000 a week at Juventus, will have completed his move in time for the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday, and his arrival should see \u00c1lvaro Morata return to Spain for the rest of the campaign. The striker is coveted by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he began his career in the youth set-up. For now, Morata is technically available for Saturday\u2019s game at Arsenal. \u201cFor him, I think it\u2019s a very difficult moment,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cBut it\u2019s normal for a player in January to be involved in the market.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>David Pritchard, who has died aged 73, was the producer-director who recognised the latent potential of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/sep/15/keith-floyd-obituary\" title=\"\">Keith Floyd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/rickstein\" title=\"\">Rick Stein</a> to become two of Britain\u2019s most popular and identifiable television chefs. His methods were unconventional \u2013 what might be called laissez-faire television \u2013 in that he worked without script, with a single hand-held camera, while allowing his presenters\u2019 characters to emerge naturally as they grew into the medium.</p> <p>The process was most marked with Floyd, never less than in his first outing, when he was filmed talking, drinking and cooking on a bucking trawler in the middle of the Channel in 1985. \u201cThis is probably the worst programme ever to come out of Plymouth\u201d was the snap judgment of some of Pritchard\u2019s colleagues as they watched, horrified, a somewhat drunk Floyd cooking up a monkfish tail for sceptical fishermen. But Pritchard knew, or hoped he knew, better, as he succeeded in promoting his work from local television to the BBC\u2019s national network.</p> <p>Viewers took to the drinking, the constant banter between the chef and the film crew, the substitution of the camera lens for the audience\u2019s eye and the downright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/sep/15/keith-floyd-dies-celebrity-chef\" title=\"\">unexpectedness</a>, if not disaster (cue the hot-air balloon crash-landing over the French Vosges mountains) of the scenario. After relations with Floyd soured, Pritchard worked his familiar magic with a second south-western chef, Stein.</p> <p>Stein was not an immediately natural choice for media stardom. Again, the producer allowed him to be himself, to act naturally, to always film on location, never in a stultifying studio setting, and to embrace unlikely developments (the eruption on screen of Stein\u2019s dog <a href=\"https://www.rickstein.com/about/rick-stein/chalky/\" title=\"\">Chalky</a>) as well as occasional upsets. The partnership was enduring, with more than a dozen series and one-off programmes to its credit since the first airing of Taste of the Sea in 1995.</p> <p>While Pritchard\u2019s style was not without some precedent in British cookery television, it took it to new heights, as well as more successfully. It was the genesis of a certain school and left its watermark on many household names such as Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay and Nigella Lawson. Floyd always complained that he had spawned a nightmare, though no one, of course, could be more nightmarish than him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4355b9e04996ddc559a2e98045e9c2f19d34bdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4355b9e04996ddc559a2e98045e9c2f19d34bdd/0_78_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Floyd\u2019s flamboyant character was allowed to emerge under the television direction of David Pritchard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Floyd\u2019s flamboyant character was allowed to emerge under the television direction of David Pritchard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David was born in Southampton. His father, Arthur Pritchard, was a customs officer based along the coast in Weymouth, and his mother, Charlotte (nee Bee), later worked as an administrative assistant at Southampton University. They divorced in 1955, while David was still at the boarding school in Sussex to which he had been sent by Hampshire county council on account of his asthma. Returning to his home town to attend Mayfield Road secondary modern, he left at 16 with a single O-level, adding a second at technical college.</p> <p>After he had spent a few months working on a building site, his mother suggested a job with Southern, the local independent television company, as a film vault porter, definitely entry-level, carting large spools from one section to another.

      "bodyText": "David Pritchard, who has died aged 73, was the producer-director who recognised the latent potential of Keith Floyd and Rick Stein to become two of Britain\u2019s most popular and identifiable television chefs. His methods were unconventional \u2013 what might be called laissez-faire television \u2013 in that he worked without script, with a single hand-held camera, while allowing his presenters\u2019 characters to emerge naturally as they grew into the medium. The process was most marked with Floyd, never less than in his first outing, when he was filmed talking, drinking and cooking on a bucking trawler in the middle of the Channel in 1985. \u201cThis is probably the worst programme ever to come out of Plymouth\u201d was the snap judgment of some of Pritchard\u2019s colleagues as they watched, horrified, a somewhat drunk Floyd cooking up a monkfish tail for sceptical fishermen. But Pritchard knew, or hoped he knew, better, as he succeeded in promoting his work from local television to the BBC\u2019s national network. Viewers took to the drinking, the constant banter between the chef and the film crew, the substitution of the camera lens for the audience\u2019s eye and the downright unexpectedness, if not disaster (cue the hot-air balloon crash-landing over the French Vosges mountains) of the scenario. After relations with Floyd soured, Pritchard worked his familiar magic with a second south-western chef, Stein. Stein was not an immediately natural choice for media stardom. Again, the producer allowed him to be himself, to act naturally, to always film on location, never in a stultifying studio setting, and to embrace unlikely developments (the eruption on screen of Stein\u2019s dog Chalky) as well as occasional upsets. The partnership was enduring, with more than a dozen series and one-off programmes to its credit since the first airing of Taste of the Sea in 1995. While Pritchard\u2019s style was not without some precedent in British cookery television, it took it to new heights, as well as more successfully. It was the genesis of a certain school and left its watermark on many household names such as Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay and Nigella Lawson. Floyd always complained that he had spawned a nightmare, though no one, of course, could be more nightmarish than him. David was born in Southampton. His father, Arthur Pritchard, was a customs officer based along the coast in Weymouth, and his mother, Charlotte (nee Bee), later worked as an administrative assistant at Southampton University. They divorced in 1955, while David was still at the boarding school in Sussex to which he had been sent by Hampshire county council on account of his asthma. Returning to his home town to attend Mayfield Road secondary modern, he left at 16 with a single O-level, adding a second at technical college. After he had spent a few months working on a building site, his mother suggested a job with Southern, the local independent television company, as a film vault porter, definitely entry-level, carting large spools from one section to another. Evincing an interest in film editing, he taught himself the craft by emulation and imitation of his better-paid and senior colleagues. At the end of the 1960s, by now an assistant film editor, Pritchard sought better prospects in Newcastle upon Tyne at Tyne Tees Television. Other than teaching himself to cook from Katharine Whitehorn\u2019s Cooking in a Bedsitter, sharing a house with the journalist and presenter John Craven and briefly marrying for the first time, his northern sojourn taught him enough about film-making to gain him wider possibilities with BBC Bristol. Some training in presenters\u2019 eccentricities may have come from accompanying the author Beryl Bainbridge in a revisit of JB Priestley\u2019s English Journey, but his most memorable involvement was with a magazine series called RPM, which once featured Floyd (cooking rabbits in the French style). This managed to garner the judgment \u201cthe worst television programme ever broadcast\u201d, this time from the Bath Chronicle. A move to BBC Plymouth as features editor was the prelude to Pritchard\u2019s exploration of the possibility of working again with Floyd, in a programme demonstrating the wealth of seafood in his home region. Floyd on Fish went out in 1985 and was an immediate, if unlikely, success, and the first of eight expeditions at home and abroad, from the Somerset Levels to Bangkok and Malaysia; the partnership was not dissolved until 1993. In 1990 Pritchard ceased to work for the BBC and went freelance. After 1993 he joined the independent company Denham Productions, headed by the ex-BBC Plymouth presenter Chris Denham, where he was creative director.

On Wednesday night, Theresa May treated us to yet another of those occasions where she emerges out of the No 10 door in signature angular fashion, says precisely nothing of substance, then jerks back in again. How many episodes of this show are there going to be? Far be it from me to criticise the Bagpuss producers, but the decision to spin off the character of Professor Yaffle\u2019s wife isn\u2019t really working.</p> \n<p>In the wake of her promise to reach out in \u201cconstructive spirit\u201d and \u201cwork harder at taking parliament with us\u201d, No 10 let it be known that the only things May isn\u2019t flexible on are a second referendum, a customs union, a single market, extending article 50, or dropping the threat of no deal. She\u2019ll do anything for love, but she won\u2019t do that, or that, or that, or that. Those. The point is: she\u2019s changed.</p> \n<p>That said, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/corbyn-defends-refusal-to-talk-to-may-without-no-deal-pledge\" title=\"\">not to accept the cattle-prod</a> May has graciously extended to him misunderstands the theatre.

Do print all these out as they come, and you can burn them for warmth in the event of no deal. In the meantime, May has until Monday evening to come up with a workable plan B.</p> \n<p>On that note, you might have been surprised to read a well-briefed story on the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/theresa-may-to-block-bercow-s-peerage-nzh5nb5m5\" title=\"\">front of the Times</a> today, revealing that she will block a future peerage for Speaker John Bercow, on the basis of his growing taste for shithousery (I paraphrase slightly). To which the only response can be: is Brexit over? No, but is it? Are we actually in the sunlit uplands and none of us noticed? Because I think we all want confirmation that every last agreement has been nailed down and every last bonanza trade deal has been signed before No 10 spends one pissing second of its dwindling time briefing about whether ermine will or will not be forthcoming, for anyone, at some unspecified point in the future.</p> \n<p>Is anyone trying to get on top of plan B? According to reports, it\u2019s David Lidington. The entity always described as \u201cthe de facto deputy prime minister\u201d is apparently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46907468\" title=\"\">holding talks</a> with senior opposition politicians, along with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay \u2013 also believed to be an urban myth \u2013 and Michael Gove.</p> \n<p>The latter, of course, we are aware of, which makes his shortening leadership odds all the more eyecatching. In the immediate wake of the referendum, you will recall, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/07/farewell-michael-gove-traitor-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Michael\u2019s actions</a> were regarded as the Tories\u2019 personal knife-crime problem. After he backstabbed his Vote Leave buddy Boris Johnson, Michael\u2019s behaviour was widely regarded as too disgusting for the Conservative party. Indeed, it was helpful to note Boris Johnson giving a shout-out to Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry in his speech this morning, because Berry\u2019s only other claim to fame has been <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/boris-johnson/news/76846/tory-mp-suggests-he-could-chop\" title=\"\">two July 2016 tweets reading</a>, \u201cI do not for one moment resile from my opinion that as a traitor Gove leaves Judas Iscariot standing\u201d, and \u201cthere is a very deep pit reserved in hell for such as he. #Gove.\u201d Well. We all live in that pit now, and \u201cSafehands\u201d Gove is being touted by some as our best hope for avoiding a deeper one. Farce could easily repeat itself as history.</p> \n<p>Ah yes, history. In the run-up to the predictably vast defeat of her withdrawal deal on Tuesday night, May was in full delusional mode. \u201cWhen the history books are written,\u201d she hazarded, \u201cpeople will ask: did we deliver on the vote to leave? Or did we deliver for the economy and security?\u201d Ah. I hate to travel back from the future with spoilers, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/18/brexit-britain-history-books\" title=\"\">history books</a> end up making this period of British history a sealed section.

Optimists may feel able to dismiss Johnson as a Chinese restaurant\u2019s Churchill impersonator, but to watch him lie remorselessly in Staffordshire was to be reminded that he is still something far more sinister. It remains disturbing to see the media held captive in Buffalo Boris\u2019s well, while he leers his terrible catchphrases down at them. \u201cIt writes the article or it gets the hose \u2026\u201d Johnson has been sewing the pieces of his prime minister suit together for such a long time now; the prospect of him getting to wear it has yet to be eliminated. But what of the prime minister who Johnson is angling to replace? On Wednesday night, Theresa May treated us to yet another of those occasions where she emerges out of the No 10 door in signature angular fashion, says precisely nothing of substance, then jerks back in again. How many episodes of this show are there going to be? Far be it from me to criticise the Bagpuss producers, but the decision to spin off the character of Professor Yaffle\u2019s wife isn\u2019t really working. In the wake of her promise to reach out in \u201cconstructive spirit\u201d and \u201cwork harder at taking parliament with us\u201d, No 10 let it be known that the only things May isn\u2019t flexible on are a second referendum, a customs union, a single market, extending article 50, or dropping the threat of no deal. She\u2019ll do anything for love, but she won\u2019t do that, or that, or that, or that. Those. The point is: she\u2019s changed. That said, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision not to accept the cattle-prod May has graciously extended to him misunderstands the theatre. Corbyn prides himself on his historic success in keeping dialogue open during the Troubles, for instance, even though this vital role isn\u2019t acknowledged in any of the significant books about these events. Like Steven Seagal in Under Siege 2, Corbyn\u2019s \u201cgot medals that are so secret he can never show them to anybody\u201d. Even so, the Labour leader\u2019s current position looks unworthy of the hour. His determination, however, can only have been strengthened by Tony Blair popping up to say he was wrong. Perhaps Mr Blair might consider going on the airwaves and demanding the opposite of what he wants? I can\u2019t help feeling it would be 100% effective. For her part, May has decided to capitalise on the impasse by sending Corbyn a long and intense letter about being ghosted. Do print all these out as they come, and you can burn them for warmth in the event of no deal. In the meantime, May has until Monday evening to come up with a workable plan B. On that note, you might have been surprised to read a well-briefed story on the front of the Times today, revealing that she will block a future peerage for Speaker John Bercow, on the basis of his growing taste for shithousery (I paraphrase slightly). To which the only response can be: is Brexit over? No, but is it? Are we actually in the sunlit uplands and none of us noticed? Because I think we all want confirmation that every last agreement has been nailed down and every last bonanza trade deal has been signed before No 10 spends one pissing second of its dwindling time briefing about whether ermine will or will not be forthcoming, for anyone, at some unspecified point in the future. Is anyone trying to get on top of plan B? According to reports, it\u2019s David Lidington. The entity always described as \u201cthe de facto deputy prime minister\u201d is apparently holding talks with senior opposition politicians, along with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay \u2013 also believed to be an urban myth \u2013 and Michael Gove. The latter, of course, we are aware of, which makes his shortening leadership odds all the more eyecatching. In the immediate wake of the referendum, you will recall, Michael\u2019s actions were regarded as the Tories\u2019 personal knife-crime problem. After he backstabbed his Vote Leave buddy Boris Johnson, Michael\u2019s behaviour was widely regarded as too disgusting for the Conservative party. Indeed, it was helpful to note Boris Johnson giving a shout-out to Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry in his speech this morning, because Berry\u2019s only other claim to fame has been two July 2016 tweets reading, \u201cI do not for one moment resile from my opinion that as a traitor Gove leaves Judas Iscariot standing\u201d, and \u201cthere is a very deep pit reserved in hell for such as he. #Gove.\u201d Well. We all live in that pit now, and \u201cSafehands\u201d Gove is being touted by some as our best hope for avoiding a deeper one. Farce could easily repeat itself as history. Ah yes, history. In the run-up to the predictably vast defeat of her withdrawal deal on Tuesday night, May was in full delusional mode. \u201cWhen the history books are written,\u201d she hazarded, \u201cpeople will ask: did we deliver on the vote to leave? Or did we deliver for the economy and security?\u201d Ah. I hate to travel back from the future with spoilers, but the history books end up making this period of British history a sealed section. Its contents are deemed too spectacularly grotesque to consume without a warning. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

Brewster was pictured running at Melwood earlier this week but an impending return to competitive action was ruled out on Friday by Klopp, who insists there is no need to rush the England Under-17 World Cup winner\u2019s recovery. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not as far as he would like to be,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cHe\u2019s outside training, his running looks much better since he had this other little surgery.

He\u2019s in a good mood. He\u2019s a nice fella, really integrated in the team, but so far he couldn\u2019t show it on the pitch. But our opinion about him will not change. We have to wait a little longer for him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Klopp provided a more positive update on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who, like Brewster, has not featured this season due to serious knee injury. The manager added: \u201cHe\u2019s closer than Rhian, he\u2019s on a very good way but it will still take time. Last time, I think I put a bit of pressure on the medical department but when I see him running or on the ball, it looks good, promising, close to return. No problems, no swellings, he can work on his fitness issues.

      "bodyText": "And with that I\u2019m going to wrap things up. It\u2019s been another splendid day of non-stop action. Thanks for being with me, and have a great weekend. Bye! Claude Puel\u2019s short-term future would be rendered considerably rosier should Leicester get three points from this match: This morning I mentioned that Levante had appealed to have Barcelona expelled from the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player against them in the last round. The case has now been decided in Barcelona\u2019s favour on a technicality - Levante didn\u2019t submit their appeal within the 48-hour deadline for these things - and the quarter-finals have been drawn with them still in it. \u201cAfter studying the complaint and the corresponding allegations, the head of the competition has decided to maintain the result of the tie and keep Barcelona in the quarter-final draw,\u201d the federation said. And here is that draw: Real Madrid v Gerona Getafe v Valencia Sevilla v Barcelona Espanyol v Real Betis The Friday Fiver has landed! Jurgen Klopp has said Rhian Brewster is not in his plans for the remainder of the season as the young Liverpool striker continues his rehabilitation from ankle and knee surgery. The highly-rated 18-year-old has been sidelined for 12 months having damaged ankle ligaments and his meniscus in an under-23s game against Manchester City. Brewster was pictured running at Melwood earlier this week but an impending return to competitive action was ruled out on Friday by Klopp, who insists there is no need to rush the England Under-17 World Cup winner\u2019s recovery. \u201cHe\u2019s not as far as he would like to be,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cHe\u2019s outside training, his running looks much better since he had this other little surgery. He\u2019s in a good way but it will take time. But it\u2019s no problem, he has the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to think about him before the pre-season, I would say. He\u2019s in a good mood. He\u2019s a nice fella, really integrated in the team, but so far he couldn\u2019t show it on the pitch. But our opinion about him will not change. We have to wait a little longer for him.\u201d Klopp provided a more positive update on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who, like Brewster, has not featured this season due to serious knee injury. The manager added: \u201cHe\u2019s closer than Rhian, he\u2019s on a very good way but it will still take time. Last time, I think I put a bit of pressure on the medical department but when I see him running or on the ball, it looks good, promising, close to return. No problems, no swellings, he can work on his fitness issues. I think we will see him this season.\u201d Stuart James has written about Claude Puel\u2019s position at Leicester City, why it\u2019s under threat and precisely how much threat it\u2019s under: Another week, another audience with Leicester City\u2019s manager, and another question about his future. \u201cIt\u2019s a common thread, all press conferences, I cannot manage these rumours,\u201d Claude Puel replied, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s often we have a lot of bets about my future. But I\u2019m sorry for lots of people who made this bet because they lost a lot of money.\u201d Puel remains the favourite to be the next Premier League manager to leave his job, which may come as a surprise to those whose knowledge of Leicester begins and ends with their position in the table: eighth. The assumption that tends to follow is that any disgruntled Leicester supporters have ideas above their station, fuelled by that 5,000-1 triumph three years ago, and now expect to challenge for the title every season. The truth is rather different and has more to do with what they are paying to watch. To put it bluntly \u2013 and many Southampton supporters will probably be nodding their heads when they get to the end of this sentence \u2013 the football at home has been dull under Puel on far too many occasions to remember. Much more here: John Vickers, the former general manager of Lincoln City, has been sentenced to 14 months in prison for fraud. He admitted to defrauding the club of \u00a335,000, which he said in court was used to fund a gambling addiction. This is the club\u2019s statement: Lincoln City Football Club unequivocally condemn the actions of Mr John Vickers which have resulted in today\u2019s sentencing. John Vickers was a trusted employee, work colleague and friend of many at Lincoln City Football Club for a number of years so the discovery of his actions was met with feelings of shock and disappointment. In closing we would like to thank the authorities for their diligence in their investigations. Lincoln City Football Club are pleased to learn this matter as now been concluded and as such will be making no further comment. I have been watching Sky Sports News for seven hours now. Apart from adverts for Over-50s health insurance, the thing I\u2019ve seen repeated most often is the assertion that Gonzalo Higuain\u2019s brother and agent is poised to board a flight to England to discuss and complete a move to Chelsea. Latest is that he\u2019s still waiting. Nuno Espirito Santo has been talking about his approach to the midseason transfer window: I agree that it\u2019s more difficult to sign players in January. You don\u2019t have the same numbers of players available. It doesn\u2019t make sense to bring someone in that you don\u2019t find different to what you already have. The other point is knowing what you sometimes want, or the profile you want, is not available in the transfer window because they are doing well in other teams and they don\u2019t want to sell. It\u2019s the same as us. If someone comes knocking on my door and asks for some kind of player, the answer will be \u2018no\u2019, because we are building, we are trying to maintain the core, and other teams have the same approach, so it becomes very hard to make deals during this transfer window. The transfer window is here, but to bring someone that we find appropriate takes a lot of thinking and there are lots of decisions to make. At the same time, all the names that have been linked to us is a guessing game for journalists, trying to guess players who are not true. The way we work is clear; myself, my team and my players are only focused on the game and the club is prepared to act if we think that\u2019s the best decision we have. News from Bolton, where John McGinlay, who scored over 100 goals during a five-year spell at the club in the 1990s and is widely cherished as a club legend, has been banned from reporting on their game against West Brom. In an interview a couple of weeks ago he was asked about the club\u2019s current state. \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace the way this club has been run.\u201d His criticism of the club\u2019s ownership has been cited as a reason for the decision. Here\u2019s Roy Hodgson on the prospect of fielding Julian Speroni at Anfield. Speroni would become the first player born in the 1970s to play in the Premier League this season, and perhaps the last player born in that decade ever to play in the English top flight (at least until I inherit a fortune from my long lost uncle Bob, buy a club and force the manager to give me a runout): It\u2019s a tough ask, there\u2019s no question of that. In an ideal world you\u2019d not be thrusting him in, you\u2019d hopefully be easing him in, but we\u2019ve no choice. He\u2019s happy to have the chance and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll be working very hard to make certain he stays in contention, even when the other two are fit. But that hasn\u2019t bothered me particularly. Julian is a very, very active goalkeeper, certainly in training. I don\u2019t notice any difference in him from when he played a year ago; I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve got him. He\u2019s looking forward to it, has confidence in himself. He\u2019s a good goalkeeper, so we\u2019re very fortunate. To have his quality and experience as the third goalkeeper is pretty fortunate. We\u2019ve someone who\u2019s played over 400 times for Palace and is in very good shape. And a news story from Jacob Steinberg on Marko Arnautovic\u2019s ongoing rabid strop: A couple more match previews for your delectation. Firstly, Brighton\u2019s visit to Old Trafford: And secondly, Burnley\u2019s trip to Vicarage Road: What a team this was. Generally the 5-0 win over Nottingham Forest the previous year is considered their high point, but the 9-0 victory over Crystal Palace, which happened 30 years ago, wasn\u2019t bad either: As Palace head back to Anfield, Steven Pye has written a thing about that game. And here it is! We all miss this guy, don\u2019t we? He hopes to be back soon, and here\u2019s video evidence: Here\u2019s Rafael Benitez on the chances of Newcastle bringing new players in this month: Everything is depending on what you have done previously. You have to keep working for the summer window, and after keep working for the January window. This is more difficult because you have less players available, but still there are good players that maybe you can get. It\u2019s about the right player at the right time. We are working for a while [on potential signings], and we\u2019ll still keep working. It has now been confirmed that Marko Arnautovic will not be in the West Ham squad to face Bournemouth, because he\u2019s too unsettled: Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham might sign someone this month, but probably won\u2019t: We are open to improving our squad, to add players that can improve us, but it is not going to put pressure on us to sign players. We know very well the market is very difficult. If we identify a player who is going to help us, identify the player that can add quality we don\u2019t have in the squad, we are more than open to try. But at the moment, I think there\u2019s not too many possibilities to add the kind of player that can improve us. There\u2019s many names that appear in every transfer window. With Gonzalo Higuain apparently incoming, will the match at Arsenal be the last time Eden Hazard is asked to play as false nine? The league leaders host Crystal Palace tomorrow. Here\u2019s a preview: And here\u2019s birthday boy Pep Guardiola on the search for a backup/replacement for Fernandinho: The way we play we need a guy with physicality, quick in the head, the reading, with our spaces to attack. As many things he can do, the better. It\u2019s not easy to find one player who can do everything, and the price and the agents and the clubs ... So we will see. We have seen three, four players we are looking for. We will check if we can do it. Here\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino on life without Harry Kane: Harry is a very positive person, the moment he got injured he started thinking about recovering as soon as possible. When he is one of the best strikers in Europe it is going to affect performances. We are positive we can cope and we have players who can cover his position. It won\u2019t affect our approach to the games. Rafael Benitez has clarified the situation regarding Newcastle\u2019s injury list, ahead of their crucial home game against Cardiff: \u201cI\u2019m more or less optimistic. We have more or less the same problems we had. The new problems, we will decide tomorrow. But I am quite optimistic with Hayden, with Schar, with Clark, with Lascelles. I think they can be available if everything is fine.\u201d Of course if everything is not fine, they won\u2019t be. So, that\u2019s cleared up then. Claudio Ranieri has clarified the nature of the widely-discussed yoga-related bust-up between Aleksandar Mitrovic and Aboubakar Kamara: It wasn\u2019t a battle, it was a chat. Apparently it was \u201csomething that happens in every team\u201d. So there you go. Nothing to see here. Everyone is being asked about Marcelo Bielsa today. Here\u2019s Pep Guardiola\u2019s response: No manager around the world works with the amount of information that he has. It\u2019s unique in the world, how he works. But I think the most important, what I learned about what he said is that football belongs to the players. In the end, the players make the difference. And that\u2019s what I most agree with from what he said. The Crystal Palace manager, Roy Hodgson, has just confirmed that Julian Speroni, 39-year-old goalkeeper and former restaurateur (Speroni\u2019s used to be advertised on team sheets, but shut down in 2016), will start at Liverpool tomorrow. He last played a game for Palace on December 28 2017. Today saw the unveiling of a West Midlands tram, named in honour of the late, great Cyrille Regis, who died a year ago this week. Forget your ten-year challenges, how about some real nostalgia from the Nessun Dorma podcast crew? More Sarri, from the Press Association wire. Remember, though, he doesn\u2019t have much to do with the actual nuts and bolts of deals, even if Jorginho is clearly his player and Higua\u00edn is another of his former Napoli players. Maurizio Sarri on Friday refused to be drawn on the prospect of Gonzalo Higua\u00edn joining Chelsea, with the Blues head coach insisting he is not spending his energy on transfers. Higua\u00edn, who is on loan at AC Milan from Juventus, has been linked with a reunion with Sarri, who was his boss at Napoli. Asked how close Higua\u00edn was to signing, Sarri said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I want to be clear, because I cannot help you.\u201d The Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri has been asked - of course he has - about Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s spy missions. In Italy, yes [it happened]. I prefer to study my opponents by video. It is difficult to have a lot of information in the last two days, so I don\u2019t like this. Every coach tries to have information about the opponents, but I don\u2019t like the way. It happened a bit in Italy. I am not a very good spy. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho news, or at least Rui Faria news. The Lowry lingerer\u2019s bagman/attack dog/former assistant has finally got his first management job. From the wires: Doha (AFP) \u2013 Rui Faria, an assistant to Jose Mourinho at a number of Europe\u2019s biggest teams, has become head coach at Qatari league side Al Duhail, the club announced on Friday. Duhail said it made an agreement with Faria \u201cto be the coach of the team in the upcoming period\u201d. \u201cThe club will present its new coach to the media in a major press conference that will be announced in the upcoming two days,\u201d the club said on its website. Let us recall the kind, almost poetic, words the master had for his apprentice when Rui took his leave of Manchester last summer. 17 years\u2026 in Leiria, Porto, London, Milan, Madrid, London again and Manchester. Training, playing, travelling, studying, laughing and also a few tears of happiness. 17 years and the kid is now a man. The intelligent student is now a football expert, ready for a successful career as a manager.I will miss my friend and that is the hardest thing for me, but his happiness is more important and, of course, I respect his decision, especially because I know that we will always be together. Be happy, brother! Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! And this week\u2019s is a toughie. Mark Hudson is Huddersfield Town\u2019s stand-in manager, and gave a press conference this morning ahead of what seems likely to be only game in charge, Sunday\u2019s meeting with Manchester City. Rumours in Germany suggest another Borussia Dortmund coach will be coming in: Jan Siewert, coach of the Under-23s. Anyway, Hudson and captain Tommy Smith have thrown a bit of light on David Wagner\u2019s departure. First, Smith. We probably heard a little bit before you did. It\u2019s certainly been a shock to all of us. Our first reaction was disappointment. This manager has done a hell of a lot for this football club. There was shock, disappointment, but ultimately, we move on. We have to win the match on Sunday...He didn\u2019t say anything. I was in the dressing room after the game and it was no different to any other. The atmosphere was down, but no one realised what was going to happen. Next, Hudson He has brought everyone together in the community. Everyone should fully respect what he has done here. I will still be in contact with him. I have learned a lot from him as a player and a manager. He came in in the morning and said his goodbyes. You create real relationships and bonds so yes it was emotional. He said thanks to the players for everything they have given to him and I said the same to him. He knows what I\u2019m like and he knows I\u2019ve got a job to do so I said thank you and that I would be in contact. We have 16 games to give everything we have. We will not leave any stone unturned and will fight for everything on the pitch. That\u2019s what we will do. Harry Pearson on one of football\u2019s continuing rituals is well worth a read. Here\u2019s a Bournemouth v West Ham preview, which I shall leave you to enjoy for a bit. John Brewin will take you through the lunch gap. Important Manchester property update: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won\u2019t be at the Lowry Hotel quite as long as Jose Mourinho: I\u2019m still in the hotel but I\u2019ve found a place, so I won\u2019t be too long. I\u2019ve been driving around a bit to find my bearings again. I\u2019ve got mates here, so I have been to see a few of them so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m stuck in the hotel on my own. We await developments in the tale of Chelsea\u2019s pursuit of Gonzalo Higuain, which apparently could be concluded today. In the meantime, a little further down the pyramid, somewhat less high-profile transfers are happening... Check out your Cech knowledge, and also other stuff, in the sports quiz of the week: The match previews are starting to drop. Here\u2019s the first, which will cover all your Southampton v Everton needs: I\u2019m hearing that Marko Arnautovic is a doubt for West Ham\u2019s trip to Bournemouth tomorrow. There\u2019s uncertainty over whether the forward is in the right frame of mind after West Ham rejected a \u00a335m bid from a Chinese club for him last week. It\u2019s a difficult situation for Manuel Pellegrini, who won\u2019t want to be without his first choice striker against Bournemouth. However Arnautovic is said to be unhappy at West Ham\u2019s refusal to budge. He might have to suck it up, though. West Ham don\u2019t have much time to find a replacement this month. They\u2019ve looked at Celta Vigo\u2019s Maxi G\u00f3mez, but the 22-year-old Uruguayan won\u2019t be cheap. Sala\u2019s imminent move to Cardiff appears to have set the cat among the Nantes-based pigeons. According to French media (such as this article in L\u2019Equipe), Vahid Halilhodzic, the Bosnian manager who joined the club only in October, might end up leaving in protest. Here\u2019s Eddie Howe on rumours surrounding Callum Wilson and a potential move to either Chelsea or West Ham, and on transfers in general: I don\u2019t want to place any more pressure on Callum or any of my players in my team by talking about things that aren\u2019t important really. What\u2019s important for me is Callum working hard for the team, producing his best performances and on a consistent basis. For him, thinking about transfer fees, values and other clubs, I would recommend that he focuses on Bournemouth and our games to come. We\u2019ve had no interest in any of our players, everything has just been speculation, which you understand, this is the month for it, and I am sure it will not be the last thing that we hear. I think from my perspective and the team we have above me, we are always working together to try to find solutions to make the team better, the squad stronger and make the team continue to go forward. They are the main things. Here\u2019s photographic evidence of Oumar Niasse\u2019s move to Cardiff: Here\u2019s a piece on the state of play in the Bundesliga: The Bundesliga restarts after the winter break on Friday with something very unfamiliar yet extremely tantalising on the horizon: a proper title race. Borussia Dortmund lead the German league at the halfway point by six points from Bayern Munich, with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach a further three behind. This is unusual, to say the least. Bayern have been the Herbsmeister (autumn champions) for the past seven years and have won every league title since 2012-13. This time, though, they are the hunters and it is a role the Bayern players are enjoying. More here: Some news from Spain now, courtesy of Reuters: Levante have filed a complaint to the Spanish football federation (RFEF) stating that Barcelona fielded an ineligible player in their Copa del Rey last-16, first-leg match, the La Liga side said in a statement on Twitter on Friday. If the RFEF rule against Barca, who deny breaking any rules, they would be thrown out of the Copa, which they have won for the last four years, with Levante taking their place in the quarter-finals. The last-eight draw is due to take place at 5pm local time on Friday. Levante say that the Bar\u00e7a defender Juan \u2018Chumi\u2019 Brand\u00e1riz was ineligible to play in the game on 10 January, which Levante won 2-1, as he was serving a suspension for Bar\u00e7a\u2019s B team, which he had earned in a Spanish third-tier game. Neil Warnock has now confirmed that Niasse has signed for Cardiff on loan from Everton for the remainder of this season: The Niasse deal\u2019s done. I\u2019m relieved because I thought it was done yesterday. So to find out this morning is something I could have done without, but it\u2019s nice to know that he\u2019s available. Sala will apparently sign a three-and-a-half year contract, with Oumar Niasse also coming on loan. In his press conference Marco Silva mentioned Niasse as one of Everton\u2019s forward options, \u201cif he doesn\u2019t leave\u201d. If Sala is to feature in tomorrow\u2019s match in Newcastle, his transfer must be registered with the Premier League in the next 67 minutes. And news of a transfer apparently about to happen: Sky are reporting that Emiliano Sala is in Cardiff right now, having his medical ahead of an \u00a318m move from Nantes. In case you missed them, here are today\u2019s big rumours: And here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s take on Solskjaer\u2019s press conference: Here\u2019s some more from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on whether his side might be a tad overconfident against Brighton having won their last six games: Overconfident? No, you cannot be too confident. Confidence is one thing, complacency is the other side of it, that you think it\u2019s going to be easy. I want players to be confident, but I don\u2019t want them to be complacent and take their foot off the pedal because that\u2019s a big difference for me. I want them going into the games full of confidence taking people on, playing, running, passing forward, getting the crowd with them, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Good news for Burnley: they had a shot on target against Fulham after all! Today\u2019s Premier League birthday news: Pep Guardiola is 48 today, and Chelsea\u2019s Robert Green is 39. Some news from Leicester, where Marc Albrighton has signed a new contract that will (might) keep him at the club until 2022. This is what he said about it: It was totally straightforward. Leicester offered me a deal and I was always going to sign it. I\u2019ve had some good times here and hopefully I can continue to do so. When I first signed, I looked at the squad that was in the dressing room and the Club itself in terms of its fanbase and what sort of club it was. It was a family Club back then and it\u2019s a family Club now. It\u2019s something that suits me down to the ground. It really fit in well with me as a person and it\u2019s the perfect fit for me. Here\u2019s Marco Silva, who implies that he will keep playing Richarlison at centre-forward despite a five-game goal drought: My aim as a coach and a manager is to put the starting XI on the pitch and the XI I think is the best solution for each match. Richarlison can play out wide or as a striker; now he is playing more as a striker. I know every three or four matches he doesn\u2019t score the same conversation will come again. I know he hasn\u2019t scored since Boxing Day but he is a possibility to play as a striker, and I will decide the best solution as to who will play in that position. What I can say is he feels as comfortable in that position as he does playing out wide, it is the same for him, and it is up to us to decide. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has delivered an update on Manchester United\u2019s preparations for tomorrow\u2019s home game against Brighton. The big news: BONG! Alexis Sanchez is available! He\u2019s champing at the bit, I have to say. He\u2019s working hard in training. His attitude in training has been fantastic and he wants to play, so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing him. But I\u2019ve got loads of good players to choose from. BONG! Marouane Fellaini is not available! He\u2019ll probably be [out] at least three or four weeks. He\u2019s got a calf problem and that\u2019s sad because there\u2019s X factors in different players and we all know Felli\u2019s X factor. Then again, he\u2019ll be working hard to get back in when all the big games are coming as well. So the weekend is nearly here, and with it an avalanche of winter football, including key clashes towards the top and the bottom of the Premier League. Let\u2019s start with the weekend\u2019s English top-flight fixtures, and then take it from there: Saturday (3pm unless stated) Arsenal v Chelsea (5.30pm) Bournemouth v West Ham Liverpool v Crystal Palace Manchester United v Brighton Newcastle United v Cardiff City Southampton v Everton Watford v Burnley Wolverhampton Wanderers v Leicester (12.30pm) Sunday Fulham v Tottenham (4pm) Huddersfield v Manchester City (1.30pm) And here are 10 things to look out for in those games: In other news: It\u2019s a rest day in the Asian Cup. The Round of 16 starts on Sunday. There are games tonight in the Championship (Norwich v Birmingham), the Bundesliga (Hoffenheim v Bayern Munich) and in Ligue 1 (Lille v Amiens). A tram will be officially named after Cyrille Regis in Wednesbury at 11am. Welcome! Let\u2019s see what the day throws at us, shall we?",

The UK has more offshore wind capacity than anywhere in the world, with 37 projects made up of nearly 2,000 turbines. There is nearly 8GW of capacity today, 1.3GW of which was added in 2018. Another 5GW is already committed to. The UK has 44% of all European offshore wind power capacity.</p>\n    <p><b>What obstacles has wind power faced?<br></b>The first subsidies awarded to offshore windfarms promised developers a guaranteed price of up to \u00a3150 per megawatt hour, or roughly three times the wholesale cost of electricity. Such steep subsidies would not be sustainable but cost reductions in the industry have seen that figure drop to as low as \u00a357.50. The offshore wind industry has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/29/wind-turbines-uk-firms-miss-out\">criticised for not using enough UK contractors and suppliers</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>What is the economic benefit to the UK?<br></b>The industry employs around 11,000 people. One of the side effects of offshore wind\u2019s growth has been an injection of money and jobs into coastal towns that in some cases have big pockets of economic deprivation. Ports have been upgraded and new maintenance facilities built, such as the one at Newhaven in East Sussex for the first windfarm in the English Channel. The different parts of turbines are made across the UK, from the Isle of Wight to Hull.</p>\n    <p><b>What does the future hold for offshore wind power in the UK?<br></b>The industry has a target of growing today\u2019s 8GW capacity to 30GW by 2030, which, if achieved, would see offshore wind power supplying more than a third of the UK\u2019s electricity. The government has put a \u00a3557m pot of funding aside for subsidies for renewables in the next few years, most of which is expected to be taken up by offshore windfarms. The industry is also hoping for export opportunities for UK firms, as new markets grow in the US and Asia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director of RenewableUK, which compiled the figures, said: \u201cWe have ready-to-go onshore wind that can help close the gap between the low carbon power we need and the amount government policy is actually delivering, and this week\u2019s announcement on nuclear power has made this mammoth task even harder.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she said the government had \u201cstacked the odds\u201d against building the onshore windfarms needed to hit the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/30/uk-sets-ambitious-new-2030s-carbon-target\">UK\u2019s carbon targets</a>, by excluding developers from competing for subsidies in auctions.

There is a lobby correspondent joke about how, whenever a politician gives a \u201cwide-ranging speech\u201d, that\u2019s because they are making a pitch for the leadership. This speech wasn\u2019t a full-on \u201cwide-ranging\u201d one because what Johnson had to say about domestic policy was quite threadbare, but there were snippets of low-tax, decentralising thinking in it that, in other circumstances, might have made news. However, they were overshadowed by his comments on Brexit (which were scarcely plausible) and his comments on the EU referendum campaign (which were downright dishonest).</p> \n  <p>Here is a summary.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson falsely claimed that he had not used alarmist anti-Turkish messages during the 2016 referendum campaign. </strong>(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/18/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-merkels-probable-successor-and-other-leading-germans-urge-uk-to-change-its-mind-and-stay-politics-live?page=with:block-5c41bfdee4b058cfe6d927b0#block-5c41bfdee4b058cfe6d927b0\"> 12.20pm,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/18/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-merkels-probable-successor-and-other-leading-germans-urge-uk-to-change-its-mind-and-stay-politics-live?page=with:block-5c41c64fe4b058cfe6d9280c#block-5c41c64fe4b058cfe6d9280c\">12.37pm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/18/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-merkels-probable-successor-and-other-leading-germans-urge-uk-to-change-its-mind-and-stay-politics-live?page=with:block-5c41c8a3e4b058cfe6d92826#block-5c41c8a3e4b058cfe6d92826\">12.48pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that it was \u201coverwhelmingly likely\u201d that the EU would agree to a withdrawal agreement with the UK that did not involve the backstop and that involved the UK retaining half the \u00a339bn due to the EU until a trade deal has been concluded.</strong> He said the government had not even asked for the backstop to be removed. It should, he said. He claimed that the UK would be \u201cflexible\u201d and that the EU only ever made concessions at the last moment.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should take out the Irish backstop and use the transition period with a mutual commitment to maintain the status quo \u2013 zero tariffs, quotas or regulatory checks \u2013 to negotiate a new free trade deal, and a new partnership, not based on the backstop, as is currently proposed, but on the PM\u2019s Lancaster House speech.</p> \n   <p>And we should withhold at least half of the \u00a339bn until that deal is concluded.</p> \n   <p>If we mean it , if we are determined, and if we make it clear that this is our best and final offer, I would be utterly amazed if we cannot get agreement on these terms.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>EU leaders have said, firmly and repeatedly, that the backstop must stay and that the UK must pay what it owes as it leaves. Johnson is, of course, right to say that in some circumstances the EU does budge at the last minute in negotiations, but in the Brexit process EU leaders have been mostly very consistent in their demands and there is no evidence at all that they are wiling to offer concessions on the scale Johnson envisages. In fact, the opposite seems more likely.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that a no-deal Brexit leading to the imposition of UK-EU tariffs could not happen.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Britain and the EU are] run by highly intelligent, sensitive people who understand democracy and who respond to the needs of their constituents, particularly businesses.

So when people talk about that kind of no deal, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s remotely credible. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that in some respects May\u2019s Brexit deal was worse than staying in the EU. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/18/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-merkels-probable-successor-and-other-leading-germans-urge-uk-to-change-its-mind-and-stay-politics-live?page=with:block-5c41bbbee4b00173154a69c8#block-5c41bbbee4b00173154a69c8\">11.45am.)</a> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed he was not someone who deprecated other countries and cultures. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am not a nationalist, if by that you mean I\u2019m a xenophobe, or someone who deprecates other countries and cultures.

If we stay, we are tying ourselves to a broken Eurozone economy while simultaneously accepting unlimited migration of people trying to escape that broken economy. The only way to restore democratic control of immigration policy is to vote to leave on 23 June.</p> \n   <p>These problems will only get worse when countries in the pipeline to join the EU become members in the near future. British taxpayers are already paying nearly \u00a32 billion for Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey to join the EU. The European Commission recently announced an acceleration of these plans and is already extending visa-free travel to the border with Syria and Iraq. This is dangerous. The Government\u2019s claim that Britain has a veto is meaningless if it is simultaneously trying to \u2018accelerate\u2019 this process.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This letter was published in full in the (pro-leave) Daily Telegraph on 5 June 2016.

They said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Others assert that the UK has \u2018a veto\u2019 on Turkish accession. This claim is obviously artificial given the government\u2019s commitment to Turkish accession at the earliest possible opportunity.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In the letter they urged the government to promise to veto Turkey joining the EU. And they went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the government cannot give this guarantee, the public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to Vote Leave and take back control on 23 June.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But in the Q&amp;A today, when Channel 4 News\u2019 <strong>Michael Crick</strong> asked Johnson about his record on immigration, and the anti-Turkish campaign in 2016, Johnson claimed he did not raise the issue. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Actually, I didn\u2019t say anything about Turkey in the referendum. I think anybody who has followed my utterances during the last 20 years will know that I\u2019ve always been in the camp of those who defend ...</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>At this point Crick asked if he was disowning what he said in 2016. Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Since I made no remarks, I can\u2019t disown them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Crick tried again, prompting Johnson to say: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I didn\u2019t make any remarks about Turkey, mate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Crick then pointed out that Johnson led the Vote Leave campaign. Johnson replied</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You do me an honour. I was happy to support leave, and I do and I did. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s claim not to have raised Turkey as an issue in 2016 is demonstrably untrue.</p> \n  <p>In response, the anti-Brexit group <strong>Best for Britain</strong> has put out this statement from the Labour MP <strong>Virendra Sharma. </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris puts the moron in oxymoron. He\u2019s now trying to act the great liberal by championing migration, after shamelessly pushing anti-Turkish messages as a leader of the Vote Leave campaign.</p> \n   <p>But the government must love it when he gets up and gives these speeches. He\u2019s a helpful clown, distracting from the government\u2019s failures by pushing a no deal that Parliament won\u2019t let happen.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s time to stop giving his ill-thought through ideas oxygen, and hand the Brexit decision back to the public through a people\u2019s vote.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c41bdcce4b0197a614f57a6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T11:58:12.521Z\">11.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">DUP denies report claiming it would be open to UK staying in customs union with EU</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the Q&amp;A Boris Johnson was asked about <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brexit-dup-edges-towards-customs-union-5vkfkgfhm\">a story in today\u2019s Times (paywall)</a> saying the the DUP \u201cwould be open to a soft Brexit that kept the whole of the UK in a customs union with Brussels\u201d.

He will say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes Brexit was about democracy . . . but that vote was also triggered by a feeling that in some way the people of this country have been drifting too far apart and in areas where we need to come together.</p> \n   <p>We all know about boardroom pay and the huge expansion in the last 25 years of the gap between the remuneration of FTSE 100 CEOs and the average workers in their firms. We know one of the ways big corporations have held wages down is that they have had access to unlimited pools of labour from other countries.</p> \n   <p>Now I am a free market capitalist and a passionate believer in the benefits of migration but there must be a balance and if an influx of labour is being used not only to prevent investment in capital equipment but also in the skills and prospects of young people, then we need to think carefully about how we control immigration. If we want the people of Britain to have a pay rise, as I do, then we can\u2019t expect to do it by simply controlling immigration, we have to address all the causes of the productivity gap that has so massively expanded.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He will also call for more investment in \u201cgreat public services and safer streets [presumably that means the police], better hospitals, better transport links and better housing\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Any Johnson speech is normally a \u2018cancel all leave\u2019 occasion for factchecking outfits, and today\u2019s will probably be no exception. It is worth pointing out that when the migration advisory committee published its<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/741926/Final_EEA_report.PDF\"> report on the impact of EEA migration (pdf),</a> in September last year, it concluded that any impact EU migration may have had on the wages of British workers was minimal.</p> \n  <p>This is from the foreword from the committee\u2019s chair,<strong> Prof Alan Manning.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While we do think that EEA migration has had impacts, many of them seem to be small in magnitude when set against other changes. The fall in the value of the pound after the referendum vote to leave the EU probably raised prices by 1.7% - this is almost certainly a larger impact than the effect on wages and employment opportunities of residents from all the EEA migration since 2004, although over a different time period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is the conclusion to the section in the report about the impact of EU migration on wages. <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Taken altogether the existing evidence and the analysis we presented here suggests that immigration is not a major determinant of the wage growth experienced by existing residents. There is some suggestion that the impact on lower skilled groups may be more negative than for higher-skilled groups, but again these estimates are imprecise and subject to uncertainty.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And, for anyone interested in the technicalities, this is how the report tried to quantify that impact.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Earlier research] found that a 1 per cent increase in the immigrant-native working age population ratio led to a 0.5 per cent decrease in wages in the 1st decile [ie, the poorest 10%], and a 0.6 per cent and 0.4 per cent increase in wages at the median and 9th decile respectively over the period 1997 to 2005. The sizes of the estimates are sensitive to the choice of instrument, but the pattern across the wage distribution remains. </p> \n   <p>Our replication of these results yielded very similar estimates ...</p> \n   <p>The new updated results show the same pattern of effects across the UK-born wage distribution as in the original study, with negative impacts at the bottom of the distribution and positive impacts at the top. In terms of magnitude, the estimates for all immigrants are similar to those from the original paper. These suggest that for a 1 percentage point increase in the EU-born working age population ratio there is an associated 0.8 per cent decrease in UK-born wages at the 5th percentile [ie, the poorest 5%], a 0.7 per cent fall at the 10th percentile, a 0.2 per cent reduction at the 25th percentile, a 0.2 per cent rise at the 50th percentile, 0.3 per cent increase at the 75th percentile and a 0.7 per cent and 0.5 percent increase at the 90th and 95th percentiles respectively.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c419c9de4b058cfe6d92638\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T09:31:28.383Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tory Brexiter <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong> is going to host a regular Friday evening talkshow on LBC, the radio station has announced this morning.

Johnson has also said he would be \u201cutterly amazed\u201d if the UK could not get the EU to agree a new withdrawal agreement without the backstop. See 2.52pm for a full summary of the speech. Theresa May will hold meetings with members of her cabinet in Downing Street to try to forge a route through the Brexit impasse, as one of her ministers suggested her withdrawal agreement could be improved if the UK was prepared properly to leave with no deal. Nick Boles, the Tory MP leading attempts to get parliament to legislate to block a no-deal Brexit, has said he could well be deselected by his local party because of his activities. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, he said he would probably be deselected if there were a vote now. He explained: One hundred people in my local party have written in saying they\u2019re outraged by what I\u2019m saying and want to de-select me. And the truth is that many of them used to belong to Ukip only about a year ago. They\u2019re entirely entitled to their view and they\u2019re entitled to be members of the Conservative party and they\u2019re entitled to deselect me but I am not going to change what I believe is in the interest of the 80,000 people that I represent in parliament because of a hundred people in my constituency party. British manufacturers are being forced to build up financial buffers in preparation for a no-deal Brexit as the cost of stockpiling goods and materials puts companies under strain. The Lords EU justice sub-committee has expressed concerns about the government\u2019s failure to give a long-term commitment to retaining the Human Rights Act. In a letter to the committee, Edward Argar, a justice minister said that the government was committed to retaining it \u201cwhile the process of EU exit is underway\u201d but that after that it would consider the matter further \u201cin the full knowledge of the new constitutional landscape\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Have a good weekend. Anand Menon, the academic who runs the UK in a Changing Europe project, has written a good article for Guardian Comment explaining what he felt when he was on the Question Time panel last night and the audience loudly cheered the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Here is an extract. Metaphors matter. And Brexit has become a metaphorical cornucopia (if you see what I mean). Perhaps nowhere is this more true, and more damagingly and misleadingly so, than when it comes to the question of \u201cno deal\u201d. When you hear the phrase, it\u2019s natural to think of some kind of commercial exchange. So, for example, I\u2019ve decided to trade my old car in. I take it to the garage to part-exchange it, and the person makes me an offer I can easily refuse. So I drive the old car home. That\u2019s a no deal, but it is absolutely not a good analogy for Brexit. In commerce, as a rule, the default outcome \u2013 the situation if no transaction takes place \u2013 is the status quo ante. No deal, no change. With Brexit, if we leave the European Union with no deal, we don\u2019t simply carry on as before. Far from it. What will happen instead is that a whole swathe of rules governing all manner of transactions with the EU \u2013 covering, among other things, travel, security cooperation and trade \u2013 will cease to apply. Losing chunks of law isn\u2019t easy; pointing this out isn\u2019t \u201cProject Fear\u201d. This will be disruptive, and there\u2019s no point claiming otherwise. Thinking, \u201cSod it, it\u2019s been almost three years, let\u2019s just leave\u201d is fair enough, but be aware of what it means. And here is the full article. Liam Fox has also reaffirmed his opposition to the UK staying in the customs union for good, saying that would \u201cnot be delivering Brexit\u201d, the BBC reports. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said that other countries are to blame for the fact that the UK does not have alternative trade deals ready by 29 March to replace the existing 40 EU ones that will lapse if the UK leaves without a deal. Asked about this revelation in today\u2019s Financial Times (see 10.57am), he said: [The agreements are] not just dependent on the UK. Our side is ready. It is largely dependent on whether other countries believe that there will be no deal, and are willing to put the work into the preparations. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has said Jeremy Corbyn should adopt a \u201cmore mature\u201d attitude to the cross-party Brexit talks and participate, instead of boycotting them until Theresa May rules out no deal. On a visit to MOD St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan, Williamson said: The prime minister reached out across the House of Commons, giving the Labour leader the option to talk and discuss how best to take things forward, and he\u2019s just turned round and refused to do this, despite the fact that so often he\u2019s talked to so many other organisations and groups. I very much hope that he will rethink his position and take a more mature and considered attitude. Theresa May left Downing Street by car shortly after 3pm on Friday without speaking to reporters, the Press Association reports. She is due to spend the weekend at her country retreat, Chequers. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. There is a lobby correspondent joke about how, whenever a politician gives a \u201cwide-ranging speech\u201d, that\u2019s because they are making a pitch for the leadership. This speech wasn\u2019t a full-on \u201cwide-ranging\u201d one because what Johnson had to say about domestic policy was quite threadbare, but there were snippets of low-tax, decentralising thinking in it that, in other circumstances, might have made news. However, they were overshadowed by his comments on Brexit (which were scarcely plausible) and his comments on the EU referendum campaign (which were downright dishonest). Here is a summary. Johnson falsely claimed that he had not used alarmist anti-Turkish messages during the 2016 referendum campaign. (See 12.20pm, 12.37pm and 12.48pm.) He claimed that it was \u201coverwhelmingly likely\u201d that the EU would agree to a withdrawal agreement with the UK that did not involve the backstop and that involved the UK retaining half the \u00a339bn due to the EU until a trade deal has been concluded. He said the government had not even asked for the backstop to be removed. It should, he said. He claimed that the UK would be \u201cflexible\u201d and that the EU only ever made concessions at the last moment. We should take out the Irish backstop and use the transition period with a mutual commitment to maintain the status quo \u2013 zero tariffs, quotas or regulatory checks \u2013 to negotiate a new free trade deal, and a new partnership, not based on the backstop, as is currently proposed, but on the PM\u2019s Lancaster House speech. And we should withhold at least half of the \u00a339bn until that deal is concluded. If we mean it , if we are determined, and if we make it clear that this is our best and final offer, I would be utterly amazed if we cannot get agreement on these terms. EU leaders have said, firmly and repeatedly, that the backstop must stay and that the UK must pay what it owes as it leaves. Johnson is, of course, right to say that in some circumstances the EU does budge at the last minute in negotiations, but in the Brexit process EU leaders have been mostly very consistent in their demands and there is no evidence at all that they are wiling to offer concessions on the scale Johnson envisages. In fact, the opposite seems more likely. He claimed that a no-deal Brexit leading to the imposition of UK-EU tariffs could not happen. He said: [Britain and the EU are] run by highly intelligent, sensitive people who understand democracy and who respond to the needs of their constituents, particularly businesses. And they are not going to want to exit with a bristling palisade of sharpened stakes, in the form of tariffs, on either side of the channel. That is not going to happen, absolutely not. So when people talk about that kind of no deal, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s remotely credible. He said that in some respects May\u2019s Brexit deal was worse than staying in the EU. (See 11.45am.) He claimed he was not someone who deprecated other countries and cultures. He said: I am not a nationalist, if by that you mean I\u2019m a xenophobe, or someone who deprecates other countries and cultures. Absolutely not, far from it. Mikey Smith at the Mirror has done a good job explaining how this is hard to square with Johnson\u2019s long history of saying and writing offensive things about foreigners. Johnson refused to say that he would back May to stay as Tory leader in the event of a snap general election. (See 11.39am.) But he did say he did not favour a snap general election. He said: I think most people in this country feel they have had quite enough elections. I certainly do ... A snap election is not the right way through. He called for local mayor and councils to be given more power over local spending. He proposed: taking council tax, business rates stamp duty, land tax and the annual tax on enveloped dwellings, bundling them together giving them to local mayors and politicians to spend so that they have clear incentives to go for growth. Johnson is not the only Tory interested in this sort of fiscal devolution. Jake Berry, the Northern Powerhouse minister, has floated plans for a department for the north of England, possibly with the power to vary local rates of income tax. Johnson said the government should create free ports in the UK. Free ports are port areas where goods can come and go exempt from tariffs and taxes. He said: There are now 135 countries in the world that have such free ports with all their power to attract the growth of all kind and it is absurd that Britain will be forbidden by this deal from doing the same. He claimed that EU migration had helped to depress wages and he said there was some evidence that \u201ca tightening of the labour market since the [referendum] vote is actually contributing to a rise in take home pay\u201d. This is from the Independent\u2019s Tom Peck. More from Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, on Boris Johnson. Theresa May will be meeting with \u201ca large number\u201d of cabinet ministers in Downing Street today, a No 10 spokeswoman said. The meetings will be both with individual ministers and in groups throughout the day, the spokeswoman added, but there will not be a \u201ccabinet gathering as such\u201d. As the Press Association reports, the spokeswoman declined to give a list of names but said that more than half of cabinet ministers would be attending. She added: \u201cI\u2019m sure they will discuss a wide range of issues but you can expect Brexit to be a dominant focus.\u201d The spokeswoman also that May had held \u201cconstructive\u201d telephone conversations with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch premier Mark Rutte yesterday. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, is going to speak to Theresa May at some point this afternoon, the commission\u2019s spokesman has announced. He said the call was happening at May\u2019s request. Here is Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, on Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. No one will take lessons from Boris Johnson on eroding trust in our democracy. The fact he is still peddling mistruths about money from Brexit going to our NHS is shameful. Brexit will make us poorer. As exit day approaches, with Theresa May\u2019s deal soundly defeated, extending Article 50 is the only responsible course of action left. We can then hold a people\u2019s vote with the option to remain in the EU. This could happen much sooner than has been suggested and dig the country out of the huge hole the Tories have excavated. And here are some more examples of Boris Johnson raising Turkey as a leave campaign issue in 2016. In April he said: I am very pro-Turkish but what I certainly can\u2019t imagine is a situation in which 77million of my fellow Turks and those of Turkish origin can come here without any checks at all. That is mad - that won\u2019t work. And in June he discussed the issue during a Telegraph/HuffPost debate, as HuffPost\u2019s Ned Simons points out. As the recent Channel 4 drama, Brexit: The Uncivil War depicted, the Vote Leave campaign decided to use alarmist messages about the prospect of Turkish migrants being able to come to the UK because they were deemed effective - even though the MPs fronting the campaign may have had their reservations about dabbling in xenophobia. Michael Gove, who was joint leader of Vote Leave with Boris Johnson, has acknowledged as much. In an interview for a book published last year, when asked about the anti-Turkish messaging, he admitted that in retrospect he would have liked the campaign to have \u201ca slightly different feel\u201d. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove also raised the prospect of the Turkish migrants being able to enter the UK freely if it remained in the EU in a second letter sent to David Cameron during the referendum campaign in 2016. They said: The Eurozone\u2019s economic crisis is fueling the rise in migration. Millions of people in southern Europe, particularly young people, are giving up hope of their countries escaping recession. Unsurprisingly, migrants from those countries are disproportionately coming to Britain. Given the Eurozone crisis, we can only expect this to continue for many years. If we stay, we are tying ourselves to a broken Eurozone economy while simultaneously accepting unlimited migration of people trying to escape that broken economy. The only way to restore democratic control of immigration policy is to vote to leave on 23 June. These problems will only get worse when countries in the pipeline to join the EU become members in the near future. British taxpayers are already paying nearly \u00a32 billion for Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey to join the EU. The European Commission recently announced an acceleration of these plans and is already extending visa-free travel to the border with Syria and Iraq. This is dangerous. The Government\u2019s claim that Britain has a veto is meaningless if it is simultaneously trying to \u2018accelerate\u2019 this process. This letter was published in full in the (pro-leave) Daily Telegraph on 5 June 2016. The letter mentioned earlier (see 12.20pm) was publicised on 16 June 2016. During the 2016 referendum campaign Vote Leave, which was jointly headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, claimed that if the UK remained in the EU, and the Turkey succeeded in joining, then around 80m Turks could end up being able to move to Britain. At one point in the campaign Johnson and Gove wrote a joint letter to David Cameron about this. They said: Others assert that the UK has \u2018a veto\u2019 on Turkish accession. This claim is obviously artificial given the government\u2019s commitment to Turkish accession at the earliest possible opportunity. In the letter they urged the government to promise to veto Turkey joining the EU. And they went on: If the government cannot give this guarantee, the public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to Vote Leave and take back control on 23 June. But in the Q&amp;A today, when Channel 4 News\u2019 Michael Crick asked Johnson about his record on immigration, and the anti-Turkish campaign in 2016, Johnson claimed he did not raise the issue. He said: Actually, I didn\u2019t say anything about Turkey in the referendum. I think anybody who has followed my utterances during the last 20 years will know that I\u2019ve always been in the camp of those who defend ... At this point Crick asked if he was disowning what he said in 2016. Johnson replied: Since I made no remarks, I can\u2019t disown them. Crick tried again, prompting Johnson to say: I didn\u2019t make any remarks about Turkey, mate. Crick then pointed out that Johnson led the Vote Leave campaign. Johnson replied You do me an honour. I was happy to support leave, and I do and I did. Johnson\u2019s claim not to have raised Turkey as an issue in 2016 is demonstrably untrue. In response, the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain has put out this statement from the Labour MP Virendra Sharma. Boris puts the moron in oxymoron. He\u2019s now trying to act the great liberal by championing migration, after shamelessly pushing anti-Turkish messages as a leader of the Vote Leave campaign. But the government must love it when he gets up and gives these speeches. He\u2019s a helpful clown, distracting from the government\u2019s failures by pushing a no deal that Parliament won\u2019t let happen. It\u2019s time to stop giving his ill-thought through ideas oxygen, and hand the Brexit decision back to the public through a people\u2019s vote. In the Q&amp;A Boris Johnson was asked about a story in today\u2019s Times (paywall) saying the the DUP \u201cwould be open to a soft Brexit that kept the whole of the UK in a customs union with Brussels\u201d. Johnson said he had seen the story, but that he did not know what the DUP were actually saying on this and that he had concerns about the idea of the UK staying in the customs union. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has just put out a statement saying the Times report is not true. She said: The report published in the Times this morning about the DUP is inaccurate and no doubt designed to undermine efforts to get the necessary changes to the withdrawal agreement. The prime minister is very clear on our position. We have been consistent that for us it is the backstop which needs to be dealt with. For the future we want an agreement which returns control of our money, our laws and our borders through a UK wide free trade arrangement with the EU. The story in the Times is an attempt to cause division. Such tactics are not new to us and as in the past will not succeed. Q: If parliament ruled out no deal, would you support May? Johnson says he does not see how parliament can rule out no deal. But he thinks there will be a deal. He says a no-deal Brexit that led to the imposition of tariffs between the EU and the UK is not going to happen. Johnson claims a no-deal Brexit, leading to the imposition of UK-EU tariffs, would not happen. And that\u2019s it. He has now finished. I will post a summary and reaction soon. Q: Alan Duncan says you have divided the Conservative party and are not fit to lead it? \u201cMe,\u201d says Johnson with some apparent incredulity. He says he is just trying to bring people together. Q: Jacob Rees-Mogg said yesterday that, forced to choose between May\u2019s deal and staying in the EU, he would opt for May\u2019s deal. Would you? Johnson says that is not a choice he would want. In some ways, May\u2019s deal is worse than staying in the EU. At least in the EU the UK would have a say over new EU rules. But not under May\u2019s deal. That is a \u201creal defect\u201d. Johnson says May\u2019s deal is in some respects worse than remaining in EU. Q: If May could get this deal through with Labour votes, should she stay on? Johnson says, if we had ham, we would have ham. He does not want to comment on hypotheticals, he says. May says parliament has voted to leave the EU on 29 March. That cannot be superseded except by another piece of legislation, he says. And he says that is not going to happen. Q: We are in the middle of a national crisis, and you are here making a blatant leadership pitch. Why don\u2019t you just support Theresa May? Johnson says May\u2019s deal will not get through the Commons. But she has a \u201cmassive opportunity\u201d. If she goes back to Brussels, she can get rid of the backstop. Q: Would you back May in a snap election? Johnson says most people have had enough of elections. Q: If there is a snap election, should May stand down? Johnson says there is no need for as snap election. The government should be focusing on getting a better deal from the EU. Johnson refuses to say he would back Theresa May to stay as leader if Tories had to fight a snap election. This is from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges. Johnson says, when he was in government, he tried very hard to get it to take the Brexit approach he is now advocating. Johnson has now finished. He is taking questions. Q: In 2015 you said you were the most pro-immigration politician in the UK. In 2016 he ran a campaign saying 80m Turks would come to the UK. You have been all over the place on immigration. Won\u2019t you say anything to win a leadership election? Johnson says he did not make any remarks about Turkey during the EU referendum campaign. Q: You ran the Vote Leave campaign. It was their theme. Johnson says the questioner, Michael Crick from Channel 4 News, is doing him too much honour. He says he has always supported immigration, but believes it must be controlled. Johnson disowns Vote Leave\u2019s anti-Turkish campaign message. Johnson says he wants to see more social cohesion. He is not a nationalist, if nationalism means being opposed to foreigners, he says. He is cosmopolitan. His ancestors came from many places, he says. But he says he does believe in the importance of place. He recalls the Olympics, and how people felt allegiance to the same team. He says, if we can harness that sense of teamwork, we can increase national self-confidence. That feeling of autonomy, being in charge of your own life, is ultimately what Brexit is all about, he says. And that autonomy can be used innovate in business. He says the UK should be the best place in the world \u201cto turn a whacky idea into a world beater\u201d. He says the JCB itself is an example; it is a glorified tractor, with a back hoe and a front loader. Johnson segues into crime, saying the curent mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is not doing as good a job \u201cas the previous guy\u201d (Johnson himself.) He calls for more spending on health. And he calls for spending decisions to be devolved to local mayors. He conceded this will cost money. Johnson says Brexit could lead to higher pay, as well as cheaper food and cheaper clothes. But immigration has not been the only factor holding pay down, he says. He says the government has to do more to improve productivity. There is too much of a gap between London and the regions, he says. People wanted this issue addressed. Johnson is now talking about the reasons why people voted for Brexit. He is quoting the passage on pay briefed overnight. (See 9.56am.) Johnson says, if the UK holds its nerve, it can deliever not a pseudo Brexit, or a fake Brexit, but the Brexit people voted for. And that would forestall all the years of uncertainty that May\u2019s deal would generate. Johnson claims that extending article 50 would be a mistake, because nothing would do more to erode trust in politics. And he criticises plans to allow MPs to block a no-deal Brexit. The UK should insist on only paying half the \u00a339bn due to the EU when the new trade deal is settled, he says. And he says he would be \u201cutterly amazed\u201d if the UK could not get a deal on the terms he is proposing. Johnson says trying to \u201cheave\u201d MPs from one side of the debate to another is a mistake. And the idea that customs union membership would be a solution is a mistake, he says. He says the UK needs to instead focus on getting a better deal from the EU. The UK has not even tried to get rid of the backstop, he says. But he says he does not believe it is true to say there is no chance of getting it removed from the deal. Now is the time for us to go back to Brussels ... and demand real change to that backstop. And this time we must mean it. He claims that the EU will be \u201cflexible\u201d. If you follow the EU, you will see that it is only in the last few days and weeks that they make concessions. Johnson says it would be a mistake to stay bound by EU rules. What would happen if the EU decided to regulate to ban some new innovation that British firms wanted to introduce. The EU would be able to take these decisions without the UK having a say. He says it makes him \u201cfurious\u201d that the government could even contemplate this. It would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d, he says. Johnson talks about driving a JCB, or a \u201ccustard collossus\u201d, as he calls it. He says they can move anything out of the way, but it goes wrong if you accidentally put it in reverse gear, he says. And he says the same thing applies with Brexit. The government is taking the wrong approach, he says. He says it should not be trying to get Theresa May\u2019s deal through parliament with Labour support. Johnson says May should not be trying to get her deal through Commons with Labour support. Boris Johnson is about to deliver his speech at the JCB factory in Staffordshire. You are read all the Guardian politics stories here. And all our Brexit ones are here. Obviously there\u2019s an overlap. And here are some of the more interesting Brexit stories in the other papers. James Blitz, Jim Pickard and George Parker in the Financial Times (paywall) says the government will not have alternative trade deals ready by 29 March to replace the existing 40 EU ones that will lapse if the UK leaves without a deal. Britain has failed to finalise most trade deals needed to replace the EU\u2019s 40 existing agreements with leading global economies and will not be close to doing so when Brexit occurs on March 29, according to an internal Whitehall memorandum. The memo, compiled by civil servants as part of contingency planning for the UK crashing out of the EU without a formal Brussels divorce agreement, warned that most of the deals would lapse without a transition period that keeps Britain under the EU umbrella once Brexit occurs. \u201cAlmost none of them are ready to go now and none will be ready to go by March,\u201d said one government official who has seen the internal analysis of the Department of International Trade\u2019s progress. John Stevens in the Daily Mail says Whitehall officials have drawn up plans for a possible snap election. Britain was on general election alert last night after Whitehall chiefs were ordered to draw up contingency plans for a snap poll. Amid the fragile situation in Westminster, Britain\u2019s top civil servant told Government departmental heads to be ready in case an election is needed to break the Brexitdeadlock. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill met senior mandarins this week to discuss preparations in case Theresa May decides to go to the country. Matt Chorley in the Times (paywall) says John Bercow could be denied a peerage when he stands down as speaker because he has enraged ministers with his stance on Brexit. John Bercow is set to become the first Speaker in 230 years to have his peerage blocked after ministers moved to punish him for \u201cbias\u201d during Brexit debates, The Times has learnt. Commons Speakers are usually automatically offered a seat in the House of Lords after approval by No 10 but relations between Mr Bercow and the government have broken down ... A cabinet source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a good job that peerage nominations are in our gift \u2014 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be thinking carefully about which individuals we would choose to elevate to the House of Lords. I can\u2019t imagine we would look favourably on those who\u2019ve cheated centuries of procedure\u201d ... Retiring Speakers usually resign as an MP at the same time, triggering a by-election. A motion is traditionally then passed by the Commons asking the Queen to \u201cconfer some signal mark of Her Royal favour upon\u201d the outgoing Speaker for \u201ceminent services during the important period in which he presided with such distinguished ability and dignity\u201d. However, the idea that the \u201csignal mark\u201d must be a peerage is merely a convention. Mehreen Khan and Alex Barker in the Financial Times say EU legal advice says article 50 could be extended beyond the summer without the UK having to hold fresh European parliamentary elections. Britain can extend its EU membership beyond the summer of 2019 without taking part in European elections or undermining the European Parliament, lawyers have advised the assembly. Although contentious, the opinion from the European Parliament\u2019s legal service potentially addresses a significant obstacle to Britain asking to delay Brexit beyond July 2, the inauguration date of the new assembly following the elections due in May. \u201cThe possibility for the European Parliament to be validly constituted following the 2019 elections would not be affected by a potential failure by the UK to organise elections,\u201d the paper states, according to a copy leaked to the Financial Times. Without elections, the UK\u2019s existing MEPs would remain until the new parliament was put together on July 2. In the new assembly, Britain would not have any seats. The other member states would have the same number of MEPs as now, with the chamber being reorganised only once Britain had left the EU. And this is not a story, but it is worth noting anyway. The Islington Tribune, Jeremy Cobyn\u2019s local paper, has a wraparound advert urging him to back a second referendum. This is from Penny Mordaunt, the Brexiter international development secretary. Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, says Mordaunt seems to be implying that a no-deal Brexit would be better than what Theresa May is offering. The Boris Johnson speech is inevitably being seen as a contribution towards his longstanding aspiration to become the next party leader. But Sir Alan Duncan, who served as his deputy when Johnson was foreign secretary and who is still in government, has taken the unusual step of going public this morning to say his former boss is not fit to replace Theresa May. According to a preview of his speech in the Times (paywall), Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, will say that he wants the people of Britain to have a pay rise and that he thinks immigration controls after Brexit will help. He will say: Yes Brexit was about democracy . . . but that vote was also triggered by a feeling that in some way the people of this country have been drifting too far apart and in areas where we need to come together. We all know about boardroom pay and the huge expansion in the last 25 years of the gap between the remuneration of FTSE 100 CEOs and the average workers in their firms. We know one of the ways big corporations have held wages down is that they have had access to unlimited pools of labour from other countries. Now I am a free market capitalist and a passionate believer in the benefits of migration but there must be a balance and if an influx of labour is being used not only to prevent investment in capital equipment but also in the skills and prospects of young people, then we need to think carefully about how we control immigration. If we want the people of Britain to have a pay rise, as I do, then we can\u2019t expect to do it by simply controlling immigration, we have to address all the causes of the productivity gap that has so massively expanded. He will also call for more investment in \u201cgreat public services and safer streets [presumably that means the police], better hospitals, better transport links and better housing\u201d. Any Johnson speech is normally a \u2018cancel all leave\u2019 occasion for factchecking outfits, and today\u2019s will probably be no exception. It is worth pointing out that when the migration advisory committee published its report on the impact of EEA migration (pdf), in September last year, it concluded that any impact EU migration may have had on the wages of British workers was minimal. This is from the foreword from the committee\u2019s chair, Prof Alan Manning. While we do think that EEA migration has had impacts, many of them seem to be small in magnitude when set against other changes. The fall in the value of the pound after the referendum vote to leave the EU probably raised prices by 1.7% - this is almost certainly a larger impact than the effect on wages and employment opportunities of residents from all the EEA migration since 2004, although over a different time period. This is the conclusion to the section in the report about the impact of EU migration on wages. Taken altogether the existing evidence and the analysis we presented here suggests that immigration is not a major determinant of the wage growth experienced by existing residents. There is some suggestion that the impact on lower skilled groups may be more negative than for higher-skilled groups, but again these estimates are imprecise and subject to uncertainty. And, for anyone interested in the technicalities, this is how the report tried to quantify that impact. [Earlier research] found that a 1 per cent increase in the immigrant-native working age population ratio led to a 0.5 per cent decrease in wages in the 1st decile [ie, the poorest 10%], and a 0.6 per cent and 0.4 per cent increase in wages at the median and 9th decile respectively over the period 1997 to 2005. The sizes of the estimates are sensitive to the choice of instrument, but the pattern across the wage distribution remains. Our replication of these results yielded very similar estimates ... The new updated results show the same pattern of effects across the UK-born wage distribution as in the original study, with negative impacts at the bottom of the distribution and positive impacts at the top. In terms of magnitude, the estimates for all immigrants are similar to those from the original paper. These suggest that for a 1 percentage point increase in the EU-born working age population ratio there is an associated 0.8 per cent decrease in UK-born wages at the 5th percentile [ie, the poorest 5%], a 0.7 per cent fall at the 10th percentile, a 0.2 per cent reduction at the 25th percentile, a 0.2 per cent rise at the 50th percentile, 0.3 per cent increase at the 75th percentile and a 0.7 per cent and 0.5 percent increase at the 90th and 95th percentiles respectively. The Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg is going to host a regular Friday evening talkshow on LBC, the radio station has announced this morning. The first programme will go out tonight at 6pm. Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March, but it is not too late to think again, according to some of the most powerful figures in Germany. They have signed a letter to the Times saying they want Britain to stay (paywall). It is affectionate and even rather moving (as well as being authentically drafted by a foreigner - there\u2019s an odd reference to \u201cgoing to the pub after work hours to drink an ale\u201d.) Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has not signed it, but the name at the top of the letter is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - who has taken over from Merkel as head of the Christian Democratic Union and who is favourite to succeed her as Germany\u2019s leader when Merkel steps down. Other signatories include: Andrea Nahles, leader of the Social Democrats; Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, leaders of the Green party; Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries; Thomas Enders, head of Airbus: and Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler. Here is the letter in full (paywall). Sir, Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today: a community defined by freedom and prosperity. After the horrors of the second world war, Britain did not give up on us. It has welcomed Germany back as a sovereign nation and a European power. This we, as Germans, have not forgotten and we are grateful. Because we realise that the freedom we enjoy as Europeans today has in many ways been built and defended by the British people, we want Britons to know that we respect their choice. And should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe. But Britons should equally know that we believe that no choice is irreversible. Our door will always remain open: Europe is home. Britain has become part of who we are as Europeans. And therefore we would miss Britain. We would miss the legendary British black humour and going to the pub after work hours to drink an ale. We would miss tea with milk and driving on the left-hand side of the road. And we would miss seeing the panto at Christmas. But more than anything else, we would miss the British people \u2014 our friends across the Channel. We would miss Britain as part of the European Union, especially in these troubled times. Therefore Britons should know: from the bottom of our hearts, we want them to stay. The House of Commons is not sitting today and the Brexit news factory may be having a relatively quiet day. The main event will probably turn out to be a speech by Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary. But we are not expecting him to declare that he has read the letter in the Times and changed his mind. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, gives a speech on the value of culture. 11am: Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, gives a speech in Staffordshire on Britain after Brexit. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I finish, at around 4pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Jake Neate, 37, is detained in intensive care at Rampton hospital in Nottinghamshire, one of three high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales. He is seriously ill and is subject to checks every 15 minutes. Chelmsford crown court heard that Neate killed 33-year-old Suzanne Brown in a \u201cfrenzied attack\u201d at the couple\u2019s home in Braintree, Essex, on 15 December 2017. A jury heard a trial of the facts because Neate was deemed unfit to stand trial. Both Neate and his parents had repeatedly raised the alarm about his deteriorating mental health in the days and hours before the killing, his parents have said. As well as police and mental health services, the family also contacted their local MP, James Cleverley, but he did not see key emails until after Brown\u2019s death. Neate\u2019s mother, Jan, said in a statement that her son had a normal childhood but smoked cannabis as a teenager and became mentally ill soon after going to study geography at the University of Birmingham. He had been with Brown since 2007 and the court heard she was devoted to him and had \u201cthe patience of a saint\u201d, looking after him when he was unwell. His mental health deteriorated after a clinical decision was made to take him off the anti-psychotic drug clozapine because it was damaging his immune system. The court heard that on the evening of Friday 15 December Neate\u2019s mother called 999 and described the situation in the couple\u2019s home as \u201ccritical\u201d, hoping the police would respond immediately. Officers arrived three hours later, by which time it was too late to save Brown. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it was finalising its investigation into the actions of the police. Neate himself had contacted Cleverly after the withdrawal of clozapine, and the MP said he would try to help. On the night of the killing, Neate\u2019s mother twice emailed Cleverly expressing concern that the emergency services had not responded swiftly to her pleas for help. Cleverly and his team did not see the emails until they returned to Westminster the following Monday morning. The MP later wrote to Neate\u2019s parents expressing his condolences and said: \u201cWhen the time is appropriate I will, if you wish me to, bring your concerns about the lack of support for Jake to the attention of mental health services and social services.\u201d Andy Brogan, the executive director for mental health and deputy chief executive at Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust, expressed sorrow for Brown\u2019s death. He said the trust had conducted an internal review but because a domestic homicide review and independent review into Neate\u2019s care by NHS England were under way it was unable to respond to specific questions from the Guardian. An inquest has been opened into Brown\u2019s death.",

      "body": "<p>The pulling out of Hitachi from the proposed Wylfa nuclear power plant is a good thing for energy policy \u2013 not a serious blow as said in the article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/17/hitachi-set-to-scrap-16bn-nuclear-project-anglesey-wales\" title=\"\">Hitachi scraps \u00a316bn nuclear power station in Wales</a>, 18 January). Nuclear power is now one of the most expensive form of electricity there is. But beyond the economics, it no longer fits with the digitalising world that we live in. The global energy system is undergoing change similar to that in telecoms and computers over the last few decades. The energy system is becoming smarter and more flexible and it is on the path to being operated in a completely different way than hitherto because of that.</p> <p>Nuclear \u2013 with its huge, inflexible output \u2013 is the equivalent of a giant boulder in the middle of a motorway. We, the energy customers of Britain, would have ended up paying way over the odds for Wylfa, which would have also undermined the UK\u2019s move to a smart and flexible system \u2013 which really is the future. We are already going to do that for Hinkley Point C.</p> <p>Going down the nuclear route has been a wasted decade for UK energy policy. Exiting from the EU and the loss of flexibility we may end up with because of difficulties to do with interconnectors and market arrangements is a far greater threat to security than some phantom nuclear power plant from a previous age. <br><strong>Catherine Mitchell</strong><br><em>Professor of energy policy, University of Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 Everyone knows that nuclear power creates lethal waste which hundreds of future generations will have to manage, and, despite the risk being very low, can lead to accidents (or terrorist attacks) with enormous impacts. But Hitachi\u2019s abandonment of the new Wylfa nuclear power station is more evidence, as if any were needed, that nuclear power is also fundamentally uneconomic.</p> <p>Renewable energy is already cheaper than all fossil fuels and new nuclear. And yet, \u00a316bn spent on grid-level energy storage in the UK would enable a further plummet in the price of renewable energy \u2013 a huge boost to the UK economy, to energy independence and security, and to a cleaner future. Why do successive governments of both main parties continue to support these massive white elephants?<br><strong>Stephen Psallidas</strong><br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 The withdrawal of Hitachi from the Anglesey nuclear power station project is another blow to the government\u2019s energy policy. Obviously, the fact that solar and wind power are intermittent posits a need for a constant source to back it up. What is difficult to understand is why we can\u2019t use tidal lagoons as the backup. The amounts of energy provided by tidal flows around Britain are almost incalculable, and the simple expedient of closing the gates and leaving millions of tons of water poised to flow through turbines whenever needed is a clear alternative to nuclear. Why aren\u2019t we adopting it?<br><strong>Jeremy Cushing</strong><br><em>Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 What a good opportunity for the government to give the go-ahead to the environmentally friendly Swansea Bay tidal lagoon power plant.<br><strong>Hilda </strong><strong>Reynolds</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 Energy supply is endlessly debated; less is said about demand. Building new homes to <a href=\"https://passivehouse.com/\" title=\"\">Passive House standards</a> and retro-fitting existing buildings (all buildings) would reduce demand hugely. It would also offer local employment and skills training across all regions. Green Keynesian economics in action.

      "bodyText": "The pulling out of Hitachi from the proposed Wylfa nuclear power plant is a good thing for energy policy \u2013 not a serious blow as said in the article (Hitachi scraps \u00a316bn nuclear power station in Wales, 18 January). Nuclear power is now one of the most expensive form of electricity there is. But beyond the economics, it no longer fits with the digitalising world that we live in. The global energy system is undergoing change similar to that in telecoms and computers over the last few decades. The energy system is becoming smarter and more flexible and it is on the path to being operated in a completely different way than hitherto because of that. Nuclear \u2013 with its huge, inflexible output \u2013 is the equivalent of a giant boulder in the middle of a motorway. We, the energy customers of Britain, would have ended up paying way over the odds for Wylfa, which would have also undermined the UK\u2019s move to a smart and flexible system \u2013 which really is the future. We are already going to do that for Hinkley Point C. Going down the nuclear route has been a wasted decade for UK energy policy. Exiting from the EU and the loss of flexibility we may end up with because of difficulties to do with interconnectors and market arrangements is a far greater threat to security than some phantom nuclear power plant from a previous age. Catherine Mitchell Professor of energy policy, University of Exeter \u2022 Everyone knows that nuclear power creates lethal waste which hundreds of future generations will have to manage, and, despite the risk being very low, can lead to accidents (or terrorist attacks) with enormous impacts. But Hitachi\u2019s abandonment of the new Wylfa nuclear power station is more evidence, as if any were needed, that nuclear power is also fundamentally uneconomic. Renewable energy is already cheaper than all fossil fuels and new nuclear. And yet, \u00a316bn spent on grid-level energy storage in the UK would enable a further plummet in the price of renewable energy \u2013 a huge boost to the UK economy, to energy independence and security, and to a cleaner future. Why do successive governments of both main parties continue to support these massive white elephants? Stephen Psallidas Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 The withdrawal of Hitachi from the Anglesey nuclear power station project is another blow to the government\u2019s energy policy. Obviously, the fact that solar and wind power are intermittent posits a need for a constant source to back it up. What is difficult to understand is why we can\u2019t use tidal lagoons as the backup. The amounts of energy provided by tidal flows around Britain are almost incalculable, and the simple expedient of closing the gates and leaving millions of tons of water poised to flow through turbines whenever needed is a clear alternative to nuclear. Why aren\u2019t we adopting it? Jeremy Cushing Exeter \u2022 What a good opportunity for the government to give the go-ahead to the environmentally friendly Swansea Bay tidal lagoon power plant. Hilda Reynolds Bristol \u2022 Energy supply is endlessly debated; less is said about demand. Building new homes to Passive House standards and retro-fitting existing buildings (all buildings) would reduce demand hugely. It would also offer local employment and skills training across all regions. Green Keynesian economics in action. Bring it on.

      "body": "<p>Another week, another audience with Leicester City\u2019s manager, and another question about his future. \u201cIt\u2019s a common thread, all press conferences, I cannot manage these rumours,\u201d Claude Puel replied, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s often we have a lot of bets about my future. But I\u2019m sorry for lots of people who made this bet because they lost a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>Puel remains the favourite to be the next Premier League manager to leave his job, which may come as a surprise to those whose knowledge of Leicester begins and ends with their position in the table: eighth. The assumption that tends to follow is that any disgruntled Leicester supporters have ideas above their station, fuelled by that 5,000-1 triumph three years ago, and now expect to challenge for the title every season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/18/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The truth is rather different and has more to do with what they are paying to watch. To put it bluntly \u2013 and many Southampton supporters will probably be nodding their heads when they get to the end of this sentence \u2013 the football at home has been dull<strong> </strong>under Puel on far too many occasions to remember.</p> <p>As for the results, it is hard to sugarcoat statistics that show Puel\u2019s record is worse than the man who was sacked to make way for him. Craig Shakespeare averaged 1.38 points per game, Leicester scored more goals than they conceded while he was in charge and they won as many games as they lost. Puel averages 1.35 points per game, Leicester have lost more matches than they have won under him and their goal difference is negative.</p> <p>Bearing in mind that Shakespeare was told to clear his desk after eight months because the club felt \u201ca change is necessary to keep the club moving forward \u2013 consistent with the long-term expectations of our supporters, board and owners\u201d, it is little wonder Puel\u2019s position continues to be the subject of so much scrutiny. Where, say his critics, is the progress?</p> <p>An alternative take would be \u2013 and there are fans who remain firmly behind Puel \u2013 that the 54-year-old should be cut some slack. Those with a foot in the Frenchman\u2019s camp say he deserves credit for giving youngsters a platform to thrive \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/07/ben-chilwell-aim-to-be-one-of-englands-best-ever-left-backs-leicester-city\" title=\"\">Ben Chilwell in particular</a> \u2013 that the loss of Riyad Mahrez to Manchester City last summer should not be overlooked and that allowances ought to be made for the emotional fallout in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/27/leicester-city-owners-helicopter-crash-car-park\" title=\"\">the helicopter crash in October</a> that claimed the lives of five people, including Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester\u2019s owner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reality is that Leicester were unconvincing on the pitch before that tragedy. Indeed, Puel was straying into slightly awkward territory last week when he rounded on his critics and suggested that people had short memories when it comes to what the club has been through. \u201cIt was a fantastic feeling to move on and respect the memory of Vichai and his dream,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have some things and words about finishing seventh or eighth, it is crazy. People forget quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The focus on the league position is a red herring \u2013 Puel did not lose his job at Southampton because they finished eighth; it was the style of football, the lack of goals \u2013 only 41 in 38 matches \u2013 and his failure to galvanise the fanbase and players that did for him. The similarities at Leicester are striking.</p> <p>Leicester have scored only 13 goals at the King Power Stadium all season, they have lost three of their past four home matches, including back-to-back defeats against relegation strugglers Cardiff and Southampton, and were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/newport-county-leicester-city-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">dumped out of the FA Cup by Newport County</a> a fortnight ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f03790acfd15218bf8a86976fb99b18f31be232b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03790acfd15218bf8a86976fb99b18f31be232b/0_0_4654_3030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puel during his Leicester City press conference on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puel during his Leicester City press conference on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arguably as worrying as all the facts and figures is that even now, 15 months after his appointment, it is hard to discern any clear identity in the way that Leicester play under Puel.On the day he was presented as manager Puel talked about how it was \u201cdifficult for Leicester to have been playing for three or four years with a counterattack and just this system. It\u2019s important to have other answers \u2026 my work is to build the players up to have these options and solutions.\u201d Yet if it was Puel\u2019s intention to turn Leicester into more of a possession-based team at times, or at the very least make the players comfortable with an alternative approach, there is no evidence it has worked.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Southampton\u2019s visit last Saturday</a> Puel started with three defensive midfielders against a team in the relegation zone. Despite playing with an extra man for 45 minutes and enjoying 72% possession Leicester struggled to create chances and resorted to pumping hopeful crosses into the area that played into the hands of Jannik Vestergaard and Jan Bednarek. Remarkably those two Southampton defenders headed the ball clear as many times (14) as Jamie Vardy touched it in 90 minutes. Forget the superhero outfit that Leicester\u2019s leading scorer wore to training on Thursday; a stepladder would have been more use against Southampton.</p> <p>The way that match panned out was predictable in many respects. Leicester\u2019s win ratio under Puel is as low as 29% (W9 D9 L13) when they have more of the ball than their opponents. It climbs to as high as 50% (W10 D3 L7) when they surrender possession, which is why facing Chelsea and Manchester City in the space of four days around Christmas suited them. That is not to take anything away from those results \u2013 hugely impressive 1-0 and 2-1 victories respectively \u2013 but more to illustrate how playing on the counterattack remains Leicester\u2019s best hope of picking up points.</p> <p>A game at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday is a blessing for that reason and it would be no surprise if Leicester get a positive result. Yet even if that turns out to be the case, the debate about Puel\u2019s future is unlikely to go away and it would be naive for anyone to think Leicester\u2019s board have not been asking questions of their own. It feels as though it has got to the stage where a parting of the ways is inevitable in the summer at the latest, when the potential availability of Brendan Rodgers and Rafael Ben\u00edtez alters the managerial landscape. Perhaps the bigger question is whether the bookies will be forced to pay out before then.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another week, another audience with Leicester City\u2019s manager, and another question about his future. \u201cIt\u2019s a common thread, all press conferences, I cannot manage these rumours,\u201d Claude Puel replied, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s often we have a lot of bets about my future. But I\u2019m sorry for lots of people who made this bet because they lost a lot of money.\u201d Puel remains the favourite to be the next Premier League manager to leave his job, which may come as a surprise to those whose knowledge of Leicester begins and ends with their position in the table: eighth. The assumption that tends to follow is that any disgruntled Leicester supporters have ideas above their station, fuelled by that 5,000-1 triumph three years ago, and now expect to challenge for the title every season. The truth is rather different and has more to do with what they are paying to watch. To put it bluntly \u2013 and many Southampton supporters will probably be nodding their heads when they get to the end of this sentence \u2013 the football at home has been dull under Puel on far too many occasions to remember. As for the results, it is hard to sugarcoat statistics that show Puel\u2019s record is worse than the man who was sacked to make way for him. Craig Shakespeare averaged 1.38 points per game, Leicester scored more goals than they conceded while he was in charge and they won as many games as they lost. Puel averages 1.35 points per game, Leicester have lost more matches than they have won under him and their goal difference is negative. Bearing in mind that Shakespeare was told to clear his desk after eight months because the club felt \u201ca change is necessary to keep the club moving forward \u2013 consistent with the long-term expectations of our supporters, board and owners\u201d, it is little wonder Puel\u2019s position continues to be the subject of so much scrutiny. Where, say his critics, is the progress? An alternative take would be \u2013 and there are fans who remain firmly behind Puel \u2013 that the 54-year-old should be cut some slack. Those with a foot in the Frenchman\u2019s camp say he deserves credit for giving youngsters a platform to thrive \u2013 Ben Chilwell in particular \u2013 that the loss of Riyad Mahrez to Manchester City last summer should not be overlooked and that allowances ought to be made for the emotional fallout in the wake of the helicopter crash in October that claimed the lives of five people, including Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester\u2019s owner. The reality is that Leicester were unconvincing on the pitch before that tragedy. Indeed, Puel was straying into slightly awkward territory last week when he rounded on his critics and suggested that people had short memories when it comes to what the club has been through. \u201cIt was a fantastic feeling to move on and respect the memory of Vichai and his dream,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have some things and words about finishing seventh or eighth, it is crazy. People forget quickly.\u201d The focus on the league position is a red herring \u2013 Puel did not lose his job at Southampton because they finished eighth; it was the style of football, the lack of goals \u2013 only 41 in 38 matches \u2013 and his failure to galvanise the fanbase and players that did for him. The similarities at Leicester are striking. Leicester have scored only 13 goals at the King Power Stadium all season, they have lost three of their past four home matches, including back-to-back defeats against relegation strugglers Cardiff and Southampton, and were dumped out of the FA Cup by Newport County a fortnight ago. Arguably as worrying as all the facts and figures is that even now, 15 months after his appointment, it is hard to discern any clear identity in the way that Leicester play under Puel.On the day he was presented as manager Puel talked about how it was \u201cdifficult for Leicester to have been playing for three or four years with a counterattack and just this system. It\u2019s important to have other answers \u2026 my work is to build the players up to have these options and solutions.\u201d Yet if it was Puel\u2019s intention to turn Leicester into more of a possession-based team at times, or at the very least make the players comfortable with an alternative approach, there is no evidence it has worked. For Southampton\u2019s visit last Saturday Puel started with three defensive midfielders against a team in the relegation zone. Despite playing with an extra man for 45 minutes and enjoying 72% possession Leicester struggled to create chances and resorted to pumping hopeful crosses into the area that played into the hands of Jannik Vestergaard and Jan Bednarek. Remarkably those two Southampton defenders headed the ball clear as many times (14) as Jamie Vardy touched it in 90 minutes. Forget the superhero outfit that Leicester\u2019s leading scorer wore to training on Thursday; a stepladder would have been more use against Southampton. The way that match panned out was predictable in many respects. Leicester\u2019s win ratio under Puel is as low as 29% (W9 D9 L13) when they have more of the ball than their opponents. It climbs to as high as 50% (W10 D3 L7) when they surrender possession, which is why facing Chelsea and Manchester City in the space of four days around Christmas suited them. That is not to take anything away from those results \u2013 hugely impressive 1-0 and 2-1 victories respectively \u2013 but more to illustrate how playing on the counterattack remains Leicester\u2019s best hope of picking up points. A game at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday is a blessing for that reason and it would be no surprise if Leicester get a positive result. Yet even if that turns out to be the case, the debate about Puel\u2019s future is unlikely to go away and it would be naive for anyone to think Leicester\u2019s board have not been asking questions of their own. It feels as though it has got to the stage where a parting of the ways is inevitable in the summer at the latest, when the potential availability of Brendan Rodgers and Rafael Ben\u00edtez alters the managerial landscape. Perhaps the bigger question is whether the bookies will be forced to pay out before then.",

      "body": "<p>Give it a week, maybe two, and Boris Johnson will deny he ever came to the JCB factory, owned by Brexit-backing billionaire Lord Bamford, in Staffordshire to make yet another comeback speech. That\u2019s his current grasp of reality. As a politician he has long since been nothing more than a blond curiosity. A one-man freak show. But as a case study he still has plenty to offer the psychiatric profession. The jury is out. Is he aware he is lying but sees no problem with it? In which case he is a borderline sociopath. Or is he utterly delusional? In which case he is clearly psychotic. Either way, he needs help. Quickly. To save him from himself and to save the country from him.</p> <p>You\u2019d have thought that Boris had had enough of making leadership bids by now. After all, it\u2019s not as if the previous seven or eight have gone particularly well. He is a film franchise dying on his feet. The Return of the Slobbit 9. But apparently not. Boris was back to once again convince the public that the man who had done more than anyone else to divide the country and bring it to its knees was just the person to pull it back from the brink.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/arent-you-going-insane-readers-questions-from-beyond-brexitland\">'Aren't you going insane?': readers' questions from beyond Brexitland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson cut to the chase early on. Theresa May\u2019s deal was terrible. What she should have been doing was trying to negotiate with the EU which had been all poised to be flexible and drop the Northern Ireland backstop. It made you wonder if he had actually been following the news over the past couple of years. In BorisWorld, Boris the Superhero would go to Brussels, tell Michel Foreigner what\u2019s what over a decent dejeuner and get exactly what he wanted. He wasn\u2019t saying he ought to be prime minister, but he ought to be prime minister.</p> <p>Having got Brexit sorted, the Slobbit turned his attention to the reasons why people voted to leave the EU. There was too much inequality. Some people got paid far too much, while others had to make do on next to nothing. Take him as an example. The \u00a3230,000 a year he was being paid to write essentially the same article each week \u2013 on top of his salary as an MP \u2013 was a total disgrace. He should be getting far more than that. No one could survive on \u00a35K a week when they had an expensive divorce to pay for.</p> <p>Next on the agenda was his record as London mayor. No one had done more to put the capital on the map than him. The cable car that went from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular was the envy of the world. As was his ability to have \u00a348m wasted on a garden bridge project that was never going to get built. Not even some of the world\u2019s greediest or corrupt politicians would have dared to try to get away with that.</p> <p>Then to the home straight. A succession of lies. Five Easy Pieces. Brexit would lead to a huge cash boost for the NHS. He loved foreigners. He was a team player. He was doing his bit to keep the Tory party together. A no-deal Brexit would be a no-sweat Brexit. There was a brief pause when the Slobbit reached the finish line as the media briefly considered the possibility that they had been had. That the whole thing had been a wind-up and that Boris was going to break into one of his trademark guilty grins and shout \u201cGotcha\u201d.</p> <p>But he had been serious. As serious as an unserious man with no credibility can hope to be. So the media piled in. Channel 4\u2019s Michael Crick challenged him on the remarks that he and Michael Gove had made about Turkish immigration during the 2016 referendum campaign. \u201cNever said nothing,\u201d Johnson pouted. Crick quoted chapter and verse but still Boris repeated his denials. Just because there was film and written evidence of him doing something didn\u2019t make it real.</p> <p>It was straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. Only sadder and more pathetic. More quintessentially British. A man who can\u2019t quite accept that his audience is now limited to his own reflection. In a cracked mirror. And even he can\u2019t raise a laugh at his tired one-liners. No one cares any more. He might have been funny once but the world has moved on. All that remains for him is a howling against the dying of the light.</p> <p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d he said at the end. It was a question everyone had been asking. He disappeared out of sight behind a large yellow digger. The other diggers in the factory raised their arms in salute. They couldn\u2019t have dug a better hole for him if they had tried.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Give it a week, maybe two, and Boris Johnson will deny he ever came to the JCB factory, owned by Brexit-backing billionaire Lord Bamford, in Staffordshire to make yet another comeback speech. That\u2019s his current grasp of reality. As a politician he has long since been nothing more than a blond curiosity. A one-man freak show. But as a case study he still has plenty to offer the psychiatric profession. The jury is out. Is he aware he is lying but sees no problem with it? In which case he is a borderline sociopath. Or is he utterly delusional? In which case he is clearly psychotic. Either way, he needs help. Quickly. To save him from himself and to save the country from him. You\u2019d have thought that Boris had had enough of making leadership bids by now. After all, it\u2019s not as if the previous seven or eight have gone particularly well. He is a film franchise dying on his feet. The Return of the Slobbit 9. But apparently not. Boris was back to once again convince the public that the man who had done more than anyone else to divide the country and bring it to its knees was just the person to pull it back from the brink. Johnson cut to the chase early on. Theresa May\u2019s deal was terrible. What she should have been doing was trying to negotiate with the EU which had been all poised to be flexible and drop the Northern Ireland backstop. It made you wonder if he had actually been following the news over the past couple of years. In BorisWorld, Boris the Superhero would go to Brussels, tell Michel Foreigner what\u2019s what over a decent dejeuner and get exactly what he wanted. He wasn\u2019t saying he ought to be prime minister, but he ought to be prime minister. Having got Brexit sorted, the Slobbit turned his attention to the reasons why people voted to leave the EU. There was too much inequality. Some people got paid far too much, while others had to make do on next to nothing. Take him as an example. The \u00a3230,000 a year he was being paid to write essentially the same article each week \u2013 on top of his salary as an MP \u2013 was a total disgrace. He should be getting far more than that. No one could survive on \u00a35K a week when they had an expensive divorce to pay for. Next on the agenda was his record as London mayor. No one had done more to put the capital on the map than him. The cable car that went from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular was the envy of the world. As was his ability to have \u00a348m wasted on a garden bridge project that was never going to get built. Not even some of the world\u2019s greediest or corrupt politicians would have dared to try to get away with that. Then to the home straight. A succession of lies. Five Easy Pieces. Brexit would lead to a huge cash boost for the NHS. He loved foreigners. He was a team player. He was doing his bit to keep the Tory party together. A no-deal Brexit would be a no-sweat Brexit. There was a brief pause when the Slobbit reached the finish line as the media briefly considered the possibility that they had been had. That the whole thing had been a wind-up and that Boris was going to break into one of his trademark guilty grins and shout \u201cGotcha\u201d. But he had been serious. As serious as an unserious man with no credibility can hope to be. So the media piled in. Channel 4\u2019s Michael Crick challenged him on the remarks that he and Michael Gove had made about Turkish immigration during the 2016 referendum campaign. \u201cNever said nothing,\u201d Johnson pouted. Crick quoted chapter and verse but still Boris repeated his denials. Just because there was film and written evidence of him doing something didn\u2019t make it real. It was straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. Only sadder and more pathetic. More quintessentially British. A man who can\u2019t quite accept that his audience is now limited to his own reflection. In a cracked mirror. And even he can\u2019t raise a laugh at his tired one-liners. No one cares any more. He might have been funny once but the world has moved on. All that remains for him is a howling against the dying of the light. \u201cIs that it?\u201d he said at the end. It was a question everyone had been asking. He disappeared out of sight behind a large yellow digger. The other diggers in the factory raised their arms in salute. They couldn\u2019t have dug a better hole for him if they had tried.",

And Billericay Town have reappointed Harry Wheeler, five months after sacking him as manager. \u201cI\u2019m not too proud to let my ego get in the way of business,\u201d he cheered. STILL WANT MORE? Life without Kane and Son, Giroud\u2019s future and Hudson\u2019s impossible mission. Just three of the 10 things to look out for this weekend. Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! Including brainteasers on Marcelo Bielsa, Petr Cech and the Mous(s)a Demb\u00e9le clan. \u201cNo one is allowed to rest\u201d: Dortmund are braced for a Bayern charge. Marcus Christenson on the return of Der Bundesliga. Daniel Taylor hears from freshly installed Martin O\u2019Neill on why Nottingham Forest should be more than just a \u201cbrilliant name\u201d.

Murdoch was forced to provide guarantees of editorial independence to gain approval of the then News International\u2019s takeover of the titles in 1981. The guarantees also prevented the sharing of resources between the two titles. A year after doing so, the Times editor, Harold Evans, was forced out, claiming Murdoch interfered with the running of the paper. News UK has made an application to Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, to remove some of the legal guarantees that would allow the two titles to share content and staff. A spokeswoman for News UK has said the titles will continue to be run separately with two newsrooms and editors \u2013 John Witherow at the Times and Martin Ivens at the Sunday Times. If the undertakings are relaxed, the publisher will be able to seek significant cost savings across the two titles, which employ 505 editorial staff. \u201cThe persistent cost pressures facing our industry mean that we need to manage our newsrooms as carefully as possible,\u201d said Witherow. \u201cWe need to stay competitive in an increasingly difficult market so that we can continue to build a sustainable future for Times journalism.\u201d Ivens said: \u201cTo protect our distinctive voice we need the freedom to work more closely to avoid duplication and invest more in the agenda-setting journalism we are famous for.\u201d The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will have to consider the application and decide if the restrictions should be allowed to be removed.

      "body": "<p>The former Sheffield Wednesday safety officer accused of criminal offences in relation to the 1989 disaster at the club\u2019s Hillsborough ground, in which 96 people died, has denied he was negligent in the performance of his role.</p> <p>Graham Mackrell, 69, will argue that the standards expected of a football ground safety officer were much lower in 1989 to those that apply now, his barrister, Jason Beer QC, told the jury at Preston crown court.</p> <p>Beer said Mackrell relied for the safety arrangements at Hillsborough on South Yorkshire police and an \u201ceminent\u201d structural engineer, Dr Wilfred Eastwood, but their methods were seriously flawed. Beer suggested the \u201cinformal\u201d approach of the former police match commander, Ch Supt Brian Mole, might have made Hillsborough \u201ca disaster waiting to happen\u201d. He said that Eastwood, who died in September 2014 aged 91, might be charged with criminal offences had he still been alive.</p> <p>Mackrell, a trained accountant who joined Sheffield Wednesday as the club secretary in 1986 from Luton Town, took on the responsibilities of safety officer as part of his position, Beer said. The safety officer role was introduced that year as guidance in the Green Guide to safety at sports grounds following the fire at Bradford City\u2019s Valley Parade ground in 1985 in which 56 people were killed. Beer said no training courses were provided for the \u201cso-called\u201d safety officers, nor any guidance for the qualifications or experience they must have.</p> <p>Mackrell is charged with a criminal breach of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 due to his alleged failure to agree with police, as required by the Hillsborough safety certificate, the arrangements at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles for 24,500 Liverpool supporters to enter the ground.

      "bodyText": "The former Sheffield Wednesday safety officer accused of criminal offences in relation to the 1989 disaster at the club\u2019s Hillsborough ground, in which 96 people died, has denied he was negligent in the performance of his role. Graham Mackrell, 69, will argue that the standards expected of a football ground safety officer were much lower in 1989 to those that apply now, his barrister, Jason Beer QC, told the jury at Preston crown court. Beer said Mackrell relied for the safety arrangements at Hillsborough on South Yorkshire police and an \u201ceminent\u201d structural engineer, Dr Wilfred Eastwood, but their methods were seriously flawed. Beer suggested the \u201cinformal\u201d approach of the former police match commander, Ch Supt Brian Mole, might have made Hillsborough \u201ca disaster waiting to happen\u201d. He said that Eastwood, who died in September 2014 aged 91, might be charged with criminal offences had he still been alive. Mackrell, a trained accountant who joined Sheffield Wednesday as the club secretary in 1986 from Luton Town, took on the responsibilities of safety officer as part of his position, Beer said. The safety officer role was introduced that year as guidance in the Green Guide to safety at sports grounds following the fire at Bradford City\u2019s Valley Parade ground in 1985 in which 56 people were killed. Beer said no training courses were provided for the \u201cso-called\u201d safety officers, nor any guidance for the qualifications or experience they must have. Mackrell is charged with a criminal breach of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 due to his alleged failure to agree with police, as required by the Hillsborough safety certificate, the arrangements at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles for 24,500 Liverpool supporters to enter the ground. He is further accused of breaching his duties under the Health and Safety Act 1974 by failing to ensure the number of turnstiles was sufficient to avoid \u201cunduly large crowds\u201d building up waiting to get through, and by failing to draw up contingency plans if that did happen. \u201cMr Mackrell denies he failed to show care or was negligent,\u201d Beer told the jury. Mackrell is standing trial charged alongside the officer who replaced Mole as match commander for the 1989 semi-final, David Duckenfield, who is accused of gross negligence manslaughter. Duckenfield has pleaded not guilty and his barrister, Ben Myers QC, told the jury on Thursday that Duckenfield had been \u201cunfairly singled out\u201d for prosecution. Both defendants sat in the body of the court among the barristers and solicitors, rather than in the dock. Beer said that the engineer, Eastwood, employed by Sheffield Wednesday to work on the physical layout of Hillsborough, was dominant and \u201coverbearing\u201d. He, not Mackrell, was responsible for the calculation of the Leppings Lane terrace\u2019s capacity \u2013 10,200 \u2013 which was not reduced after its division into \u201cpens\u201d with a high metal fence in front, in which the lethal crush happened. An expert engineer, John Cutlack, has calculated that capacity to be substantially excessive. \u201cMr Eastwood is no longer with us,\u201d Beer told the jury, \u201cotherwise he might be standing here in this court.\u201d Responsibility for policing ultimately lay with Mole, an experienced match commander who was in charge of the semi-final at Hillsborough the year before, also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Mole was replaced by Duckenfield, who was promoted to chief superintendent 19 days before the 1989 semi-final.

Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry issued a blistering attack on Maduro, who began his second six-year term as president on 10 January despite a storm of criticism at home and abroad. Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry claimed Maduro \u2013 who took power after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death in 2013 and has led his country into economic ruin \u2013 headed an \u201corganized crime apparatus\u201d built on \u201cwidespread corruption, narco-trafficking, the trafficking of people, the laundering of money and terrorism\u201d. Bolsonaro\u2019s son and close confidant Eduardo Bolsonaro tweeted: \u201cMaduro\u2019s narco-dictatorship is a cancer that needs to be excised.\u201d Eduardo Bolsonaro is a longstanding critic of Maduro and has close relations with rightwing Venezuelan dissidents who seek Maduro\u2019s military overthrow. The condemnation came as Venezuela\u2019s opposition \u2013 suddenly reinvigorated by the ratcheting up of regional pressure by countries such as Brazil and the emergence of a potential new figurehead \u2013 prepared to hold a day of demonstrations next Tuesday. Long moribund, Maduro\u2019s opponents have found a new voice since Juan Guaid\u00f3, the young head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-run national assembly, declared himself ready to assume the presidency as a result of Maduro\u2019s illegitimate rule and received backing from rightwing governments in Brazil, Colombia and the United States. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s profile grew further last Sunday when he was briefly detained by members of Venezuela\u2019s security services \u2013 a headline-grabbing incident he claimed highlighted growing desperation within Maduro\u2019s inner circle.

In the absence of a legitimately elected president, Guaid\u00f3 argued, it was his constitutional duty to occupy the position on an interim basis until free and fair elections could be held.

So, when I listen to these people, I feel it might make more of a difference to say that not only am I on their side, but I am also by their side.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cI\u2019ve spent years pretending my assault didn\u2019t happen, boxing it off in my brain. Locking it up, full on blaming myself. No longer. I want to help those who have experienced what I went through.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year Mulligan faced an inquiry into her conduct after allegations of bullying behaviour were made against her by a former member of staff. The allegations, which were were upheld by the North Yorkshire police and crime panel, were made public last year.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI know I am far from perfect, indeed I am my own harshest critic.

      "bodyText": "A police and crime commissioner has revealed that she was raped as a teenager, saying she wanted to encourage other victims to speak out. Julia Mulligan, who has overseen policing in North Yorkshire since 2012, told the Yorkshire Post she was raped when she was 15 and had kept it secret for 36 years. The 51-year-old said she wanted to let other victims know she was \u201cby their side\u201d. Mulligan, who grew up in a North Yorkshire village, said she did not report the incident to police as she partly blamed herself for the ordeal and was only able to tell her family and closest friends about it late last year. Mulligan, who took over the governance of North Yorkshire\u2019s fire and rescue service as well as its police force last year, said her job had brought her into contact with many vulnerable women. She wrote: \u201cI have spent time with children who have been exploited, and I know in different circumstances, that could have been me. \u201cLike many others, my past is material to who I am today, and what I do today. So, when I listen to these people, I feel it might make more of a difference to say that not only am I on their side, but I am also by their side.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019ve spent years pretending my assault didn\u2019t happen, boxing it off in my brain. Locking it up, full on blaming myself. No longer. I want to help those who have experienced what I went through.\u201d Earlier this year Mulligan faced an inquiry into her conduct after allegations of bullying behaviour were made against her by a former member of staff. The allegations, which were were upheld by the North Yorkshire police and crime panel, were made public last year. She said: \u201cI know I am far from perfect, indeed I am my own harshest critic. After all, I have spent 36 years beating myself up for a situation that I still think today was partly of my own making. \u201cI hate to ever think I had either intentionally or unintentionally made someone upset or feel unvalued, and for that I am deeply sorry. \u201cBut those characterisations hurt. I can\u2019t hide that \u2013 and they brought everything back I\u2019ve hidden away for so long.\u201d Since the inquiry, fresh allegations have emerged that she instructed an employee to help distance her from a convicted kidnapping gang leader. Mulligan, who has twice been elected to the role, is now being investigated over her friendship with businessman Mujeeb ur Rehman Bhutto. The Conservative commissioner has denied claims that she asked a staff member to delete all references on her personal Facebook page to Bhutto. Bhutto was an activist for Mulligan as as she stood as Conservative candidate for Leeds North West in the 2010 general election. In 2005 he was sentenced to seven years in prison after he admitted being behind a high-profile kidnapping in Karachi, Pakistan. He later became a member of the Conservative party and then a spokesman for Ukip.",

      "body": "<p>West Ham\u2019s resolve to keep Marko Arnautovic has been tested by a \u20ac40m (\u00a335.2m) offer from Guangzhou Evergrande.</p> <p>The Premier League club are furious with Arnautovic over behaviour that has led to the striker being dropped for the game at Bournemouth and apologising to his teammates, but are likely to hold out for a third bid from the Chinese Super League side, who had previously offered \u20ac35m.</p> <p>West Ham will also not sell Arnautovic unless they get the green light from Manuel Pellegrini and find a replacement. The manager is deciding whether he would like the Austrian to go after omitting him for Saturday\u2019s match because he felt the player was not in the right frame of mind having been denied a move.</p> <p>With Genoa\u2019s Krzysztof Piatek set to join Milan once Gonzalo Higua\u00edn completes his loan to Chelsea and Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson likely to prove out of reach, West Ham are expected to step up their interest in Celta Vigo\u2019s Maxi G\u00f3mez. The 22-year-old Uruguayan has a \u00a345m release clause and is regarded as one of the brightest young forwards in Spain. However Celta are reluctant to lose G\u00f3mez as they battle against relegation from La Liga.</p> <p>Arnautovic said sorry to the rest of West Ham\u2019s squad after training on Friday for pushing for a move. Pellegrini concluded that Arnautovic\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/10/marko-arnautovic-west-ham-china-asks-to-leave\" title=\"\">desperation to accept a lucrative offer</a> from Guangzhou had affected his focus. The club remain unhappy with the disruption before an important Premier League game and one source rated Arnautovic\u2019s chances of staying at 50-50.</p> <p>The player\u2019s conduct has not extended to going on strike nor resulted in him being ostracised by his teammates, even though they will be without him against Eddie Howe\u2019s side. They understand his reasons for wanting to leave and appreciated him apologising about the circumstances that have led to his absence against Bournemouth. They will not protest if the 29-year-old stays at West Ham.</p> <p>Arnautovic has not hidden his desire to move to China and has grown increasingly unhappy with his club\u2019s stance.

      "bodyText": "West Ham\u2019s resolve to keep Marko Arnautovic has been tested by a \u20ac40m (\u00a335.2m) offer from Guangzhou Evergrande. The Premier League club are furious with Arnautovic over behaviour that has led to the striker being dropped for the game at Bournemouth and apologising to his teammates, but are likely to hold out for a third bid from the Chinese Super League side, who had previously offered \u20ac35m. West Ham will also not sell Arnautovic unless they get the green light from Manuel Pellegrini and find a replacement. The manager is deciding whether he would like the Austrian to go after omitting him for Saturday\u2019s match because he felt the player was not in the right frame of mind having been denied a move. With Genoa\u2019s Krzysztof Piatek set to join Milan once Gonzalo Higua\u00edn completes his loan to Chelsea and Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson likely to prove out of reach, West Ham are expected to step up their interest in Celta Vigo\u2019s Maxi G\u00f3mez. The 22-year-old Uruguayan has a \u00a345m release clause and is regarded as one of the brightest young forwards in Spain. However Celta are reluctant to lose G\u00f3mez as they battle against relegation from La Liga. Arnautovic said sorry to the rest of West Ham\u2019s squad after training on Friday for pushing for a move. Pellegrini concluded that Arnautovic\u2019s desperation to accept a lucrative offer from Guangzhou had affected his focus. The club remain unhappy with the disruption before an important Premier League game and one source rated Arnautovic\u2019s chances of staying at 50-50. The player\u2019s conduct has not extended to going on strike nor resulted in him being ostracised by his teammates, even though they will be without him against Eddie Howe\u2019s side. They understand his reasons for wanting to leave and appreciated him apologising about the circumstances that have led to his absence against Bournemouth. They will not protest if the 29-year-old stays at West Ham. Arnautovic has not hidden his desire to move to China and has grown increasingly unhappy with his club\u2019s stance. It has been reported that Shanghai SIPG, the CSL champions, lodged the original \u20ac35m bid. They have shown an interest in Arnautovic yet the Guardian has been told by sources on both sides of the deal that Guangzhou were the real bidders and were Arnautovic\u2019s preferred destination. The deal would have meant the former Stoke striker standing to earn \u00a340m over a four-year contract, a large upgrade on his West Ham wage of \u00a390,000 a week. West Ham felt that Guangzhou\u2019s offer was far too low given that Stoke have a sell-on clause that would entitle them to 20% of any fee over \u00a320m. Arnautovic\u2019s mood has not improved since he appeared to wave goodbye to the crowd after being substituted during last week\u2019s home win over Arsenal and, although he has trained this week, Pellegrini does not want any distractions against Bournemouth. Andy Carroll, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Lucas P\u00e9rez are in contention to replace Arnautovic. Another option available to Pellegrini is to push Michail Antonio into a forward role.",

South Yorkshire police said they were called to Plantation Road at about 8.45pm where the victim was found with gunshot wounds. He was treated by paramedics at the scene and then taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead, the force said. No one else was injured in the attack and no suspects have been arrested. Doncaster Plant Works amateur boxing club, where Bell trained, said: \u201cWe are absolutely devastated to announce the passing of a great warrior who has spent a huge amount of time over the years boxing with our club. We are shocked beyond words to hear this sad news and would like to offer our sincere condolences to Tom\u2019s family and closest friends.\u201d Bell had won all six of his professional fights and had spoken of following in the footsteps of his elder brother, Andy Bell, a former holder of the English and British super flyweight titles. Head coach Paul Harrison said Bell had boxed at the gym before turning professional aged 18. \u201c[Tom] brought his happy, fearless nature into everything he did,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cTom was an outstanding boxer, but also a considerate human being, who continued to visit the gym, inspiring and encouraging other young people, long after he went professional. \u201cWe\u2019re shocked beyond words at the needless loss of Tom\u2019s life and ask that the community pull together to seek the justice Tom rightly deserves. Our gym will be a little emptier without him.\u201d Bell\u2019s coach, James Harrington, tweeted a video of the boxer training and wrote: \u201cRIP Tom. You and people in boxing knew I loved you like a son, I will never forget you and our memories.\u201d Liam Hoden, the deputy head of sport at the Sheffield Star newspaper, wrote that Doncaster had lost \u201cone of its most promising young fighters\u201d. He said: \u201cHe would likely have been back in the ring as early as March, beginning a concerted effort to rise through the domestic ranks. \u201cDue to tragic, unthinkable circumstances, we will never know how far Bell\u2019s talents could have taken him. His boxing family are devastated.\u201d",

Not among the MPs, who all seem fairly sure of their decision by this point, but at the art stall Elaine Robinson has set up in the Commons\u2019 upper waiting room. She\u2019s embarking on an ambitious project \u2013 to collect the fingerprints of MPs, Lords and other Westminster workers and create an artistic statement of unity during this especially fractious week \u2013 but there\u2019s a problem. Upstairs, away from the main action, she\u2019s at the mercy of whichever MPs happen to be wandering past, and most of them seem to be rather busy at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5bf7ac74f6ea12303c518f490ccf85af61eb23d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5bf7ac74f6ea12303c518f490ccf85af61eb23d/65_224_790_987/400.jpg\" alt=\"Leaves his mark \u2026 Boris Johnson.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leaves his mark \u2026 Boris Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got a meeting,\u201d mutters John Redwood when she accosts the rather irritated looking MP for Wokingham.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back,\u201d says Robinson.</p> <p>Really? Did he say that?</p> <p>\u201cWell, not really, no \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Bob Seely, MP for the Isle of Wight, rushes past, Robinson swiftly waved away. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy right now,\u201d says his adviser. \u201cWould you like to add your fingerprint instead?\u201d pleads Robinson. \u201cEr \u2026 no.\u201d</p> <p>While we wait hopefully for passing MPs, Robinson tells me about the project. She\u2019s spent the last few years visiting various cities \u2013 Newcastle, Cambridge, Liverpool \u2013 and asking residents to place their fingerprints within cell-like circles she\u2019s drawn on a canvas. The plan is to eventually make a cast of each circle in resin and display them together, somehow, thereby providing a snapshot of the country during the Brexit era. \u201cAll walks of life are in there, it\u2019s a real social document,\u201d says Robinson.</p> <p>In football-obsessed Liverpool, residents demanded she provide both red and blue ink, so strong is the rivalry between the city\u2019s two teams. In the more deprived areas of Newcastle, people seemed genuinely surprised that anyone would be bringing art out on the streets to engage with them. But her Sheffield experience scarred her \u2013 it was a month after the country voted to leave the EU and there was a lot of anger on the street. One man shouted that he didn\u2019t want his fingerprint next to an immigrant. \u201cIt was a raw comment,\u201d she notes. \u201cI just hope the division hasn\u2019t got worse.\u201d She didn\u2019t return to the project for a while after that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b8477bd98f9f4bfea46ea65146ba6331a71f3aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8477bd98f9f4bfea46ea65146ba6331a71f3aa3/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Tebbit.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Tebbit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now she\u2019s here, embedded in the heart of the establishment. There\u2019s something charmingly naive about the whole project \u2013 a Bristol-based artist who more regularly creates colourful, new-age paintings of birds and dolphins, mixing with the big beasts of politics. She stayed up until 4am emailing every single MP about the project, and seems genuinely disappointed that no party leaders got back to her. \u201cI want Theresa May\u2019s fingerprint,\u201d she says, undaunted by the fact that currently she has no MPs\u2019 fingerprints at all. </p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith comes into sight, and Robinson makes a beeline for him. He has also got an appointment but says he\u2019ll visit later. Robinson makes him shake on it, and seems rather trusting that a UK politician might keep their word: \u201cIf he says he\u2019ll come then he will come, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"24fd7ec15cac5860537db76841cd5de612f0da53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24fd7ec15cac5860537db76841cd5de612f0da53/0_269_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s genius!\u2019 \u2026 Martin Whitfield.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s genius!\u2019 \u2026 Martin Whitfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually her own MP, Bristol West\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire, shows up with two of her fellow Labour MPs, Madeleine Moon and Barbara Keeley, to lay the first fingerprints. \u201cElaine came to me to describe the project at a time when the country was very divided \u2013 and it still is,\u201d says Debbonaire, who helped Robinson gain access to Westminster. \u201cI liked the idea that we are being asked to think about who we are and how we identify at a time when that is so hotly contested<strong>.</strong>\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"495b868c6c3169f1c758f836ef426f0d67f0f182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495b868c6c3169f1c758f836ef426f0d67f0f182/0_0_480_600/400.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Robinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martin Whitfield MP comes next.

From here things take off. Robinson chases Lord [John] Prescott down a corridor, telling him he \u201chas to do it\u201d.

Her charm certainly seems to be having an effect. Iain Duncan Smith does indeed return: \u201cI said I was a man of my word,\u201d he declares, before laying down a print.</p> <p>The artwork evolves. A cute kid called Dylan, in Westminster because his parents are taking part in a nationwide pubs event, is invited to lay a whole handprint (\u201cI let him because he represents the future,\u201d says Robinson, who seems relaxed about the project taking on a direction of its own.) Later, while she\u2019s temporarily away from the stall, someone stamps one of the small ink blocks on the artwork. I see it as an act of vandalism (and suspect Redwood) but Robinson sees the mark as representing the vote itself.</p> <p>When it\u2019s all completed \u2013 Robinson can\u2019t say when that might be \u2013 she plans to tour the country with it on the back of a truck, ideally with some funding. I leave Robinson with a huge collection of fingerprints, and she keeps me posted through the week as new ones come in: Boris Johnson, Caroline Flint, David Davis, Jo Swinson, Melvyn Bragg, Lord Tebbit. She also gets an invitation to stay for a second week, which will surely delight John Redwood. As for whether she will end up getting the prime minister\u2019s fingerprint, I wouldn\u2019t bet against it. Unlike some in Westminster, she seems to know how to get things done.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Westminster, the day before Theresa May\u2019s supposedly meaningful vote, and the atmosphere is tense. Not among the MPs, who all seem fairly sure of their decision by this point, but at the art stall Elaine Robinson has set up in the Commons\u2019 upper waiting room. She\u2019s embarking on an ambitious project \u2013 to collect the fingerprints of MPs, Lords and other Westminster workers and create an artistic statement of unity during this especially fractious week \u2013 but there\u2019s a problem. Upstairs, away from the main action, she\u2019s at the mercy of whichever MPs happen to be wandering past, and most of them seem to be rather busy at the moment. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got a meeting,\u201d mutters John Redwood when she accosts the rather irritated looking MP for Wokingham. \u201cHe\u2019ll come back,\u201d says Robinson. Really? Did he say that? \u201cWell, not really, no \u2026 \u201d Bob Seely, MP for the Isle of Wight, rushes past, Robinson swiftly waved away. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy right now,\u201d says his adviser. \u201cWould you like to add your fingerprint instead?\u201d pleads Robinson. \u201cEr \u2026 no.\u201d While we wait hopefully for passing MPs, Robinson tells me about the project. She\u2019s spent the last few years visiting various cities \u2013 Newcastle, Cambridge, Liverpool \u2013 and asking residents to place their fingerprints within cell-like circles she\u2019s drawn on a canvas. The plan is to eventually make a cast of each circle in resin and display them together, somehow, thereby providing a snapshot of the country during the Brexit era. \u201cAll walks of life are in there, it\u2019s a real social document,\u201d says Robinson. In football-obsessed Liverpool, residents demanded she provide both red and blue ink, so strong is the rivalry between the city\u2019s two teams. In the more deprived areas of Newcastle, people seemed genuinely surprised that anyone would be bringing art out on the streets to engage with them. But her Sheffield experience scarred her \u2013 it was a month after the country voted to leave the EU and there was a lot of anger on the street. One man shouted that he didn\u2019t want his fingerprint next to an immigrant. \u201cIt was a raw comment,\u201d she notes. \u201cI just hope the division hasn\u2019t got worse.\u201d She didn\u2019t return to the project for a while after that. But now she\u2019s here, embedded in the heart of the establishment. There\u2019s something charmingly naive about the whole project \u2013 a Bristol-based artist who more regularly creates colourful, new-age paintings of birds and dolphins, mixing with the big beasts of politics. She stayed up until 4am emailing every single MP about the project, and seems genuinely disappointed that no party leaders got back to her. \u201cI want Theresa May\u2019s fingerprint,\u201d she says, undaunted by the fact that currently she has no MPs\u2019 fingerprints at all. Iain Duncan Smith comes into sight, and Robinson makes a beeline for him. He has also got an appointment but says he\u2019ll visit later. Robinson makes him shake on it, and seems rather trusting that a UK politician might keep their word: \u201cIf he says he\u2019ll come then he will come, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Eventually her own MP, Bristol West\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire, shows up with two of her fellow Labour MPs, Madeleine Moon and Barbara Keeley, to lay the first fingerprints. \u201cElaine came to me to describe the project at a time when the country was very divided \u2013 and it still is,\u201d says Debbonaire, who helped Robinson gain access to Westminster. \u201cI liked the idea that we are being asked to think about who we are and how we identify at a time when that is so hotly contested.\u201d Martin Whitfield MP comes next. He promises to tell everyone about it: \u201cIt\u2019s genius! It\u2019s genius!\u201d he keeps saying. But with Redwood refusing Robinson\u2019s invitation for a second time, and no other Tories forthcoming, the unity aspect is looking precarious. Enter Dominic Raab who, after establishing that it\u2019s neither a pro- nor an anti-Brexit statement, gets into the spirit of things by placing a red fingerprint, to symbolise stepping across the political divide. From here things take off. Robinson chases Lord [John] Prescott down a corridor, telling him he \u201chas to do it\u201d. She then leaps on Jess Phillips, of whom she became an admirer after once seeing her speak on domestic violence issues. Phillips puts down a purple print in honour of the suffragettes. The next evening is voting day on May\u2019s Brexit deal so I head back to Westminster, slightly amazed that Robinson has been allowed to run amok around parliament on this highly significant week. Her charm certainly seems to be having an effect. Iain Duncan Smith does indeed return: \u201cI said I was a man of my word,\u201d he declares, before laying down a print. The artwork evolves. A cute kid called Dylan, in Westminster because his parents are taking part in a nationwide pubs event, is invited to lay a whole handprint (\u201cI let him because he represents the future,\u201d says Robinson, who seems relaxed about the project taking on a direction of its own.) Later, while she\u2019s temporarily away from the stall, someone stamps one of the small ink blocks on the artwork. I see it as an act of vandalism (and suspect Redwood) but Robinson sees the mark as representing the vote itself. When it\u2019s all completed \u2013 Robinson can\u2019t say when that might be \u2013 she plans to tour the country with it on the back of a truck, ideally with some funding. I leave Robinson with a huge collection of fingerprints, and she keeps me posted through the week as new ones come in: Boris Johnson, Caroline Flint, David Davis, Jo Swinson, Melvyn Bragg, Lord Tebbit. She also gets an invitation to stay for a second week, which will surely delight John Redwood. As for whether she will end up getting the prime minister\u2019s fingerprint, I wouldn\u2019t bet against it. Unlike some in Westminster, she seems to know how to get things done.",

The runner-up drawing specialist, with 20 in a row, is Anish Giri, the pacific world No 5, whose tweets are often jibes at the champion. Worse, 21 is one more than Bobby Fischer\u2019s famous 20-game series in 1970-71 which brought the US legend to the verge of the world crown. It is just that Fischer\u2019s was a winning sequence. Carlsen has stated in the past that he thinks he could have defeated Fischer and that it would be even between him and Garry Kasparov at his peak. What happened this week is sure to come up in the future whenever chess fans argue over who was the greatest.</p> \n<p>Other ironies are positive for Carlsen. He dropped rating points with all those draws, yet is still five classical rating points clear of Caruana, who has also found winning difficult. And while the champion has been held at classical, he has crushed all opposition at speed, beating Caruana 3-0 in their rapid tie-break, almost winning the world rapid despite a terrible start, and capturing the world blitz unbeaten in 21 games.</p> \n<p>Finally, Carlsen is far from out of it at Wijk.

      "bodyText": "It will be a sore statistic with Magnus Carlsen for years to come. The world champion has just emerged from a run of 21 consecutive draws which threatened to derail his achievement of staying No 1 in the global rankings since July 2011. Carlsen halved his final five rounds at the European Club Cup in October, famously drew all 12 classical games in his world title match with Fabiano Caruana in November, then this week halved his first four rounds at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, where the international tournament continues this weekend and can be viewed online, with grandmaster and computer commentaries, from 12.30pm daily. There are ironies associated with this unwelcome record for top chess. The runner-up drawing specialist, with 20 in a row, is Anish Giri, the pacific world No 5, whose tweets are often jibes at the champion. Worse, 21 is one more than Bobby Fischer\u2019s famous 20-game series in 1970-71 which brought the US legend to the verge of the world crown. It is just that Fischer\u2019s was a winning sequence. Carlsen has stated in the past that he thinks he could have defeated Fischer and that it would be even between him and Garry Kasparov at his peak. What happened this week is sure to come up in the future whenever chess fans argue over who was the greatest. Other ironies are positive for Carlsen. He dropped rating points with all those draws, yet is still five classical rating points clear of Caruana, who has also found winning difficult. And while the champion has been held at classical, he has crushed all opposition at speed, beating Caruana 3-0 in their rapid tie-break, almost winning the world rapid despite a terrible start, and capturing the world blitz unbeaten in 21 games. Finally, Carlsen is far from out of it at Wijk. He won in round six and shares the lead on 4/6 with Giri (Netherlands) and Ding Liren (China). The other significant move in the early rounds was the fine form of Ding, now fully recovered from the broken hip he suffered in a cycling accident during the Stavanger tournament last summer. China\u2019s No 1 is aiming to qualify for the next world title candidates in 2020 via the rating list, and moved up to No 3 this week behind Carlsen and Caruana. The UK 4NCL league favourites Guildford and Manx Liberty kept their 100% match records at Daventry last Sunday, and after four wins each are heading for their showdown at the final league weekend in early May. The all-conquering Surrey team is now on a record unbeaten run of 68 wins and two draws stretching over more than six years. This season Guildford have scored 7.5-0.5 or 7-1 margins except for 5-3 against their old rivals Wood Green. As a further statement of intent, Guildford fielded the England No 1, Michael Adams, playing his first 4NCL game since May 2014. Manx, sponsored by the chess.com website, had to work hard, with only 5-3 against Guildford\u2019s B team and just 4.5-3.5 against 3Cs Oldham despite a rating edge of 150 points a board. Manx have yet to meet Cheddleton, who have won all four matches. 3602 1\u2026Ne2! 2 Kb4 Nd4 3 Kc5 Nxf5 4 Kb6 Nd6 5 Kc5 (if 5 Kc7 b5 and queens) Nc8! and the black king eats White\u2019s last pawn then strolls to the queen\u2019s side to mop up.",

      "body": "<p>So how is it going for those of you who are doing dry January? Struggling? Getting bored with soft drinks? Although I\u2019m not doing it myself (let\u2019s face it, it would be hard, considering the day job), I thought a few suggestions might help you through the next 13 days.</p> <p>The good news is that it\u2019s never been as easy to go booze-free, with supermarket shelves rapidly filling up with alternatives to the classic alcoholic drinks. According to sector pioneer Ben Branson of the non-alcoholic \u201cspirit\u201d <a href=\"https://seedlipdrinks.com/shop?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi8qxq8rR3wIVSLTtCh0kAwtwEAAYAiAAEgIIAfD_BwE\" title=\"\">Seedlip</a>, there have been more than 30 launches in the past six months alone. And Seedlip\u2019s launching a new sister brand, an aperitif called <a href=\"https://www.aecornaperitifs.com/\" title=\"\">Aecorn</a>, in the next few weeks.</p> <p>There\u2019s certainly a market for the stuff. Dry January aside, <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/uk/en/insights/news/2018/rise-of-no-and-low-alcohol.html\" title=\"\">a quarter of adults say they\u2019re looking to reduce their alcohol consumption</a>, according to market research company Nielsen, with almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/10/young-people-drinking-alcohol-study-england\" title=\"\">a third of 16- to 24-year-olds not drinking at all</a>, statistics that mirror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/01/third-of-britons-have-stopped-or-reduced-meat-eating-vegan-vegetarian-report\" title=\"\">a similar desire to eat less or no meat</a>. This has resulted in a rash of booze-free bars, such as <a href=\"https://www.redemptionbar.co.uk\" title=\"\">Redemption in London</a>, which has just opened its third branch, <a href=\"http://thebrinkliverpool.com\" title=\"\">the Brink in Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.doubleimpact.org.uk/cafe-sobar/\" title=\"\">Cafe Sobar in Nottingham</a>.</p> <p>Ironically, the gin craze has also encouraged a corresponding boom in tonics, which are often more enjoyable to drink on their own than to match to the spirit you happen to have in the house. I particularly like <a href=\"https://www.drinklongtail.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Long Tail range of mixers</a>, which, unusually, is designed to go with dark rather than white spirits. Try <strong>Island Spice</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Long-Tail-Island-Spice-Mixer/dp/B07KP5Z1YT\" title=\"\">\u00a318 for 12 200ml bottles on Amazon</a>), a refreshing blend of chinotto (an orange-type citrus fruit), gentian and spices, which also goes well with rum when/if you come off the wagon.</p> <p>The downside is that a lot of these products seem unnecessarily expensive, given that they don\u2019t attract the same tax as spirits, though Branson points out that there are <a href=\"https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2018/11/is-greater-transparency-needed-in-non-alcoholic-spirits/\" title=\"\">36 distillations involved in making Seedlip</a>.</p> <p>Even less understandable is the amount currently being charged for various \u201cplant waters\u201d for which unproven health benefits are claimed.

      "bodyText": "So how is it going for those of you who are doing dry January? Struggling? Getting bored with soft drinks? Although I\u2019m not doing it myself (let\u2019s face it, it would be hard, considering the day job), I thought a few suggestions might help you through the next 13 days. The good news is that it\u2019s never been as easy to go booze-free, with supermarket shelves rapidly filling up with alternatives to the classic alcoholic drinks. According to sector pioneer Ben Branson of the non-alcoholic \u201cspirit\u201d Seedlip, there have been more than 30 launches in the past six months alone. And Seedlip\u2019s launching a new sister brand, an aperitif called Aecorn, in the next few weeks. There\u2019s certainly a market for the stuff. Dry January aside, a quarter of adults say they\u2019re looking to reduce their alcohol consumption, according to market research company Nielsen, with almost a third of 16- to 24-year-olds not drinking at all, statistics that mirror a similar desire to eat less or no meat. This has resulted in a rash of booze-free bars, such as Redemption in London, which has just opened its third branch, the Brink in Liverpool and Cafe Sobar in Nottingham. Ironically, the gin craze has also encouraged a corresponding boom in tonics, which are often more enjoyable to drink on their own than to match to the spirit you happen to have in the house. I particularly like the Long Tail range of mixers, which, unusually, is designed to go with dark rather than white spirits. Try Island Spice (\u00a318 for 12 200ml bottles on Amazon), a refreshing blend of chinotto (an orange-type citrus fruit), gentian and spices, which also goes well with rum when/if you come off the wagon. The downside is that a lot of these products seem unnecessarily expensive, given that they don\u2019t attract the same tax as spirits, though Branson points out that there are 36 distillations involved in making Seedlip. Even less understandable is the amount currently being charged for various \u201cplant waters\u201d for which unproven health benefits are claimed. For instance, the \u00a33.28 you have to pay for 250ml of TreeVitalise Birch Water or the new Twinings Cold Infuse range \u201cto liven up your water in a hassle-free way\u201d (12 \u201cinfusers\u201d cost \u00a33.98 in my local Tesco, compared with \u00a31.70 for 20 fruit-flavoured teabags). Clearly drinks companies realise they\u2019re on to a good thing. Four drinks to cheer up your dry January Sheppy\u2019s Low-Alcohol Classic Cider \u00a31, 50cl bottle, Tesco, \u00a312.99 for six bottles, drydrinker.com, 0.5%. Beer makes most of the running in the alcohol-free category, but this low-alcohol cider, from a reliable Somerset producer, has a proper cider apple flavour. Cale\u00f1o \u00a324.99, 70cl, calenodrinks.com, 0%. New alcohol-free spirit based on juniper and inca berries is my favourite to date, with an almost tropical fruit flavour. Good with regular Indian tonic water. Lucky Saint \u00a31.99, 33cl bottle, lightdrinks.co.uk, six bottles for \u00a311.49 drydrinker.com, 0.5%. Really decent, rich, hoppy lager that doesn\u2019t miss the alcohol. Wolfe\u2019s Pineapple Chilli and Lime Leaf Shrub \u00a37.50, 25cl bottle, bigbarn.co.uk, 0%. Good, fresh flavour with a mild chilli hit. Dilute with sparkling water. Would be great with Caribbean food. \u2022 More at matchingfoodandwine.com",

It looked wet and grey and I also over-peppered it and got the shits. Nicola: We tried to make creme caramel and screwed it up so badly it tasted like a cold, wet, sweet omelette. We tried four times before we packed it in. A huge waste of time and eggs.

The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny \u2026 Rosie: Madonna falling down the stairs at the Brits. The funniest word \u2026 Nicola: Sploich.

Tesla and Musk agreed to pay $20m each to the SEC and, under a settlement, the billionaire stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman but remained as chief executive. Grimes was in a relationship with Musk when he sent the tweet and had recently accompanied him on a trip to China. Banks claims she was staying at one of Musk\u2019s Los Angeles properties at the time he posted the tweet, allegedly waiting for Grimes to participate in a planned collaboration. Banks claimed that she saw Musk \u201cscrounging for investors\u201d. She also alleged that he was tweeting while on acid. Musk claimed he had never met Banks. The complaint says Banks \u201chas proven to be a key source of information\u201d in this matter. \u201cMs Boucher and Ms Banks were in close contact with Mr Musk before and after the tweet and are believed to be in possession of relevant evidence concerning Mr Musk\u2019s motives,\u201d Adam M Apton, the lawyer representing the investors, told Business Insider earlier this month. In late August, Banks apologised to Musk \u201cfor all of the painful events you\u2019ve endured over the past week, as I feel as though my actions have largely exacerbated them\u201d. However, in early January, Banks appeared to threaten Musk after the tech billionaire\u2019s lawyers maligned the rapper\u2019s credibility in a filing. \u201cThey are still slighting me like I don\u2019t have plenty more dirt to spill on Elon,\u201d Banks wrote in an Instagram post that she later deleted. \u201cThis is going to get extremely ugly \u2026 Elon will learn very soon who is more powerful of us two.\u201d",

I\u2019m seriously confused (Danni, US)</strong></p> <p>Brexit is the process of the UK leaving the EU, which it narrowly voted in favour of in a referendum in June 2016. The process is governed by article 50 of the EU\u2019s Treaty of Lisbon and is happening in two stages: first, the two sides negotiate their divorce deal (the \u201cwithdrawal agreement\u201d), and after this they will sort out their future trading relationship. It\u2019s proving problematic because the UK voted for a departure but not a destination: some think Britain should remain in a close relationship with the EU, with privileged access to its vast single market but having to obey its rules; others think its should strike out on its own, with greater control but less smooth trade. It\u2019s complicated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/prime-minister-vows-to-put-final-brexit-deal-before-parliament\">red lines set down by the prime minister</a>, Theresa May, (ending the automatic right of EU citizens to settle in the UK, and leaving the EU\u2019s single market and customs union) which exclude a lot of potential options.</p> <p><strong>Can you explain the Irish backstop? (Diane Dalton, US, with related questions from Ton Pasman and Leonie, Netherlands; Shona, Ireland;</strong><strong> Dietmar Homberg, </strong><strong>Germany; Elisabeth Sanfuchs, Belgium; Ayaz Ramji, Canada)</strong></p> <p>When the UK leaves the EU, the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland, which is currently invisible, will become the EU\u2019s only land border with the UK. Such a border normally requires customs and other controls. Nobody wants that, partly because nobody wants a return to the violence of the period before the Good Friday agreement, which removed border checks. In theory, the post-Brexit trading arrangements between the EU and the UK will avoid a \u201chard\u201d border, but they could take years to negotiate so the EU has insisted on a \u201cbackstop\u201d guaranteeing the absence of a hard border until those arrangements are in place. The backstop leaves the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU \u201cunless and until\u201d the EU agrees it can leave. Brexiters do not like this at all.</p> <p><strong>Why is the deadline 29 March 2019 and what\u2019s the problem with extending it? (Dawn, Canada; Jean Vigoureux, France)</strong></p> <p>Article 50 provides for two years of talks; the UK triggered it on 29 March 2017 so in principle it leaves automatically two years later. It can ask the EU27 for an extension, which they have said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/13/eu-preparing-to-delay-brexit-until-at-least-july\">they would grant for a valid reason</a>, such as sorting out the final details of a deal that has the support of a majority in the UK parliament. This now looks quite likely, but it may only last for a few months because a new European parliament is sworn in in July and EU rules require all member states to be represented \u2013 a problem if the UK is still a member. Experts think this could be resolved with a temporary fix, but the EU would rather avoid the hassle.</p> <p><strong>Can article 50 </strong><strong>be revoked and how would the EU respond? (Benjamin Willumsen, Chile)</strong></p> <p>The European court of justice has ruled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/10/uk-can-unilaterally-stop-brexit-process-eu-court-rules\">the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally</a> at any time without the permission of the EU27 (who would be delighted, if annoyed by all the UK has put them through). There\u2019s disagreement in the UK about whether it could be done by a simple vote by MPs or would need an act of parliament, but in any case it looks like the last thing the government would do.</p> <p><strong>Is there any chance of another </strong><strong>referendum? (Michael Kerr, California; Johannes Meigen, Germany; David French, New Zealand; Laurent, France)</strong></p> <p>There isn\u2019t a majority in parliament for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, or second referendum, which both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/16/brexit-pm-to-urge-parliament-not-to-break-faith-with-the-people\">the Tory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/jeremy-corbyn-offers-little-hope-for-peoples-vote-campaigners\">Labour leaderships</a> argue would undermine people\u2019s faith in democracy. That could change, but one of the problems is the time it could take to organise another vote: the government says it would take a year, which is an exaggeration, but it would almost certainly take longer than the UK has left, and possibly longer than the relatively short extension likely to be favoured by the EU.</p> <p><strong>What is Labour\u2019s position and why? Why does Jeremy Corbyn think he can negotiate a different or better deal with the EU than Theresa May? (Fernando Hervas, Belgium; Antje, Switzerland)</strong></p> <p>Labour\u2019s position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/corbyn-could-face-string-of-resignations-if-he-backs-peoples-vote\">is complicated</a> by the fact that under the UK\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system, many of its MPs represent constituencies that voted to leave while most of its members and voters are pro-remain. Corbyn himself is also far from being a convinced pro-European. The party has sat on the fence until now \u2013 favouring a general election before all other options \u2013 but will soon have to come off it. If the EU agrees to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement, Labour could get a better deal than May if it dropped (some of) her red lines, but it has been as guilty as the Conservatives of pretending that Britain can leave the EU while retaining all the advantages of membership.</p> <p><strong>Have any trade deals been approved with non-EU nations? What are World Trade Organization terms, and why are they a bad thing? (Patrick Speer, Scotland and Liam, Australia)</strong></p> <p>Britain is not formally allowed to negotiate new trade deals while still an EU member. It has signed off on a text said to replicate current trading arrangements with Switzerland. Other than that, hardly any of the 68 trade deals from which the UK benefits as an EU member, and which it said it would have replicated by the time of departure, are near, and none will be ready by 29 March, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c44581c2-1a75-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\">according to the FT</a>. Brexiters talk about \u201ctrading on WTO terms\u201d as if it is what the world does, but it does not: it may trade under WTO <em>rules</em>, but all 164 members of the WTO have also agreed bilateral or regional trade deals that allow them to trade on much better <em>terms</em> than the WTO baselines. No sensible nation would leave the world\u2019s largest single market, the EU, to trade with it on WTO terms, as would happen in the event of no deal.</p> <p><strong>What might happen in the the first weeks and months after a no-deal Brexit? I\u2019m travelling to Britain in April \u2013 will my trip be disrupted, might there be food shortages? (Mark Singer</strong><strong> and Gerry Patey, Canada; Francois Bry, Munich; Jean Ballanco, US)</strong></p> <p>As far as food shortages go, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Major British supermarket chains have started stockpiling tinned goods and MPs have said Britons may need to adopt a different diet, which does not sound promising, but it\u2019s hard to imagine it coming to that. No deal would certainly be likely to cause disruption at airports; the European commission last month unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/17/brussels-plans-for-status-quo-in-few-key-sectors-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit\">temporary nine-month plan</a> to keep planes in the air and goods and money flowing should the UK crash out, and Britain has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/18/brexit-cabinet-meets-to-discuss-ramping-up-plans-for-no-deal\">army standing by</a>, but an awful lot of things we take for granted could change very suddenly if Britain leaves without a deal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/dec/21/how-a-no-deal-brexit-will-affect-uk-travellers-flights-passports-currency\">British visitors</a> to Europe will need to apply for an online visa waiver, similar to the the US Esta programme, once it comes into operation in 2020; if the UK crashes out before then, they may \u2013 depending on how the UK decides to treat EU visitors \u2013 require a Schengen area visa.</p> <p><strong>Does the Queen have any powers to intervene? (Vincent, Netherlands; Isabel Pitta, Brazil)</strong></p> <p>The monarch is not meant to get involved in politics. But she is the only person who can invite someone to form a government, and if Theresa May loses another no-confidence vote, she might have to. She would have 14 days to ask someone to form a new administration (including a cross-party option) providing it was clear they could command a majority in parliament. If no majority exists, new elections would automatically follow. The Queen, however, cannot dissolve parliament, having lost this power in the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act.</p> <p><strong>Will my daughter, who is French, need to apply for a visa to study in the UK?

It has warned, however, that UK drivers living in the EU should exchange their licence for a local one \u2013 and if possible get an international driving permit \u2013 as soon as possible in case of a no-deal Brexit, which might invalidate their UK licence, or mean they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/14/britons-living-in-eu-new-driving-tests-no-deal-brexit\">have to take a new driving test</a>.</p> <p><strong>How do you get out of this mess?

      "bodyText": "A hospital in Dublin has refused an abortion to a woman with a fatal foetal abnormality, raising questions over Ireland\u2019s recent introduction of abortion services. The Coombe hospital, a leading maternity facility that has signed up to the service, reportedly declined to terminate the pregnancy because it did not \u201cfall neatly\u201d into a fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis. The woman said she planned to travel to England with her partner for an abortion next week, a journey made by generations of Irish women before her, but which was supposed to no longer be necessary. GPs and hospitals started offering abortion services on 1 January, six months after Ireland voted in a landslide to lift a constitutional ban. Two politicians revealed the case in the D\u00e1il, the lower house of the Irish parliament, on Thursday after being contacted by the woman. \u201cHer words to me were: \u2018This is not what I voted for. I have constitutional rights,\u2019\u201d Br\u00edd Smith, of the People Before Profit party, told the chamber. \u201cShe is finding it hard to sleep, knowing the condition her much-wanted child is in.

Under the new system GPs provide abortions to women up to nine weeks of pregnancy and hospitals perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks, after which abortions are allowed only in exceptional circumstances. Pro-choice activists have complained the legislation is too restrictive and vague and could make doctors unsure about whether or not to terminate pregnancies. In a statement the Coombe hospital said it did not comment on individual cases but that its board had no role in certifying abortions. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, said the law was clear and consistent with last year\u2019s referendum. \u201cSo hospitals in Ireland have an obligation to make decisions in a way that is consistent with that new legislation.\u201d",

Later, she politely turned away the inevitable questions about allegations by Lleyton Hewitt that Bernard Tomic had threatened him and his family for freezing him out of the Davis Cup team. Tomic denies the claim. Nick Kyrgios and others have been ducking for cover. It is all very unsavoury.</p> <p>\u201cI have no knowledge of what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a million stories going around grand slam time because there are so many players, there are so many matches, there are so many amazing stories. From my point of view, it\u2019s been a super positive week.\u201d</p> <p>Barty will have the country cheering her on against Sharapova, who went out in the third round to Angelique Kerber on her return here last year after her drugs suspension, but has looked back to near her best this week. The Russian, 30th in the world after a quiet 2018, had two easy wins then had to fight harder on Friday to overcome the defending champion, Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.</p> <p>After two hours and 20 minutes, Wozniacki gifted Sharapova match point with a double fault, but the Russian got anxious in a long rally and wasted the chance with a loose forehand.

      "bodyText": "Ashleigh Barty, who strips down many of her trophies and gives them to friends to recycle for juniors at a Brisbane club, writes the sort of story Australian tennis badly needs right now. While various stars of the men\u2019s game here, faded and flickering, former and current, embarrass themselves on an almost daily basis by bickering in public over private rows, the 22-year-old Queenslander with the open smile and rock-solid game has been quietly working her way to the fourth round of the Australian Open. She beat the exciting Greek prospect, Maria Sakkari, 7-5, 6-1 on Friday and plays the 2008 champion, Maria Sharapova, on Sunday. Later, she politely turned away the inevitable questions about allegations by Lleyton Hewitt that Bernard Tomic had threatened him and his family for freezing him out of the Davis Cup team. Tomic denies the claim. Nick Kyrgios and others have been ducking for cover. It is all very unsavoury. \u201cI have no knowledge of what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a million stories going around grand slam time because there are so many players, there are so many matches, there are so many amazing stories. From my point of view, it\u2019s been a super positive week.\u201d Barty will have the country cheering her on against Sharapova, who went out in the third round to Angelique Kerber on her return here last year after her drugs suspension, but has looked back to near her best this week. The Russian, 30th in the world after a quiet 2018, had two easy wins then had to fight harder on Friday to overcome the defending champion, Caroline Wozniacki 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. After two hours and 20 minutes, Wozniacki gifted Sharapova match point with a double fault, but the Russian got anxious in a long rally and wasted the chance with a loose forehand. She was not so profligate with the next opportunity and there was little the world No 3 could do about her withering, angled backhand. Wozniacki is the highest-ranked opponent Sharapova has beaten since her first-round victory over Simona Halep at the US Open in 2017, her first grand slam match since her ban. There has been a froideur between the two players since Wozniacki was highly critical of Sharapova\u2019s welcome by tournament organisers on her return to the tour, leading to the Russian\u2019s agent describing Wozniacki as \u201ca journeyman\u201d.

It glows with what he discovered there. Samson\u2019s rippling, ridged back is a homage to Michelangelo\u2019s male nudes. The dramatic lighting set against nocturnal darkness emulates Caravaggio, who died in 1610 as this painting was finished. Rubens was powerfully struck by Caravaggio\u2019s revolutionary art. He was instrumental in getting Caravaggio\u2019s Death of the Virgin to the collection of Charles I in England. Yet the yellow glow that illuminates Samson\u2019s mighty back is much more buttery than anything by Caravaggio. However much he imitates Italian art Rubens is always, deep down, a Flemish artist with a rollicking peasant appetite for fat flesh and buxom cuddles.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/peter-paul-rubens-samson-and-delilah\">National Gallery</a>, London.</p> <h2>Image of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c354e135d61f0602790594fc8ba5914c1e1c9c65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c354e135d61f0602790594fc8ba5914c1e1c9c65/0_53_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"kanye\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Roden Crater, Arizona, by James Turrell</strong><br>Rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/15/kanye-west-donates-10-million-for-james-turrell-art-installation\">Kanye West has donated $10m</a> to help complete James Turrell\u2019s vast Roden Crater installation.

Also showing Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory The intimate painter of French domesticity brings his eerie calm to Tate Modern. \u2022 Tate Modern, London, 23 January to 6 May. Richard Pousette-Dart It\u2019s well worth discovering the cosmic abstractions of this little-known American painter. \u2022 Pace Gallery, London, until 20 February. Fausto Melotti Stylish abstract sculpture inflected by a scientific sensibility. \u2022 Estorick Collection, London, until 7 April. Wildlife Photographer of the Year A jaguar killing a caiman and wasps rolling mud balls are among the moments of wonder in this epic view of life on Earth by professional and amateur photographers. \u2022 Natural History Museum, London, until 30 June. Masterpiece of the week Samson and Delilah, c.1609-10, by Peter Paul Rubens Rubens painted this sultry scene in his home town Antwerp soon after returning from a long stay in Italy. It glows with what he discovered there. Samson\u2019s rippling, ridged back is a homage to Michelangelo\u2019s male nudes. The dramatic lighting set against nocturnal darkness emulates Caravaggio, who died in 1610 as this painting was finished. Rubens was powerfully struck by Caravaggio\u2019s revolutionary art. He was instrumental in getting Caravaggio\u2019s Death of the Virgin to the collection of Charles I in England. Yet the yellow glow that illuminates Samson\u2019s mighty back is much more buttery than anything by Caravaggio. However much he imitates Italian art Rubens is always, deep down, a Flemish artist with a rollicking peasant appetite for fat flesh and buxom cuddles. \u2022 National Gallery, London. Image of the week Roden Crater, Arizona, by James Turrell Rapper Kanye West has donated $10m to help complete James Turrell\u2019s vast Roden Crater installation. The artist who specialises in exploring light and space has for decades been gradually transforming the extinct volcano into a huge observatory for exploring phenomena of the sky and cosmos.

Data from British Transport Police (BTP) showed 2,838 reported incidents took place between November 2017 and September 2018. Between November 2015 and October 2016, there were 1,980. King\u2019s Cross St Pancras, one of the capital\u2019s busiest stations, had the highest number of recorded offences. There were 1,339 incidents during the three-year period. The London assembly, which published the findings, noted almost 11 million passengers travelled on Transport for London (TfL) services every day, \u201cwith very few of them ever experiencing or witnessing crime\u201d. The data, released after a request from Greater London Authority Conservatives, covered the period up to September last year because figures for October were not available. Weapons offences have increased by 126% since 2015, from 42 to 95, while sexual attacks have risen from 925 to 1,047. The figures also showed a 25% increase in the number of criminal offences recorded on the tube network, from 10,450 in 2015-16 to 13,101 in 2017-18. The RMT union blamed government cuts to TfL\u2019s budget for the increase. \u201cWe now routinely have reports of stations being left unstaffed and the safety culture being ripped apart as London Underground is turned into a thugs\u2019 paradise,\u201d said Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary. \u201cThose cuts to staffing and budgets must be reversed and these appalling figures should serve as a wake-up call to those calling the shots.\u201d Between November 2017 and September 2018, Stratford was the scene of the highest number of violent crimes, followed by Oxford Circus. Robin Smith, an assistant chief constable at BTP, said: \u201cLondon has one of the busiest transport networks in the world and the chances of being a victim of crime remains incredibly low, with less than 10 crimes recorded for every million passenger journeys made. \u201cIn the past year, crime involving a weapon has increased. However, it is important to bear in mind that these figures also include the many knives seized in our targeted, intelligence-led operations against knife crime.\u201d TfL funds more than 2,500 Metropolitan police, BTP and City of London police officers to patrol the capital\u2019s transport network. Susan Hall, a Conservative London assembly member, called on the mayor, Sadiq Khan, to cut the millions of what she called \u201cCity Hall waste\u201d to provide more officers on London\u2019s streets.",

      "body": "<p>I first came out in my early 40s, following a destructive affair with a colleague. Coming out was not nearly as stressful as recovering from the affair, or the period surrounding it during which I questioned and eventually began to understand my sexuality. I had been married for 15 years to the father of my children, and the changes these realisations brought about were complicated and challenging to navigate.</p> <p>I had wondered about my sexuality after my second child was born (in my mid-30s) but due to the trauma of my brother\u2019s suicide at around that time all my emotional energy was taken up with surviving, alongside parenting small children and depression. By the time I fell for the woman at work I had lost any remaining affection for my husband, and the chaos of an affair was a distraction from my emotional emptiness.

      "bodyText": "I first came out in my early 40s, following a destructive affair with a colleague. Coming out was not nearly as stressful as recovering from the affair, or the period surrounding it during which I questioned and eventually began to understand my sexuality. I had been married for 15 years to the father of my children, and the changes these realisations brought about were complicated and challenging to navigate. I had wondered about my sexuality after my second child was born (in my mid-30s) but due to the trauma of my brother\u2019s suicide at around that time all my emotional energy was taken up with surviving, alongside parenting small children and depression. By the time I fell for the woman at work I had lost any remaining affection for my husband, and the chaos of an affair was a distraction from my emotional emptiness. I remember thinking, \u201cFuck it \u2013 I\u2019ve got nothing left to lose,\u201d and throwing myself headlong into the affair, ending my relationship with my husband within about a fortnight.

On the flipside, the most demure version comes thanks to the delicate whisper of a skirt that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/03/liz-phair-trump-change-her-music-exile-in-guyville-25-years\">Liz Phair</a> has draped over her thigh as she assumes the position on the cover of her self-titled 2003 album. For a classical twist, why not check out a beaming Grace Chatto of Clean Bandit stranded in a car park with only a violin bra for warmth <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd0cT7Dnpt8\">in the 2013 video for Mozart\u2019s House</a>? A scene so scandalous, it led to her being fired from her job as a school cello teacher. Thankfully, the band have since made a shit ton of cash, so she can afford all the IRL clothes she needs in case she\u2019s ever stuck in Peckham Levels without her undies again.</p> <p>So what does this particular pose mean? A number of things, actually, none of them particularly heartening. It means you are allowed to love your body (that\u2019s if you\u2019re a slim, conventionally attractive blond white woman). It means women are allowed to play musical instruments, but only if they\u2019re also willing to use them as a saucy prop, just in case you\u2019d forgotten for a few seconds that they\u2019ve got tits. It means that women should be naked before they\u2019re comfortable and vulnerable before they\u2019re powerful. All of which means that the patriarchy is still winning. Goddamn those guys.</p>",

On the flipside, the most demure version comes thanks to the delicate whisper of a skirt that Liz Phair has draped over her thigh as she assumes the position on the cover of her self-titled 2003 album. For a classical twist, why not check out a beaming Grace Chatto of Clean Bandit stranded in a car park with only a violin bra for warmth in the 2013 video for Mozart\u2019s House? A scene so scandalous, it led to her being fired from her job as a school cello teacher. Thankfully, the band have since made a shit ton of cash, so she can afford all the IRL clothes she needs in case she\u2019s ever stuck in Peckham Levels without her undies again. So what does this particular pose mean? A number of things, actually, none of them particularly heartening. It means you are allowed to love your body (that\u2019s if you\u2019re a slim, conventionally attractive blond white woman). It means women are allowed to play musical instruments, but only if they\u2019re also willing to use them as a saucy prop, just in case you\u2019d forgotten for a few seconds that they\u2019ve got tits. It means that women should be naked before they\u2019re comfortable and vulnerable before they\u2019re powerful. All of which means that the patriarchy is still winning. Goddamn those guys.",

It also presaged the coming of the powerful #MeToo movement which would reshape the culture around the treatment of women at work.</p> <p>This year, however, the showing is expected to be fractured.</p> <p>Following a protracted fight over the organization\u2019s leadership, Vanessa Wruble, a Brooklyn-based activist who was pushed out of the organization in 2017, went on to help found another organization called March On, which emphasizes supporting local activists and denouncing antisemitism.</p> <p>The result is that there will be two major women\u2019s marches taking place on the streets of New York and many other cities around the country on Saturday \u2013 the original one, which emphasizes leadership by women of color, and another \u2013 March On \u2013 formed in opposition to antisemitism.</p> <p>\u201cFounded by the leaders of many of the marches across the country, March On is women-led, but open to all, and will employ a sophisticated political strategy to coordinate concrete actions at the federal, state, and local level through the joint efforts of millions of marchers,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wearemarchon.org/about/\">the March On website states</a>.</p> <p>Lee Weal, an activist based in New York City, told the Guardian that while she went to the second Women\u2019s March and had been planning to go to the third this year, the group\u2019s ties to Farrakhan put her off.</p> <p>\u201cIf we insist that Trump disavow people like David Duke, you can\u2019t have a different rule for those on the left,\u201d she said, adding she thought leaders were \u201churting the movement\u201d by aligning with him.</p> <p>Even without the infighting, turnout for the main Women\u2019s March \u2013 which kicks off on Saturday on the National Mall in Washington DC \u2013 was expected to be lower than in previous years.</p> <p>Crowds in 2017 came in part as a response to Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration. But this year\u2019s rally takes place on the heels of a successful midterm election for Democrats, and at a time when options for civic involvement extend well beyond donning a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/casting-off-trump-the-women-who-cant-stop-knitting-pussy-hats\">pussy hat</a>.</p> <p>Washington DC has turned into <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown-travel/u-s-shutdown-turns-washington-into-ghost-town-during-quiet-travel-season-idUSKCN1PA29B\">a veritable ghost town</a> amid the longest government shutdown in US history, with shuttered museums and tourist attractions. Earlier this month the National Park Service clarified that the Women\u2019s March <a href=\"https://wtop.com/dc/2019/01/shutdown-wont-stop-marches-on-mall-next-week/\">would take place</a> despite the setbacks.</p> <p>Many of the biggest stars of the Democratic party, including those who are running for president and were prominently featured at the march in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/womens-march-2020-democrats\">will not be making appearances</a> this year. They include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who once called the women\u2019s march the \u201cmost inspiring and transformational moment I\u2019ve ever witnessed in politics\u201d.</p> <p>The developments come following claims, described at length in stories in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/womens-march-anti-semitism.html\">the New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/276694/is-the-womens-march-melting-down\">Tablet</a> magazine, that at a private meeting members of leadership said Jews bore some special collective responsibility for the oppression of people of color, according to multiple sources in attendance, allegations those leaders have denied.</p> <p>The stories also highlight the leadership\u2019s ties to the teachings of Farrakhan. While the Women\u2019s March has issued multiple statements claiming it does not support Farrakhan\u2019s comments and rejects antisemitism, the Women\u2019s March co-president Tamika Mallory has continued to defend her connection to him.This week, in an interview on The View, she <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/US/womens-march-president-tamika-mallory-discusses-controversial-relationship/story?id=60362553\">failed to explicitly denounce</a> his defamatory statements about Jews.</p> <p>Another member of leadership, Bob Bland, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/US/womens-march-president-tamika-mallory-discusses-controversial-relationship/story?id=60362553\">told ABC News</a> the Women\u2019s March \u201cunequivocally condemns antisemitism\u201d as well as \u201cany statements of hate\u201d.</p> <p>The Tablet story also outlined other internal disputes, such as concerns around the organization\u2019s financial transparency and a lack of LGBT representation on its board.</p> <p>Top organizers, including Women\u2019s March founder Teresa Shook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TeresaShookOfficial/posts/2368957223146495\">have called</a> for Women\u2019s March leadership to step down, arguing that the small cadre of women in charge have \u201csteered the movement away from its true course\u201d and become an unwelcome distraction.</p> <p>Such calls have gone <a href=\"https://mic.com/articles/192579/womens-march-2019-linda-sarsour-tamika-mallory-not-stepping-down-anti-semitism#.z5inXYkDb\">unheeded</a>. In a November conference call, top Women\u2019s March organizer Linda Sarsour sought to dismiss the tensions as idle scuttlebutt.</p> <p>\u201cIt just happens often with women, unfortunate gossip and rumors and it\u2019s very hurtful to us as our families are watching these conversation online,\u201d she said, <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/276694/is-the-womens-march-melting-down\">according to</a> Tablet\u2019s report.</p> <p>Sarsour\u2019s comment appears to cater to damaging stereotypes about women being catty. But there is a long history of destructive fragmentation within the women\u2019s movement and social and progressive movements more generally.</p> <p>Women\u2019s suffrage leaders <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/womens-suffrage-leaders-left-out-black-women\">infamously excluded</a> black women. And the Equal Rights Amendment introduced in 1923 went down to defeat, after the middle-class women who championed it were pitted against working-class women who feared the erosion of labor protections. When it re-emerged later in the 1970s, it was brought down by a group of staunchly conservative housewives led by Phyllis Schlafly.</p> <p>From its earliest days the Women\u2019s March has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/womens-march-on-washington-opens-contentious-dialogues-about-race.html?module=inline\">fraught with racial tensions</a>, with minority women concerned that white participants had ignored their needs. Some women feel the current fracas around antisemitism is just one more way for women to be divided from one another.</p> <p>That\u2019s why sponsors such as Planned Parenthood are sticking with the march, even as they \u201cunequivocally reaffirm that there is no place for antisemitism, racism, homophobia, transphobia or any kind of bigotry in our communities\u201d.</p> <p>Planned Parenthood\u2019s Angela Ferrell-Zabala wrote in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PPact/together-we-fight-for-all-41f69608fbaa\">lengthy Medium post</a> defending the decision: \u201cWe know our work fighting for equity and justice for all people cannot happen if we don\u2019t face difficult conversations within our community head on.\u201d</p> <p>The American Federation of Teachers \u2013 one of the largest unions in the country whose president, Randi Weingarten, is Jewish \u2013 is also sticking with the Women\u2019s March.</p> <p>\u201cI come down on the side of of course we must engage,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/randi.weingarten.9/posts/10157050238404524\">she wrote on Facebook</a>, \u201cand work together to create a country and a world that deeply believes and honors the inalienable rights of all.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just two years after leading the largest recorded protest in US history, the third annual Women\u2019s March on Saturday is set to proceed under a cloud of controversy. This year\u2019s march is shaping up to be smaller and more splintered than before, after several major sponsors withdrew and local chapters disaffiliated from the central organization which leads it, following allegations of antisemitism. Leaders were slow to deny and condemn allegations they had made antisemitic comments, and recent reporting has revealed deep ties between top officials and the Nation of Islam, whose leader, Louis Farrakhan, is a notorious antisemite. Major progressive groups which sponsored the first march in 2017 have quietly withdrawn, including leading unions, environmental groups and women\u2019s organizations. Of the many Jewish groups listed as partners in previous years, only a few remain. The Democratic National Committee, which had previously appeared on a list of 2019 Women\u2019s March sponsors, recently disappeared too. It\u2019s a major blow for the movement that marked the beginning of the \u201cresistance\u201d in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential upset, when hundreds of thousands descended on the National Mall in Washington DC, a mass demonstration roughly three times the size of Trump\u2019s own inauguration. Experts called the 2017 Women\u2019s March the largest single-day protest in recorded US history, with turnout around the country estimated in the millions, and top celebrities and politicians lending their star power to the event. It also presaged the coming of the powerful #MeToo movement which would reshape the culture around the treatment of women at work. This year, however, the showing is expected to be fractured. Following a protracted fight over the organization\u2019s leadership, Vanessa Wruble, a Brooklyn-based activist who was pushed out of the organization in 2017, went on to help found another organization called March On, which emphasizes supporting local activists and denouncing antisemitism. The result is that there will be two major women\u2019s marches taking place on the streets of New York and many other cities around the country on Saturday \u2013 the original one, which emphasizes leadership by women of color, and another \u2013 March On \u2013 formed in opposition to antisemitism. \u201cFounded by the leaders of many of the marches across the country, March On is women-led, but open to all, and will employ a sophisticated political strategy to coordinate concrete actions at the federal, state, and local level through the joint efforts of millions of marchers,\u201d the March On website states. Lee Weal, an activist based in New York City, told the Guardian that while she went to the second Women\u2019s March and had been planning to go to the third this year, the group\u2019s ties to Farrakhan put her off. \u201cIf we insist that Trump disavow people like David Duke, you can\u2019t have a different rule for those on the left,\u201d she said, adding she thought leaders were \u201churting the movement\u201d by aligning with him. Even without the infighting, turnout for the main Women\u2019s March \u2013 which kicks off on Saturday on the National Mall in Washington DC \u2013 was expected to be lower than in previous years. Crowds in 2017 came in part as a response to Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration. But this year\u2019s rally takes place on the heels of a successful midterm election for Democrats, and at a time when options for civic involvement extend well beyond donning a pussy hat. Washington DC has turned into a veritable ghost town amid the longest government shutdown in US history, with shuttered museums and tourist attractions. Earlier this month the National Park Service clarified that the Women\u2019s March would take place despite the setbacks. Many of the biggest stars of the Democratic party, including those who are running for president and were prominently featured at the march in 2017 will not be making appearances this year. They include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who once called the women\u2019s march the \u201cmost inspiring and transformational moment I\u2019ve ever witnessed in politics\u201d. The developments come following claims, described at length in stories in the New York Times and Tablet magazine, that at a private meeting members of leadership said Jews bore some special collective responsibility for the oppression of people of color, according to multiple sources in attendance, allegations those leaders have denied. The stories also highlight the leadership\u2019s ties to the teachings of Farrakhan. While the Women\u2019s March has issued multiple statements claiming it does not support Farrakhan\u2019s comments and rejects antisemitism, the Women\u2019s March co-president Tamika Mallory has continued to defend her connection to him.This week, in an interview on The View, she failed to explicitly denounce his defamatory statements about Jews. Another member of leadership, Bob Bland, told ABC News the Women\u2019s March \u201cunequivocally condemns antisemitism\u201d as well as \u201cany statements of hate\u201d. The Tablet story also outlined other internal disputes, such as concerns around the organization\u2019s financial transparency and a lack of LGBT representation on its board. Top organizers, including Women\u2019s March founder Teresa Shook, have called for Women\u2019s March leadership to step down, arguing that the small cadre of women in charge have \u201csteered the movement away from its true course\u201d and become an unwelcome distraction. Such calls have gone unheeded. In a November conference call, top Women\u2019s March organizer Linda Sarsour sought to dismiss the tensions as idle scuttlebutt. \u201cIt just happens often with women, unfortunate gossip and rumors and it\u2019s very hurtful to us as our families are watching these conversation online,\u201d she said, according to Tablet\u2019s report. Sarsour\u2019s comment appears to cater to damaging stereotypes about women being catty. But there is a long history of destructive fragmentation within the women\u2019s movement and social and progressive movements more generally. Women\u2019s suffrage leaders infamously excluded black women. And the Equal Rights Amendment introduced in 1923 went down to defeat, after the middle-class women who championed it were pitted against working-class women who feared the erosion of labor protections. When it re-emerged later in the 1970s, it was brought down by a group of staunchly conservative housewives led by Phyllis Schlafly. From its earliest days the Women\u2019s March has been fraught with racial tensions, with minority women concerned that white participants had ignored their needs. Some women feel the current fracas around antisemitism is just one more way for women to be divided from one another. That\u2019s why sponsors such as Planned Parenthood are sticking with the march, even as they \u201cunequivocally reaffirm that there is no place for antisemitism, racism, homophobia, transphobia or any kind of bigotry in our communities\u201d. Planned Parenthood\u2019s Angela Ferrell-Zabala wrote in a lengthy Medium post defending the decision: \u201cWe know our work fighting for equity and justice for all people cannot happen if we don\u2019t face difficult conversations within our community head on.\u201d The American Federation of Teachers \u2013 one of the largest unions in the country whose president, Randi Weingarten, is Jewish \u2013 is also sticking with the Women\u2019s March. \u201cI come down on the side of of course we must engage,\u201d she wrote on Facebook, \u201cand work together to create a country and a world that deeply believes and honors the inalienable rights of all.\u201d",

Electronics and digital sampling feature prominently, too. In Quadroforone No 1, by the Faroese composer Sunleif Rasmussen, Esfahani\u2019s hyperactive live harpsichord meshes with prerecorded and transformed versions of itself, creating dense, pulsing textures somewhere between the early minimalism of Steve Reich and the complex canonic writing of Conlon Nancarrow. Anahita Abbasi\u2019s Intertwined Distances takes a more radical line with the prerecorded harpsichord transformations, providing a confrontational backdrop to the equally explosive live element. There were no electronics in Berio\u2019s tumbling miniature Rounds \u2013 a single page without clefs, that\u2019s played through normally, then upside down, and finally the right way up again but faster \u2013 nor in Miroslav Srnka\u2019s rather dated and unconvincing Triggering, in which the harpsichord is \u201cprepared\u201d with objects placed on its strings. But one of the solos from Cage\u2019s evening-long HPSCHD not only surrounded the live instruments with a torrent of prerecorded sound, but used a computerised version of the I Ching to fix many of the performance parameters. Esfahani chose a solo that required him to practise and play something by Mozart; he\u2019d opted for the D minor Fantasia, whose fragments emerged from the welter of the electronic sounds that threatened to overwhelm them.",

The chief executive of the electric car manufacturer told staff on Friday that \u201cthe road ahead is very difficult\u201d because its products were not yet affordable for most people and it was up against a big incumbent industry. The California-based company had a torrid 2018 as it struggled through production problems with its mass market\u201d Model 3 car and had to pay out $40m over tweets Musk made about taking the firm into private ownership. Musk said it had also been a good year because Tesla had sold almost as many cars in 2018 as it had in its entire history and the firm had made its first profit. However, he said he had no choice but to reduce its global headcount by 7% as the company had grown by nearly a third last year, which was \u201cmore than we can support\u201d. The company has not published its precise headcount but Musk gave a figure of 45,000 in October, implying 3,150 job losses. In a company update, Musk said: \u201cWhile we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people. Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we\u2019re up against massive, entrenched competitors. \u201cThe net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.\u201d Musk added that the cuts would fall at a time when the firm also needed to ramp up the speed with which it is building the Model 3.

Tesla will make a \u201ctiny profit\u201d for the fourth quarter of 2018, he said, suggesting it will be lower than the $312m profit in made in the third quarter.

These two recipes, though, are on pretty heavy rotation at home. The cherry-topped porridge has serious hits of flavour, texture and an almost white-chocolate creaminess thanks to the cashew butter. The other, a quick fix on a rushed morning, is coconut-laced instant porridge: think gourmet Ready Brek.</p> <h2><strong>Creamy porridge with cherries and cashew butter (pictured above)</strong></h2> <p>Hands down my favourite bowl of porridge.

      "body": "<p>When Chigozie Obioma came up with the idea of writing a novel from the point of view of a person\u2019s \u201cchi\u201d \u2013 the animating spirit that, in Igbo cosmology, every living thing contains \u2013 his heart sank. It seemed to the 33-year-old that as a writing exercise it was too weird and too hard, besides which, how would he even describe it? \u201cReally I didn\u2019t want to do it that way at all,\u201d he says, in the restaurant of a New York hotel. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing with me; any time I come up with an idea for a novel, I\u2019m drawn to a very grand, almost cosmic structure that I try to push away. But as time goes on, and as the story builds, it\u2019s almost as if without this frame it would not make sense. So I would just go ahead, even though I knew it would be very difficult to navigate.\u201d</p> <p>The result is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/10/an-orchestra-of-minorities-by-chigozie-obioma\" title=\"\">An Orchestra of Minorities</a></em> \u2013 Obioma\u2019s second novel after his Man Booker-shortlisted debut <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/13/the-fishermen-chigozie-obioma-review\" title=\"\">The Fishermen</a> \u2013</em> an <em>Odyssey</em>-like story in which a poultry farmer from Nigeria undertakes a journey to prove himself worthy of the woman he loves. Chinonso, a man whose chi dithers constantly over how much to interfere in his host\u2019s fortunes, falls in love with a wealthy woman called Ndali, whom he saves from jumping off a bridge and in so doing aligns his destiny with hers. The novel is a study in what happens when a man loses control of his life and is subject to forces \u2013 in this case, the corrupt middlemen who persuade Chinonso to hand over lots of money for a place at university in northern Cyprus, and the racism he confronts on arrival \u2013 greater than his own.</p> <p>The idea for the novel, Obioma says, grew out of something he witnessed when he was himself a student in northern Cyprus. Some of the strongest parts of the book describe the hideous plight of Nigerian students, tricked into handing over large sums of money to gain access to Europe via Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, only to discover, on arrival, that from an immigration perspective the country is not even part of the EU.</p> <p>Obioma wasn\u2019t subject to this scam himself; his parents were wealthy enough to avoid going through middlemen and to pay the university direct. When he arrived, however, it was clear to him that \u201c95% of the Nigerians I met in Cyprus had been through these middlemen and had lost money.\u201d And he says the universities are benefiting. \u201cWhen I left Cyprus in 2012, there were about seven universities. Now there are about 15, because it\u2019s so lucrative. Now I hear that Cameroonians are flocking there because of the war.\u201d</p> <p>The impetus to write the novel came out of what happened to Obioma\u2019s friend, Jay, a Nigerian man he met in the first days of starting college. Jay had been duped by the middle men both into thinking the university in Cyprus would be a springboard into Europe, and that his degree would enable him to make lots of money. Instead, he confronted the reality that not only had most of the funds he\u2019d handed over to fixers been embezzled, but that he was now stuck in northern Cyprus, where there were no jobs and where his status as a Nigerian immigrant made him widely despised. After a heavy bout of drinking, Jay was found dead at the bottom of a lift shaft, where he was assumed to have fallen accidentally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of the strongest stories begin with very simple archetypes. And you work your way from that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne thing that I was always thinking about in the aftermath of the tragic death,\u201d Obioma says, \u201cwas that Jay had mentioned, during the few days when I met him, that he had come to Cyprus in the first place because of the woman he was betrothed to \u2013 he needed to make money quickly. And I found myself often thinking about her. We had no way to contact her. The university contacted his mother, and they took his corpse back to Nigeria. But we were nobodies. And I was always thinking: what happened to her?\u201d</p> <p>It is a fascinating premise for a story, along the lines of the movie <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/affair-to-remember-romance\" title=\"\">An Affair to Remember</a></em>, in which one half of a couple waits endlessly for the other, who will never turn up. These sorts of cliffhangers are not supposed to be possible in the age of the mobile phone, in which no one is kept in the dark about anything. But as Obioma\u2019s novel makes clear, this assumption overlooks the vastness of these immigrant journeys, in which the silencing effect of shame, failure and poverty effectively renders technological advance almost irrelevent.</p> <p>As a result, <em>An Orchestra of Minorities</em> has about it the air of a timeless story, premised on archetypes from a much earlier age. \u201cI believe that some of the strongest stories we can have begin with very simple archetypes,\u201d says Obioma. \u201cThe great mother, or the great father, for example. And you work your way from that, slowly, to more complexity. The idea of this guy who wants to be with the woman he loves \u2013 you can say the same of the movie <em>Gladiator</em>, for instance. If you strip everything down to the basics, it\u2019s just about Maximus wanting to go back to his wife and every other thing stopping him. Even Homer\u2019s<em> Odyssey</em>; he just wants to go back and the entire universe is conspiring against that ambition.\u201d</p> <p>Obioma\u2019s own journey ended in a much happier place. He is the fifth of 12 children, the son of a banker who, as Obioma puts it, \u201cpulled himself up by his bootstraps. His dad died when he was 10, and he funded his education by being a manservant to wealthy families.\u201d Obioma\u2019s father is a big reader and while his mother \u201chad only a primary school education, she encouraged us\u201d.</p> <p>Obioma was an academic stand-out in the family: \u201cI found reading to be an escape. I was a recluse. I would always be the one hiding, and reading\u201d. His parents were adamant that he enter a profession and, as they put it, not \u201cwaste\u201d his promise on something like writing. \u201cThey wanted the best for me. They didn\u2019t want me to be poor.\u201d Under their influence, he agreed to study engineering at a university in Nigeria, but was desperately unhappy and left before graduating. He then won a place at a university in Britain, but the Home Office withdrew the offer of a visa before he could take it up. Finally his parents found the university in northern Cyprus, where, against the odds, Obioma flourished, and wound up staying on to teach. Eventually, he applied and won a place to do a writing fellowship at the University of Michigan, and it was there that he completed his first novel, <em>The Fishermen</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ffc7a3a41df5222b168d2f26bfb671d85e54e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ffc7a3a41df5222b168d2f26bfb671d85e54e8a/0_135_4817_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man Booker prize 2015 Sunjeev Sahota, Chigozie Obioma, Hanya Yanagihara, Anne Tyler, Tom McCarthy and Marlon James.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shortlisted authors for the Man Booker prize 2015, left to right: Sunjeev Sahota, Chigozie Obioma, Hanya Yanagihara, Anne Tyler, Tom McCarthy and Marlon James.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The success of that debut, which describes the lives of four brothers living in a small town in Nigeria and which was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2015, finally put paid to his parents\u2019 anxieties. Obioma now lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he teaches at the university and occasionally struggles to remember which language to operate in. He is quadrilingual, speaking Igbo, the language of his father, as well as Yoruba, which is widely spoken in the south west of Nigeria where Obioma grew up, plus English and, thanks to his sojourn in Cyprus, Turkish. There are some advantages, he says. \u201cThere are some rhetorical moves that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make if I didn\u2019t know these languages. In terms of writing figurative language, I probably pull a lot from Yoruba imagery. I was reading from the book at the launch and there is a phrase I thought about afterwards. It was that to Chinonso, Ndali was the thing \u2018his soul had been longing for with tears in its eyes\u2019. And I thought, how did I come up with the idea of somebody\u2019s soul crying? And I imagine it was from the folklore that my mum would tell me \u2013 the word soul is used a lot in the Yoruba language, more than you would find in English.\u201d</p> <p>At other times, being quadrilingual becomes difficult. \u201cAfter learning Turkish my English was affected, and for a while it was very difficult for me to speak in an articulate way extemporaneously. But then it got better. The languages eventually meshed and things realigned, but for a while it felt like something had gone wrong somewhere. Sometimes I wish I could divest myself of some of these languages.\u201d</p> <p>One of the joys of his new novel is the way that it interweaves western religion and philosophy with Nigerian thought systems, without any obvious hierarchy. It was his intention, he says, to trace the locus of Igbo cosmology as it is vested in the idea of the \u201cchi\u201d. So, he says, \u201cthe idea of the chi comes from the basic principle that where one thing stands, another thing stands beside it. We believe in the duality of everything; we believe that nothing has meaning if it cannot be compared to something else. Beauty has no meaning if there is no such thing as ugliness. If you exist in a corporeal form, there must be a double in the spiritual realm. The chi is your spirit double.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/10/an-orchestra-of-minorities-by-chigozie-obioma\">An Orchestra of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma review \u2013 a stunning leap forwards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In <em>An Orchestra of Minorities</em>, Obioma posits this theory in opposition to that of free will \u2013 the Christian idea, embedded in western political and judicial institutions, that a person is not governed by a spirit force, but is entirely responsible for their own moral choices. The resultant conflict informs the question underpinning Chinonso\u2019s tragic arc: to what extent is he culpable in his own downfall?

      "bodyText": "When Chigozie Obioma came up with the idea of writing a novel from the point of view of a person\u2019s \u201cchi\u201d \u2013 the animating spirit that, in Igbo cosmology, every living thing contains \u2013 his heart sank. It seemed to the 33-year-old that as a writing exercise it was too weird and too hard, besides which, how would he even describe it? \u201cReally I didn\u2019t want to do it that way at all,\u201d he says, in the restaurant of a New York hotel. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing with me; any time I come up with an idea for a novel, I\u2019m drawn to a very grand, almost cosmic structure that I try to push away. But as time goes on, and as the story builds, it\u2019s almost as if without this frame it would not make sense. So I would just go ahead, even though I knew it would be very difficult to navigate.\u201d The result is An Orchestra of Minorities \u2013 Obioma\u2019s second novel after his Man Booker-shortlisted debut The Fishermen \u2013 an Odyssey-like story in which a poultry farmer from Nigeria undertakes a journey to prove himself worthy of the woman he loves. Chinonso, a man whose chi dithers constantly over how much to interfere in his host\u2019s fortunes, falls in love with a wealthy woman called Ndali, whom he saves from jumping off a bridge and in so doing aligns his destiny with hers. The novel is a study in what happens when a man loses control of his life and is subject to forces \u2013 in this case, the corrupt middlemen who persuade Chinonso to hand over lots of money for a place at university in northern Cyprus, and the racism he confronts on arrival \u2013 greater than his own. The idea for the novel, Obioma says, grew out of something he witnessed when he was himself a student in northern Cyprus. Some of the strongest parts of the book describe the hideous plight of Nigerian students, tricked into handing over large sums of money to gain access to Europe via Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, only to discover, on arrival, that from an immigration perspective the country is not even part of the EU. Obioma wasn\u2019t subject to this scam himself; his parents were wealthy enough to avoid going through middlemen and to pay the university direct. When he arrived, however, it was clear to him that \u201c95% of the Nigerians I met in Cyprus had been through these middlemen and had lost money.\u201d And he says the universities are benefiting. \u201cWhen I left Cyprus in 2012, there were about seven universities. Now there are about 15, because it\u2019s so lucrative. Now I hear that Cameroonians are flocking there because of the war.\u201d The impetus to write the novel came out of what happened to Obioma\u2019s friend, Jay, a Nigerian man he met in the first days of starting college. Jay had been duped by the middle men both into thinking the university in Cyprus would be a springboard into Europe, and that his degree would enable him to make lots of money. Instead, he confronted the reality that not only had most of the funds he\u2019d handed over to fixers been embezzled, but that he was now stuck in northern Cyprus, where there were no jobs and where his status as a Nigerian immigrant made him widely despised. After a heavy bout of drinking, Jay was found dead at the bottom of a lift shaft, where he was assumed to have fallen accidentally. \u201cOne thing that I was always thinking about in the aftermath of the tragic death,\u201d Obioma says, \u201cwas that Jay had mentioned, during the few days when I met him, that he had come to Cyprus in the first place because of the woman he was betrothed to \u2013 he needed to make money quickly. And I found myself often thinking about her. We had no way to contact her. The university contacted his mother, and they took his corpse back to Nigeria. But we were nobodies. And I was always thinking: what happened to her?\u201d It is a fascinating premise for a story, along the lines of the movie An Affair to Remember, in which one half of a couple waits endlessly for the other, who will never turn up. These sorts of cliffhangers are not supposed to be possible in the age of the mobile phone, in which no one is kept in the dark about anything. But as Obioma\u2019s novel makes clear, this assumption overlooks the vastness of these immigrant journeys, in which the silencing effect of shame, failure and poverty effectively renders technological advance almost irrelevent. As a result, An Orchestra of Minorities has about it the air of a timeless story, premised on archetypes from a much earlier age. \u201cI believe that some of the strongest stories we can have begin with very simple archetypes,\u201d says Obioma. \u201cThe great mother, or the great father, for example. And you work your way from that, slowly, to more complexity. The idea of this guy who wants to be with the woman he loves \u2013 you can say the same of the movie Gladiator, for instance. If you strip everything down to the basics, it\u2019s just about Maximus wanting to go back to his wife and every other thing stopping him. Even Homer\u2019s Odyssey; he just wants to go back and the entire universe is conspiring against that ambition.\u201d Obioma\u2019s own journey ended in a much happier place. He is the fifth of 12 children, the son of a banker who, as Obioma puts it, \u201cpulled himself up by his bootstraps. His dad died when he was 10, and he funded his education by being a manservant to wealthy families.\u201d Obioma\u2019s father is a big reader and while his mother \u201chad only a primary school education, she encouraged us\u201d. Obioma was an academic stand-out in the family: \u201cI found reading to be an escape. I was a recluse. I would always be the one hiding, and reading\u201d. His parents were adamant that he enter a profession and, as they put it, not \u201cwaste\u201d his promise on something like writing. \u201cThey wanted the best for me. They didn\u2019t want me to be poor.\u201d Under their influence, he agreed to study engineering at a university in Nigeria, but was desperately unhappy and left before graduating. He then won a place at a university in Britain, but the Home Office withdrew the offer of a visa before he could take it up. Finally his parents found the university in northern Cyprus, where, against the odds, Obioma flourished, and wound up staying on to teach. Eventually, he applied and won a place to do a writing fellowship at the University of Michigan, and it was there that he completed his first novel, The Fishermen. The success of that debut, which describes the lives of four brothers living in a small town in Nigeria and which was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2015, finally put paid to his parents\u2019 anxieties. Obioma now lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he teaches at the university and occasionally struggles to remember which language to operate in. He is quadrilingual, speaking Igbo, the language of his father, as well as Yoruba, which is widely spoken in the south west of Nigeria where Obioma grew up, plus English and, thanks to his sojourn in Cyprus, Turkish. There are some advantages, he says. \u201cThere are some rhetorical moves that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make if I didn\u2019t know these languages. In terms of writing figurative language, I probably pull a lot from Yoruba imagery. I was reading from the book at the launch and there is a phrase I thought about afterwards. It was that to Chinonso, Ndali was the thing \u2018his soul had been longing for with tears in its eyes\u2019. And I thought, how did I come up with the idea of somebody\u2019s soul crying? And I imagine it was from the folklore that my mum would tell me \u2013 the word soul is used a lot in the Yoruba language, more than you would find in English.\u201d At other times, being quadrilingual becomes difficult. \u201cAfter learning Turkish my English was affected, and for a while it was very difficult for me to speak in an articulate way extemporaneously. But then it got better. The languages eventually meshed and things realigned, but for a while it felt like something had gone wrong somewhere. Sometimes I wish I could divest myself of some of these languages.\u201d One of the joys of his new novel is the way that it interweaves western religion and philosophy with Nigerian thought systems, without any obvious hierarchy. It was his intention, he says, to trace the locus of Igbo cosmology as it is vested in the idea of the \u201cchi\u201d. So, he says, \u201cthe idea of the chi comes from the basic principle that where one thing stands, another thing stands beside it. We believe in the duality of everything; we believe that nothing has meaning if it cannot be compared to something else. Beauty has no meaning if there is no such thing as ugliness. If you exist in a corporeal form, there must be a double in the spiritual realm. The chi is your spirit double.\u201d In An Orchestra of Minorities, Obioma posits this theory in opposition to that of free will \u2013 the Christian idea, embedded in western political and judicial institutions, that a person is not governed by a spirit force, but is entirely responsible for their own moral choices. The resultant conflict informs the question underpinning Chinonso\u2019s tragic arc: to what extent is he culpable in his own downfall? While there are flashes of humour, and Obioma himself is full of merriment, the novel comes to a gloomy conclusion. \u201cPeople always ask me, why do your stories end this way? And honestly,\u201d he says, \u201cI want to write a feelgood story. But I think that because I\u2019m fascinated with the metaphysics of existence, I keep thinking why, of all the people who came to Cyprus, was it Jay who died? Or, I read not too long ago of a nine-year-old doing her homework and there\u2019s a drive-by shooting and a bullet comes in through the roof and kills her. She didn\u2019t do anything to deserve that fate. When you think about these things, and you want to write fiction around that, the path it takes you to can feel inevitable and tragic.\u201d The impulse to write in the first instance may come from a place of optimism \u2013 Obioma says that he was partly motivated by a desire to salvage Jay\u2019s death from meaninglessness \u2013 but the bottom line remains that, whether one construes the larger forces to be spiritual or political, Jay, and so many other victims of seemingly random deaths, \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything to deserve that fate\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The longest government shutdown in US history shows no sign of ending, Brexit is roiling Europe, trade wars are still in the offing and the stock market is acting like a spooked cat. And once again, gold is shining. Gold often shines in times of trouble. The last time there was a showdown between a US president and Congress over government spending, gold prices shot up to an all-time high, about $1,925 an ounce. That was when a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, led by John Boehner, sparred with Barack Obama over whether to lift the debt ceiling or risk the US Treasury defaulting on its payments. Considering gold prices are hovering around $1,290 an ounce, it\u2019s highly unlikely they will return to those earlier heights quickly. But even when the government reopens, analysts say the metal\u2019s fortunes may soon sparkle after a few dull years. In the fourth quarter, Comex gold futures prices rose 7.1% as stock prices started to skid. Although spot gold prices \u2013 the figure in the current market \u2013 ended 2018 down about 1%, that was a better showing that the 6% loss for the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 stock index. George Gero, senior managing director at RBC Wealth Management and a 35-year gold trader, said the late-year stock market weakness kickstarted gold\u2019s rebound, and the government shutdown fueled it. Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management, who specializes in gold, said Democrats regaining control of the House of Representatives in November was very positive for gold because it suggested there would be gridlock in Washington. \u201cA government shutdown is gridlock on steroids,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not just the shutdown that is boosting gold. Its biggest underpinning is an apparent softening in Federal Reserve policy, said Joe Foster, portfolio manager and strategist for VanEck\u2019s International Investors Gold Fund. The Fed has been raising interest rates, and previous expectations for 2019 were that the central bank would hike them again. But a more dovish tone by the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, in December and the release of Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, which suggest that the Fed may not be as aggressive in raising rates, were positive for gold, the analysts said. Foster said investor interest in gold was also spurred by the view that the US economic expansion may be ending, another key catalyst for gold. \u201cTo me there are two outcomes: either the Fed continues raising rates and they drive the economy into our next recession, [or] if they stop or reverse course, then we see weakness in the dollar. Both scenarios are good for gold,\u201d Foster said. (Higher interest rates support the US dollar, and gold is dollar-denominated, meaning that when the greenback is strong, gold usually falters.) Day said investors are reviewing gold\u2019s traditional role as an insurance hedge and a portfolio diversifier after ignoring it for several years when stocks, bonds and the housing market were all strong. With those three markets showing signs of weakness, people are looking for alternatives, he added. And with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin having crashed from its own lofty levels in 2017, buyers are no longer considering that decentralized asset as a safe haven asset. Day pointed to strong inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds as a sign investors are using gold to hedge against weaker stocks and uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the trade disputes. Geopolitical concerns are particularly good for gold when prices are already on an upswing. The government shutdown between Bill Clinton and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich didn\u2019t affect gold because the overall atmosphere wasn\u2019t conducive; instead investors sought safety in cash. During the 1980 Iran hostage crisis, gold prices spiked because prices were already high. On Wednesday, US gold prices perked up slightly following the news the British parliament rejected Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan in a historically lopsided vote. \u201cIf gold is already in a bull market, if the sentiment is positive, the moves can be very strong,\u201d Day said. Gold isn\u2019t in a bull market yet, as it would need to take out the 2018 highs around $1,365 an ounce to break through the meandering pattern it has followed since falling off all-time nominal highs in 2011. Gero predicted gold would hold around the current $1,275 to $1,300 area for a while. But the more uncertain things become, the more brightly gold will shine.",

      "bodyText": "Alongside its golden beaches, glitzy nightclubs and vibrant music scene, Senegal\u2019s capital, Dakar, is emerging as a key African fashion hub. Senegalese young people watch a runway show during Dakar fashion week in the Niari Tali neighbourhood, June 2017 The breezy seaside city, located on the continent\u2019s westernmost point, is \u201cwest Africa\u2019s centre of style\u201d, according to the January issue of National Geographic Traveler magazine, which ranked it at No 1 on its list of urban hotspots. The New York Times this week included it on a list of 52 places to visit in 2019, saying Dakar is \u201cbursting with positive energy\u201d and that local \u201cdesign and fashion creations would fit right in at New York showrooms\u201d. Dakar fashion week in the capital\u2019s Niari Tali neighbourhood The strength of the city\u2019s fashion scene has long been apparent, even if it is only now gaining notice. I moved to Dakar in 2005 and spent nearly a decade based there as a newswire photographer covering stories across Africa. The role often meant documenting wars, coups and disasters, but Senegal always remained a haven of peace and relative tranquillity in an often-tumultuous region. My eye was drawn to its vibrant colours and designs and, over the years, I photographed fashion around town. The city\u2019s youth blend a deep respect for the traditional, flowing boubous worn for special occasions with cutting-edge styles of their own. A model takes a runway selfie during Dakar fashion week, July 2017 Senegal has a well-educated middle class and an Instagram generation that embraces African and American fashions, creating an elegant and athletic style of bling and beauty. Dakar fashion week, June 2017 Designer Oumar Dicko (right) of Mali and Belgium laces up a model in one of his creations backstage, July 2017 Dakar now rivals Johannesburg, Lagos, Nairobi and Casablanca at the forefront of African fashion, with much of its energy driven by the designer Adama Ndiaye, the 40-year-old organiser of Dakar fashion week and a number of other international African fashion week events. \u201cWhen I started it was a young girl\u2019s dream to build something in my country,\u201d Ndiaye says. Models backstage during Dakar fashion week in June 2017 Left: model and designer Sachakara Dieng wears one of her creations in an elevator in Dakar, December 2018; right: hairstylist Nabou Dieng poses for a portrait near Dakar, November 2018 Launched 17 years ago, Dakar fashion week initially had only a handful of aspiring local designers and models gathering in often rundown hotels. Now dozens of designers from around the world present their creations to thumping DJ mixes as drone cameras hover above runway shows broadcast live on national television. Guests attend a beach wedding near Dakar, November 2018 One of Ndiaye\u2019s friends is Jenke Ahmed Tailly, an Ivorian and Senegalese stylist who works as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s creative director and also advises Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. At the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 charity concert in South Africa last month, Beyonc\u00e9 wore one of Ndiaye\u2019s creations, a Boyette bag, based on the nomadic Tuareg style of embossed leather boxes. Models backstage during Dakar fashion week in June 2016 Models Amy Faye and Sachakara Dieng wear creations by Adama Ndiaye in Dakar, July 2012 Africa\u2019s fashion scene has grown steadily over the past two decades, with sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s apparel and footwear market now worth $31bn, according to data by Euromonitor. Industry challenges include managing clothing production costs, quality control, distribution logistics and reaching large markets.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Pretty much everything has been given to Leinster and, indirectly, to Ireland,\u201d Stuart Lancaster says when he considers how the knowledge he gained during seven years at the heart of English rugby has been jettisoned by his own country. The Leinster coach speaks without bitterness and, having reflected movingly on the recent death of his father and the bruising aftermath of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/11/stuart-lancaster-england-head-coach-leaves-post\" title=\"\">sacked by England after the 2015 World Cup</a>, he sounds philosophical.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/17/england-six-nations-squad-eddie-jones-rugby-union\">England\u2019s Six Nations squad has tools to be hard, direct and ruthless</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lancaster is clearly happy coaching Leinster alongside Leo Cullen and they are the bookmakers\u2019 favourites to retain the European Champions Cup. Leinster also supply the core of the Irish squad which, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/17/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">won the grand slam</a> last season and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/17/ireland-new-zealand-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">beaten New Zealand two months ago</a>, face England in Dublin on 2 February in their opening Six Nations game. The mood in Dublin is calmly confident and Lancaster, a proud Englishman, looks at home in a successful Irish environment.</p> <p>English rugby, in contrast, appears uncertain. Only one Premiership club, Saracens, may qualify for the European quarter-finals this weekend while Leinster, Munster and Ulster should seal their places. After a dismal run of five consecutive defeats, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/25/rugby-union-eddie-jones-upward-curve-english-patient\" title=\"\">England improved in the autumn</a>. But they will be tested with fresh force in Dublin. It prompts the question as to why Lancaster\u2019s insights have not only been lost to English rugby but allowed to flourish in Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"081a7a35dc4ceeb976c2112498a03f6d0d81328d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/081a7a35dc4ceeb976c2112498a03f6d0d81328d/0_50_3031_1818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Lancaster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lancaster after defeat to Australia knocked England out of their home World Cup. \u2018I felt pretty battered,\u2019 he admits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re coaching England, and I did it 50 times, you learn a lot,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been around 12 Premiership clubs, you\u2019ve coached many great players, you\u2019ve coached against great countries and great coaches. So your technical detail, your understanding of the game, grows exponentially. I learned through the good times and the bad times. I learned through failure and success. I gathered lots of knowledge and experience with England.\u201d</p> <p>Lancaster was not shocked to lose his job as England head coach in 2015 \u2013 but he was ready to commit himself to the RFU and return to the work he had done so well from 2008 to 2011 when overseeing the development of young players and coaching England Saxons. But the willingness of a humble man, and an outstanding coach, to step back into development work was not accepted. Lancaster remained in the rugby wilderness for nearly a year until, in September 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/05/stuart-lancaster-leinster-senior-coach-till-end-of-season\" title=\"\">he was invited to join Leinster</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The sense of identity and connection is incredible. Leinster have got more local players than any club I\u2019ve been involved in. The cohesion is huge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Johnny Sexton, voted World Rugby Player of the Year in 2018, helped persuade Lancaster. \u201cHe dropped me a text while I was deciding,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cIt was nice of Johnny because when you\u2019re bruised by the World Cup experience it\u2019s good to feel wanted. When I met him he said: \u2018We could see how well England were doing when we played you. We could see the improvements.\u2019 With England we had a pretty good track record against Ireland.\u201d England beat Ireland four times out of five during Lancaster\u2019s tenure.</p> <p>Before we talk at Leinster\u2019s headquarters at University College Dublin, I watch Lancaster work with the squad. Even this snapshot underlines their cohesion. \u201cIt\u2019s different in England,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter A-levels many people in England go to university in a different city. In Dublin, if they go to university they stay in the city. So this group have gone to school together, played schools matches together, gone to university together, come through the academy together. The sense of identity and connection is incredible. Leinster have got more local players than any club I\u2019ve been involved in. When I first arrived I talked to players individually. I\u2019d say: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 Dublin. \u2018Where did you to go to university?\u2019 Dublin. \u2018Where would you like to go in the future?\u2019 They all wanted to stay in Dublin and play for Leinster.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than being parochial, Lancaster believes this strong bond is inspirational. \u201cThe cohesion, the sense of community, is huge. People often talk about Ireland having an advantage because they prioritise Europe over domestic competition. But people sometimes fail to recognise there are some great players here. If you had to pick a Lions team right now there would be quite a few players from Ireland in it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/17/concentration-talent-ireland-english-trailing-europe\">The Breakdown | Concentration of Ireland rugby talent leaves English trailing in Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last Saturday, when missing the injured Sexton, Leinster still dominated Toulouse, regarded as the form team in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/12/leinster-toulouse-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">and won 29-13</a>. The depth of their squad was obvious. \u201cWe like to think we can rest and rotate players and still win,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cWe\u2019re 19 points clear in our conference in the Pro14 \u2013 where there are lots of very good coaches. Dave Rennie, Richard Cockerill, Johann van Graan. It\u2019s a similar model to New Zealand where you\u2019ve got head coaches contracted to the Irish union. You\u2019ve also got players contracted to Ireland. For a country that\u2019s small in population it\u2019s the only way that you\u2019re going to make it work.\u201d</p> <p>Lancaster pauses when asked to compare his immersion in Leinster with the far more difficult year when he was out of work. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a sense of purpose without working full-time. You also spend all your time reflecting. For me my last game had been in the World Cup. All the stuff beforehand was erased. In everyone\u2019s mind it became very hard to look further back than the Australia and Wales games. You also think what comes next? How do you get out of the position you\u2019re in? A lot of national coaches often don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p>How did he stop becoming depressed? \u201cI\u2019m pretty resilient. And getting out of England during the Six Nations in 2016 helped. I went to New Zealand, Australia and South Africa and it was great. It gave me some thinking time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d956edf1dd37bc90b63953404d54ec1c37fcf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d956edf1dd37bc90b63953404d54ec1c37fcf7/0_47_5034_3021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Lancaster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lancaster shows off the Champions Cup after Leinster\u2019s victory over Racing 92 in last year\u2019s final in Bilbao.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did he doubt himself? \u201cNo. But I felt pretty battered. The sense of responsibility for not achieving success weighed heavily on my shoulders. I was in charge of a national team at a home World Cup and we didn\u2019t achieve what we wanted. I was confident many things we did in the buildup went well. But 20 minutes of rugby changed everything.\u201d</p> <p>Lancaster is still grieving the loss of his father, who died unexpectedly last September, and he remembers how his dad was wounded by the World Cup. \u201cSome of the criticism levelled at me hurt him. But we have a great circle of friends, a very small community [around his parents\u2019 home in Cumbria]. They only knew me as Stuart \u2013 rather than the England head coach. So whenever I came home I was never treated differently.\u201d</p> <p>Had there been concerns about his dad before his death? \u201cNo, he was in fantastic health. I came off the training field and saw five missed calls from my brother. I knew that wasn\u2019t good. My dad had collapsed on the farm with a cardiac arrest. My mum rang 999.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Pretty much everything has been given to Leinster and, indirectly, to Ireland,\u201d Stuart Lancaster says when he considers how the knowledge he gained during seven years at the heart of English rugby has been jettisoned by his own country. The Leinster coach speaks without bitterness and, having reflected movingly on the recent death of his father and the bruising aftermath of being sacked by England after the 2015 World Cup, he sounds philosophical. Lancaster is clearly happy coaching Leinster alongside Leo Cullen and they are the bookmakers\u2019 favourites to retain the European Champions Cup. Leinster also supply the core of the Irish squad which, having won the grand slam last season and beaten New Zealand two months ago, face England in Dublin on 2 February in their opening Six Nations game. The mood in Dublin is calmly confident and Lancaster, a proud Englishman, looks at home in a successful Irish environment. English rugby, in contrast, appears uncertain. Only one Premiership club, Saracens, may qualify for the European quarter-finals this weekend while Leinster, Munster and Ulster should seal their places. After a dismal run of five consecutive defeats, England improved in the autumn. But they will be tested with fresh force in Dublin. It prompts the question as to why Lancaster\u2019s insights have not only been lost to English rugby but allowed to flourish in Ireland. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coaching England, and I did it 50 times, you learn a lot,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been around 12 Premiership clubs, you\u2019ve coached many great players, you\u2019ve coached against great countries and great coaches. So your technical detail, your understanding of the game, grows exponentially. I learned through the good times and the bad times. I learned through failure and success. I gathered lots of knowledge and experience with England.\u201d Lancaster was not shocked to lose his job as England head coach in 2015 \u2013 but he was ready to commit himself to the RFU and return to the work he had done so well from 2008 to 2011 when overseeing the development of young players and coaching England Saxons. But the willingness of a humble man, and an outstanding coach, to step back into development work was not accepted. Lancaster remained in the rugby wilderness for nearly a year until, in September 2016, he was invited to join Leinster. Johnny Sexton, voted World Rugby Player of the Year in 2018, helped persuade Lancaster. \u201cHe dropped me a text while I was deciding,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cIt was nice of Johnny because when you\u2019re bruised by the World Cup experience it\u2019s good to feel wanted. When I met him he said: \u2018We could see how well England were doing when we played you. We could see the improvements.\u2019 With England we had a pretty good track record against Ireland.\u201d England beat Ireland four times out of five during Lancaster\u2019s tenure. Before we talk at Leinster\u2019s headquarters at University College Dublin, I watch Lancaster work with the squad. Even this snapshot underlines their cohesion. \u201cIt\u2019s different in England,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter A-levels many people in England go to university in a different city. In Dublin, if they go to university they stay in the city. So this group have gone to school together, played schools matches together, gone to university together, come through the academy together. The sense of identity and connection is incredible. Leinster have got more local players than any club I\u2019ve been involved in. When I first arrived I talked to players individually. I\u2019d say: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 Dublin. \u2018Where did you to go to university?\u2019 Dublin. \u2018Where would you like to go in the future?\u2019 They all wanted to stay in Dublin and play for Leinster.\u201d Rather than being parochial, Lancaster believes this strong bond is inspirational. \u201cThe cohesion, the sense of community, is huge. People often talk about Ireland having an advantage because they prioritise Europe over domestic competition. But people sometimes fail to recognise there are some great players here. If you had to pick a Lions team right now there would be quite a few players from Ireland in it.\u201d Last Saturday, when missing the injured Sexton, Leinster still dominated Toulouse, regarded as the form team in Europe, and won 29-13. The depth of their squad was obvious. \u201cWe like to think we can rest and rotate players and still win,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cWe\u2019re 19 points clear in our conference in the Pro14 \u2013 where there are lots of very good coaches. Dave Rennie, Richard Cockerill, Johann van Graan. It\u2019s a similar model to New Zealand where you\u2019ve got head coaches contracted to the Irish union. You\u2019ve also got players contracted to Ireland. For a country that\u2019s small in population it\u2019s the only way that you\u2019re going to make it work.\u201d Lancaster pauses when asked to compare his immersion in Leinster with the far more difficult year when he was out of work. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a sense of purpose without working full-time. You also spend all your time reflecting. For me my last game had been in the World Cup. All the stuff beforehand was erased. In everyone\u2019s mind it became very hard to look further back than the Australia and Wales games. You also think what comes next? How do you get out of the position you\u2019re in? A lot of national coaches often don\u2019t come back.\u201d How did he stop becoming depressed? \u201cI\u2019m pretty resilient. And getting out of England during the Six Nations in 2016 helped. I went to New Zealand, Australia and South Africa and it was great. It gave me some thinking time.\u201d Did he doubt himself? \u201cNo. But I felt pretty battered. The sense of responsibility for not achieving success weighed heavily on my shoulders. I was in charge of a national team at a home World Cup and we didn\u2019t achieve what we wanted. I was confident many things we did in the buildup went well. But 20 minutes of rugby changed everything.\u201d Lancaster is still grieving the loss of his father, who died unexpectedly last September, and he remembers how his dad was wounded by the World Cup. \u201cSome of the criticism levelled at me hurt him. But we have a great circle of friends, a very small community [around his parents\u2019 home in Cumbria]. They only knew me as Stuart \u2013 rather than the England head coach. So whenever I came home I was never treated differently.\u201d Had there been concerns about his dad before his death? \u201cNo, he was in fantastic health. I came off the training field and saw five missed calls from my brother. I knew that wasn\u2019t good. My dad had collapsed on the farm with a cardiac arrest. My mum rang 999. The officers were brilliant and talked her through CPR. But, because we\u2019re in a rural area, it took a while for the ambulance to come. Mum did an amazing job keeping him alive amid such trauma and the paramedics got his heart restarted. I got the first flight back to England. Obviously you go through the first few days in the hope he\u2019ll wake up, and say: \u2018What happened?\u2019 His heart and lungs were functioning but there was brain damage.

El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are accused of belonging to a group of Isis members, nicknamed the Beatles because of their British accents, responsible for killing a number of western captives. The pair, who have been stripped of their British citizenship, were captured in January last year, prompting a row over whether they should be returned to the UK for a trial or face justice in another jurisdiction. Elsheikh\u2019s mother, Maha Elgizouli, challenged a decision by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to share 600 witness statements gathered by the Metropolitan police with US authorities under a mutual legal assistance (MLA) agreement, without seeking assurances that the men would not be executed if they were extradited and tried there. However, her challenge was rejected on Friday by two high court judges, who ruled the decision was not unlawful. The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, sitting with Mr Justice Garnham, said: \u201cThere is no general, common law duty on Her Majesty\u2019s government to take positive steps to protect an individual\u2019s life from the actions of a third party, and that includes requiring particular undertakings before complying with the MLA request.\u201d Gareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce solicitors, which represented Elgizouli, said: \u201cThe court\u2019s decision is difficult for Ms Elgizouli to take onboard. \u201cMs Elgizouli hopes that the opportunity will be given for the supreme court to consider whether it has a greater ability to explore the important factors raised in the case she has brought. \u201cShe recognises that they have broader (and fundamental) consequences beyond the case she felt compelled to initiate. \u201cShe did so in the belief that if her son is accused, not that no prosecution should take place, but that any prosecution should respect the established protections that she has believed and still believes exist.\u201d During a hearing in October, Elgizouli\u2019s lawyers said Javid\u2019s decision, which was outlined in a letter to the then US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was \u201cunprecedented and unjustified\u201d and put the suspects at risk of an \u201cinhuman punishment\u201d. Kotey and Elsheikh, who were raised in the UK, are believed to be being detained by Kurdish forces in Syria. They are said to have been members of the cell that also included Mohammed Emwazi, known as \u201cJihadi John\u201d, who was killed in a US airstrike in 2015, and Aine Davis, who has been jailed in Turkey. Emwazi appeared in a number of videos in which hostages, including the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and the US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were killed. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them in the UK. After Elgizouli launched legal action, the Home Office announced in July that it had agreed to a short-term pause of the MLA process with the US. Javid faced intense criticism after the letter he wrote to Sessions was leaked, with MPs accusing him of breaching the UK\u2019s longstanding opposition to the death penalty. The government\u2019s former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile, said the move was \u201cextraordinary\u201d and a \u201cdramatic change of policy\u201d. Theresa May supported Javid\u2019s original decision, which was also backed by Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary. Commenting on the court\u2019s decision, Javid said: \u201cMy priority has always been to ensure we deliver justice for the victims\u2019 families and that the individuals suspected of these sickening crimes face prosecution as quickly as possible. \u201cOur longstanding opposition to the death penalty has not changed.

      "bodyText": "Editors of television programmes streamed on China\u2019s Netflix-like iQiyi site appear to be blurring the earlobes of male actors with earrings, according to web users in the country. Doctored images of male actors on a show called Sisters Flower Shop alongside earlier footage where they were sporting earrings have been posted online. In another show, I, Actor, the earlobes of the actor and singer J\u01d0ng B\u00f3r\u00e1n also appear to have been edited. A public relations officer at iQiyi told the website Sixth Tone that the company \u201chadn\u2019t received any instruction from the relevant department\u201d to edit footage of earrings worn by men. Earrings are common among male Chinese pop stars, actors and TV hosts. Two of China\u2019s best-known male pop stars, Kris Wu and Lu Han, who are former members of the Chinese-Korean boy band EXO, typically wear earrings. Over the past year, masculinity has become a subject of public debate. Some people have criticised popular Asian culture for encouraging effeminate standards of beauty for men. A 2018 article published by the state news agency Xinhua said China\u2019s pop idols were spawning a generation of \u201csissy boys\u201d. Web users criticised the blurred-out earrings, and thousands have commented on social media under the \u201cMaleTVStarsCantWearEarrings\u201d hashtag. One user said: \u201cThe whole world is moving forward, while China is moving backward.\u201dAnother said: \u201cDo earrings impede the core values of socialism?\u201d \u201cChina holds up these slogans of prosperity, democracy, freedom, equality \u2026 and yet people don\u2019t even have the right to choose what they wear. What a shame,\u201d another commenter said. Over the past year, Chinese platforms have increasingly begun to censor their content, as authorities crack down on \u201cvulgar\u201d material. Officials closed own 26,000 \u201cillegal\u201d websites and deleted 6 million posts last year, according to Xinhua. Earlier this month, regulators released a list of 100 types of video content that short-form video platforms should erase, including any material that promoted \u201cnon-mainstream views of love and marriage\u201d.",

Either Gillette must be struggling to believe their luck or their marketing bods have done a brilliant job creating a backlash to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gillette-metoo-ad-on-toxic-masculinity-cuts-deep-with-mens-rights-activists\">new advert</a> to send it viral. I\u2019ve watched it several times now and I\u2019m still struggling to see what all the fuss is about. It\u2019s basically just a slick sales pitch in which men are shown they can learn how to behave decently towards women and not bully each other, providing they shave regularly and don\u2019t grow beards. Hardly controversial you would have thought, but it\u2019s enough to have sent some rightwing organisations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/15/gillette-ad-not-pc-guff-piers-morgan-macho-stereotype-boys\">and Piers Morgan</a> into a meltdown.

He immediately announced he was boycotting all Gillette products because the advert was an affront to masculinity. Men should be allowed to be real men. Gillette must be gutted to lose his business. But it makes you wonder what kind of advert would make Morgan happy. Perhaps one where a man lies in bed while his wife gets the children up, before going to the bathroom where he farts loudly while shaving. He smiles, because that\u2019s the best a man can get.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/tory-remainers-second-referendum\">Are Tory remainers pondering a conscious uncoupling from the party?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the side-effects of getting older I had never anticipated is that significant anniversaries now come around with ever greater frequency, making almost every year a landmark in some way or other. Today while filling in a form, my wife and I suddenly realised we had been living in the same house for 25 years. Far longer than I have ever lived anywhere else, longer than our grownup son has been alive. By the time I was his age, my parents had moved house four times. Nor can I really ever imagine moving, other than to one of the care homes that keep sending me mailshots. Give it another 20 years and their persistence might pay off. But the unexpected anniversary has made us wonder if it was about time we had a house-warming party. Something we never got round to when we first moved in, partly because the house was in a bit of a state but mainly because we are instinctively lazy. And by the time the house was done up a bit, we didn\u2019t really fancy inviting friends round to mess it up. Besides we had two children who were more than capable of doing that by themselves. We did once have a party of sorts to celebrate our 51st birthdays \u2013 we had both been too depressed to do anything a year earlier for a joint 50th \u2013 but we now reckon it might be time to have another. All the stars are aligned. Not just the 25th anniversary but the fact that the house is back to looking almost as tatty as when we moved in. Largely thanks to the kids and the dog. Our friends can consider they have been put on notice. All we need to screw things up is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/07/uk-must-have-second-eu-referendum-chris-patten-tory\">second referendum</a> or a general election.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>The BBC has been criticised for continuing with its live coverage of the FA Cup third round replay between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/16/southampton-derby-fa-cup-third-round-replay-match-report\">Southampton and Derby</a> on BBC One and relegating the prime minister\u2019s statement outside Downing Street to BBC Two. In Westminster we thought we\u2019d all had enough of Theresa May earlier in the day during the damp squib of a no-confidence debate which everyone knew she was going to win. Her own opening speech had been a dismal, passionless affair in which she appeared to be making a good case for why she should resign and it was telling that the most passionate speaker in her defence was Michael Gove. And even he found time to take the piss out of her by describing her as \u201cinspirational\u201d. Once the no-confidence vote had been won, May made a short statement in the Commons, declaring she would be happy to engage in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/may-will-stick-to-brexit-principles-in-cross-party-talks-says-no-10\">talks with the leaders</a> of other parties. But only if they were happy to talk to her about the things she wanted to talk about: mostly about what kind of deal she could get for the DUP to continue to keep her in a job. It wasn\u2019t the most enticing of invitations. So when the lobby heard May was going to make a Downing Street statement at 10pm there was a mini-panic. Could it be she was going to do something dramatic, such as offering Corbyn a general election later in the year in return for Labour backing her deal? Er \u2026 no. Of course not. This was Theresa May. All she did was repeat what she had said earlier about talking to people about why she wasn\u2019t going to listen to them. The Beeb made exactly the right call.

The subtext to this is that everyone is supposed to marvel at how amazing you looked 10 years ago and/or how devastatingly wonderful you have now become in a more mature kind of way. It is obviously catnip for many narcissists and though I bow to no one in my narcissism \u2013 a few politicians excepted \u2013 it may not surprise you to know I won\u2019t be joining in. Largely because there are no photos of me from 2009 or 2019 in which I don\u2019t look either hideously moronic or just hideous. I\u2019ve even had people email to say they enjoy my writing, but could I do something about the byline picture? I\u2019ve had to explain that \u2013 much as I wish it were otherwise and struggle to accept it myself \u2013 I really do look like that and that it is far worse for me than it is for them. I also think the 10-year challenge is inherently flawed and a more interesting exercise would be to upload photos from every year as that way everyone can tell when things went really pear-shaped. My friends Simon and Olivia have patented the concept of \u201chaving the year\u201d. Rather than ageing gradually, they reckon most people look pretty much the same to the outside world for years on end. Then there comes a time when you haven\u2019t seen them for a while when you suddenly realise they have aged 10 years almost overnight. Think about it. You know it\u2019s true.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/13/david-cameron-and-art-of-blaming-other-people\">David Cameron and the art of blaming other people | David Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the bus to work, when I\u2019m not worrying about what potentially life-changing disaster the government has got lined up for the rest of the day, I often keep myself entertained trying to work out who has been the worst prime minister of the past 150 years. And it always comes down to the same two people. Theresa May or David Cameron. You might have thought that by now May would be edging it: after all, it takes a special kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/jan/06/trump-tweets-i-am-a-stable-genius-video\">genius</a> to trigger article 50 without having a clue what you want to do next, to call a snap election to give you a minority government, to impose unnecessary red lines on your Brexit negotiations, to be found in contempt of parliament, to lose a vote on your budget, to go down to the worst ever defeat in the Commons and still lack the basic skills to articulate whether you have a policy or not. But even after all this, Dave still gets the nod, both for his ideological pursuit of austerity and the thoughtless, casual way in which he has split the country for decades to come by calling a referendum that only a small minority of his own party wanted. I suspect he knows it, too. Though he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/so-what-is-david-cameron-really-doing-now\">breezes around</a> giving a pretty good impression of someone in denial, recent photos of him on holiday in Costa Rica capture a man who is tormented by his failure. That\u2019s why he has found it so hard to complete his memoirs in his \u00a325K shed. He\u2019s reached the point in his story where all his energies are directed at avoiding the unavoidable damning conclusion on himself.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Yet again, nothing has changed.

Friday On the bus to work, when I\u2019m not worrying about what potentially life-changing disaster the government has got lined up for the rest of the day, I often keep myself entertained trying to work out who has been the worst prime minister of the past 150 years. And it always comes down to the same two people. Theresa May or David Cameron. You might have thought that by now May would be edging it: after all, it takes a special kind of genius to trigger article 50 without having a clue what you want to do next, to call a snap election to give you a minority government, to impose unnecessary red lines on your Brexit negotiations, to be found in contempt of parliament, to lose a vote on your budget, to go down to the worst ever defeat in the Commons and still lack the basic skills to articulate whether you have a policy or not. But even after all this, Dave still gets the nod, both for his ideological pursuit of austerity and the thoughtless, casual way in which he has split the country for decades to come by calling a referendum that only a small minority of his own party wanted. I suspect he knows it, too. Though he breezes around giving a pretty good impression of someone in denial, recent photos of him on holiday in Costa Rica capture a man who is tormented by his failure. That\u2019s why he has found it so hard to complete his memoirs in his \u00a325K shed. He\u2019s reached the point in his story where all his energies are directed at avoiding the unavoidable damning conclusion on himself. Digested week, digested: Yet again, nothing has changed. As we were.",

Even though most diplomats have lived with Brexit throughout their posting \u2013 it has consumed more of their energy than they could ever have imagined, or probably wanted \u2013 one admitted this was not the time to be in the prediction business. The cautious characters of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, nervous of saying something that splits their parties, make the runes harder to read. One ambassador said: \u201cThe reality is there is no longer any interlocutor for Europe. It is not at present the prime minister. We have to wait until one emerges.\u201d Another confirmed: \u201cThere is nothing more that we can do with the deal ... There is nothing in reserve that anyone is holding back. There is no willingness to open everything up.\u201d Although the British logjam makes it easy for European diplomats to say the next step lies with Britain, the reality is more subtle. The EU has to make a judgment on whether the natural majority in the parliament to oppose a no-deal Brexit can assert itself. \u201cAt the moment both sides are waiting to see which blinks first, but others do not want to play such a dangerous game,\u201d said one observer. Precautions are clearly being stepped up for no deal, but many ambassadors are privately optimistic that they will not be needed. The initiatives from the Tory Nick Boles and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper to force a delay if there is no deal have encouraged diplomats to believe the natural majority in parliament tends towards a softer Brexit. One ambassador and close student of UK parliamentary procedure said: \u201cThe Speaker has changed the rules of the game and the balance of power. He may be bending the rules, but he seems to want to force the parliament to come to a view. If he had left this to roll on and on, Jacob Rees-Mogg will have got his way.\u201d Ambassadors seem keen to signal that they would respond if Boles succeeded in allowing parliament to vote to suspend article 50, so removing the 29 March deadline for the UK\u2019s departure. A diplomat said: \u201cIt must come from the UK parliament, but if it passes a simple bill to delay article 50, then that means no deal is off the table, and Europe, I am sure, will respond not flexibly, but super flexibly.\u201d The previous assumption that Europe would only accept deferral if there was a clear plan to hold a second referendum seems to be misplaced. The key issue is not the principle of the suspension, but its duration.

One diplomat suggested the UK\u2019s political parties could appoint MEPs to the new parliament for the interim, probably distributing the seats between the parties on the basis of the last 2014 European elections. \u201cSome federalists in the European parliament might object, but there is a bigger prize there.\u201d This diplomat claimed the democratic objections could be overridden in the interests of an orderly Brexit. As to the nature of the deal, only the political declaration is up for discussion, but one diplomat said he had been told as long as two years ago by a senior Whitehall official that the final resting place was likely to be a permanent customs union. A senior observer said: \u201cSuch an arrangement solves most problems, including the Democratic Unionist objections to the current deal, and has been on the table for a long time.

This final match more than the previous two exposed the limitations of this Australian team, and while the bowlers battled hard, India\u2019s batsmen always looked in control. The match only went as long as it did because that\u2019s how MS Dhoni likes to play, but it could have been over much earlier if he\u2019d had half a mind. </p> <p>Dhoni now averages 103.07 in winning run chases. Not out 46 times out of 73 in which he\u2019s batted. He\u2019s literally been there at the end two thirds of the time. He\u2019s more reliable than most of our parents. Another 87 not out tonight, and could have gunned for a hundred if he\u2019d wanted to attack more earlier, but it\u2019s not his way. <br></p> <p>But it\u2019s not just about the batting. Yuzvendra Chahal sat on the bench for the entire tour to date, got called up for the very last match, and promptly took 6-42 from his 10 overs. He got rid of each set middle-order batsman and was the reason Australia was restricted to 230.</p> <p>He\u2019s an unlikely looking athlete: slender, bespectacled, quietly spoken. But leg-spinners remain the great mystery of cricket, and Australia couldn\u2019t unpick his. India can be pretty confident ahead of the World Cup: they have a raft of bowling options, and most spots in the XI bar a couple of batting positions are decided. Dhoni has surely answered the biggest of those questions in this series.</p> <p>Dhoni is chatting to Brendon Julian at the post-match presentation. \u201cI\u2019m happy to bat any number. The important thing is where the team needs me. After 14 years I can\u2019t really say, \u2018I can\u2019t bat at six, I must bat at four or five.\u2019\u201d<br></p> <p>Now Kohli: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that easy a wicket to bat on, so we had to take it deep. Kuldeep we wanted to give him a little break, and he\u2019d played two games so we don\u2019t want to be too predictable. We\u2019ve been here for a long time, it\u2019s been an amazing tour for us. We drew the T20 series, won the Test series, won the ODI series. If someone had offered me those results I would have grabbed them with both hands.\u201d</p> <p>The team comes up to take the mirrored pointy trophy. I had a close-up look at that one in Sydney, it\u2019s dangerous. Can\u2019t take it on a plane, I\u2019m sure. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport/status/1083574287540224005\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This trophy is so advanced it features stealth cloaking technology. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AusvInd?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AusvInd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/n0JAOkM7Lv\">pic.twitter.com/n0JAOkM7Lv</a></p>&mdash; Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffLemonSport/status/1083574287540224005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The whole blue-clad outfit gets up on the podium and poses for their photos, and now they\u2019ll wander over to the boundary line to applaud the massed Indian fans who are waving flags and cheering.

Four on the fence on the leg side. I don\u2019t know about this. Is the field set for the yorker? Maybe, and Siddle does hit one of them, but he misses a couple too. Jadhav belts one that pitches too short over cover for four, then backs well away so he can jam a low full toss in the same direction for three. Dhoni slams the second-last ball <strong>down the ground for four</strong>. That\u2019s all but it, scores are level.

A full toss down the leg side costs him four. Dross, and bossed, Dhoni flicking four. Last ball of the over is a fully as well, this one wide of off, and Jadhav carves it behind point for the same result.</p> <p>The over is worth 13, and India need 14 from the last two.

Finch lets the catch burst through his fingers, and injures himself into the bargain. It was travelling at a rapid rate. He at least stopped it going for four, then the return nearly catches Jadhav at the non-striker\u2019s end. Stoinis collects the ball and knocks the stumps with his forearm, legitimately, but after a million replays the third umpire determines that Jadhav was in by a fraction when the stumps lit up. <br></p> <p>If we\u2019d had the 1000fps camera on that call, it might have been different, but on one frame he was out of his ground with the stumps intact, and on the other he was in with them broken.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T10:34:42.127Z\">at 10.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c41a966e4b00173154a6906\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T10:29:14.734Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>47th over: India 204-3 (Dhoni 74, Jadhav 46)</strong> Richardson the bowler Jadhav squats, digs a hole, squeezes one out. No, he\u2019s not having a moment to himself in the forest, he\u2019s defusing a yorker at ground level after initially shaping to sweep. Gets a run, the start of a picket fence sequence as they take one from each ball of the over. Jadhav nearly holes out off the fifth, sweeping again, but Maxwell sprinting in from deep midwicket sees the ball dip and drop short. <br></p> <p>Crowd number is 53,603.

Two more from a yorker squeezed out behind square leg, and Jadhav hits Siddle from behind as the batsman runs back for the second. A couple of singles follow.<br></p> <p>The over costs 11. A target of 44 off 30 has become 33 off 24. <br></p> <p>Lovely email in from Christopher MacLehose. \u201cComing to the end, one way or the other, of India in Australia, so just time to thank you and your brilliant colleagues for a vastly pleasurable coverage of the Tests too.

One more over until his day is complete, and Dhoni has decided to see him off. Forward defence, forward defence. The crowd jeers, or cheers?

Can\u2019t get enough pace across the turf though, so Stanlake is able to put in a fine chase and slide from deep cover point where he\u2019s stationed. Dhoni, from the next five balls, can\u2019t get Zampa away. Blot, blot. Eventually Zampa feels sorry for him and bowls a half-tracker, but Dhoni only pulls it into this thigh pad for a dot ball.

A <strong>terrible</strong> mix-up from the opening pair, Carey prodding to point, Finch sent back when the vice-captain realised it was Jadeja - as you do. The throw looked on target but bounced just over the woodwork, the skipper again saved from walking off without scoring. As an omen, it was on this ground during the 2013 World Cup against England in the tournament opener that he was dropped at square leg for nothing, going on to make a big hundred. Earlier, Carey struck the first boundary of the afternoon, taking Shami\u2019s short ball through midwicket over the circle. \u201cI really want a drone,\u201d says Shane Warne on telly. \u201cThere are many options that you can use it for.\u201d My mind, it is boggled.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c414025e4b0197a614f53fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T02:57:43.309Z\">2.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: Australia 1-0 (Carey 1, Finch 0)</strong> Inches away from a duck for Finch!

      "bodyText": "The same scoreline as the Tests, in the end, as India make this an unbeaten tour across all three formats. This final match more than the previous two exposed the limitations of this Australian team, and while the bowlers battled hard, India\u2019s batsmen always looked in control. The match only went as long as it did because that\u2019s how MS Dhoni likes to play, but it could have been over much earlier if he\u2019d had half a mind. Dhoni now averages 103.07 in winning run chases. Not out 46 times out of 73 in which he\u2019s batted. He\u2019s literally been there at the end two thirds of the time. He\u2019s more reliable than most of our parents. Another 87 not out tonight, and could have gunned for a hundred if he\u2019d wanted to attack more earlier, but it\u2019s not his way. But it\u2019s not just about the batting. Yuzvendra Chahal sat on the bench for the entire tour to date, got called up for the very last match, and promptly took 6-42 from his 10 overs. He got rid of each set middle-order batsman and was the reason Australia was restricted to 230. He\u2019s an unlikely looking athlete: slender, bespectacled, quietly spoken. But leg-spinners remain the great mystery of cricket, and Australia couldn\u2019t unpick his. India can be pretty confident ahead of the World Cup: they have a raft of bowling options, and most spots in the XI bar a couple of batting positions are decided. Dhoni has surely answered the biggest of those questions in this series. Dhoni is chatting to Brendon Julian at the post-match presentation. \u201cI\u2019m happy to bat any number. The important thing is where the team needs me. After 14 years I can\u2019t really say, \u2018I can\u2019t bat at six, I must bat at four or five.\u2019\u201d Now Kohli: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that easy a wicket to bat on, so we had to take it deep. Kuldeep we wanted to give him a little break, and he\u2019d played two games so we don\u2019t want to be too predictable. We\u2019ve been here for a long time, it\u2019s been an amazing tour for us. We drew the T20 series, won the Test series, won the ODI series. If someone had offered me those results I would have grabbed them with both hands.\u201d The team comes up to take the mirrored pointy trophy. I had a close-up look at that one in Sydney, it\u2019s dangerous. Can\u2019t take it on a plane, I\u2019m sure. The whole blue-clad outfit gets up on the podium and poses for their photos, and now they\u2019ll wander over to the boundary line to applaud the massed Indian fans who are waving flags and cheering. Great turnout tonight, great atmosphere. Australia have more questions than answers out of tonight, but I\u2019ll write on those overnight and put up a proper article for you in the morning, Australian time. For now, it\u2019s farewell from the Australian end of the OBO \u2013 for all of six days, until we start up against another blue-clad subcontinental team in Brisbane, where Sri Lanka will start their brief Test tour. Plenty of interest for both teams, given Australia\u2019s current weakness and Sri Lanka\u2019s ability to punch above their weight at times last year away from home. We\u2019ll see you there. 49.2 overs: India 234-3 (Dhoni 87, Jadhav 61) The field is up, and stops the first shot, but next time Jadhav slots Stoinis over mid-on for four. 49th over: India 230-3 (Dhoni 87, Jadhav 57) Four in the ring on the off side for Siddle. Four on the fence on the leg side. I don\u2019t know about this. Is the field set for the yorker? Maybe, and Siddle does hit one of them, but he misses a couple too. Jadhav belts one that pitches too short over cover for four, then backs well away so he can jam a low full toss in the same direction for three. Dhoni slams the second-last ball down the ground for four. That\u2019s all but it, scores are level. And Dhoni has done what he loves: taken the match into the final over. 48th over: India 217-3 (Dhoni 82, Jadhav 50) The drop from Finch costs Stoinis two runs from his first ball. A full toss down the leg side costs him four. Dross, and bossed, Dhoni flicking four. Last ball of the over is a fully as well, this one wide of off, and Jadhav carves it behind point for the same result. The over is worth 13, and India need 14 from the last two. Easy. We\u2019re seeing lots of frames. Dhoni pulls Richardson, hard, but straight at mid-off. Finch lets the catch burst through his fingers, and injures himself into the bargain. It was travelling at a rapid rate. He at least stopped it going for four, then the return nearly catches Jadhav at the non-striker\u2019s end. Stoinis collects the ball and knocks the stumps with his forearm, legitimately, but after a million replays the third umpire determines that Jadhav was in by a fraction when the stumps lit up. If we\u2019d had the 1000fps camera on that call, it might have been different, but on one frame he was out of his ground with the stumps intact, and on the other he was in with them broken. 47th over: India 204-3 (Dhoni 74, Jadhav 46) Richardson the bowler Jadhav squats, digs a hole, squeezes one out. No, he\u2019s not having a moment to himself in the forest, he\u2019s defusing a yorker at ground level after initially shaping to sweep. Gets a run, the start of a picket fence sequence as they take one from each ball of the over. Jadhav nearly holes out off the fifth, sweeping again, but Maxwell sprinting in from deep midwicket sees the ball dip and drop short. Crowd number is 53,603. Good for an ODI these days. India need 27 in 18 balls. 46th over: India 198-3 (Dhoni 71, Jadhav 43) Siddle returns, and it does not work out. Two wides down leg, either side of a ball that Jadhav slams down the ground for four. Airborne and just to the left of mid-off, but there\u2019s no catch. Two more from a yorker squeezed out behind square leg, and Jadhav hits Siddle from behind as the batsman runs back for the second. A couple of singles follow. The over costs 11. A target of 44 off 30 has become 33 off 24. Lovely email in from Christopher MacLehose. \u201cComing to the end, one way or the other, of India in Australia, so just time to thank you and your brilliant colleagues for a vastly pleasurable coverage of the Tests too. Anent your reference to Sam Beckett in the last Test, as you might not know, he was at Lord\u2019s one first day of a Test with John Calder his publisher and one other: glorious sunlit day, the outfield mown to perfection, the game on a knife-edge, one of his companions said: it makes you grateful to be alive. Beckett said: I wouldn\u2019t go so far as that. Warm wishes from frozen France.\u201d 45th over: India 187-3 (Dhoni 70, Jadhav 35) Single, single, then Dhoni blocks Stoinis. He\u2019s faced 100 balls now \u2013 how many have been dots? Not the 101st, as Dhoni pulls it very fine, and Stanlake\u2019s dive can only richochet it into a different part of the rope. That was almost another three. CricViz analysts have confirmed my suspicion from earlier: this match has had the most threes of any ODI at the MCG since 1999. I mean, my suspicion wasn\u2019t that specific. I just thought there had been lots. 44th over: India 179-3 (Dhoni 64, Jadhav 33) Zampa. He\u2019s been tidy. He\u2019s looked decent. He\u2019s conceded 33 runs from nine overs. But he hasn\u2019t been a wicket-taking threat today. One more over until his day is complete, and Dhoni has decided to see him off. Forward defence, forward defence. The crowd jeers, or cheers? I think they\u2019re enjoying the ridiculousness, as Dhoni blocks a third, a fourth, a fifth. Finally he helps a single round the corner. One run from the 44th over of an ODI. Absurd. Zampa ends with 0-34, meaning Australia\u2019s specialist spinners didn\u2019t take a wicket in this three-match series. 43rd over: India 178-3 (Dhoni 63, Jadhav 33) Good bowling. Stoinis jags one in, takes the edge of Dhoni\u2019s bat and nearly chops on to the stumps. Dhoni takes a couple more balls to compose himself, then chops away to third man for a three. 53 off 42. 42nd over: India 173-3 (Dhoni 59, Jadhav 32) Just the two singles from Richardson\u2019s over, five of those balls to Dhoni with the DRS review in the middle. India need 58 from 48. Struck on the pad by Richardson... No inside edge but probably too high, after the ball beat the batsman\u2019s defensive stab on the back foot. And so it proves. Clearing the bails, just. Australia had to, this game has almost slipped away entirely. 41st over: India 171-3 (Dhoni 58, Jadhav 31) Six from the Zampa over in risk-free style. This more positive MSD is great to watch. Finds a brace with some good running, along with four singles. There\u2019s a brilliant sunset breaking out over the MCG as well. 40th over: India 165-3 (Dhoni 54, Jadhav 29) Stanlake may be tiring, as Jadhav milks him effectively. A couple here, a couple there. India need 66 off 60. Amod Paranjape emails in. \u201cThreat of spin. Is the Australian World cup opener against Afghanistan going to result in a huge upset?\u201d It\u2019s not beyond the realm. Australia can\u2019t play the slow stuff well in this format at the moment. And every other team in the world is tending to load their line-ups with at least a couple of specialists, while Australia sometimes goes without one at all. Things could get ugly for the green and gold in England come June. 39th over: India 159-3 (Dhoni 53, Jadhav 24) The runs are back to flowing as Stoinis takes the ball. A wide, a top edge from Dhoni for a couple, then Jadhav slots a full ball straight down the ground for four. Mid-on was up so the batsman went over him. Nine from the over. It was always likely to prove the case but Australia just didn\u2019t get enough... 38th over: India 150-3 (Dhoni 50, Jadhav 19) Better over from Stanlake, pinning Jadhav down for a while and conceding three singles. But the last of those takes MSD to a half-century. Wrap your head around this: he has seventy ODI fifties. That\u2019s ridiculous. Though now somebody will probably start potting him for conversion rates. 37th over: India 147-3 (Dhoni 48, Jadhav 18) Three singles from Stoinis, then the last ball of the over sees Jadhav have a wild mow. It takes a top edge over Carey for four. 36th over: India 140-3 (Dhoni 46, Jadhav 13) Not quite the over of control Australia wanted from Stanlake. Another wide, and Dhoni gets him away through cover for another three. India firming with each over that goes by. 35th over: India 133-3 (Dhoni 42, Jadhav 11) Look out, Dhoni has the lid off against Zampa. He\u2019ll remove his headwear at the drop of a hat. And when hats drop in this town, he means business. He takes his hat off like any other man: but when his hat is off, he wins run chases. You bet. Kohli is the more aggressive and still probably the more impulsive. Dhoni averages 49.9 in run chases in one-dayers. In winning run chases, he averages 99.85. And out of 72 times he\u2019s batted in a winning run chase, he\u2019s been there at the end 45 times. 34th over: India 129-3 (Dhoni 39, Jadhav 10) Stanlake to Jadhav, a couple of dots to start. We have 100 balls left in the innings now, and 108 runs required. So Australia have narrowed then inverted that gap, and can definitely still bring pressure to bear. Another wicket, a few more quiet overs, either would make things difficult. Jadav blocks out a yorker for a run. Dhoni shuffles and pulls one more. Stands at the non-striker\u2019s end wrapping and re-wrapping the velcro on his gloves, then watches Jadhav lean back and crack a cut shot for four. 102 needed from 96. 33rd over: India 123-3 (Dhoni 38, Jadhav 5) Zampa nearly slides through onto Jadhav\u2019s stumps, but the batsman gets down just in time. Then he drops to one knee to slog two runs wide of long-on. 32nd over: India 120-3 (Dhoni 38, Jadhav 2) Four balls for Jadhav to get away from Richardson, pulling a short ball for a single. Another short ball is called wide, and another. Just the one run from the bat in that eight-ball over though. Abhijato Sensarma emails in. \u201cWith the Australian tour drawing to a close, I would like to say that for the away Indian matches, it has been heartening to see the new Indian broadcasters (Sony Network) have been more involved in proper analysis and decent opinions along with less affinity for the theatrics compared to the channel which broadcasts matches played in India. \u201cAlong with the presence of people like Sunil Gavaskar who have strong opinions yet not an imposing personality, and Harsha Bhogle between the shared commentary box and radio calling, the experts\u2019 opinions have been pleasant to hear. I hear the same has happened in Australia. After a long lull where muting the telly was more entertaining than listening to India\u2019s home \u2018experts\u2019, is this the period of the Experts\u2019 Renaissance?\u201d One can only hope so. The monotony of every broadcast being entirely staffed by former cricketers, with plenty lacking the facility to make good broadcasters, is so far below par. Hopefully the recent trend towards some level of balance is maintained and increased. 31st over: India 117-3 (Dhoni 38, Jadhav 1) Stanlake is immediately back to try to rough up the new batsman Kedar Jadhav. He does alright though, blocking a couple and getting off strike. 30th over: India 113-3 (Dhoni 35) Finally! Australia land the biggest fish! He\u2019s been wrestling at the end of the line all night but now he\u2019s on the deck. Richardson got him in Sydney. Now Richardson bowls wide outside off, just back of a length. Kohli steps into it and drives, but again the bounce is too much, taking the edge high on the blade and Carey moves across. Richardson is pumped up, he\u2019s found an edge over the best on the planet. That was the last ball of the over, one ball after Richardson had drawn a thicker edge for a couple of runs to third man. 29th over: India 109-2 (Kohli 43, Dhoni 34) Streaky from Dhoni! He charges Siddle and aims to spank one over cover. Instead he gets a top edge over the keeper. Dhoni whips around to see where it\u2019s gone, but gets to see it elude Carey\u2019s glove by a couple of feet. Undeterred, Dhoni charges again, and this time Siddle cuts the ball back through him between bat and body and it\u2019s a dot ball. Was that an inside edge? Maxwell appealed from point. Siddle asked politely. Carey shrugged and said no. But Hot Spot picks up the faintest gleam of a nick as the ball passes blade. Goodness me. They could have overturned that. Are we up to five chances given to Kohli and Dhoni tonight? 28th over: India 104-2 (Kohli 42, Dhoni 30) Jhye Richardson returns, and he\u2019s on the mark immediately. Nice tight line around the off stump, red-ball bowling. Dhoni does some red-ball batting, blocking out a maiden. Time on their side, he\u2019s happy to wait. 27th over: India 104-2 (Kohli 42, Dhoni 30) Desperation running from Dhoni, and this time I think he\u2019s gauged one right. Walks at Siddle, stabs the ball straight down to mid-on, but correctly gauges that he\u2019s far enough down the wicket already that he\u2019ll make it, and that Kohli without that start will be running to the safe end. They make it, Shaun Marsh flat on his face after underarming at the stumps from close range. Dhoni adds three through midwicket later in the over. Run-outs aside, I\u2019ve been on Kohli Average Watch. And with a single to move to 42, his ODI average goes back to 60. 26th over: India 98-2 (Kohli 40, Dhoni 26) Dhoni still unsure against Zampa. Three balls for a single this time, while Kohli faces the other three balls in the over to score 2, 1, 1. 25th over: India 93-2 (Kohli 36, Dhoni 25) It\u2019s pretty much an India home game at the MCG tonight. The bottom bays everywhere bar the Members are decked out in blue with tri-colour flags waving. They simmer as Dhoni flicks Siddle for two, then heave as Dhoni pulls him for four. The former skipper has a better balance in working runs so far tonight, as opposed to Sydney in Game 1 where he soaked up something like 60 dot balls out of 90 faced. We\u2019re at the halfway mark. 150 balls left, and only 123 runs needed. India\u2019s game to lose, but Australia can still get into it. 24th over: India 85-2 (Kohli 35, Dhoni 18) Zampa keeping the brakes on against Dhoni: four balls for one single. Kohli tries to beat cover but Maxwell goes flying across to slap down the ball, wanting to make up for that earlier lapse in the field. 23rd over: India 83-2 (Kohli 34, Dhoni 17) So many jitters out on that field. Dhoni tries to calm them by walking at Stoinis and swatting him back past mid-on for four. A straight-bat swat, a back-foot drive while leaning back for power to a length ball. 22nd over: India 78-2 (Kohli 33, Dhoni 13) And they\u2019ve nearly done it again, India. Nearly cocked it up between the wickets. Kohli jams out to backward point and is watching the ball, so he doesn\u2019t see Dhoni come three quarters of the way down the pitch. Kohli goes back before Dhoni can come through, so Dhoni turns back as well. A throw to the bowler would have him cold, but Khawaj goes to the keeper first, who relays to Zampa, who fumbles the half-volley but flicks it back to the stumps expertly. Even with a clean take, Dhoni would have been just back in his ground. 21st over: India 76-2 (Kohli 32, Dhoni 12) Down to mid-off from Dhoni, and Australia miss a run-out! Oh, come off it. Virat Kohli, the hardest batsman in the world to dismiss in this format, almost gave his wicket away. Offered it up. Dhoni clunked straight to the field and took a couple of steps. I don\u2019t know if Kohli was just responding to that cue, but he started down the wicket as well, then had to turn back. He was so far out of his ground that he gave up and just watched the throw from mid-off. But Richardson scuffed it into the dirt and wide of the stumps on the bounce. Had more time than he realised. So Australia have given up two chances to dismiss Kohli and one for Dhoni so far. Defending 230. No bueno. 20th over: India 73-2 (Kohli 32, Dhoni 9) There\u2019s another three. Zampa, short, and Kohli is back in a flash to drop his knees wide and carve his cut shot behind point. Can\u2019t get enough pace across the turf though, so Stanlake is able to put in a fine chase and slide from deep cover point where he\u2019s stationed. Dhoni, from the next five balls, can\u2019t get Zampa away. Blot, blot. Eventually Zampa feels sorry for him and bowls a half-tracker, but Dhoni only pulls it into this thigh pad for a dot ball. So Zampa generously dishes up a big full toss outside off... and Dhoni carves it to the one outfielder on that side of the wicket for a single. A battle of courtesies. 19th over: India 69-2 (Kohli 29, Dhoni 8) You don\u2019t see a lot of threes in ODI cricket these days, but they\u2019re flowing tonight with the field up and the outfield slow. Fine leg, deep midwicket, third man are the only three back for Dhoni against Stoinis. Dhoni gets his three through cover. 18th over: India 65-2 (Kohli 28, Dhoni 5) That looks good from Dhoni, driving Stanlake for three. Gets the strike back, and can-cans across the stumps with a Moulin Rouge kick in order to pull a short ball just past short midwicket for a single. 17th over: India 60-2 (Kohli 27, Dhoni 1) Now what\u2019s this? What\u2019s this? Here comes MS Dhoni batting at No4. Rohit Sharma called for him to come up the order. Dhoni is in the role his teammate suggested. Can he do something with it after finishing off the chase in Adelaide? First ball, he\u2019s dropped! Calamity again for Australia. And it\u2019s Maxwell, normally the best set of hands in the side, who takes miracle snares out at deep midwicket. This time it\u2019s a simple one at backward point, a cut shot straight to him, and somehow the ball goes in and pops out. Maxwell and Stoinis both have anguish on their faces. There\u2019s been so much focus on Maxwell\u2019s position in this team and the Test side that perhaps it\u2019s thrown off his concentration. The very next ball, Stoinis hits the pad and goes up in a huge appeal! Not out. Then Dhoni gets off the mark with an edge to third man. What an over from the all-rounder. Stoinis strikes with his second ball! A nothing push at the ball from Dhawan, spliced it straight back at the bowler who snares it in his follow-through and then hurls the ball way up into the air in celebration. Dhawan has been out there for a while, pottered along at a strike rate of 50, and now has given it up tamely. 16th over: India 57-1 (Dhawan 21, Kohli 27) Now Dhawan tries to take on Billy Stanlake, but miscues the pull for a single. Kohli pulls the next straight down to mid-on, which is unorthodox. Billy pitches up and draws a defensive shot. Kohli then works a couple round the corner. If anyone was confused by the King of Geelong line, this is what happens from spending too much time with Adam Collins. 15th over: India 54-1 (Dhawan 20, Kohli 25) Zampa calms things down at the other end with an over featuring three singles. 14th over: India 51-1 (Dhawan 18, Kohli 24) You can beat Kohli once. You can beat Kohli twice. But it doesn\u2019t often happen a third time. Stanlake tries for the same short ball that has done the Indian captain, but this time Kohli rattles it through cover for four! Cut shot in front of square, and the field has been slow today but that one flew. A couple of balls later, short on a different line, and Kohli nails the pull for four more! Fast, fierce, and the batsman taking it on. This is top entertainment. Kohli has already overtaken his teammate\u2019s score. 13th over: India 43-1 (Dhawan 18, Kohli 16) Adam Zampa comes on, a little neat blond feller with a lime-green headband to top off his retro uniform. Great areas without a ball bowled. Four singles from his first, as the Indian batsmen ease into his spell as comfortably as a warm bath. 12th over: India 39-1 (Dhawan 16, Kohli 14) Stanlake is going up the gears, hitting 145 after starting at 138. Kohli taps the third ball to mid-off and judges the single alright, even though Aaro Finch throuws down the stumps direct. But looked very keen to escape the strike, the batsman. Dhawan gives it immediately back, and then Kohli is dropped! Kohli is dropped at first slip! And reprives don\u2019t come any bigger. That was lovely from Stanlake, brutish and lovely. He gave that ball everything, got sizzling bounce just outside off. Kohli was trying to steer away but again the ball had too much for him. It took the top corner of the bat, perhaps a bit of glove, and flew towards slip. Handscomb got his hands up, the ball was just above his head but moving fast. And in the end Handscomb could only tip it over the bar for four runs to third man. No justice in this game. 11th over: India 33-1 (Dhawan 15, Kohli 9) Maxwell on to bowl in the 11th over. Interesting. Leg-spinner Adam Zampa is the only specialist slow bowler in the team. Maxwell is quite animated as Kohli glances to fine leg, where Stanlake was perhaps a bit slow to get around and a bit square to start with. The bowler calls instructions. Then again he has his hand over his mouth as Kohli drives to mid-on, perhaps thinking that wasn\u2019t far way from being chipped up. Dhawan cuts a couple to point and keeps building. 10th over: India 26-1 (Dhawan 12, Kohli 5) This guy can go super fast though. Here comes Big Billy, the King of Geelong. Billy Stanlake has been scorching them down in the nets but hasn\u2019t played in this series yet. Now he\u2019s into the XI while Jason Behrendorff gets a rest with a back twinge. And he tests Kohli out nicely: yorker jammed out, short ball blocked, another shorty that Kohli tries to cut but is done in by the bounce, the ball zipping over his bat. Lovely stuff. Eventually Kohli steers a single away. 9th over: India 25-1 (Dhawan 12, Kohli 4) Richardson is enjoying his day so far, just a dozen runs from his five overs. Two singles from this one. He\u2019s been brisk but not super fast, around the 140 mark. 8th over: India 23-1 (Dhawan 11, Kohli 3) Dhawan is into his stride now, harvesting ones and twos from Siddle with relative ease. Kohli\u2019s first shot isn\u2019t exactly what he intended, spanging the ball away in the air through cover, though it gains him three runs. Tough to time on this pitch, it seems. 7th over: India 16-1 (Dhawan 7, Kohli 0) Whew, listen to the ovation as Kohli comes to the crease. Big crowd in at the MCG and they\u2019re giving it the big ones. He sees out most of Richardson\u2019s over without troubling the scorers. \u201cGood afternoon Geoff,\u201d writes Mahendra Killedar from somewhere where it\u2019s the afternoon. \u201c230 is vintage stuff. Can I order a hard-fought low scoring humdinger please?\u201d You can now. 6th over: India 15-1 (Dhawan 5) Siddle bowls his first bad ball, and Rohit plays the drop-kick again, over square leg with a bit more timing, and despite plugging in the slow outfield this shot trickles and ambles and meanders into the rope at last. But Siddle has the final chuckle, last ball of the over. Some seam movement again, squares him up as Rohit tries to go across the line, and it ends up in the hands of Shaun Marsh at slip. 5th over: India 10-0 (Rohit 5, Dhawan 5) The field is up, and twice the batsmen find a gap and get back for three. Rohit drop-kicking one over square leg, Dhawan slashing through point. Neither shot was quite controlled as they try to adjust to this surface. 4th over: India 4-0 (Rohit 2, Dhawan 2) Siddle is looking good today. His kind of conditions. Cloudy, humid, sticky. Probably this pitch is tacky as well, if Melbourne is Melbourne. After cutting the ball in to beat the right-handed Rohit last over, he cuts the other way to beat Dhawan in this over. Past the inside edge and not far past the stumps. Just a Rohit single from the first ball for Siddle. 3rd over: India 3-0 (Rohit 1, Dhawan 2) Richardson errs once in the over, on the leg stump, and Dhawan middles a glance for two. Other than that, he plays each ball to the off-side field. That\u2019s the luxury of chasing a small total, you can take your time to get set. Dhawan likes playing in his adopted home town, made a World Cup century here in 2015 if I recall correctly. 2nd over: India 1-0 (Rohit 1, Dhawan 0) It\u2019s a maiden for Siddle with that review in the middle. Hey diddle diddle. Siddle gets Finch to go upstairs after hitting the back pad. Good ball, it cut into Rohit and beat his inside edge. DRS says it\u2019s smashing middle stump, but just enough of the ball is above the stump line to qualify for umpire\u2019s call on height. Australia keep the review, India keep the batsman. 1st over: India 1-0 (Rohit 1, Dhawan 0) Jhye Richardson will commence formalities with the ball, from the Great Southern Stand end. He\u2019s on the money, and the Indian opening pair is happy to go quietly through his over. Hello friends. Australia continue to underwhelm with the bat this summer, which is nothing new. It\u2019s a sticky dull sort of evening, still plenty of daylight, and now the bowlers in gold have to come up with something special. Fantastic bowling. India deserved to take all ten Australian wickets with all the chances they created from start to end. Only when Kohli raced through 13 overs with his part-timers at the conclusion of the power play did Australia score with ease, albeit almost exclusively in singles. Chahal was held back but when he came on in the 24th over it was the beginning of the end for the hosts as far as a big tally was concerned, both Marsh and Khawaja removed in the leggie\u2019s first over. When Handscomb was joined by Maxwell they threatened to get on top again but that didn\u2019t last long, the latter top-edging a bouncer that didn\u2019t get up. The Victorian captain top collected a tidy half-century and did the best he could with the lower order (adding 45 with Richardson), but the damage was largely done. After coming so close to knocking off India to win the series in Adelaide on Tuesday, the home side only have 230 to play with after the dinner break. With the power and nous Kohli\u2019s side have through their batting list, that should be nowhere near enough. For the chase, stick with Geoff Lemon. Bye for now! Chahal speaks! \u201cThis is an amazing feeling. I have been playing this game after so long and this is my first match in Australia. Obviously, when you contribute for your team with my second five-wicket haul, it is such a great feeling.\u201d Shami deserved a second wicket to finish it off, his full delivery to Stanlake sneaking through and smashing into his leg stump. Australia fall eight balls short of batting out their overs, leaving India just 231 to win the series. 48th over: Australia 229-9 (Siddle 9, Stanlake 0) What a spell from Yuzvendra Chahal, 10-0-42-6 his final figures. Kohli didn\u2019t bring him into the side until the decider and held him back today while the left handers were building. But he picked up both of those the space of four balls and that was just the start of it, finishing with the best bowling for an Indian at the MCG in an ODI. Lovely work. CHAHAL HAS SIX! Zampa danced at the spinner, trying to smash him over his head but didn\u2019t get enough of it, Shankar taking the easy chance down at long-on. He has two balls left to make that a very rare ODI 7-for! 47th over: Australia 227-8 (Zampa 8, Siddle 7) Siddle off the mark with a hit-and-run push to Kohli at cover, which would have left him several metres short had the Indian skipper nailed the direct hit. Back on strike due to the overthrow, Siddle gets low and lifts Shami over the slips for four! Clever from the veteran. Quite superb wrist spin from Chahal, picking up his fifth with a wonderful toppie that Handscomb missed from deep in the crease, the ball on track for middle stump when it struck his back pad. He went upstairs because he had no choice as the final recognised batsman. Very, very out. 46th over: Australia 219-8 (Zampa 7) 45th over: Australia 216-7 (Handscomb 58, Zampa 4) You can\u2019t ask for more much more than that from the new man Zampa, scoring from each ball he has faced so far, Handscomb adding a couple down the ground and three in the gap to midwicket. Nine off the Bhuvi over. Will Handscomb try and take down Chahal? 44th over: Australia 207-7 (Handscomb 52, Zampa 1) Zampa is off the mark with a single to square leg, keeping the strike. It is not for nothing that the South Australian does have nine professional half-centuries to his name. That\u2019s four for the leggie! On the leg stump line, Richardson mistimes a clip in the direction of Jadhav at midwicket to completes the diving chance. The end of a productive 45-run union. 43rd over: Australia 205-6 (Handscomb 51, Richardson 16) A balletic error on the rope, Jadeja leaping over the diving sub Rayudu, but they can\u2019t keep the ball off the rope, giving Richardson his first boundary down to fine leg. The West Australian is growing in confidence, striking the final ball sweetly for two more to deep cover. The modern game is such that all of these young quicks can bat a bit. 42nd over: Australia 197-6 (Handscomb 50, Richardson 9) Chahal probably won\u2019t bowl out his ten but he is every chance to pick up five, back now for a crack from the Great Southern Stand End. Both batsmen are now hitting the sweepers well enough, Handscomb\u2019s feet and wrists in concert, but boundaries are going to be hard to come by without a fair degree of risk. With a second single down the ground, Handscomb moves to his third ODI 50, getting there in 57 balls. It\u2019s hard to fault the way he has played over the last week, now a big chance to go to the World Cup - even with Smith and Warner back into the mix. 41st over: Australia 193-6 (Handscomb 48, Richardson 7) It says a lot about how good India\u2019s seam attack was during the Test series that Bhuvi could not get a start. He\u2019s so accurate, always moving the ball around off the seam, very hard to get away. It takes Handscomb three attempts to get him down the ground, Richardson playing a nice flick to midwicket, Handscomb keeping the strike with a glide through the vacant cordon. Bhuvi\u2019s current analysis: 7-1-19-2. 40th over: Australia 190-6 (Handscomb 46, Richardson 6) Handscomb takes Shankar on over midwicket and finds the gap, giving him his second boundary. He\u2019s giving himself every chance to put the foot down in this final ten, provided Richardson - who is looking solid - can stuck around for the bulk of them. 39th over: Australia 182-6 (Handscomb 39, Richardson 6) Bhuvi\u2019s back and making very difficult work of it for Handscomb then Richardson, the latter beaten with a beauty that deserves to kiss his outside edge, the off stump or both. 38th over: Australia 181-6 (Handscomb 38, Richardson 6) Shankar, the man on debut, is back with his accurate medium pacers. I miss the days when the ODI game had space for one seamer sending them down at this far more gentle speed. Indeed, Tim Wigmore wrote a nice piece about this. He does the trick here, going for three singles, making 0/15 from his five. 37th over: Australia 178-6 (Handscomb 36, Richardson 5) Shami\u2019s short balls to Maxwell varied in bounce, so he is right to have a pop at Handscomb and Richardson too, both scoring behind the wicket. A nice clip from the Victorian captain follows for two, Richardson finishing with a fine cover drive for two as well. 36th over: Australia 171-6 (Handscomb 32, Richardson 2) Jadeja goes again, now into his ninth on the bounce. Handscomb continues to tick over, albeit with a boundary from the outside edge on this occasion. But he\u2019s hitting the sweepers well and using his feet confidently. Richardson does likewise, getting his first runs. 35th over: Australia 162-6 (Handscomb 25, Richardson 0) Australia\u2019s final four batsmen average single digits in this form of the game. Uh oh. BHUVI! What a wonderful catch! Shami is back and has successfully won Maxwell\u2019s top edge. He got away with something similar earlier in the over but the second didn\u2019t get up, flying down to fine leg off the edge but with a lot of work to do for the fielder, a task that Bhuvi was up to with an athletic forward dive. Fantastic work from Kohli as well to back in his fast bowler to make the big breakthrough. If they weren\u2019t before, Australia are in real strife now. 34th over: Australia 153-5 (Handscomb 21, Maxwell 22) Maxwell is changing this game of cricket, flogging the full toss that comes early from Chahal then driving him superbly to finish, getting down the pitch and splitting the gap between the sweepers at deep cover. A glorious shot to push back against the man who has had the Australians\u2019 measure from the moment he came to the bowling crease. 11 off it. \u201cHe\u2019s got too much of a gift,\u201d Michael Vaughan says of the flaw of Maxwell batting seven, noting that the rest of the world will be very happy he isn\u2019t higher up. 33rd over: Australia 142-5 (Handscomb 19, Maxwell 13) Maxwell smashes another half tracker, this time coming from Jadeja. Our list of \u2018Do Nots\u2019 from earlier? Do Not bowl short to Maxwell if you are a spinner. In response, Shane Warne says that Maxwell brings, before a ball is bowled, the fear factor. \u201cThey know what he is capable of, and I think when you have Khawaja, Marsh and Handscomb together you can bowl to those guys. But Maxwell brings the fear factor. Who would you rather bowl to? The guys who they can contain runs with. That\u2019s why I think they made a mistake batting Maxwell at seven.\u201d 32nd over: Australia 135-5 (Handscomb 17, Maxwell 8) Handscomb lucky! He completely miscues Chahal, edging him high up to midwicket but Shankar, running back with the flight, cannot make it in time despite his best efforts. In response, Maxwell smashes a shorter legbreak over midwicket for four. 31st over: Australia 128-5 (Handscomb 15, Maxwell 3) \u201cThey have got to bat the next ten overs these two,\u201d says Mark Waugh on TV. \u201cIt is simple as that. It is as long a tail as I\u2019ve seen in an Australian team.\u201d True, that. Back to Jadeja to Maxwell, the No7 striking along the ground to cover, Handscomb then going down the ground. They then repeat the same shots for the same result to finish. \u201cFinally Chahal helping Maxwell,\u201d emails Mahendra Killedar. \u201cHe can bat full 20 overs today.\u201d Too right. Geoff and I did a 60-minute aural history of Glenn Maxwell in our Final Word live podcast show last night, so I\u2019m fairly invested in all this. 30th over: Australia 124-5 (Handscomb 13, Maxwell 1) Out walks Maxwell, wearing his baggy gold baseball cap. He\u2019s off the mark second ball to long-on. He\u2019s done it again! Chahal gets a lot of turn on this leg break, spinning across Stoinis and collecting his edge on the way through to Rohit at slip, completing an excellent one-handed snaffle diving to his right. 29th over: Australia 122-4 (Handscomb 12, Stoinis 10) That\u2019s a good over of consolidation for Australia, five of Jadeja\u2019s deliveries scored off around the ground, worth seven to the hosts. 28th over: Australia 115-4 (Handscomb 9, Stoinis 6) Handscomb once again is rotating the strike from the first ball but Stoinis finds a way to immediately score himself this time, crashing a drive past the bowler for four. Another four dots in a row do follow, though. It is a habit he has to break. 27th over: Australia 110-4 (Handscomb 8, Stoinis 2) Handscomb has started well, jumping at Jadeja\u2019s first ball and stroking it carefully to long-off. But Stoinis can\u2019t do likewise, tied to the crease for the final five balls. His strike rate early in an innings is a talking point on TV, sitting at about 65 on average for his first ten balls. 26th over: Australia 109-4 (Handscomb 7, Stoinis 2) Stonis off the mark with a nicely struck drive down the ground, Handscomb also taking a single in that direction. They finished with one more each off Chahal, to the boundary riders at deep point and square leg. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Stoinis goes about this task. 25th over: Australia 105-4 (Handscomb 5, Stoinis 0) Good start from Handscomb against Jadeja, advancing then clipping for two. Later, he was again using his feet before driving a couple down the ground. He has to bat for 15 overs here, given he was picked for this side mainly due to how well he plays spin. \u201cRe Australia v Afghanistan,\u201d tweets Geoff Foley. \u201cI\u2019d put firm money on Afghanistan if the game was to be at Ciderabad. Although the odds would be so short as maybe to not warrant it.\u201d For those who don\u2019t follow the county championship, Ciderabad = Taunton, which turns like the subcontinent. Bristol spun plenty during the Women\u2019s World Cup a couple of years back, but I think the skill of the bowlers will be the biggest issue. Two wickets in four balls, Chahal dismissing both of the left handers! It\u2019s a soft one too, Khawaja trying to turn a topspinner into the leg side, the leading edge ballooning straight back to the bowler instead. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he hit it harder?\u201d Michael Vaughan ponders. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he hit it straighter?\u201d 24th over: Australia 101-4 (Handscomb 1, Stoinis 0) Chahal finishes with an accurate wrong\u2019un to the new man Stoinis. What a fantastic first over: 2/2. Chahal does it second ball! The legspinner misses down the legside but Marsh was on the advance. Once he missed the ball he was in real strife, Dhoni getting the bails off just before the No4 got his bat back. The decision was sent upstairs but Dhoni knew - he always knows. Watching the replay a couple of times, that\u2019s very good bowling from Chahal to see Marsh coming and direct his delivery wide. 23rd over: Australia 99-2 (Khawaja 34, Marsh 39) Seven off Jadeja\u2019s third, punctuated by a picture-perfect Khawaja reverse sweep through backward point. He\u2019s turning into one of the best reverse sweepers in the country. 22nd over: Australia 92-2 (Khawaja 29, Marsh 38) Kohli backs Jadhav to go again despite his poor previous set, and he is rewarded for it with only four runs taken to the sweepers. He\u2019s bowled six overs; Chahal is yet to get on. 21st over: Australia 88-2 (Khawaja 28, Marsh 35) As is often the case an an ODI with two spinners bowling, I\u2019ve fallen behind a bit here, so let me just relay that eight were taken off Jadeja\u2019s over, all to the sweepers in the smaller money. They\u2019ve started confidently against the experienced tweaker. 20th over: Australia 80-2 (Khawaja 25, Marsh 31) Marsh got the memo, taking Jadhav down for 15 off this over, by far Australia\u2019s best of the innings. It started with a smashed boundary through midwicket off a long hop, three then cut through point before he replicated the first shot off another half-tracker. Runs came from every ball of the set, Khawaja doing his bit too. Pratik Dubey makes the very reasonable point that Jadhav\u2019s numbers are a lot more impressive than one would expect. \u201cHe makes key breakthroughs and doesn\u2019t give away many runs. Makes me wonder if he may be the worst looking successful part time bowler, anyone else you can think of?\u201d I\u2019ll put some thought into that. Any nominations from the floor to get us going? 19th over: Australia 65-2 (Khawaja 22, Marsh 19) Shankar\u2019s job is done for now, giving up just 12 runs in four overs. Form his end, Kohli turns to Jadeja to tighten the screws once more. The champion spinner is not quite on the mark to begin though, spraying a couple down the legside to Marsh after Khawaja turned another misdirected delivery to fine leg. 18th over: Australia 59-2 (Khawaja 19, Marsh 18) A fourth over for the sixth bowler Jadhav, once again just going for four singles. I understand that it is important not to lose a third wicket at this stage but Virat is taking the you know what and it is working a treat. In fairness, the offspinner has really found his range and is is giving it a rip, beating Marsh with the final ball. Per our earlier topic, Marsh is lucky he didn\u2019t drag that back foot. 17th over: Australia 55-2 (Khawaja 17, Marsh 16) That\u2019s more like it, Marsh putting away a shorter delivery from Shankar, pulled hard through midwicket to bring up the Australian 50 as they take their first drinks break. 16th over: Australia 49-2 (Khawaja 16, Marsh 12) There is room for one anchor in a successful ODI team in 2019, but two? Can Khawaja and Marsh co-exist? With Jadhav skipping through another over worth only four runs to the home side, I do wonder. There was an outside edge in there as well, Marsh lucky not to be walking off, deflecting into the end of Dhoni\u2019s gloves rather than the webbing. 15th over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 15, Marsh 9) There is nothing theatening about Shankar but they can\u2019t get him away. Nor are they trying to for that matter, happy to take a few risk-free singles. \u201cIt feels like we are watching a game from 1986,\u201d says Andrew Wu, my press box colleague, of current score. 14th over: Australia 42-2 (Khawaja 14, Marsh 7) Jadhav beats Marsh with one that really spins, delivered with his arm in the fourth row of the southern stand such is the side-arm he has going on. It\u2019s a bold tactic and it is working, the part-timer\u2019s second over going for just three singles. A related World Cup prediction: Afghanistan, with their bevy of superb spinners, are going to make life very difficult for Australia in their tournament opener in Bristol. 13th over: Australia 39-2 (Khawaja 13, Marsh 5) A fraction quicker from Shankar this time around, keep both left-handers honest from over the wicket. The final delivery to Khawaja nearly got him in real strife, finding the inside edge. Not a bad start at all from the all-rounder. 12th over: Australia 37-2 (Khawaja 12, Marsh 4) It might be a bit defensive from Kohli to let Jadhav push through an over or two with his side-arm nude nuts, but going for just five singles, he has done the job as intended. If he gets another over, one of these two experienced batsmen surely have to back themselves to take him down. It\u2019s not international standard bowling, not even close. 11th over: Australia 32-2 (Khawaja 9, Marsh 2) Shankar, the man on debut, is on for his first twist of his ODI career. He\u2019s done a lot better with his first over than Siraj did on debut in Adelaide, going for just a couple with his little mediums, one of those a wide. The right time to bowl him at this stage of the innings. \u201cGoing by the numbers the top Do Not in the Do Not list might be Do not let Kohli bat second,\u201d says Pratik Dubey. Quite right! He then quickly adds: \u201cOn second thoughts the number one \u201cDo Not\u201d should be - Do not bowl anything to Finch except incoming darts!\u201d The story of his summer, sadly. 10th over: Australia 30-2 (Khawaja 8, Marsh 2) Khawaja gives the strike straight to Shaun Marsh, Australia\u2019s man of the moment, who gets off the mark with a carve through point for a couple; the stroke of a man who is seeing them well. Another poor first ten overs for Australia, a theme across the series. What a bizarre passage of play! Finch has been given lbw the ball after Bhuvi tried to deliver to the opener from four metres behind the crease! It prompted a long conversation between bowler and umpire, signalled a dead ball because Finch had pulled out of his stance. The very next ball an off-cutter hit him on the knee roll but a long way down the track but he elected not to send it to DRS and walk off. 9th over: Australia 27-2 (Khawaja 7) 8th over: Australia 27-1 (Finch 14, Khawaja 7) A couple through cover to begin, Khawaja leaning nicely into a Shami half-volley. He doesn\u2019t get another chance to score, the Indian quick sending down another probing over, once again beating the No3\u2019s outside edge along the way. 7th over: Australia 25-1 (Finch 14, Khawaja 5) Shot! Finch gets on the front foot and crunches Bhuvi through cover for four. That\u2019s the guy who was the best white-ball opener in the world for the bulk of 2018. Oops, now that I\u2019ve written that it was inevitable a false stroke would follow, the captain\u2019s outside edge located for a second time in the innings, straight to where a second slip would have been. I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t have a second man in there given how many times these two have beaten the bat so far in these muggy conditions. 6th over: Australia 15-1 (Finch 6, Khawaja 4) Khawaja again misses Shami, albeit on the back foot pulling this time, struck on the back leg. He\u2019s much better to the next delivery, crunching from the balls of his feet in front of point for a nerve-settling boundary. With the middle of the bat found, the left-hander is comfortable addressing the second half of the over. What a mess at the Gabba last night! Sure enough, refunds are available. 5th over: Australia 11-1 (Finch 6, Khawaja 0) Better from Finch, defending confidently then steering two behind point with the full face of the bat before seeing off the rest of the Bhuvi over without risk. \u201cAfter Jadeja\u2019s run-out in the last match,\u201d emails Seventh Horcrux, \u201cI was thinking about the You Don\u2019ts in cricket at the moment. You don\u2019t take on Jadeja\u2019s left arm- You don\u2019t try to drive Jimmy Anderson in England.\u201d They are one and two. Don\u2019t drag your back foot sweeping when Dhoni is keeping another high on the list. What else? Hit me up. 4th over: Australia 9-1 (Finch 4, Khawaja 0) The Indian openers are right on top here, Shami beating Khawaja with a lovely away-ducker then enticing him into a waft that goes past the blade once more. He makes it three in the over with the final delivery; another unconvincing push from the crease. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a bowler go past the outside edge as often as Shami does. Lovely from Bhuvi, round the wicket to Carey angling in then darting away just enough to clip the shoulder of Carey\u2019s bat, the ball landing in the hands of Kohli at second slip - he doesn\u2019t miss those. That makes it three failures for the South Australian at the top of the list this series. 3rd over: Australia 8-1 (Finch 3, Khawaja 0) Finch was off the mark with a nice push through midwicket. That\u2019ll feel good after the five minutes he has had. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Carey 5, Finch 0) Talk about living dangerously! A terrible mix-up from the opening pair, Carey prodding to point, Finch sent back when the vice-captain realised it was Jadeja - as you do. The throw looked on target but bounced just over the woodwork, the skipper again saved from walking off without scoring. As an omen, it was on this ground during the 2013 World Cup against England in the tournament opener that he was dropped at square leg for nothing, going on to make a big hundred. Earlier, Carey struck the first boundary of the afternoon, taking Shami\u2019s short ball through midwicket over the circle. \u201cI really want a drone,\u201d says Shane Warne on telly. \u201cThere are many options that you can use it for.\u201d My mind, it is boggled. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Carey 1, Finch 0) Inches away from a duck for Finch! The final ball of Bhuvi\u2019s over caught the Australian captain\u2019s outside edge, falling just short of Rohit at first slip. Earlier, he was hit on the pad when shouldering arms, prompting an unsuccessful appeal from the bowler. All happening. The players are back on the field! Hurrah! Bhuvi to continue at Finch with Australia 1-0 after two balls when the rain came. Let\u2019s try this again: PLAY! Play to resume at 1:55pm. No overs have been lost so the dinner break has been reduced to 30 minutes From where I\u2019m sitting, it looks like the rain has stopped. In turn, the umpires are on their way to the middle, presumably to order that the covers be taken off. If I was on the 1s and 2s right now, this is where I\u2019d take it. Would you believe it. Carey was off the mark to third man first ball with a nice little steer, Finch defended the second... then the rain came tumbling down. The players are on the field. Bhuvi has the ball for India, running in from the Members End. He\u2019ll be delivering at Alex Carey to begin. PLAY! Yup, play is officially delayed. If no further rain, they will be on at 1:30pm. Meanwhile, a very good start from the Cricket Ground DJ, who has had a blinder during this series. This is some good news. CA are putting up all their old footage! Get in! Nothing official, but the hessian cover is back on. So, that\u2019ll almost certainly make it a late start. It\u2019s going to be one of those days, I\u2019m afraid. Three changes for India. Siraj has been dropped for new all-rounder Vijay Shankar, Chahal the leggie replaces Kuldeep and Jadhav is in for the out of sorts Rayudu. India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Vijay Shankar, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Yuzvendra Chahal Justin Langer is on Fox Cricket. He notes that India and England have \u201csome of the all time great players\u201d in their team at the moment. \u201cHopefully, by the time we get to the World Cup we\u2019ll have a settled team and we\u2019ll give it a good crack.\u201d Interesting question from Adam Gilchrist at the end about the number of interviews that he now has to do as a result of the new broadcast deal. \u201cIt is like the Truman Show,\u201d he says. Aaron Finch says that Australia would have bowled too. He confirms the inclusions of Stanlake and Zampa. \u201cIt might nibble a touch but it could be a bit on the slower side early,\u201d the captain adds. \u201cI would have bowled but we are not too disappointed.\u201d Australia: Alex Carey (wk), Aaron Finch (c), Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Jhye Richardson, Billy Stanlake, Peter Siddle, Adam Zampa \u201cIt is going to be overcast and with rain it could be stop-start so as batsmen you are never in,\u201d explains Virat Kohli. \u201cSo that\u2019s the thinking behind it.\u201d Teams shortly. Rain has delayed the toss. If there is no further rain, it will be held at 1pm. But play will still start, in theory, at 1:20pm. The pitch. Which, I should add, is now looking ready for play with the stumps quickly inserted, getting a bit of treatment from the ground staff now. Maybe we will start on time. If so, the toss will take place in a few minutes from now. This old ground loves a final and that is, in essence, what we have here today with these two sides coming into this rubber with one win apiece. Australia went close to wrapping it up in two but Kohli and Dhoni had other ideas, doing as they have for so long to haul down Australia\u2019s 298 in Adelaide on Tuesday. Another contest just as entertaining would really do the trick here, albeit in very different conditions. At Adelaide, the sides were running around in 41 degree heat. Right now, it is raining and the covers are on. It isn\u2019t heavy enough to delay Australia\u2019s warm up, going through their paces at the northern end, but a delayed start is the most likely scenario at this stage. When they do get going, Aaron Finch\u2019s team sheet will have two changes, Billy Stanlake and Adam Zampa in at the expense of Jason Behrendorff and Nathan Lyon, the former due to back soreness and the latter dropped. Surely it\u2019ll be the case that they need two spinners at the World Cup, but that\u2019s for another day. India are also out kicking a ball around at the southern end with the main covers now coming off, a piece of good news that I will leave you on for the time being. Stay in touch throughout the afternoon, whether that\u2019s for cricket or rain. Email, twitter - you know the drill.",

      "bodyText": "Day and night, through crackling loudspeakers, the announcements ring out. \u201cIt is Babu speaking,\u201d says a shrill voice. \u201cI have lost my wallet and brother. Please come here the moment you hear this.\u201d \u201cLal Ram is here,\u201d a woman says a few times. \u201cCome and collect him from the yellow tower.\u201d \u201cWhoever has taken my trousers, that were drying on my car,\u201d booms a voice in Bengali. \u201cAt least return the car keys from the pocket. You can keep the trousers.\u201d It is the first day of the largest human gathering ever. An estimated 15 million Hindus have come together at the convergence of the Ganges and Yamuna \u2013 two holy rivers in north India. Up to 10 times that many \u2013 more than the population of Russia \u2013 could bathe in the waters by the end of the festival in March. Children step between thickets of adult legs. Older pilgrims walk hunched over, eyes fixed to the ground. They and millions of others will be carried along in vast human waves to the water. Hundreds of thousands will get lost on the way. \u201cWe calculated last time we had 225,000 missing people,\u201d says Devesh Chaturvedi, the head of the team that organised the last Kumbh Mela in the city, in 2013. High above the festival grounds, a pop-up city of tents and dusty roads about two-thirds the size of Manhattan, two giant yellow balloons hover. They mark the two lost-and-found centres that have become operational so far. By mid-morning, one centre is already heaving with lost men, women and children. \u201cAfter taking a dip I felt sick and couldn\u2019t get back to my group,\u201d says an older man named Papon. He was found wandering in the crowd, freezing and in his underwear. \u201cI\u2019m wearing someone else\u2019s clothes now,\u201d he says, pulling a blanket around himself. \u201cFor the last 24 hours I haven\u2019t eaten,\u201d says Shripath, burying her head in a green shawl. Barely able to walk, she was put on the back of a motorbike the previous day by her brother. He said he would meet her closer to the river, but they lost each other. She knows the name of her village, but not which state or district it is in, and does not know any of her family\u2019s phone numbers. She has been lost before at another festival in the mountains of Uttarakhand. \u201cI wish I had never come,\u201d she says. \u201cJust take me back to my village. My grandchildren are there.\u201d Twins who become separated at the Kumbh Mela and rediscover each other decades later was once a stock Bollywood storyline. Folks tales abound of heartless families taking burdensome older relatives to the festival and abandoning them there. In reality, most of the lost are found. This year the operation has gone digital, including an app with live updates of every new registered missing person. \u201cThe biggest challenge we face are the people,\u201d says Mamta Tamboli, a manager with the IT firm running the lost-and-found system. India has 22 official languages and an estimated 720 dialects. Most who attend the Kumbh Mela hail from small villages they might rarely have previously left. New India, with its sleek software solutions, keeps crashing up against the old. \u201cAround 90% [of the people who get lost] are illiterate,\u201d says Tamboli. \u201cThey don\u2019t know their mobile numbers, their district\u2019s name. We have to try to understand, what are they saying? What language are they speaking?\u201d Prasanna Uguonkar, who oversees the centre, says most people will spend only a few hours there. \u201cOur experience is that we will locate [the families on] 70% on that day, within weeks it\u2019s about 90%, and by the end of the Kumbh Mela around 99%,\u201d he says. Those who are never reunited or go missing permanently may be mentally ill or could have chosen to run away, he says. Others go missing for even darker reasons. \u201cWe have studies now that show at large events the risk of trafficking increases,\u201d says Dhananjay Tingal, from the child\u2019s rights group Bachpan Bachao Andolan, which is working at the festival. No data has been collected, but he knows from experience at other Hindu fairs that traffickers see the events as opportunities. \u201cYou see the large number of children moving around the area, or working with their parents,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a crowd moving like that, a child who falls even five paces behind cannot be seen.\u201d Uguonkar says his team is aware of the risks.

In a few hours, they will be handed over to an organisation for destitute women. \u201cNobody is coming to pick us up,\u201d Shripath says. \u201cI\u2019ve been crying so much I can\u2019t open my eyes.

I can\u2019t thank all the support I have received here all my career. Even playing against an Australian I feel like some parts of the crowd are with me. I am in the fourth round. That is the best news possible because I have another chance to play here. Ten years ago that [injury] situation would be a drama, but very difficult.

A big, bouncing, swinging serve gets De Minaur\u2019s backhand in a tangle. 30-0. Then Nadal plonks another forehand winner down the line to earn three match points. But De Minaur saves the first and then Nadal double-faults. Are we about to witness an incredible choke? Nadal misses another first serve. A dramatic rally ensues. After 24 shots Nadal sends a forehand wide for deuce! The crowd go wild, enthralled with De Minaur\u2019s fight. Nadal restores calm with an ace. De Minaur saves a fourth match point with a brilliant forehand winner. Nadal earns a fifth chance; De Minaur comes up with another stubborn forehand. Nadal earns a sixth chance with a solid serve. Then Nadal\u2019s given a time violation by Carlos Ramos, an umpire he\u2019s rarely seen eye to eye with in the past. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. De Minaur finally cracks, sending a forehand long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f47a2c89eedb914d55ae7f87d4d229699f7d05f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f47a2c89eedb914d55ae7f87d4d229699f7d05f2/0_0_4221_2643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spectators hold up banners of support for Rafael Nada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The result would have pleased these fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T11:06:54.161Z\">at 11.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c41a982e4b058cfe6d92686\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T10:28:15.804Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 5-4 De Minaur* (*denotes server): </strong>De Minaur holds to love.

Though he won yet another French Open to move up to 17 grand slam titles, three behind that Swiss chap who simply refuses to retire, he struggled with injuries for much of 2018 and had an awkward start to the new season, a thigh strain forcing him to withdraw from Brisbane and disrupting his preparations for this tournament. Doubt hung over him as he made his way to Melbourne.</p> <p>It probably still does \u2013 Nadal will need a few more solid performances before he totally extinguishes the uncertainty. But at least there haven\u2019t been any slips so far just yet. Consecutive wins over two Australians, James Duckworth and Matthew Ebden, have allowed the 32-year-old to build confidence and momentum. For the time being we can still dream of Federer and Nadal meeting in the semi-finals (Federer\u2019s progress continued earlier today, a comfortable win over Taylor Fritz setting up a fourth-round match with Stefanos Tsitsipas).</p> <p>But having dispensed with two home favourites already, Nadal is likely to face a sterner examination against the player many Australians regard as the new Lleyton Hewitt. Alex de Minaur, 19 years old and precociously talented, has emerged as the great white hope of men\u2019s tennis in Australia in the past year, especially now Nick Kyrgios mania is becoming a bit pass\u00e9, and the youngster\u2019s speed, hustling skills and shot-making abilities will give him a chance of reaching the fourth round of a slam for the first time in his short career. </p> <p>Born in Sydney to a Uruguayan father and a Spanish mother, De Minaur moved to Alicante when he was five years old, giving him a good appreciation of just how much esteem Nadal is held in Spain. \u201cRafa is pretty much like the king in Spain,\u201d he says \u2013 and he had to bow to Nadal\u2019s brilliance when they met in the third round of Wimbledon last year. But, having beaten Pedro Sousa in three sets in the first round and survived a tough five-setter with Henri Laaksonen on Wednesday, the 29th seed shouldn\u2019t shrink this time. If he plays without fear, this could be very interesting. Nadal wasn\u2019t totally convincing against Ebden and although it\u2019s likely the world No2 is about to disappoint the home fans for the third time this week, he won\u2019t underestimate the young pretender\u2019s threat.</p> <p><strong>Play begins at: 8am GMT, 7pm in Melbourne.</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. Tom Bassam will be back with live coverage of day six tomorrow. I\u2019ll leave you with some Andy Murray news. Rafa Nadal is asked about playing Tomas Berdych in the fourth round. \u201cHe has been off the court for a while but he played the first week of the season and did it well. He has confidence after the comeback. When you are playing well after a tough time with injuries, that helps the energy even more. I predict a very tough match.\u201d Rafael Nadal speaks! \u201cHe is a big fighter. He is super quick. He is the fastest on the tour. I think I played a very solid match. I want to congratulate Alex for a great start to the season. No complaints [about the crowd]. I can\u2019t thank all the support I have received here all my career. Even playing against an Australian I feel like some parts of the crowd are with me. I am in the fourth round. That is the best news possible because I have another chance to play here. Ten years ago that [injury] situation would be a drama, but very difficult. But throughout my career I have had a lot of stops for my injury. I have been in that situation a couple of times. Even if I have to deal with ups and downs with the body it is very exciting any time I am healthy.\u201d Alex de Minaur walks off to a big ovation. The 19-year-old Australian left everything on the court and will hopefully be stronger for the experience, even though he\u2019s just received an almighty thrashing from Rafa Nadal. Serving for the match, Nadal makes it 15-0 with yet another forehand winner. A big, bouncing, swinging serve gets De Minaur\u2019s backhand in a tangle. 30-0. Then Nadal plonks another forehand winner down the line to earn three match points. But De Minaur saves the first and then Nadal double-faults. Are we about to witness an incredible choke? Nadal misses another first serve. A dramatic rally ensues. After 24 shots Nadal sends a forehand wide for deuce! The crowd go wild, enthralled with De Minaur\u2019s fight. Nadal restores calm with an ace. De Minaur saves a fourth match point with a brilliant forehand winner. Nadal earns a fifth chance; De Minaur comes up with another stubborn forehand. Nadal earns a sixth chance with a solid serve. Then Nadal\u2019s given a time violation by Carlos Ramos, an umpire he\u2019s rarely seen eye to eye with in the past. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. De Minaur finally cracks, sending a forehand long. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 5-4 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur holds to love. This has been a drubbing, but at least he\u2019s kept Nadal honest in this set. Nadal will surely serve it out now. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 5-3 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal moves a game away from victory. De Minaur will serve to stay in the set. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 4-3 De Minaur* (*denotes server): The game goes to deuce. Somehow De Minaur finds the will to keep landing a few blows. He holds. He\u2019s showing plenty of heart. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 4-2 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love once again. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 3-2 De Minaur* (*denotes server): More \u201cC\u2019mons!\u201d from De Minaur as he holds again. He\u2019s still fighting the inevitable. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 3-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal keeps rolling, holding to love. It will be interesting to see how he deals with the power of Berdych, who crushed him in the quarters in 2015. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 2-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur holds to love! \u201cCome on!\u201d he cries. That\u2019s good to see. I doubt Nick Kyrgios would be showing so much positivity in similar circumstances. Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 2-0 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal consolidates the break. Let\u2019s hope De Minaur is taking some lessons on board. Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 1-0 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Nadal just won\u2019t step. De Minaur shakes his head after netting a backhand for 15-40. A stinging return from Nadal\u2019s too hot for De Minaur, who sends a limp forehand long. The comeback\u2019s on when Nadal slices wide for 15-30! Then he earns a break point, Nadal pushing a forehand wide for 30-40! Yet the game goes to deuce when the youngster dabs a backhand wide. Nadal seems to have relaxed and gives up another chance with a poor volley. He refocuses and saves the break point with a vicious forehand. De Minaur\u2019s proving a nuisance and he earns a third opportunity when Nadal knocks an unsteady forehand wide. Nadal serves well to save it, before earning his first set point, one he converts when De Minaur sends a return long. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 5-2 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, De Minaur rouses the crowd with a lovely forehand winner for 40-15 and an ace to hold. The comeback\u2019s on! Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 5-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): The crowd are sighing like sympathetic parents every time De Minaur misses a shot. Nadal holds easily again. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 4-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Nadal crunches into a 0-40 lead. De Minaur, fading fast, nets a backhand and Nadal breaks again. Thoughts are already turning to a fourth-round match against Tomas Berdych. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 3-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Nadal holds to 30. This isn\u2019t much of an event at the moment, even though De Minaur is giving his all. Second set: Nadal 6-1, 2-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur finally stops the rot, holding for the first time since his very first service game. He\u2019s still got a long way to go, though. Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 2-0 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal easily consolidates the break. Fevered speculation about Andy Murray\u2019s retirement plans refuses to die down just days after his early exit from the Australian Open, and his team on Friday were forced to deny that he has already committed to having surgery on his hip. The former world No1 probably will have an operation to resurface the hip bone, using a metal implant, but organisers of the Marseilles tournament from which he has withdrawn made the false assumption in an announcement that he had already decided to do so. A spokesman for Murray said, \u201cNo decision has been made about an operation, but he had already decided to withdraw from all tournaments. He will make a further announcement with a week or so.\u201d The Marseilles tournament press release said, \u201cStill suffering from hip, Andy Murray will undergo further surgery and therefore had to forfeit upcoming tournaments, including the Open 13 Provence.\u201dIt quoted Murray as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a blow, but I have no choice.\u201d Second set: Nadal 6-1, 1-0 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur desperately needs to hold here. Nadal is like a dog with a very juicy bone, finding his range with a forehand to make it 30-40. De Minaur resists the inevitable, leaping into a backhand to save the break point. Nadal earns another chance, only to make a rare error with a forehand. Another opening comes and goes. So we\u2019re locked at deuce for a while. As the game ticks past the 10-minute mark, De Minaur sprays a forehand winner down the line. Nadal hits back with a stunning forehand down the line. They continue for another five minutes. Nadal earns his fifth break point of the game. De Minaur crashes a forehand long. He\u2019s trying so hard, but Nadal is relentless. It now seems that the Marseille organisers jumped the gun. Andy Murray\u2019s camp are insisting he\u2019s made no decision on having hip surgery yet. Serving for the set, Nadal lets De Minaur have the first point. Then he gets down to business, carving out two set points. He serves wide and De Minaur nets a forehand return. That escalated quickly. First set: Nadal 5-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. Nadal\u2019s on the prowl, pushing De Minaur deeper and deeper. De Minaur somehow gets two smashes back, but Nadal does the job with the third to make it 30-40. Nadal stops in the next rally, saying De Minaur\u2019s backhand has gone long. Hawkeye agrees. This has gone flat. Nadal has skipped into a very commanding lead. Seems the stubborn Scot is going to do everything he can to save his career. He\u2019s pulled out of Marseille and is going under the knife again. First set: Nadal* 4-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): De Minaur sets about showing he\u2019s not going to roll over, meeting a Nadal lob with a lovely backhand overhead for 0-15. Yet Nadal makes off with the next three points. An ace is enough for a comfortable hold. First set: Nadal 3-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): After threatening to break in the previous game, De Minaur finds himself in a little bit of trouble here, a couple of errors making it 15-30. Nadal, so experienced, decides his time to unwind that forehand - and he sends one fizzing past De Minaur for 15-40. Another one down the line is enough to force De Minaur to knock a forehand long. The first break goes Nadal\u2019s way. First set: Nadal* 2-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): After the first two points are shared, there\u2019s a murmur in the crowd when Nadal double-faults for 15-30. Nadal pulls it back to 30-all, but De Minaur earns a break point when a very good backhand forces a scrambling Spaniard to hook a forehand long for 30-40. They rally for a while, trading backhands \u2013 and then Nadal knocks a forehand long! Or does he? Nadal, frowning, challenges \u2013 and the ball was on the line. Oh. Replay the point! Nadal serves wide and De Minaur blocks a backhand return wide. Still, De Minaur is playing some magnificent tennis, and this game is taking for ever. The rallies are going deep and the youngster\u2019s rising to the challenge. Outlasting Nadal isn\u2019t easy, though, and the Spaniard eventually holds. First set: Nadal 1-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d cries De Minaur after coming out on top of a baseline duel at the start of the net, Nadal netting a forehand for 15-0. The camera picks out Lleyton Hewitt, Australia\u2019s Davis Cup captain, who\u2019ll be feeling concerned when this game goes to 30-all. Nadal\u2019s started well and he earns a break point when De Minaur sticks a backhand into the net. A grinding baseline duel ensues and, surprisingly, it\u2019s Nadal who blinks first, shanking a backhand into the crowd, where someone fluffs the catch. How embarrassing. Nadal earns another chance with a trademark drop shot, but De Minaur stands firm again. De Minaur is scrambling hard. Nadal is hitting the ball harder. He earns a third chance. Then a fourth. De Minaur, who has a lot of miles on the clock already this week, looks tight. But he gees himself up when Nadal nets a forehand return. Eventually he olds. \u201cYuuuuurrggghhhhhh!\u201d De Minaur cries. First set: Nadal* 1-0 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal, wearing an orange vest, opens the serving. De Minaur, wearing a red t-shirt, won the toss and chose to receive. But he doesn\u2019t get much of a look at first, Nadal gambolling into a 30-0 lead. De Minaur steps it up and goes for a huge forehand winner, but Nadal mounts a challenge and finds it was wide. 40-0. Nadal follows with a double-fault, but the game\u2019s done when De Minaur nets a backhand. Tok! Tok! Tokity tok! They\u2019ve had their warm-up. Rod Laver\u2019s in the crowd. We\u2019re about to begin. The players are out on court. Alex de Minaur is going to have plenty of support today. I doubt that\u2019s going to affect someone as focused as Rafa Nadal, though. Kevin Mitchell, our man in Melbourne, was in position to watch Roger Federer thrash Taylor Fritz earlier. Hello. Ten years on from Rafa Nadal\u2019s first and only Australian Open title, the sense is growing that time is catching up with the Spanish legend. Though he won yet another French Open to move up to 17 grand slam titles, three behind that Swiss chap who simply refuses to retire, he struggled with injuries for much of 2018 and had an awkward start to the new season, a thigh strain forcing him to withdraw from Brisbane and disrupting his preparations for this tournament. Doubt hung over him as he made his way to Melbourne. It probably still does \u2013 Nadal will need a few more solid performances before he totally extinguishes the uncertainty. But at least there haven\u2019t been any slips so far just yet. Consecutive wins over two Australians, James Duckworth and Matthew Ebden, have allowed the 32-year-old to build confidence and momentum. For the time being we can still dream of Federer and Nadal meeting in the semi-finals (Federer\u2019s progress continued earlier today, a comfortable win over Taylor Fritz setting up a fourth-round match with Stefanos Tsitsipas). But having dispensed with two home favourites already, Nadal is likely to face a sterner examination against the player many Australians regard as the new Lleyton Hewitt. Alex de Minaur, 19 years old and precociously talented, has emerged as the great white hope of men\u2019s tennis in Australia in the past year, especially now Nick Kyrgios mania is becoming a bit pass\u00e9, and the youngster\u2019s speed, hustling skills and shot-making abilities will give him a chance of reaching the fourth round of a slam for the first time in his short career. Born in Sydney to a Uruguayan father and a Spanish mother, De Minaur moved to Alicante when he was five years old, giving him a good appreciation of just how much esteem Nadal is held in Spain. \u201cRafa is pretty much like the king in Spain,\u201d he says \u2013 and he had to bow to Nadal\u2019s brilliance when they met in the third round of Wimbledon last year. But, having beaten Pedro Sousa in three sets in the first round and survived a tough five-setter with Henri Laaksonen on Wednesday, the 29th seed shouldn\u2019t shrink this time. If he plays without fear, this could be very interesting. Nadal wasn\u2019t totally convincing against Ebden and although it\u2019s likely the world No2 is about to disappoint the home fans for the third time this week, he won\u2019t underestimate the young pretender\u2019s threat. Play begins at: 8am GMT, 7pm in Melbourne.",

In this essay, I talk about fermentation: what makes it so magical, why people are so afraid of it. I talk about some strategies people use to make fermentation part of their daily life, and why modern life makes it so hard to do so. And finally, I speak to the ethics of fermentation \u2013 what we can learn from it and how it can help us think differently.</p> <h2><strong>Taking time</strong></h2> <p>Consider <em>nukadoko</em>, a fermented rice bran from Japan. Stir together salt, water and bran \u2013 with optional ginger, dried fruit and spices. Then \u201cplant\u201d some vegetables like radish, beets, or carrots, burying them deep in the \u201csoil\u201d. Stir up to three times a day, preferably with your hands: get those skin microorganisms in there. After a week, you will have an active fermentation. Pretty soon it will be so strong that you can plant any vegetable in it and it will be pickled within one hour \u2013 these are then called <em>nukazuke</em>.</p> <p>What happened? The salt inhibited the growth of the \u201cbad\u201d bacteria and fungi. Without it, mold would have been sprouting all over the place, and the vegetables would have become inedible. Stirring it regularly ensures that the rice bran that was exposed to air gets buried again, so that any mold quickly dies in the anaerobic environment. Yeast starts eating the sugars in the vegetables, and then our friend <em>Lactobacillus</em> turns it into vinegar.</p> <p>Make nuka, and you get to watch the transition from living organism to a crowd of multitudes. The only catch: to care for your nuka properly, you need to stir it daily, sometimes twice a day. The privilege of tending to life and death takes time.</p> <p>Rosemary Liss, an artist who works with fermentation in her practice, learned about nuka at Hex Ferments, a group of food alchemists in Maryland, USA. \u201cWe had a pot and it was like a pet we had to tend to daily. I loved this ritual \u2013 the gestures and movements \u2013 it felt like a dance. Each day we lifted the heavy crock off the shelf, removed its colorful fabric covering and then unearthed the pickles before aerating the bran and adding fresh veg to the bed for a short lactic sleep.\u201d</p> <p>In Japan, the nuka gets passed down from generation to generation; each develops its own special flavors. They become unique microbiomes, only able to survive because of the daily work of grandmothers, mothers and daughters. We have them to thank for this strange gift.</p> <p>But that daily magic can quickly disappear when you get too precise. When Liss had the chance to start a residency at the Nordic Food Lab, she decided to work on nuka. She spent months trying to perfect it for a Nordic context. As she noted: \u201cWhen this process was removed from the vibrancy of Hex and into a laboratory with only food grade plastic vessels available for controlled research I felt the magic had been lost.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s something about fermentation that transcends exact science: it wants to be integrated into the rhythm of life. This rhythm is erratic; it\u2019s embedded in culture, tradition and habits.</p> <h2><strong>Low-tech solutions for modern problems</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73022351985ec7d19802b874709947730c927a97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73022351985ec7d19802b874709947730c927a97/0_117_5607_3364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pantry of fermenting vegetables\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018People do project their fears and anxieties of bacteria on fermentation. The ironic thing is it has always been a strategy for food safety.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan West/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I talk to people new to fermentation, they often ask if it\u2019s different from canning. According to Alex Lewin, author of Real Food Fermentation and Kombucha, Kefir and Beyond, fermenting is the opposite: \u201cIt\u2019s unlike canning \u2013 with canning you kill all of the microbes and seal it hermetically. With fermentation you invite the microbes you want and don\u2019t let in the ones you don\u2019t. Fermentation is diplomacy and canning is a massacre. Canning is a high-tech food technology.\u201d</p> <p>Canning requires glass and the ability to shape metal in very precise ways. That makes canning uniquely modern. Part of the conceit of modernity is that, to solve our problems, we need more high-tech solutions. On the other hand, fermentation is low-tech. You don\u2019t need to be an expert to preserve food, or any fancy technology. Just a bucket, some salt and trust in the world of bacteria and fungi.</p> <p>One of the charms of fermentation is that it can help us deal with food waste. Our modern food system is extremely wasteful, with 30-40% of food going into the landfill in the United States, with 21% occurring at a household level. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s incredibly energy-intensive: 33% of global warming-related emissions come from agriculture. If consumers were to learn how to ferment at home, they could preserve their food without having to cook or freeze it \u2013 both requiring more energy. That makes it a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem.</p> <h2><strong>Fear of having to care</strong></h2> <p>If fermentation is so easy, why isn\u2019t everyone doing it? To write this article, I reached out to friends and friends-of-friends who regularly ferment, asking them why they do it and why they think many don\u2019t.</p> <p>Ariadna Rodriguez and I\u00f1aki Alvarez run nyamnyam, an art collective based in Barcelona, Spain. Like many people I interviewed, theyhave been greatly inspired by Sandor Katz, writer of books like Wild Fermentation and The Art of Fermentation. So when I asked them why they think some people have negative reactions to it, they cited him: \u201cPeople do project their fears and anxieties of bacteria on fermentation. The ironic thing is it has always been a strategy for food safety.\u201d</p> <p>They also think it has to do with something else: people\u2019s fear of messing up. As they put it: \u201cThey\u2019re scared of having to take care of other microorganisms, they say they will have to travel, they will forget. I think it\u2019s about responsibility, a big word nowadays, because the food industry makes everything for you that just needs to go from fridge to pan.\u201d</p> <p>Lina and Adam Esbold, a couple from Sweden, shared similar perspectives. \u201cMost people are skeptical, they don\u2019t like the taste and are put off by the idea of healthy bacteria \u2026 Even more people simply don\u2019t care.\u201d Rosemary Liss, the artist, also thinks it has something to do with people\u2019s fears of food safety. \u201cI think the fear of contamination and making one\u2019s self sick is the biggest barrier. We grew up hearing the horror stories about botulism and canning going wrong and don\u2019t realize the fermentation process is much different.\u201d</p> <p>For Mark Reynolds, who runs Naughty Nettle Medicinals, \u201clack of experience or first-hand knowledge is a key part of this. There are those who try it once and have something go moldy so they won\u2019t try it again.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, people can also get pretty excited when they first learn about fermentation \u2013 and how little responsibility it actually requires. Lewin describes the moment when he learned about fermentation from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Wild-Fermentation-Flavor-Nutrition-Live-Culture/dp/1931498237\">Wild Fermentation</a>. \u201cMy head exploded \u2013 you can do that with food? You can chop up cabbage and leave it on the counter for a month? How is that possible? Part of what appealed to me is how rebellious that is, to cut something up and not put it in the refrigerator.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Making death part of life</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"359e5a44fdd57e62542713947a021a1dafaf1dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/359e5a44fdd57e62542713947a021a1dafaf1dd9/0_0_4608_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s like gardening, you go out and you look at it and poke at it every once in a while,\u2019 said Alex Lewin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Bruno/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve often met people who tried to ferment something once, and then they either forgot about it or got scared they did something wrong. There are cupboards full of abandoned kombuchas, fridges littered with old kefir and unfed sourdough.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to start fermenting, but it can quickly get dispiriting, and then embarrassing. Rodriguez and Alvarez note that many people might worry that they don\u2019t have the time to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with these microorganisms. But, they say, \u201cthe good thing is that you can always start again, you can always put new tea in the kombucha and everything will be OK. So as we say in Spanish: \u2018<em>No hay mal que por bien no venga</em>\u2019\u201d (there is nothing bad that can\u2019t be turned into good).</p> <p>Lina Esbold and Adam Karlsson say it all takes balance and going with the flow. \u201cSome weeks the fermentation gets to take more time and energy, but the opposite is also true, and we just let the cultivations whither.\u201d And that\u2019s OK, too. Lewin learned to keep his projects out in the open: \u201cOne thing I do is I leave all of my fermentation projects in plain sight. I see them every time I go in the kitchen. It\u2019s like gardening, you go out and you look at it and poke at it every once in a while.\u201d</p> <p>Lewin notes that if your fermentation does go bad, \u201cit will be very obvious and very visible: fluffy green spores and you throw it away. If you\u2019ve never had kombucha or kimchi, if you don\u2019t know what it tastes like and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s bad or not, you either take the leap or you find someone who has tried it before.\u201d</p> <p>At some point, you might get tired of it all. Simply pause your fermentation by putting it in the fridge, or better yet, in the freezer. Fermentation starters, like kefir grains or kombucha scobies, can also survive several years when you dry them. Once you\u2019re ready to start them up again, just add whatever it needs (sugar and tea for kombucha, milk for kefir, or flour for sourdough).</p> <h2><strong>Stinking up the aisles of the modern supermarket</strong></h2> <p>And yet, even if you try your best, fermentation isn\u2019t always easy to keep doing. Our jobs and school uproot us; we work 9-5 and come home exhausted. For those who work irregular hours, it\u2019s hard to build up the routine and habits needed to maintain that sourdough or make yoghurt or kefir daily.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the food system. The supermarket is anathema to fermentation: live fermentation generates carbon dioxide and methane, stinking up the aisles and bursting through the packaging. In other words, it\u2019s messy and weird. Partly because our access to food is limited to what the supermarket has to offer, it\u2019s not easy to get hold of kefir grains or a kombucha mother. And when we do, it\u2019s hard to get guidance. It can be intimidating if you don\u2019t know anyone with experience fermenting.</p> <p>Our society is also marked by what food researchers call \u201cde-skilling\u201d. We have largely lost the food practices handed down to us over generations. What remains is a semblance of our past food cultures: fermented pickles become canned; sauces rich in character and variety become, simply, ketchup.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My head exploded \u2013 you can do that with food? You can chop up cabbage and leave it on the counter for a month?</p> <footer> <cite>Alex Lewin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of this is the industrialized food system, but another part is also the way the economy shapes our lives. Even just a few generations ago, most westerners lived in multi-generational households, children together with grandparents, several families sharing tenements, and a vibrant street culture that came from dense living arrangements and reliance on walking as the primary means of transportation. With modernity, every tradition, every routine, every relationship is constantly shifting and torn apart.</p> <p>And even though science has given us unprecedented ways to understand the food that we eat, it also has its limitations. It seems like every week a study comes out that overturns the guidelines on what we\u2019re supposed to eat. We\u2019ve grown up with the idea of an official expiration date \u2013 leaving our trust in food safety to some largely invisible process, determined by experts. We have the science to understand the invisible stuff going on in our kitchens and in our guts, but a cultural attitude of fear that stops us from playing with our food \u2013 an attitude that inhibits microbiomes from flourishing in our kitchens.</p> <p>When I talked to Jyotsana Singh, a friend, about this, she pointed out that we lack a common sense of how food spoils and what\u2019s safe or unsafe to eat. As she put it, \u201cpeople don\u2019t trust their senses\u201d. Ironic, with so much information available \u201cat our fingertips\u201d. She grew up in a family where, when concerned if the milk was OK, they wouldn\u2019t look at the expiry date but instead sniff it. Perhaps due to this common sense she grew up with, combined with a knowledge of basic chemistry and biology, she rarely has a feeling of risk or fear when making food.</p> <p>Through our conversation, we decided that there\u2019s an important distinction between three things. First, there\u2019s habits \u2013 the kind that allow us to ferment on a daily basis. Then, there\u2019s common sense \u2013 an intuition of what\u2019s going on under the surface, informed by today\u2019s science and cultural knowledge. Finally, there\u2019s tradition, which involves passing down knowledge about and confidence in the food we eat and make. Maybe it\u2019s a balance of these that helps foster fermentation practices.</p> <p>If you think about it this way, there\u2019s something very political about fermentation. Our work life makes it difficult to form daily habits. The modern food system has atrophied our cultural knowledge and traditions of food preservation practices. It makes sense that so many people find it hard to integrate into everyday life. To create a world where fermentation is the norm, we\u2019d need to change the world.</p> <h2><strong>Thinking with fermentation</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The living body is always on the point of passing over into the chemical process: oxygen, hydrogen, salt are always about to appear, but are always again sublated; and only at death or in disease is the chemical process able to prevail. The living creature is always exposed to danger, always bears within itself an other \u2026</em></p> <p>\u2013 GW Hegel, Philosophy of Nature</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Thus politics</em><em> \u2026 originated in the daily ferment of ordinary life in the agora.</em></p> <p>\u2013 Murray Bookchin, Urbanization Without Cities: The Rise and Decline of Citizenship</p> </blockquote> <p>As Hegel realized two centuries ago, we carry others within ourselves. What makes the body keep its integrity, surrounded by constant danger? The practice of fermentation raises these kinds of questions, and helps us think through a different ethics of being.</p> <p>For Rodriguez and Alvarez, getting into fermentation opened them up to seeing multiple connections in life. \u201cIt all feels as part of the same thing,\u201d they say when I ask them how fermentation is part of their daily life. \u201cEating it. Having something fermented every meal. Then taking care of all the microorganisms that coexist with us, maybe taking out the tea from the kombucha, or changing the water and adding the sugar to the water kefir, tasting how the chilis are doing fermenting in the sun, opening the miso every now and then, and so on and on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c3418201f0f13a5342b3a5d522fb8dad1cefd46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3418201f0f13a5342b3a5d522fb8dad1cefd46/0_237_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018To practice fermentation, we need to multiply experiences, not just with bacteria and fungi, but also with each other.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To practice fermentation, we need to multiply experiences, not just with bacteria and fungi, but also with each other.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Roddy/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of this, they say, helps them visualize \u201call this activity in different scales interconnected between all the agents, our bodies, the microorganisms\u201d. Fermentation also informed Lewin\u2019s approach to life. \u201cFermenting establishes a dynamic equilibrium of microbes \u2013 getting people comfortable with that is hard. In our overly determined world where everyone wants to understand everything completely, a lot of people are uncomfortable making a leap of faith. It\u2019s a good practice to help people let go a bit. Maybe we don\u2019t have to measure everything exactly, maybe we don\u2019t have to control everything completely.\u201d</p> <p>To practice fermentation, we need to multiply experiences, not just with bacteria and fungi, but also with each other. It takes human relationships to learn how to ferment, and it takes knowledge given to us through science and culture. It also takes common sense. This common sense emerges through interaction with others. In ancient Athens, strangers met at the agora, the marketplace. It was here that politics happened, where people could learn to discuss with each other. The agora was messy, it was ordinary, but it was also the foundation of Athens\u2019 democratic system. What kinds of fermented goods, I wonder, were sold in the Athenian agora, and what kinds of political conversations did they provoke?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/10/fit-in-my-40s-fermentation-gut-health\">Fit in my 40s: \u2018I hadn\u2019t realised that fermentation is so vital to the gut\u2019 | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When modernity meets its end-point and creates a world where everything is sterile, controlled and known, there will be little space for fermentation.

But it\u2019s precisely this practice that can help us come to a different way of thinking and approaching the world.

Perhaps it would be a world that lends itself to contemplation, letting us ponder the transition of life to death, rather than fearing it, hiding it away.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This article was originally published in No Tech magazine as part of a collaboration between Low-tech </em><em>magazine and nyamnyam, an art collective based in Barcelona, Spain.</em></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Aaron Vansintjan writes about food, culture</em><em> and politics and is a co-editor of Uneven Earth</em></p></li> </ul>",

Low-tech solutions for modern problems When I talk to people new to fermentation, they often ask if it\u2019s different from canning. According to Alex Lewin, author of Real Food Fermentation and Kombucha, Kefir and Beyond, fermenting is the opposite: \u201cIt\u2019s unlike canning \u2013 with canning you kill all of the microbes and seal it hermetically. With fermentation you invite the microbes you want and don\u2019t let in the ones you don\u2019t. Fermentation is diplomacy and canning is a massacre. Canning is a high-tech food technology.\u201d Canning requires glass and the ability to shape metal in very precise ways. That makes canning uniquely modern. Part of the conceit of modernity is that, to solve our problems, we need more high-tech solutions. On the other hand, fermentation is low-tech. You don\u2019t need to be an expert to preserve food, or any fancy technology. Just a bucket, some salt and trust in the world of bacteria and fungi. One of the charms of fermentation is that it can help us deal with food waste. Our modern food system is extremely wasteful, with 30-40% of food going into the landfill in the United States, with 21% occurring at a household level. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s incredibly energy-intensive: 33% of global warming-related emissions come from agriculture. If consumers were to learn how to ferment at home, they could preserve their food without having to cook or freeze it \u2013 both requiring more energy. That makes it a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem. Fear of having to care If fermentation is so easy, why isn\u2019t everyone doing it? To write this article, I reached out to friends and friends-of-friends who regularly ferment, asking them why they do it and why they think many don\u2019t. Ariadna Rodriguez and I\u00f1aki Alvarez run nyamnyam, an art collective based in Barcelona, Spain. Like many people I interviewed, theyhave been greatly inspired by Sandor Katz, writer of books like Wild Fermentation and The Art of Fermentation. So when I asked them why they think some people have negative reactions to it, they cited him: \u201cPeople do project their fears and anxieties of bacteria on fermentation. The ironic thing is it has always been a strategy for food safety.\u201d They also think it has to do with something else: people\u2019s fear of messing up. As they put it: \u201cThey\u2019re scared of having to take care of other microorganisms, they say they will have to travel, they will forget. I think it\u2019s about responsibility, a big word nowadays, because the food industry makes everything for you that just needs to go from fridge to pan.\u201d Lina and Adam Esbold, a couple from Sweden, shared similar perspectives. \u201cMost people are skeptical, they don\u2019t like the taste and are put off by the idea of healthy bacteria \u2026 Even more people simply don\u2019t care.\u201d Rosemary Liss, the artist, also thinks it has something to do with people\u2019s fears of food safety. \u201cI think the fear of contamination and making one\u2019s self sick is the biggest barrier. We grew up hearing the horror stories about botulism and canning going wrong and don\u2019t realize the fermentation process is much different.\u201d For Mark Reynolds, who runs Naughty Nettle Medicinals, \u201clack of experience or first-hand knowledge is a key part of this. There are those who try it once and have something go moldy so they won\u2019t try it again.\u201d And yet, people can also get pretty excited when they first learn about fermentation \u2013 and how little responsibility it actually requires. Lewin describes the moment when he learned about fermentation from Wild Fermentation. \u201cMy head exploded \u2013 you can do that with food? You can chop up cabbage and leave it on the counter for a month? How is that possible? Part of what appealed to me is how rebellious that is, to cut something up and not put it in the refrigerator.\u201d Making death part of life I\u2019ve often met people who tried to ferment something once, and then they either forgot about it or got scared they did something wrong. There are cupboards full of abandoned kombuchas, fridges littered with old kefir and unfed sourdough. It\u2019s easy to start fermenting, but it can quickly get dispiriting, and then embarrassing. Rodriguez and Alvarez note that many people might worry that they don\u2019t have the time to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with these microorganisms. But, they say, \u201cthe good thing is that you can always start again, you can always put new tea in the kombucha and everything will be OK. So as we say in Spanish: \u2018No hay mal que por bien no venga\u2019\u201d (there is nothing bad that can\u2019t be turned into good). Lina Esbold and Adam Karlsson say it all takes balance and going with the flow. \u201cSome weeks the fermentation gets to take more time and energy, but the opposite is also true, and we just let the cultivations whither.\u201d And that\u2019s OK, too. Lewin learned to keep his projects out in the open: \u201cOne thing I do is I leave all of my fermentation projects in plain sight. I see them every time I go in the kitchen. It\u2019s like gardening, you go out and you look at it and poke at it every once in a while.\u201d Lewin notes that if your fermentation does go bad, \u201cit will be very obvious and very visible: fluffy green spores and you throw it away. If you\u2019ve never had kombucha or kimchi, if you don\u2019t know what it tastes like and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s bad or not, you either take the leap or you find someone who has tried it before.\u201d At some point, you might get tired of it all. Simply pause your fermentation by putting it in the fridge, or better yet, in the freezer. Fermentation starters, like kefir grains or kombucha scobies, can also survive several years when you dry them. Once you\u2019re ready to start them up again, just add whatever it needs (sugar and tea for kombucha, milk for kefir, or flour for sourdough). Stinking up the aisles of the modern supermarket And yet, even if you try your best, fermentation isn\u2019t always easy to keep doing. Our jobs and school uproot us; we work 9-5 and come home exhausted. For those who work irregular hours, it\u2019s hard to build up the routine and habits needed to maintain that sourdough or make yoghurt or kefir daily. And then there\u2019s the food system. The supermarket is anathema to fermentation: live fermentation generates carbon dioxide and methane, stinking up the aisles and bursting through the packaging. In other words, it\u2019s messy and weird. Partly because our access to food is limited to what the supermarket has to offer, it\u2019s not easy to get hold of kefir grains or a kombucha mother. And when we do, it\u2019s hard to get guidance. It can be intimidating if you don\u2019t know anyone with experience fermenting. Our society is also marked by what food researchers call \u201cde-skilling\u201d. We have largely lost the food practices handed down to us over generations. What remains is a semblance of our past food cultures: fermented pickles become canned; sauces rich in character and variety become, simply, ketchup. Part of this is the industrialized food system, but another part is also the way the economy shapes our lives. Even just a few generations ago, most westerners lived in multi-generational households, children together with grandparents, several families sharing tenements, and a vibrant street culture that came from dense living arrangements and reliance on walking as the primary means of transportation. With modernity, every tradition, every routine, every relationship is constantly shifting and torn apart. And even though science has given us unprecedented ways to understand the food that we eat, it also has its limitations. It seems like every week a study comes out that overturns the guidelines on what we\u2019re supposed to eat. We\u2019ve grown up with the idea of an official expiration date \u2013 leaving our trust in food safety to some largely invisible process, determined by experts. We have the science to understand the invisible stuff going on in our kitchens and in our guts, but a cultural attitude of fear that stops us from playing with our food \u2013 an attitude that inhibits microbiomes from flourishing in our kitchens. When I talked to Jyotsana Singh, a friend, about this, she pointed out that we lack a common sense of how food spoils and what\u2019s safe or unsafe to eat. As she put it, \u201cpeople don\u2019t trust their senses\u201d. Ironic, with so much information available \u201cat our fingertips\u201d. She grew up in a family where, when concerned if the milk was OK, they wouldn\u2019t look at the expiry date but instead sniff it. Perhaps due to this common sense she grew up with, combined with a knowledge of basic chemistry and biology, she rarely has a feeling of risk or fear when making food. Through our conversation, we decided that there\u2019s an important distinction between three things. First, there\u2019s habits \u2013 the kind that allow us to ferment on a daily basis. Then, there\u2019s common sense \u2013 an intuition of what\u2019s going on under the surface, informed by today\u2019s science and cultural knowledge. Finally, there\u2019s tradition, which involves passing down knowledge about and confidence in the food we eat and make. Maybe it\u2019s a balance of these that helps foster fermentation practices. If you think about it this way, there\u2019s something very political about fermentation. Our work life makes it difficult to form daily habits. The modern food system has atrophied our cultural knowledge and traditions of food preservation practices. It makes sense that so many people find it hard to integrate into everyday life. To create a world where fermentation is the norm, we\u2019d need to change the world. Thinking with fermentation The living body is always on the point of passing over into the chemical process: oxygen, hydrogen, salt are always about to appear, but are always again sublated; and only at death or in disease is the chemical process able to prevail. The living creature is always exposed to danger, always bears within itself an other \u2026 \u2013 GW Hegel, Philosophy of Nature Thus politics \u2026 originated in the daily ferment of ordinary life in the agora. \u2013 Murray Bookchin, Urbanization Without Cities: The Rise and Decline of Citizenship As Hegel realized two centuries ago, we carry others within ourselves. What makes the body keep its integrity, surrounded by constant danger? The practice of fermentation raises these kinds of questions, and helps us think through a different ethics of being. For Rodriguez and Alvarez, getting into fermentation opened them up to seeing multiple connections in life. \u201cIt all feels as part of the same thing,\u201d they say when I ask them how fermentation is part of their daily life. \u201cEating it. Having something fermented every meal. Then taking care of all the microorganisms that coexist with us, maybe taking out the tea from the kombucha, or changing the water and adding the sugar to the water kefir, tasting how the chilis are doing fermenting in the sun, opening the miso every now and then, and so on and on.\u201d All of this, they say, helps them visualize \u201call this activity in different scales interconnected between all the agents, our bodies, the microorganisms\u201d. Fermentation also informed Lewin\u2019s approach to life. \u201cFermenting establishes a dynamic equilibrium of microbes \u2013 getting people comfortable with that is hard. In our overly determined world where everyone wants to understand everything completely, a lot of people are uncomfortable making a leap of faith. It\u2019s a good practice to help people let go a bit. Maybe we don\u2019t have to measure everything exactly, maybe we don\u2019t have to control everything completely.\u201d To practice fermentation, we need to multiply experiences, not just with bacteria and fungi, but also with each other. It takes human relationships to learn how to ferment, and it takes knowledge given to us through science and culture. It also takes common sense. This common sense emerges through interaction with others. In ancient Athens, strangers met at the agora, the marketplace. It was here that politics happened, where people could learn to discuss with each other. The agora was messy, it was ordinary, but it was also the foundation of Athens\u2019 democratic system. What kinds of fermented goods, I wonder, were sold in the Athenian agora, and what kinds of political conversations did they provoke? When modernity meets its end-point and creates a world where everything is sterile, controlled and known, there will be little space for fermentation. But there will also be little space for free thought: thinking that bubbles up out of the corners, appreciates complexity, multiplies relationships, navigates the subtle contours of life and death. Despite our scientific know-how, modern life makes fermentation unintuitive and difficult. But it\u2019s precisely this practice that can help us come to a different way of thinking and approaching the world. A world where fermentation is integrated into our daily life might be a bit messier, but it would also be more caring to the many life forms with whom we co-exist. Perhaps it would be a world that lends itself to contemplation, letting us ponder the transition of life to death, rather than fearing it, hiding it away.

On the civil side, Schuette has argued the state doesn\u2019t have a constitutional obligation to provide clean water, and it has been difficult for those suing the government to get around the defense of sovereign immunity, which shields officials from legal responsibility. In one of the largest civil cases, a federal judge granted immunity to Snyder, high ranking environmental officials and an emergency financial manager. That case consists of 12 class action suits consolidated into one large suit. Plaintiffs are asking for an independent monitor to ensure state health and environmental departments are complying with court orders. They\u2019re also seeking the establishment of a fund for 100,000 people affected by the crisis. The plaintiff\u2019s co-counsel, Michael Pitt, says he\u2019s more confident that victims will see some justice now that Nessel is in charge. \u201cShe\u2019s very dedicated to the goal of making sure the victims of state abuse and government abuse are taken care of in the proper way,\u201d he said. Still, the damage is so far-reaching that it\u2019s going to be difficult to repair, said Peter Henning, a Wayne State University Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. \u201cHow much is the state willing to commit?\u201d Henning asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the issue. Leaving all the legal niceties aside, how much is the state willing to pay?\u201d",

For Billy Wilder, who directed her in ice-cold noir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/29/my-favourite-film-double-indemnity\">Double Indemnity</a>, it was simple: \u201cShe was the best.\u201d Perhaps Sam Fuller, who gave her a memorable late film role as a fearsome rancher in Forty Guns, summed up the Stanwyck touch most completely as \u201cthe happy pertinence of professionalism and emotion\u201d.

Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, a young woman who takes revenge on a cruel world by hustling to the top of New York society using raw sex appeal and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/06/exploding-nietzsche-myths-need-dynamiting\">ruthless, Nietzschean philosophy</a>.</p> <p>Stanwyck\u2019s best role of the 30s came in maternal melodrama Stella Dallas (1937), adapted from Olive Higgins Prouty\u2019s popular novel. It\u2019s a magnificent film, closely modelled on the silent version starring Belle Bennett, and featured Anne Shirley as Stanwyck\u2019s daughter, who is increasingly mortified by her brash, working-class mother. Stanwyck had never been vain about her looks (\u201caverage nice-looking\u201d was the most she would allow) and she wasn\u2019t afraid to embrace the padded, gaudy frocks, cotton-wool jowls and floozy manners that made Stella unattractive, before tearing the audience\u2019s hearts to pieces in the rain-soaked finale. \u201cStella had to appear loud and flamboyant \u2013 with a touch of vulgarity,\u201d Stanwyck said. Stella Dallas was a triumph, and earned Stanwyck her first best actress Oscar nomination.

That wasn\u2019t even the best comedy she released that year.

In All I Desire (1953), she plays a famous actor, in There\u2019s Always Tomorrow (1956) a ritzy fashion designer, but in both films the plot allows her and her charisma to breeze back into a small town and cause emotional havoc by rekindling old flames and sparking old rivalries. The final 20 minutes of There\u2019s Always Tomorrow in particular are a masterclass in melodramatic acting, as raw as anything she did for Capra, but powerfully restrained.

The Arbor brings swirling keyboards to the early Cocteau Twins\u2019 glacial shimmer, but there\u2019s a pop sensibility to VTr or Let\u2019s Get Lost, as Graham delivers every vowel with care and precision: \u201cI\u2019m losing you every day, I know that I\u2019m losing \u2026\u201d Dark, bold, big music.",

      "bodyText": "The book I\u2019m currently reading I read several books at once, skipping restlessly from one to another. Currently Naomi Alderman\u2019s The Liar\u2019s Gospel, prompted by a tour of the Jewish objects in the Ashmolean in Oxford, guided by Rebecca Abrams; The Bank That Lived a Little, an excellent account of the ongoing goings-on at Barclays by Philip Augar; and Tara Westover\u2019s Educated, an extremely painful memoir about a Mormon childhood in Idaho. Can it really have been that bad, for so long? The book that changed my life So many, but let\u2019s settle for Mary McCarthy\u2019s The Group and Doris Lessing\u2019s The Golden Notebook. The book I wish I\u2019d written Anything by Lee Child. What page turners, what prose, what landscapes, what motorways and motels, what mythic dimensions! He does all the things I could never do, and I read, awestruck, waiting impatiently for the next. The book that most influenced my writing I think Shakespeare was the determining influence of my desire to write. I think of him every day. The book I think is most under/overrated Calling good books underrated is the kiss of death so I won\u2019t choose one. I\u2019ve never managed to read any Harry Potter, so if I call them overrated it will do nobody any harm. And I think the Tolkien cult has gone a bit too far. The book that changed my mind My mind is always changing. The last book that made me cry I cry all the time, at everything. Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, WB Yeats. The last book that made me laugh I don\u2019t laugh much, but I did laugh at Muriel Spark\u2019s disastrous dinner party novel, Symposium. The book I couldn\u2019t finish Thomas Mann\u2019s The Magic Mountain. I\u2019ve begun it many times, but never reached the summit. Not enough oxygen. The book I give as a gift I don\u2019t give books very often \u2013 it\u2019s so personal \u2013 but Sarah Moss\u2019s extraordinary Cold Earth was a surefire success with an archaeologist friend. I gave my grandchildren so many copies of Dr Seuss\u2019s The Sneetches and Other Stories that I may have put them off reading for life. My earliest reading memory The Radiant Way, the primer with which my newly demobbed father patiently taught me to read. My comfort read Anthony Trollope.

Because of course Kosa\u2019s most passionate relationships are not with women \u2013 like his new animal-doctor squeeze or even her comely teenage daughter \u2013 but with other blokes. There\u2019s a stern gym-owning father whose love is always withheld, a paraplegic kid brother who needs bucking up, and even a worthy opponent in the ring \u2013 all the worthier because he truly understands the hero\u2019s worth as a fighter. Rounding out the archetypes of masculinity is Janusz Chabior\u2019s sidekick trainer who has Tourette\u2019s syndrome and spouts obscenities nonstop, a condition played strictly for laughs in a way that an American film wouldn\u2019t dare to do these days.",

Divorce is one of the spectres that children dread, a bogeyman, a babadook under the bed, clutching a written demand from the child support agency, a new stepmother or father on its arm.</p> <p>I say this not to make all the divorced parents feel bad. I have survived depression and anxiety in adolescence and adulthood, though both have at times have been severe, and life events unrelated to my parents\u2019 separation played a major part in those episodes. My parents divorced two decades ago, and have been separated for more of my life than they were together. I have a good relationship with both of them. They are supportive and loving, and I feel very lucky. I know people whose parents remained unhappily together, whose childhood homes were infested with a leaden, unspoken misery, whose parents were openly unfaithful. These people have also battled mental health issues. Staying together for the kids can be just as harmful, if not more so.</p> <p>Knowing, however, the impact of parental separation on child and adolescent mental health better equips professionals to help children deal with it, and arguably makes it less likely that they will require so much mental health treatment from the NHS in adulthood. Some 37% of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/22/what-is-happening-with-childrens-mental-health\" title=\"\">more than 338,000</a> under-18s referred to NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in England in 2017 were <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-children-mental-health-services-cuts-or-closure-third-downsizing-survey-staff-conservatives-a7749616.html\" title=\"\">denied any help</a> at all. Leave children floundering and they will flounder as adults. Divorce is lonely for all involved, especially children. Having counselling, or at least a grown-up to talk to can change everything. To expect you to soldier on and be brave seems to be a curious misunderstanding of child behaviour, and yet that is what was expected of most people I have met in adulthood whose parents split up when they were old enough to remember it vividly. We owe children better than that. Divorce may be unexceptional in today\u2019s society, but childhood depression should be, bad age or not.</p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p>",

I say this not to make all the divorced parents feel bad. I have survived depression and anxiety in adolescence and adulthood, though both have at times have been severe, and life events unrelated to my parents\u2019 separation played a major part in those episodes. My parents divorced two decades ago, and have been separated for more of my life than they were together. I have a good relationship with both of them. They are supportive and loving, and I feel very lucky. I know people whose parents remained unhappily together, whose childhood homes were infested with a leaden, unspoken misery, whose parents were openly unfaithful. These people have also battled mental health issues. Staying together for the kids can be just as harmful, if not more so. Knowing, however, the impact of parental separation on child and adolescent mental health better equips professionals to help children deal with it, and arguably makes it less likely that they will require so much mental health treatment from the NHS in adulthood. Some 37% of the more than 338,000 under-18s referred to NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in England in 2017 were denied any help at all. Leave children floundering and they will flounder as adults. Divorce is lonely for all involved, especially children. Having counselling, or at least a grown-up to talk to can change everything. To expect you to soldier on and be brave seems to be a curious misunderstanding of child behaviour, and yet that is what was expected of most people I have met in adulthood whose parents split up when they were old enough to remember it vividly. We owe children better than that. Divorce may be unexceptional in today\u2019s society, but childhood depression should be, bad age or not. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author",

That indeed is the basis of the backstop, a backstop confined to very limited areas, primarily those necessary for North-South cooperation under the Good Friday agreement. From this point of view, the DUP\u2019s hostility to the backstop is self-defeating since a hard border could lead nationalists in Northern Ireland to call for Irish unity so as to achieve a closer relationship with nationalists in the Republic. The backstop, paradoxically, is a guarantee for Northern Ireland not a threat. In its report on Brexit, the EU select committee of the House of Lords declared that the EU was \u201cin effect, part of the glue holding the United Kingdom together since 1997\u201d. That glue is now coming unstuck. Membership of the EU put us in effect under a codified constitution via treaties constraining both government and parliament. With Brexit, Britain will once more have an unprotected constitution in which our rights as citizens and the relationships between the different parts of the United Kingdom come, once again, to be at the mercy of a sovereign parliament, which, except when there is a minority government, is under the control of the executive. Might not the very nakedness of our post-Brexit condition provide an impetus for Britain to follow almost every other democracy by enacting a constitution? Might not Brexit prove to be our constitutional moment? \u2022 Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King\u2019s College London. His book Beyond Brexit: Towards a British Constitution will be published by Taurs on 7 February.",

Matt Mahowald, an Los Angeles-based nutritionist who has worked with top boxers like Amir Khan and Vasyl Lomachenko, believes a vegan boxer would have difficulty getting the necessary level of protein to recover from strenuous training, especially if they were trying to lose weight at the same time. He has his clients eating lean meat, eggs, complex carbohydrates and plenty of healthy fats.</p> <p>\u201cI like my guys to have one gram of protein per pound of body weight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even for a guys who\u2019s 130lbs, a junior lightweight, that\u2019s still a lot of protein: about four good sized chicken breasts per day.

Your sources are beans, legumes, quinoa, hemp, peas and rice, but they\u2019re mainly carbohydrates. A plant-based diet for an athlete is really difficult.\u201d</p> <p>But Jennings has no time for doubters. He\u2019s doing it for himself.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not fighting to prove anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just proud of who I am. When I have a great performance I say, \u2018See, I guess I don\u2019t need meat.\u2019 When I lift something that\u2019s heavy that people say I couldn\u2019t do, I say, \u2018See, I guess I don\u2019t need meat.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Still, he may be helping to set an unlikely trend in this bloodiest of sports. Bernard Hopkins, the former middleweight king, went vegan six months ago after Jennings helped convince him of the health benefits. David Haye stopped eating animal products around the same time as Jennings, though it must be said the change did not correspond with his period of greatest career success.

      "body": "<p>Aden Grace Sawyer is 18 years old, \u201ca serious girl, an asker of questions\u201d. Alienated from her comfortable suburban California surroundings by family breakdown \u2013 her father has left home following an affair, and her mother has slipped into alcoholism \u2013 she turns to Islam for consolation. Her choice appears to be guided in equal measure by a genuinely spiritual urge for submission to the transcendent, and a more prosaic youthful defiance. Still in the Bay Area, she dons Afghan-style shalwar kameez, and crops her hair rather than wear a hijab. Next she plans to migrate to a godly country. Because Decker, her blustering boyfriend and travelling companion, has Afghan roots and cousins in Karachi, they head for Pakistan.</p> <p>Aden\u2019s father is a professor of Islamic studies at Berkeley, and has warned her of the limited \u201cpossibilities for a woman in that part of the world\u201d. Aden has too much attitude to accept any sort of limitation and so reinvents herself, improbably but credibly, as a boy. With bandaged breasts, and \u201chidden by her clear and perfect strangeness\u201d, she becomes Suleyman, Qur\u2019anic student and potential holy warrior. Soon she\u2019s attending a madrasa in the tribal areas of the Pakistani-Afghan borderlands. \u201cSo far away,\u201d she whispers triumphantly. Too far for unlucky Decker, who only planned an adventure holiday. To sustain her role, Aden now refuses to sleep with him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Very unusually, the book engages deeply with the purist attractions of a religious life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The \u201cwar on terror\u201d theme can quickly reduce even great writers to cliche and worse. (John Updike\u2019s lamentable <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/23/fiction.johnupdike\" title=\"\">Terrorist</a></em> may be the worst of the genre.) However, John Wray\u2019s fifth novel, <em>Godsend</em>, is entirely convincing, in part because he has done his research. As a journalist he travelled to Afghanistan in 2001 to study the case of \u201cAmerican Taliban\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/10/john-walker-lindh-american-taliban-father\" title=\"\">John Walker Lindh</a>. While there he heard a rumour concerning a young western woman fighting in men\u2019s disguise.

      "bodyText": "Aden Grace Sawyer is 18 years old, \u201ca serious girl, an asker of questions\u201d. Alienated from her comfortable suburban California surroundings by family breakdown \u2013 her father has left home following an affair, and her mother has slipped into alcoholism \u2013 she turns to Islam for consolation. Her choice appears to be guided in equal measure by a genuinely spiritual urge for submission to the transcendent, and a more prosaic youthful defiance. Still in the Bay Area, she dons Afghan-style shalwar kameez, and crops her hair rather than wear a hijab. Next she plans to migrate to a godly country. Because Decker, her blustering boyfriend and travelling companion, has Afghan roots and cousins in Karachi, they head for Pakistan. Aden\u2019s father is a professor of Islamic studies at Berkeley, and has warned her of the limited \u201cpossibilities for a woman in that part of the world\u201d. Aden has too much attitude to accept any sort of limitation and so reinvents herself, improbably but credibly, as a boy. With bandaged breasts, and \u201chidden by her clear and perfect strangeness\u201d, she becomes Suleyman, Qur\u2019anic student and potential holy warrior. Soon she\u2019s attending a madrasa in the tribal areas of the Pakistani-Afghan borderlands. \u201cSo far away,\u201d she whispers triumphantly. Too far for unlucky Decker, who only planned an adventure holiday. To sustain her role, Aden now refuses to sleep with him. The \u201cwar on terror\u201d theme can quickly reduce even great writers to cliche and worse. (John Updike\u2019s lamentable Terrorist may be the worst of the genre.) However, John Wray\u2019s fifth novel, Godsend, is entirely convincing, in part because he has done his research. As a journalist he travelled to Afghanistan in 2001 to study the case of \u201cAmerican Taliban\u201d John Walker Lindh. While there he heard a rumour concerning a young western woman fighting in men\u2019s disguise. The plot also makes use of an Afghan antecedent \u2013 the bacha posh tradition, whereby a daughter in a home with no sons may take on the role of a boy. Beyond its solid grounding in Afghan and Islamic knowledge, this unlikely tale is rendered plausible by Wray\u2019s consummate skills as a writer. The various Muslim characters \u2013 cynics and fanatics, manipulative adults and lost children \u2013 are each clearly distinct and treated seriously and empathetically. Godsend is certainly not another tired \u201cradicalisation\u201d narrative. Aden brings her naivety and arrogance with her, lamenting \u201chow far from the true faith the country had fallen\u201d, and most of the madrasa officials aim to challenge them. \u201cThere is no humility in the righteous self-love of the mujahid,\u201d says one. \u201cThere is no modesty in it, no denial of desire, no restraint.\u201d Very unusually, the novel engages deeply with the purist attractions of a religious life. There is as much delight as horror in the world Aden leaps into: in \u201cthe beauty of austerity\u201d, the morning prayer which \u201ccalls the whole world into being\u201d, and the spiritual-poetic rhythms of Qur\u2019anic recitation. \u201cIn the very best moments her own sight seemed to dim and she could feel the verses buzzing as they passed between her teeth, and that was all she wanted or could ever want.\u201d The reader lives enough within her perspective to believe, in the end, her claim that \u201cthe love she harboured for the world was free of sin\u201d. Though carefully understated, Aden\u2019s relationship with her father, whom she wishes to \u201cerase\u201d, is central to the psychodrama. \u201cThe Teacher\u201d, as she scornfully calls him, studies Islam but laughs at the Muslims. The charismatic Ziar, who persuades her to cross the border to fight, is by contrast deadly serious, and the love she develops for him \u2013 beautifully complicated by her gender deception \u2013 veers between romantic and filial. Once in the war zone she commits irreversible acts in bad as well as good faith. Thereafter \u201cthere was no way out for her but straight ahead\u201d. A furious narrative momentum carries the story to its devastating conclusion. Along the way Wray includes a masterful 9/11 scene. \u201cSome sort of conflagration\u201d in Manhattan is reported on a field radio, though its significance for Afghanistan is not immediately recognised. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Pashtuns that did it,\u201d mutter the Pashtun fighters.

Much like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peppa-pig\" title=\"\">Peppa Pig</a>, which it resembles a little too closely, the character design, supersaturated colour palette and highly stylised animation have an easily decipherable, eminently replicable simplicity, all the better to appeal to young minds and spawn a million items of merchandise.

Troop leader Duggee awards them to those who have completed tasks such as running an obstacle course.</p> <p>Yet every episode is salted with grownup-skewed gags \u2013 for instance, references to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08vy8sn/hey-duggee-series-2-19-the-river-badge\">Apocalypse Now</a> appear in an episode about going down a river.

Before you know it, they\u2019re fully grown and off to do gap years, study mechanical engineering or get jobs in the financial sector. The climax is, as fans of the show would expect, a rousing rendition of that EDM floor-filler, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05N2jqFHc8\" title=\"\">The Stick Song</a>, a ditty as infectious as nits in a playground, featuring lyrics that go: \u201cStick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, sticky sticky stick stick!\u201d ad infinitum.

(Everybody\u2019s welcome in this inclusive, anthropomorphic utopia.) Alexander Armstrong narrates in plummy, jolly tones, animator and assistant director Sander Jones does Duggee\u2019s droll \u201cwoofs\u201d, while young actors voice the rest of the cast. This package, assembled for theatrical release, collates several of the show\u2019s best episodes and it\u2019s not hard to see why the series is so treasured by fans of all ages. Much like Peppa Pig, which it resembles a little too closely, the character design, supersaturated colour palette and highly stylised animation have an easily decipherable, eminently replicable simplicity, all the better to appeal to young minds and spawn a million items of merchandise. Every plot revolves around an effort by the troop to win badges, like Cubs or Brownies. Troop leader Duggee awards them to those who have completed tasks such as running an obstacle course. Yet every episode is salted with grownup-skewed gags \u2013 for instance, references to Apocalypse Now appear in an episode about going down a river. Another richly amusing segment features tadpoles repulsed by the suggestion that they will grow up some day, experience voice changes that will cause them to \u201cribbit\u201d, and spout arms and legs. Before you know it, they\u2019re fully grown and off to do gap years, study mechanical engineering or get jobs in the financial sector. The climax is, as fans of the show would expect, a rousing rendition of that EDM floor-filler, The Stick Song, a ditty as infectious as nits in a playground, featuring lyrics that go: \u201cStick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, sticky sticky stick stick!\u201d ad infinitum. I want it played at my funeral.",

The Saints had to crawl out of a 14-0 hole against the Philadelphia Eagles last week.

In fact, Los Angeles brought in a second kicker, Nick Rose, to handle kickoffs and limit Patterson\u2019s chances (he would end up returning just one kick, for 23 yards). In a game that may well come down to the wire, one huge return could end up being key.</p> <p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Patriots 31-34 Chiefs</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s always odd when politicians make an appeal to \u201cthe history books\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s like an actor making an appeal to reviewers midway through the film. But it took on a new surreal meaning on Monday, when Theresa May asked us to consider what the history books would say about the vote on her deal. It takes truly great commitment to your own mediocrity to sort through a catalogue of your own mistakes, find the largest and most avoidable, and then tell the gods of history that yep, this national humiliation is the way you want future generations to remember you. It\u2019s like calling up the Oxford English Dictionary and requesting that \u201cto cock something up irrevocably, to the point that people feel a pang of despair when they hear your name\u201d be for ever known as \u201cdoing a Theresa\u201d. If, like me, you\u2019re curious as to what history books will make of this period, then good news! I\u2019ve managed to simulate a completely accurate version of the future using the latest futurologist technology and got my hands on a Key Stage 2 history book from 2070, looking back on 2019 in a course that they call \u201cThe Age of Screaming, Stupidity and the Crying With Laughter Emoji\u201d. Here\u2019s how our era is remembered in 50 years\u2019 time \u2026 The People of Britain in 2019 Back in 2019, Britain was much larger \u2013 it included Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and Norwich (now the modern-day Underwater Kingdom of Delia Smith) was still above sea level. Britain\u2019s people were simple and angry, all of the time, and they believed in many mysterious superstitions: they thought that cancer could be cured if enough people grew moustaches in November, that cuddling a stuffed meerkat would bring them luck in their car insurance, and that you could effect a miraculous epiphany in Donald Trump by messaging him on Twitter. This silliness was borne out by the pop culture of the era: the most popular song was about building a city on thousands of sausage rolls, the most popular social media star was an egg, and the most popular pastime was blindfolding yourself and driving into traffic. If you want to imagine what it was like to live in this era, find the most expensive razor in the house and throw it into the toilet while shouting, \u201cTake that, Gillette, you feminazis!\u201d Many silly things happened during this era, but the silliest without a doubt was Brexit. But What Does Brexit Mean? No one knows for sure. Technically it means \u201cBritain leaving the European Union\u201d, but depending on context, it\u2019s clear that it was also used as a verb (as in, \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake Nigel, you\u2019ve Brexited the toilet again\u201d), and as an adjective (\u201cThis Wetherspoons is well Brexit, there\u2019s blood on the seats\u201d). The nuances have been lost in the sands of time \u2013 some sources say that at the time Brexit meant leaving the customs union, some say it meant fewer \u201cbrown people\u201d, some say it just meant having more Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys on the telly. In 2019, it must have had a clear definition as a government would never carry out something that affected the lives of 70 million people based on a vague word whose meaning no one could agree on. Why Did Brexit Happen? Starting in 2010, the British government carried out a policy called \u201causterity\u201d. Austerity was a process by which the money that traditionally went to things like schools, hospitals and hungry people, instead went to a man called Fred Goodwin. Nobody is entirely sure why, but at the time experts agreed that this was an extremely sensible course of action, just as in the middle ages experts thought that leeches would get rid of dysentery.

During this period, she had the opportunity to rectify the many mistakes of her predecessor, and to tackle the fundamental issues in British society that had led to the Brexit vote. If she had achieved this, she would have been remembered as one of the greatest prime ministers of all time. Unfortunately, May is most famous today for: alienating the EU; setting arbitrary red lines in Brexit negotiations; triggering article 50 without a plan; calling a pointless election that lost the Tories their majority; negotiating a Brexit deal just a few months before the deadline that didn\u2019t have the support of her cabinet, let alone her party, let alone parliament; trying to force that deal through parliament through deceit, blackmail and petty bribery; and finally for losing the vote on that deal by a historically massive margin. May was placed in an impossible position by history, but her actions somehow managed to exacerbate the situation to the point that it pushed the country to financial and societal ruin.

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet confirms his status as the floppy-fringed face of young Hollywood with another Oscar-bait performance, while Steve Carell tries out another \u201cserious\u201d role. Felix van Groeningen, of Broken Circle Breakdown, directs.</p> <h2>Mary Queen of Scots (15)</h2> <p><em>(Josie Rourke, 2018, UK) 124 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riSROsdT-f0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/riSROsdT-f0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Hot on the heels of The Favourite: Mary v Elizabeth. This drama of court intrigue is a different kettle of fish, however; dark and conspiratorial.

Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet confirms his status as the floppy-fringed face of young Hollywood with another Oscar-bait performance, while Steve Carell tries out another \u201cserious\u201d role. Felix van Groeningen, of Broken Circle Breakdown, directs. Mary Queen of Scots (15) (Josie Rourke, 2018, UK) 124 mins Hot on the heels of The Favourite: Mary v Elizabeth. This drama of court intrigue is a different kettle of fish, however; dark and conspiratorial. Margot Robbie plays Elizabeth, the Tudor monarch who ambushes her Scottish cousin (Saoirse Ronan) when it becomes apparent that she is angling to become heir to the English throne. Hale County This Morning, This Evening (15) (RaMell Ross, 2018, US) 76 mins Part of the recent wave of outstanding African-American documentaries, this image-heavy, poetic film essay concentrates on the eponymous county in Alabama, a deep south slave state famously photographed in the 1940s by Walker Evans. Director RaMell Ross creates a tapestry composed of tiny miniatures and brief moments, along with more involved accounts of one or two locals. The Favourite (15) (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2018, Ire/UK/US) 119 mins This laceratingly scabrous account of power struggles at the court of Queen Anne looks to be faltering slightly in the awards race, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Three superb performances from Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone lead the way; a brilliant script, extravagant visuals and general air of berserk hysteria all combine to create Lanthimos\u2019s best film to date. Mary Poppins Returns (U) (Rob Marshall, 2018, US) 130 mins There may still be just enough holiday spirit around to justify a trip to see the sequel/reboot of Disney\u2019s 1964 blockbuster. It is machine-tooled for Christmas, with generous lashings of goodwill to all, even if Emily Blunt\u2019s Poppins is somewhat harsher in tone than Julie Andrews. Still, it\u2019s the proverbial spoonful of sugar. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Azealia Banks Seven years on from her breakthrough hit, 212, rapper Azealia Banks has become better known for her beefs than her bangers. Zayn, Elon Musk, Lana Del Rey and Sarah Palin are just some of the people she has had high-profile altercations with, a switch in focus that\u2019s meant her music has suffered.

Part of the Roundhouse\u2019s In the Round series, An Evening of Words and Music promises, well, some spoken word and some, you know, music. There will also likely be some stories from her many collaborations, including REM and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Roundhouse, NW1, Friday 25 January Death Cab for Cutie For some, Ben Gibbard and his band of not-so-merry men will always be defined as plaid shirt-wearing, Garden State-watching, mopey emo kids. They know it, too: last year\u2019s ninth album, Thank You for Today, fully embraced warm nostalgia, offering timeless, MOR melodies and a healthy dose of crumpled melancholia.

The Guardian saw the large cod, estimated to be about 30 to 40 years old, floating about 1km downstream from where another large cod died on Thursday. After three days of temperatures over 40C, the temperature is due to drop to 24C overnight. A temperature drop can lead to algal blooms dying or rapidly de-oxygenating river pools during the night as they go into a reverse photosynthesis. The major fish kill on 7 January followed a heatwave and a sudden drop in temperature to 14C. Locals are patrolling the river looking for signs of a repeat incident. The NSW Department of Primary Industries has kept a team of fish clean-up experts in Menindee in case of a new outbreak. They have been out before dawn looking for dead fish. Earlier on Friday, the commissioner heading the South Australian royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan offered to extend his inquiry to encompass the fish kill at Menindee, after the New South Wales government appeared to blame SA for the draining of the lakes. The commissioner\u2019s offer is understood to have been rejected by the SA attorney general, Vickie Chapman. Bret Walker SC is due to hand his report to the SA government within days, and it is expected to deliver a scathing assessment of both the management of the plan by the Murray Darling Basin Authority and the underpinning water recovery targets that aim to restore the basin\u2019s health. But at this stage there is no indication from the SA government about when it will be released and and there are fears the Liberal government could seek to hold it up until after the NSW election. \u201cIt is my view that the whole report should be published immediately,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe public interest demands it.

The government says it will release Walker\u2019s report on a departmental website and intends to shut down the royal commission website by 30 March. Walker has argued this is out of step with normal procedure and would result in submissions and transcript to his inquiry no longer being available.

He supposed that genes must take the form of a \u201chuge molecule\u201d containing a \u201cminiature code\u201d to direct the subsequent development of the organism. Francis Crick and James Watson, inspired by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s work, later proved him right when they, along with Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, discovered the structure of DNA.

Sneinton Hermitage refers to a set of caves that were once inhabited by a religious order, and the 15-foot steel dragon that is partially hidden in the trees nearby is the work of local artist Robert Stubley. The tunnel in the park Nottingham sits on a vast sandstone escarpment in which there are extensive networks of manmade caves, some of which were in use for work and even habitation until the second world war. The tunnel is evidence of the historical divide between rich and poor in Nottingham: it was designed by 19th century architect TC Hine as a route for horse-drawn carriages to travel from the prestigious Park area to the west of the city centre, through to Derby Road. It is now used as pedestrian access from the Park to through to Derby road, an area recently regenerated by EU funding. Pryzm nightclub The building opened in 1925 as the Palais de Dance, and sits at the junction of Glasshouse Street and Lower Parliament Street, a key thoroughfare into the city from the East side. Nottingham train station from Karlsruhe Friendship Tram Bridge This is the point at which the train lines and the tram network meet, bringing together the mid-nineteenth-century Midlands railway structures with modern-day infrastructure. Express Office portico This building housed the Nottingham Daily Express (1918-1953), known for its radical and non-conformist leanings. The building is one of hundreds designed by Watson Fothergill in Nottingham, whose neo-Gothic style characterises much of central Nottingham. The building is now offices, but its portico often offers unofficial shelter for Nottingham\u2019s homeless people. The Exchange, central Nottingham The eighteenth-century building is the crossing point for central Nottingham\u2019s pedestrians, who criss-cross the old market place as they go about their business. Honeycomb Alley One of a small number of alleys that are woven through Nottingham\u2019s centre, creating a set of hidden spaces next to the central shopping zones. Honeycomb alley houses an independent bookshop. Bottle Lane from Waterstones The glass walls and industrial-style escalators move people from one zone to another, while the revealed mechanisms of the escalators reference Nottingham\u2019s industrial past. The cut-through joins two transitional points together: the Old Market Square area, and the Lace Market.

She was the better player today, particularly in the latter stages of that final set - she had more firepower, more weaponry. She was braver, those second serves were quite outstanding and she took more risks. The fact she was able to push Wozniacki right behind the baseline on those second serves said it all. Maria went after it and it paid off today.<br><br>\u201cThis really was a cracker of a match. In many ways, the ball striking between the two of them between Konta and Muguruza was even more mesmerising whereas this had dips and flows. I thought it was interesting to hear Sharapova say she hasn\u2019t had much opportunity to play the top players in the last 2-3 years, but that it was she had trained for and it was rewarding to get that job done on the last point today. Maria had to work hard for that win today but I thought she was the better player.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c417ea0e4b00173154a680a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T07:22:14.683Z\">7.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WTA_insider/status/1086160846512828416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Maria Sharapova with a vintage performance to end Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s title defense.

A 179kph ace at deuce shifts the momentum Wozniacki\u2019s way but then Sharapova plays arguably her point of the match, drilling line after line, working Wozniacki ragged until the error materialises. <strong>From the second deuce Sharapova forces a third break point and this time she takes it! </strong>She climbs into a weak second serve, sending Wozniacki wide then pulverising the forehand into the open court.

Yes please!</p> <p>Such is the depth of women\u2019s tennis at the moment that a blockbuster is lurking in every segment of every draw but this is the biggest match-up of AO 2019 so far, 2008 winner Maria Sharapova taking on defending champion Caroline Wozniacki for a place in the last 16 of the year\u2019s first grand slam.</p> <p>Wozniacki will start as favourite. The world number three has won at least one title each season since 2008 and finally broke her grand slam duck in Melbourne a year ago. </p> <p>But there are doubts. Wozniacki revealed late last season she now has to manage the remainder of her career with rheumatoid arthritis and she arrived in Australia after a disappointing warm-up tournament in Auckland. </p> <p>Despite her ubiquity off court Sharapova is something of an unknown quantity on it. The Russian is seeded 30, a reflection of her inability to return to the top echelon of the game following her suspension for doping at the AO back in 2016. Now 31, Sharapova has battled injuries in recent months, retiring from her Grand Slam warm-up event in Shenzhen at the quarter-final stage. While she remains a sporting megastar, since 2015 Sharapova has won just one tour title and failed to pass the quarters in a slam. </p> <p><strong>Everything is on schedule at Rod Laver Arena and set for a 3.30pm start.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7090f8a1d56359f9881e1fa7da64f44945648a1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7090f8a1d56359f9881e1fa7da64f44945648a1e/0_0_2236_1496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Wozniacki faces the biggest test of her Australian Open title defence against Maria Sharapova.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Wozniacki faces the biggest test of her Australian Open title defence against Maria Sharapova.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Prange/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-18T04:01:21.814Z\">at 4.01am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s probably all you need from me for now. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be more reaction and further AO goodness shortly when the Nadal vs De Minaur liveblog fires up. Until then, thank you for your company, and goodnight! Former British number one and Eurosport UK tennis expert Annabel Croft has had her say, and I agree with every word. \u201cIt was a huge win for Maria Sharapova and a thoroughly deserved one. She was the better player today, particularly in the latter stages of that final set - she had more firepower, more weaponry. She was braver, those second serves were quite outstanding and she took more risks. The fact she was able to push Wozniacki right behind the baseline on those second serves said it all. Maria went after it and it paid off today. \u201cThis really was a cracker of a match. In many ways, the ball striking between the two of them between Konta and Muguruza was even more mesmerising whereas this had dips and flows. I thought it was interesting to hear Sharapova say she hasn\u2019t had much opportunity to play the top players in the last 2-3 years, but that it was she had trained for and it was rewarding to get that job done on the last point today. Maria had to work hard for that win today but I thought she was the better player.\u201d That\u2019s a result that has major ramifications for the WTA Rankings. Wozniacki left Melbourne last year as world number one, began this tournament ranked three, but falling so early this time around will see her plummet to no better than ninth when the next standings are published. Sharapova looked up for that victory from the opening serve, and probably would have won more convincingly had she been able to curb her enthusiasm early in a number of rallies curtailed by unnecessary errors. Her power game - especially on her forehand - was awesome, and even Wozniacki\u2019s famed defensive prowess was no match over the two and a half hours. Phew! That was gripping. Wozniacki becomes the highest seed in either singles draw to leave this Australian Open. Next up for Sharapova, Australia\u2019s Ash Barty. Sharapova on court with Brett Philips: I knew I was going to get a tough match. I haven\u2019t played many matches in the past year so it was really rewarding to win that last point. Experience is priceless but you still have to work for it because the girl on the other side has just as much.\u201d Third set: *Sharapova 5-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Wozniacki serving to stay in the championship but Sharapova is now in to gear, hammering ball after ball back at the Dane, some winners, some provoking errors. At 30-40 Sharapova engineers her first match point but Wozniacki holds her nerve in a gutsy 18-shot rally. More brute force from Sharapova at deuce creates a second match point, and this time she sees it home, monstering another poor second serve before pounding away until the dam broke. Awesome hitting, huge result, superb match. Third set: *Sharapova 5-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Vintage Sharapova, consolidating the break with a love hold. Power turned up to 11 from the Russian from the back of the court. One game from upsetting the defending champ. It\u2019s worth remembering Sharapova\u2019s seeded 30 this AO, Serena 16, Muguruza 18, while Venus and Azarenka were both unseeded. The women\u2019s draw is wild right now. Third set: Sharapova 4-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Bosh! Wozniacki\u2019s early-set vim has evaporated but Sharapova\u2019s relentless hitting hasn\u2019t. Two ferocious returns set up the game at 0-30, then a clean return winner at 15-30 lands two break points. The first is squandered with yet another unforced error searching for a winner wasn\u2019t there before Wozniacki defends the second with some trademark court coverage. A 179kph ace at deuce shifts the momentum Wozniacki\u2019s way but then Sharapova plays arguably her point of the match, drilling line after line, working Wozniacki ragged until the error materialises. From the second deuce Sharapova forces a third break point and this time she takes it! She climbs into a weak second serve, sending Wozniacki wide then pulverising the forehand into the open court. Massive moment in this battle. Third set: *Sharapova 3-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova has crafted so many beautiful points without finding the winner and the opening point of this game is a case in point, pulling Wozniacki one way then the other but drilling the knockout blow into the net with the open court at her mercy. She earns the next two points with more controlled aggression but a double fault and another unnecessarily long forehand sends the game to deuce. Wozniacki cannot capitalise though, and this deciding set remains on serve. Third set: Sharapova 2-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Four unforced errors in a row from Sharapova give Wozniacki some breathing space as the match ticks over into two-hours duration. The unforced error count now 40-19 in Wozniacki\u2019s favour. Third set: *Sharapova 2-2, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova matches Wozniacki\u2019s confident hold with one of her own. Perhaps also a dip in intensity from Wozniacki following her aggressive start to the set. Grigor Dimitrov is now two sets up over Thomas Fabbiano and on his way to the fourth round you\u2019d think. Seeded 20 the hardcourt specialist is a dangerous sleeper. Third set: Sharapova 1-2, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Another confident hold for Wozniacki who maintains her attacking intent in this final set. Third set: *Sharapova 1-1, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Wozniacki must have given herself a talking-to between sets because she has come out firing in this decider. From nowhere she is setting the tempo in attack and hustling down every ball in defence. Sharapova has to battle hard to 30-30 despite landing four first serves before Wozniacki lets her off the hook with a couple of cheap points to concede the game and induce a huge roar from her opponent. This one is coming to the boil nicely. Third set: Sharapova 0-1, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Woah! The most assertive and clinical game of the match from Wozniacki. For the first time today she looked the aggressor, serving powerfully, looking to open the court and strike winners on every point, cruising to a confidence-boosting hold. What has Sharapova got in response? Slight delay to the third set while Sharapova takes a comfort break. Elsewhere, Sloane Stephens and Grigor Dimitrov are both up a set in their third round matches. Here we go then, a one set shootout for the right to take on Ash Barty in round four. Second set: *Sharapova 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Serving to stay in the set Sharapova slips to 15-30 but a superb serve wide to Wozniacki\u2019s backhand levels the score. A double fault then hands Wozniacki a set point that the Dane accepts simply by keeping the ballin play and waiting for Sharapova to make a mistake, which she does, overhitting for the umpteenth time trying to hurry-up a straightforward rally. Huge moment in this contest and a let-off for the third seed. Second set: Sharapova 4-5, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) It\u2019s not just by using too much power that Sharapova is keeping Wozniacki alive. At 0-15 she wastes a golden opportunity with an unnecessary drop shot into the net after setting up the point beautifully from the baseline. At 30-30 Sharapova commits another unforced error allowing Wozniacki to serve out for a vital hold. A reminder this is round three! The quality and intensity of this contest is worthy of a much grander stage. Second set: *Sharapova 4-4, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova\u2019s unforced errors are really keeping Wozniacki in this match. Time after time she throws away promising situations with loose swings of the racquet with little need to shorten the points. Such sloppiness leads to 30-30 in a service game she appears to be dominating, at which point Wozniacki unloads from the baseline to hammer a backhand down to the line to force a break point. Under pressure, Sharapova ups the ante, pulling out the fastest serve of the match (183kph) to steer her back to safety. Second set: Sharapova 3-4, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Two sets in a row now that Wozniacki has seen an early break erased and Sharapova once again puts her serve under pressure, firing deep and flat returns to take it to 30-30. Sharapova then hands Wozniacki the game with two loose low-percentage hits where safer options were on offer. 25 winners, 26 unforced errors for Sharapova tells the story of this match so far. Second set: *Sharapova 3-3, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova backs up that break with a hold. Again her monster forehand is to the fore but she turns 15-0 to 30-0 with a deft backhand crosscourt that finds the tightest of angles then drills a stinger of a backhand down the line to seal the game. Momentum once again all with the Russian. Second set: Sharapova 2-3, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Sharapova is not leaving anything in the locker room, smashing anything in her arc with brute force. Inevitably there are winners and errors, a pair of each setting up 30-30 without Wozniacki contributing greatly to the game. The Dane eventually features but it\u2019s to overhit a crosscourt forehand to concede a break point. Sharapova then monsters a second serve return to set up an easy point. You get the sense that if Sharapova can channel her power game this match is hers for the taking. Second set: *Sharapova 1-3, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) After that previous service game wobble Sharapova steadies the ship with a rapid hold to love. Second set: Sharapova 0-3, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Wozniacki\u2019s service games remain at the extremes. Her second serves are meat and drink to Sharapova\u2019s range and power but the first serves, when they land, are now commonly leading to rallies ending in the Dane\u2019s favour. Her ability to read Sharapova\u2019s power and repel it until the error materialises is becoming a feature. Despite Sharapova playing the aggressor it isn\u2019t always well-placed aggression as 22-11 unforced errors would attest. Second set: *Sharapova 0-2, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Three double faults from Sharapova set up two break points, but Wozniacki only needs one, defending superbly from the back of the court and provoking the backhand error. What a weird and potentially confidence-destroying service game that was from Sharapova. Second set: Sharapova 0-1, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) The roof has closed between sets, which the commentators on TV suggest should favour Wozniacki. The early signs aren\u2019t conclusive with Sharapova continuing to attack the Dane\u2019s serve, especially the second serve. That second serve win percentage still lingers at 33% which is unsustainable against an opponent like Sharapova, but the Russian pushes too hard too often, handing the third seed three gifts to set up a much needed service hold. First set: *Sharapova 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Five games in a row for the Russian superstar and she bolts to the opening set. At 40-0 this was becoming the most powerful service game of the afternoon for Sharapova but a couple of sloppy errors made things interesting at 40-30 at which point the afterburners returned and those massive forehands blitzed Wozniacki from the baseline. The defending champion looks shellshocked after watching her 1-4 lead disintegrate. First set: Sharapova 5-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) This is looking a little dicey for Wozniacki now. Her first serve of the game is just 150kph and allows Sharapova to dictate the point. The second point is at the 30th seed\u2019s mercy as well but an unforced error brings the Dane level, but a couple of weak second serves later and Sharapova has two break points - the second of which she converts! Four games in a row for the 2008 champion. Wozniacki has some thinking to do. First set: *Sharapova 4-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Both players are now moving beautifully and striking the ball crisply, leading to some well-crafted points. The opening point of the game is one of the rallies of the tournament, both players covering 80m during the point and both at times looking the aggressor before a blistering Sharapova backhand eventually forces an error. The confidence gained from that point allows her to dictate the remainder of the game from the back of the court, landing blow after blow with that massive forehand, each swing of the racquet met with a noise noticeably higher in pitch than previous games. This is coming to the boil nicely. First set: Sharapova 3-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Wozniacki\u2019s second serve is becoming a problem. At 15-15 she lobs over a gimme that Sharapova climbs into to set up a nervy game, but then hands a point back by - not for the first time today - taking on the line drive too soon in the rally. But it matters little because the second serve really bites Wozniacki hard, conceding a double fault to return this opening set to serve. First set: *Sharapova 2-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Confidence boosting hold to love for Sharapova, finished off with her ninth winner, yet another powerful forehand after setting up the point beautifully. First set: Sharapova 1-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) That was the first time this AO Sharapova has been broken and Wozniacki rams home the advantage with an ace and three unreturnable first serves. The Dane is 74% on points won on her first serve compared to just 33% on her second. First set: *Sharapova 1-3 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Seven winners to one in favour of Sharapova tells a bit of the story of the opening games, the 30th seed really trying to assert herself on this contest. Wozniacki has responded by adding a touch more guile to her play, trying to disrupt Sharapova\u2019s rhythm. This works at 30-15, which quickly becomes break point at 30-40 with a double-fault. A big serve sets up an easy save but she faces another break point soon afterwards after failing to put away a winner after structuring a superb rally. That comes back to bite her with an overhit forehand to gift Wozniacki an early break. Bonus for the third seed. First set: Sharapova 1-2 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Better from Wozniacki, dictating terms with her serve to earn a host of cheap points and ease her way into the contest. Once Sharapova engineers a rally she looks the more likely of the pair, but she can only do that twice in this game. It\u2019s Nike v Adidas this afternoon (I don\u2019t know why, but I always enjoy apparel rivalries). Wozniacki in an ombre number that I like a lot, and once that features recycled plastic bottles in the material, in partnership with Parley for the Oceans. Sharapova is in one of Nike\u2019s better offerings this AO, which, to be frank, are largely dross - those crop tops especially. First set: *Sharapova 1-1 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Quickfire hold to love for Sharapova who looks bang on the money early on, snapping through her service motion and hitting punishing forehands from the baseline with plenty of depth and power. First set: Sharapova 0-1 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Not the most convincing hold for Wozniacki in an opening service game featuring five deuces and three break points but she dusted away some early cobwebs eventually. A double-fault and some pretty weak second serves allowed Sharapova to set the tempo from the baseline, and her powerful forehand forced Wozniacki onto the back foot. The Russian went for a couple of shots too many though to allow Wozniacki chance to recover and then nail a couple of first serves when they were most needed. Here we go, Wozniacki about to serve... Meanwhile, a not insignificant upset... Sharapova leads the H2H 6-4 overall, Wozniacki leads 4-3 on hardcourts, but they haven\u2019t faced each other since 2015. The players are out on Rod Laver Arena. Sharapova has won the toss and elected to receive serve. There\u2019s no love lost between this pair, it should be noted. Wozniacki, a close friend of Sharapova\u2019s long-time rival Serena Williams, criticised US Open schedulers in 2017 for prioritising the Russian despite returning from a doping suspension. \u201cAnd when you look on Centre Court \u2013 I understand completely the business side of things \u2013 but someone who comes back from a drugs sentence, performance-enhancing drugs, and all of a sudden gets to play every single match on Centre Court, I think that\u2019s a questionable thing to do,\u201d Wozniacki said at the time. Here\u2019s some more background on Wozniacki\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis that she revealed late last year. The Bernard Tomic vs Lleyton Hewitt brouhaha is the story that just keeps on giving. Tomic has today responded to Hewitt\u2019s comments from last night in response to Tomic\u2019s comments from the other day. \u201cI have never threatened his family,\u201d Tomic told News Corp Australia. \u201cNice, Lleyton. To think how low of a person you actually [are] and [it\u2019s] why the Australian public never liked you. I got nothing to do with your family and I don\u2019t care what\u2019s wrong with you, you liar.\u201d I should point out that until recently action has been limited to the three stadium courts with roofs owing to some inclement weather in Victoria. Action is underway on the outside courts now, but there may be some scheduling tetris for tournament organisers later in the day to fit all the matches in - especially the early doubles contests. In some live action away from RLA it isn\u2019t good news for Belarus. 11th seed Aryna Sabalenka is a set down to American teenager Amanda Anisimova. While Aliaksandra Sasnovich, who just missed out on a seeding, is a set down to experience Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Elsewhere around Melbourne Park today there have been wins for a resurgent Tomas Berdych, the legendary Roger Federer and the rising star Stefanos Tsitsipas. When the latter pair meet in their round four contest there will be a lovely baton-passing aspect to it. Of course, you can join in the conversation about this match or anything AO related by contacting me on Twitter @JPHowcroft or by email jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. The winner of this match plays the in-form Ash Barty in the last 16 after the Queenslander continued her impressive form with a straight sets victory over Maria Sakkari earlier today. Barty thundered down 13 aces and dropped serve just once, but looked ginger at times with her movement, no doubt the result of a gruelling workload of eight matches in the past 12 days. The 22-year-old broke Sakkari in the 12th game to snatch a tight first set before running away with the second set and the match, prevailing after one hour and 22 minutes under a closed roof at Rod Laver Arena. Two former world No 1s, two Australian Open champions, round three of a major championship? Yes please! Such is the depth of women\u2019s tennis at the moment that a blockbuster is lurking in every segment of every draw but this is the biggest match-up of AO 2019 so far, 2008 winner Maria Sharapova taking on defending champion Caroline Wozniacki for a place in the last 16 of the year\u2019s first grand slam. Wozniacki will start as favourite. The world number three has won at least one title each season since 2008 and finally broke her grand slam duck in Melbourne a year ago. But there are doubts. Wozniacki revealed late last season she now has to manage the remainder of her career with rheumatoid arthritis and she arrived in Australia after a disappointing warm-up tournament in Auckland. Despite her ubiquity off court Sharapova is something of an unknown quantity on it. The Russian is seeded 30, a reflection of her inability to return to the top echelon of the game following her suspension for doping at the AO back in 2016. Now 31, Sharapova has battled injuries in recent months, retiring from her Grand Slam warm-up event in Shenzhen at the quarter-final stage. While she remains a sporting megastar, since 2015 Sharapova has won just one tour title and failed to pass the quarters in a slam. Everything is on schedule at Rod Laver Arena and set for a 3.30pm start.",

This is an earnest, uneven project \u2013 an anthology of struggle in the city \u2013 that at its best shows diverse London as it\u2019s rarely seen in the movies, shot in crappy flats with stories about the migrant experience, loneliness and being broke. What struck me watching it was the uncomfortable truth in that \u201cmelting pot\u201d comment \u2013 Londoners pride themselves on openness but plenty are guilty of barely tiptoeing outside their own postcodes and friendship networks.</p> <p>Only a few of the shorts are successful. In Unchosen, a young Iranian woman is told she has no grounds to appeal her rejected asylum claim. Her lawyer correctly suspects she\u2019s hiding something \u2013 a secret that carries a death sentence in Iran. The storyline thoughtfully reverses the stereotype of \u201cbogus\u201d asylum-seekers. In my favourite, a rosy-cheeked toddler cheerfully takes herself off for a solo day trip to Tate Modern after her mum is distracted by a work email. This piece has no social message and is entirely unrealistic \u2013 and including a happy ending that doesn\u2019t involve A&amp;E or social services \u2013 but it tickled me.</p> <p>Inevitably, a good chunk of the shorts are underdeveloped or let down by amateur acting. But it is an impressive achievement on a next-to-nothing budget. And how refreshing to see London without its makeup on. This is a film devoid of Richard Curtis-like fairytale \u2013 with the exception of one scene in which a woman gazes out of her window at the stars. Stars! The only place my two-year-old has seen stars in London is in books.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTNEADGcGA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3KTNEADGcGA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cLondon\u2019s supposed to be this melting pot, but that\u2019s bullshit, innit.\u201d A guy is talking to a woman he\u2019s trying to pull in London Unplugged \u2013 a collection of 10 shorts by emerging film-makers, all with London as their backdrop. This is an earnest, uneven project \u2013 an anthology of struggle in the city \u2013 that at its best shows diverse London as it\u2019s rarely seen in the movies, shot in crappy flats with stories about the migrant experience, loneliness and being broke. What struck me watching it was the uncomfortable truth in that \u201cmelting pot\u201d comment \u2013 Londoners pride themselves on openness but plenty are guilty of barely tiptoeing outside their own postcodes and friendship networks. Only a few of the shorts are successful. In Unchosen, a young Iranian woman is told she has no grounds to appeal her rejected asylum claim. Her lawyer correctly suspects she\u2019s hiding something \u2013 a secret that carries a death sentence in Iran. The storyline thoughtfully reverses the stereotype of \u201cbogus\u201d asylum-seekers. In my favourite, a rosy-cheeked toddler cheerfully takes herself off for a solo day trip to Tate Modern after her mum is distracted by a work email. This piece has no social message and is entirely unrealistic \u2013 and including a happy ending that doesn\u2019t involve A&amp;E or social services \u2013 but it tickled me. Inevitably, a good chunk of the shorts are underdeveloped or let down by amateur acting. But it is an impressive achievement on a next-to-nothing budget. And how refreshing to see London without its makeup on. This is a film devoid of Richard Curtis-like fairytale \u2013 with the exception of one scene in which a woman gazes out of her window at the stars. Stars! The only place my two-year-old has seen stars in London is in books.",

In the Champagne region, the Renoirs\u2019 summerhouse and garden in the village of Essoyes is now a museum with a permanent exhibition on the artist\u2019s life and work, complete with his studio and some of his sculptures, and the gardens that inspired many paintings. Renoir spent the last 12 years of his life in Cagnes-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. His house is now the excellent Renoir Museum, containing family furniture, 14 paintings and 30 sculptures, surrounded by olive trees and with panoramic views down to Cap d\u2019Antibes. \u2022 More details at impressionismsroutes.com Moon landing 50th UK On 20 July, it will be 50 years since the first humans landed on the moon.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018This concept of blocking Brexit is wrong\u2019</h2> <p>Good morning, this is Alison Rourke welcoming you to the final morning briefing of this hectic Brexit week.</p> <p>A string of junior shadow ministers have told the Guardian they strongly oppose a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d and might resign if the party backs a second referendum, believing it could expose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/corbyn-could-face-string-of-resignations-if-he-backs-peoples-vote\">Labour to a vicious backlash in its pro-leave constituencies. </a>\u201cI would feel deeply uncomfortable about going into a people\u2019s vote at this stage,\u201d said one, adding the idea of not carrying out Brexit would \u201cbreak a link with millions of our traditional voters who expect us to keep our word.\u201d Labour strategists have not ruled out a free vote on a second referendum, believing that whipping MPs either to support or oppose a referendum would open a deep rift.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Theresa May continues to insist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/may-will-stick-to-brexit-principles-in-cross-party-talks-says-no-10\">her door is open to Corbyn</a> but also that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to rule out a no-deal exit. On Thursday a group of senior Tory Brexiters \u2013 including former cabinet ministers David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers \u2013 told the PM parliament would back a deal if she could find a way of dealing with the Northern Ireland backstop issue. The DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds said May \u201chas a way through this\u201d if she could ease concerns about the backstop.</p> <p>As the political brinkmanship continues, manufacturers are stockpiling cash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/18/uk-manufacturers-hard-brexit-stockpiling-santander\">in the face of \u201cterrifying uncertainty\u201d</a>, according to the the manufacturing lobby group EEF. Its chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said companies were \u201cramping up their contingency operations\u201d in preparation for a hard Brexit.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Very shocked\u2019 </strong>\u2013 The Duke of Edinburgh is reported to be shaken after the Land Rover he was driving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/17/prince-philip-involved-in-car-accident-near-sandringham\">was involved in a collision in Norfolk</a>. Prince Philip, 97, escaped without injury from the accident that involved another car near the Queen\u2019s Sandringham Estate. Both drivers were breath tested and returned negative readings.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Trump targets Pelosi</strong>\u2013 Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his feud with Democrat House speaker Nancy Pelosi over the US government shutdown by cancelling her previously undisclosed trip abroad and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/17/trump-pelosi-trip-abroad-military-cancelled-shutdown\">denying her the use of a military aircraft</a> to visit American troops in Afghanistan. It follows Pelosi suggesting he should postpone his State of the Union address, or submit it in writing. \u201cIn light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,\u201d he wrote to Pelosi. Trump added that she should be in Washington negotiating with him over the shutdown.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>NHS overspend </strong>\u2013 Some hospitals are overspending by as much as \u00a3141m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/18/nhs-hospitals-overspend-by-up-to-141m-a-year\">a year due to NHS underfunding, staff shortages and demand for care, </a>according to Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office. The NAO concluded in its annual review of health service finances that the NHS in England was grappling with budgetary problems that are unsustainable. The watchdog warned that continuing to cut spending on public health, capital projects and medical education and training, in order to give the NHS more money for frontline care, \u201ccould affect the NHS\u2019s ability to deliver the priorities of the long-term plan\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Going back would be the end for us\u2019 </strong>\u2013 The Home Office has come under fire for trying to separate an Iranian couple from their four British children and 11 grandchildren <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/18/home-office-refuses-to-let-great-grandparents-remain-in-uk\">by forcing them to return to Iran</a>. The couple, aged 83 and 73, bought their flat in Edinburgh in 1978, live near their close-knit family and depend heavily on their daily support. But they also act as co-parents to one of their grandchildren, a teenager with severe autism who requires constant supervision. Although the couple raised their children in the UK, they never sought British citizenship.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Heatwave hell </strong>\u2013 Spare a thought for the residents of the Australian outback community of Noona, population 14, who attempted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/18/australia-heatwave-sydneys-west-to-hit-45c-after-week-of-extreme-weather\">sleep through a night of 35.9C</a> on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "A retiring Liberal senator with more than three years left on his term has been announced as Australia\u2019s next consul-general in Chicago. News of the appointment came just an hour after David Bushby, the chief government whip in the Senate, announced he would retire from the Senate on Monday. Bushby\u2019s decision to vacate his Tasmanian Senate seat early will create a casual vacancy for the Liberal party to fill until June 2022, when his term was due to end. While generous tributes flowed in from his Liberal colleagues, political opponents questioned the merit of his appointment to the consul-general post. Former independent MP Rob Oakeshott \u2013 who announced on Tuesday that he would recontest the seat of Cowper \u2013 said the appointment was \u201cthe sort of stuff that is making people angry\u201d about politics. The Coalition has a strong record of finding government jobs for its former Tasmanian members, appointing Andrew Nikolic to the administrative appeals tribunal, Eric Hutchinson as the administrator of Norfolk Island and Brett Whiteley to an advisory role in Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s office. In a statement, Bushby said it had been \u201can honour and a privilege to serve the people of Tasmania in the Australian Senate for over eleven years\u201d. \u201cI look forward to commencing a new chapter in my professional career, following a short break with my family.\u201d Before entering parliament in 2007, Bushby was a political adviser, practised as a commercial and international trade lawyer, and was a partner in a public relations firm. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, said Bushby had been a \u201chighly professional and competent\u201d chief government whip as the Coalition had to negotiate legislation through the chamber in which it did not have a majority. Fellow Tasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz said Bushby had been a \u201cchampion of all things Tasmanian\u201d as well a \u201cstand-out contributor towards economic policy over the last 11 years, including through his long service on the Senate economics committee\u201d. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, thanked consul-general Michael Wood \u2013 a career diplomat appointed by Julie Bishop in 2015 \u2013 \u201cfor his contributions to advancing Australia\u2019s interests in Chicago and the surrounding region\u201d. In 2013, Bishop sacked the former Labor Victorian premier Steve Bracks from his role as consul-general in New York because she claimed the appointment was made by the Gillard government inappropriately close to the 2013 election.",

It will tell you stories you never knew you wanted to hear, such as what the relationship is between Donald Trump and Pizza Hut, or how gangs once roamed the grounds of Disneyland.",

      "body": "<p>In a cramped rehearsal room on a side street in Brooklyn, AJ Lambert and her band are quibbling over the order of their set, trying to make sure it contains contrast and dynamism. It includes a handful of covers of songs by Shame, Spoon, TV on the Radio, Robert Wyatt and Chris Bell, all radically repurposed by the band of two synths, bass and drums. The setlist also contains a handful of Sinatra standards and these need to be especially well-judged. After all, Sinatra was Lambert\u2019s grandfather.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I hear things he sings, I hear them through some other filter,\u201d she tells me later. \u201cI hear them as a fan, but also as a human being I knew.\u201d</p> <p>The placement of one song they are particularly puzzling over is that of Glad I\u2019m Not a Kennedy, by Shona Laing. It\u2019s a startling song to hear in this context, because of Sinatra\u2019s history with the Kennedys. He was John F Kennedy\u2019s friend and cheerleader until being abruptly cut off by the family in 1962, for reasons that have been the source of endless speculation since: usually assumed to involve the mafia, sex or both.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that song\u2019s super-personal to me,\u201d Lambert says after rehearsal, eating a slice of salted caramel apple pie in a cafe around the corner. She knows how deeply her grandfather was hurt by his excision from Camelot\u2019s inner circle. She knows, too, how he grieved after Kennedy\u2019s death. But she has no idea what happened, either. \u201cA lot of times I don\u2019t know if I get the real story. Because they\u2019re\u201d \u2013 they being the Sinatra organisation: the family, the lawyers, the management \u2013 \u201cso used to being on the defensive, understandably. But I\u2019m far enough removed from all of it to be: \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPWDP25T_ac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QPWDP25T_ac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>AJ Lambert: Careful You \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>So when Lambert sings Glad I\u2019m Not a Kennedy, it\u2019s not so much with the original\u2019s regret for political opportunities missed, more with a sense of sadness for people whose lives have been overshadowed by their name, something she understands a little. \u201cI\u2019m singing it because they say all this horrible shit about my family, but it must have been so much worse to be in that family with all the shit that gets said about them. It\u2019s a sad song. There are so many levels of tragedy and death and misery in that family.\u201d</p> <p>Lambert is 44, and only now releasing her debut album, the excellent Careful You, in which the indie tracks and the standards come together in a seamless whole that recalls the lush soul productions of Matthew E White\u2019s Spacebomb stable, topped by Lambert\u2019s restrained, insinuating voice.</p> <p>She has been delayed by alcoholism (she\u2019s four years sober), by motherhood, by having other jobs. And by not wanting to be seen to be hanging on the coattails of her grandfather or her mother, Nancy Sinatra. She was in indie bands through much of her 20s and 30s: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpB9_cXQ8Ig&amp;t=124s\">a group called Sleepington at college</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgrKfdIhYDA\">one called Looker</a>, which ascended to the dizzy heights of recording a session for Steve Lamacq, brief spells with Here We Go Magic and the reformed punk band the Homosexuals \u2013 but tucked away in the rhythm section rather than out front.</p> <p>\u201cI loved it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a wild kid, drinking and drugging, and I loved it. But it was a world that suited me at that time. Perfect life, perfect fun. Until it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Her alcoholism, she says, was insidious. \u201cI would black out pretty much every day. I don\u2019t remember chunks of my life and nobody knew. It was that scary thing; I could be sitting here having this conversation looking normal. The next day they\u2019d tell me we had a great conversation, and I wouldn\u2019t remember it. All the time.\u201d</p> <p>The singing only began in earnest in 2015, with her and a pianist doing covers of her favourite indie songs in a lounge act (\u201cbut it wasn\u2019t campy; it wasn\u2019t ironic\u201d). In March 2016 her uncle, Frank Sinatra Jr, died, \u201cand he left this hole, where no one in my family does that music at all. My mom doesn\u2019t do it. And they approached me, the family powers that be, management types. \u2018OK, we know you\u2019re singing. He had been about to do this tribute show: do you want to see the list of songs?\u2019 It was every single hit there ever was. And I felt if I were to do that it would be so cynical. It seemed ridiculous to be a 41-year-old woman, at that time, singing Love and Marriage and My Way. I said: \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable doing this, but I\u2019m so honoured to have that lineage, and I feel like I have to do something for it.\u2019 So I decided to do [Sinatra] album shows, where I do In the Wee Small Hours and Only the Lonely.

I can\u2019t sit and say it sucks, because it will make her feel bad and me feel worse.\u2019 I thought, she must have a reason to do this. And she got paid a lot of money.

      "bodyText": "As if it\u2019s not enough for famous people to have better skin, better bodies and better houses than the rest of us, it seems these days they are also liable to demonstrate how much better they are at getting in and out of relationships. \u201cConscious uncoupling\u201d is a celebrity-endorsed attitude towards separation, made famous by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. The aim is to be as generous and reasonable as possible about the end of the affair, in both public and private. The current queen of gracious divorcees is Anna Faris, who poured out her happiness about ex-husband Chris Pratt\u2019s engagement to Katherine Schwarzenegger on Instagram this week, saying, \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you both!!\u201d before offering to perform the wedding ceremony herself (ostensibly a genuine proposition, given that she is an ordained minister). This perhaps takes things one step beyond even the hypercivilised efforts of Paltrow and Martin, who recently revealed that things had gone so well post-breakup that he had accompanied Paltrow on her honeymoon with new love, Brad Falchuck.

He threatened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/08/donald-trump-north-korea-missile-threats-fire-fury\">\u201cfire and fury\u201d</a> against North Korea, but has since claimed to have \u201cfallen in love\u201d with Kim Jong-un, although the young dictator has yet to show any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/us-and-north-korea-expectations-over-denuclearization-appear-to-collide\">inclination to dismantle</a> his nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>He is reluctant to criticise Vladimir Putin, boosting suspicions that he is under the sway of the Kremlin. But his administration has arguably taken a tougher line against Russia than its predecessor, piling on more sanctions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/ukraine-kurt-volker-us-arms-supplies\">supplying lethal weaponry</a> to Ukraine.</p> <p>There are some themes, however, that make foreign policy in the age of Trump quite different in character from any previous administration. One of them is the personalisation of relations with foreign governments.</p> <p>Trump evidently trusts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/16/trump-finds-putin-denial-of-election-meddling-powerful\">his gut instincts</a> more than the advice of the US foreign policy and security establishment, and those instincts have drawn him towards autocrats and away from traditional democratic allies, whom he often views as freeloaders, taking advantage of US might.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df0ede6f9eaccea38ef280e045b93a0d722e3dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df0ede6f9eaccea38ef280e045b93a0d722e3dc4/0_147_4423_2654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump meets Kim Jong-un in Singapore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump meets Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another constant in the Trumpian approach to the world is the drive to erase the legacy of Barack Obama and his other predecessors. Almost everything Obama was for, Trump has been overwhelmingly against, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">2015 nuclear deal</a> with Iran to trade deals in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/23/donald-trump-first-orders-trans-pacific-partnership-tpp\">Pacific</a> or with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/15/germany-trump-ttip-trade-deal\">Europe</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-confirms-us-will-quit-paris-climate-deal\">Paris climate accord</a>.</p> <p>The distrust of multilateral agreements and institutions is a third persistent theme. Trump\u2019s template for making deals is two powerful men facing off across a table. Round tables with a variety of voices frustrate him, forcing him to listen to foreigners with less power or with different points of view. He chose John Bolton as national security adviser primarily to build a bonfire of US international obligations.</p> <p>Trump has yet to be tested by an international crisis not of his own making. In the two years to come, we will see whether his (and the world\u2019s) luck will continue to hold.</p> <h2>Economy</h2> <p>\u201cThis is the greatest economy in the history of our country,\u201d Donald Trump told reporters last year. Two years into his presidency he has plenty to brag about but also some big problems. Many of his own making.</p> <p>Unemployment is close to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/04/us-jobs-report-latest-december-beats-expectations\">levels unseen</a> since the first moon landing. It ticked up last month but even that rise came as more workers came off the sidelines and started looking for work. So far about 5m jobs have been created under Trump.</p> <p>It is pretty dubious to claim presidents \u201ccreate\u201d jobs but they all take the credit when things are good; unsurprisingly Trump is no exception. The current recovery clearly began under the previous president, Barack Obama. Even with the unarguably impressive improvements under Trump, he has a way to go before he can fulfil his promise of being \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created\u201d.</p> <p>Bill Clinton holds the record for largest numeric increase in the workforce, 23m jobs over his two terms. Obama, who was elected in the teeth of the worst recession in living memory, added 10m jobs over his two terms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"163829399dcb3b3701227bec273775a600d8441f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/163829399dcb3b3701227bec273775a600d8441f/0_241_4200_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump displays the $1.5tn tax cut he had just signed, on 22 December 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump displays the $1.5tn tax cut he had just signed, on 22 December 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump is off to a great start, but it\u2019s just that. The US has experienced 99 months of consecutive jobs growth and a slowdown seems inevitable.</p> <p>Trump does, however, already have one over on Obama. Wage growth is finally picking up \u2013 a bit \u2013 after years of stagnation.</p> <p>In other areas, Trump\u2019s economic record is more discordant.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s single biggest policy achievement is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/18/trump-tax-plan-winners-and-losers\">$1.5tn tax cut</a> he pushed through in November 2017. Slammed by critics on the left and right as a giveaway for corporations and the 1%, it helped Democrats win in November\u2019s midterm elections.</p> <p>And then, of course, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s other most notable economic policy \u2013 trade wars. Trump has effectively torn up decades of trade agreements and antagonised his largest trading partners. The impact of the rancor he has sown is still being assessed but it has already triggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/21/stock-markets-worst-week-in-decade-nasdaq-dow\">dramatic sell-offs</a> on stock markets and may have contributed to a slowdown in the Chinese economy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/02/apple-stocks-key-quarter-tim-cook\">Apple issued its first profits warning </a>since 2002 earlier this month, blaming slowing business in China. There will be more warnings to come.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s economic populism helped get him elected. Whether he gets a second term will probably depend on whether he can keep the promises he made in the first, or whether the moves he made in the last two years come back to haunt him.</p> <h2>Judiciary</h2> <p>Call it Operation Patriarchy. Old white men are fighting a losing battle against <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/31/10-demographic-trends-that-are-shaping-the-u-s-and-the-world/\">changing demographics in the United States</a>, but the 72-year-old president and 76-year-old Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, are doing their utmost to safeguard the supremacy of white men in American courts.</p> <p>For two years, they have been packing the courts with predominantly white male conservative judges, whose lifetime appointments will mean the federal benches look a lot less like the country they preside over.</p> <p>That may sound like business as usual for a party in power but it is actually the product of McConnell\u2019s long-term strategy. He blocked dozens of Obama nominees for the federal courts by refusing to hold Senate votes, gambling that in 2016 a Republican might win the presidency and present a roster of more conservative judges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"159c13b9003f5b44c09a31685367e43bf42a94b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/159c13b9003f5b44c09a31685367e43bf42a94b1/681_604_4035_2422/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump congratulates Brett Kavanaugh on his swearing-in as a supreme court justice in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump congratulates Brett Kavanaugh on his swearing-in as a supreme court justice in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the 2016 death of the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, McConnell used his control of the Senate to keep the seat vacant for 293 days by refusing a hearing for Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland.</p> <p>For white evangelical Christians, a vacant seat on the supreme court was the most compelling reason to vote for Trump, the thrice-married alleged serial adulterer who boasted of sexually interfering with women.</p> <p>After winning the presidency, Trump nominated a conservative in Neil Gorsuch.</p> <p>In 2018, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court nomination was forced through after a vitriolic and incomplete examination of past sexual assault allegations, which he denied.</p> <p>Trump and McConnell delivered a conservative majority on the court, which could now last decades and gives hopes of overturning the the 1973 Roe v Wade decision, which enshrined the right to abortion.</p> <p>McConnell and Trump have also been moving rapidly to shift the appeal and district courts to the right.</p> <p>So far, 85 judges <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Donald_Trump#United_States_Courts_of_Appeals\">have been appointed</a> by Trump \u2013 two to the supreme court, 30 for the US courts of appeal and 53 to district courts.

      "bodyText": "Foreign policy If there has been one defining trait in the foreign policy of the Trump era, it is confusion \u2013 not only in the frequent gaps between the paths taken by the president and his own administration, but also in the morass of contradictions and U-turns in his own impulses. Trump has insisted on bringing back US troops from Syria and Afghanistan, but has at times shocked his advisers with a bellicosity, towards Iran in particular, that risks starting new wars. While demonising the government in Tehran, Trump has decided not to directly contest Iranian influence in Syria with US troops. He threatened \u201cfire and fury\u201d against North Korea, but has since claimed to have \u201cfallen in love\u201d with Kim Jong-un, although the young dictator has yet to show any inclination to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. He is reluctant to criticise Vladimir Putin, boosting suspicions that he is under the sway of the Kremlin. But his administration has arguably taken a tougher line against Russia than its predecessor, piling on more sanctions and supplying lethal weaponry to Ukraine. There are some themes, however, that make foreign policy in the age of Trump quite different in character from any previous administration. One of them is the personalisation of relations with foreign governments. Trump evidently trusts his gut instincts more than the advice of the US foreign policy and security establishment, and those instincts have drawn him towards autocrats and away from traditional democratic allies, whom he often views as freeloaders, taking advantage of US might. Another constant in the Trumpian approach to the world is the drive to erase the legacy of Barack Obama and his other predecessors. Almost everything Obama was for, Trump has been overwhelmingly against, from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran to trade deals in the Pacific or with Europe, or the Paris climate accord. The distrust of multilateral agreements and institutions is a third persistent theme. Trump\u2019s template for making deals is two powerful men facing off across a table. Round tables with a variety of voices frustrate him, forcing him to listen to foreigners with less power or with different points of view. He chose John Bolton as national security adviser primarily to build a bonfire of US international obligations. Trump has yet to be tested by an international crisis not of his own making. In the two years to come, we will see whether his (and the world\u2019s) luck will continue to hold. Economy \u201cThis is the greatest economy in the history of our country,\u201d Donald Trump told reporters last year. Two years into his presidency he has plenty to brag about but also some big problems. Many of his own making. Unemployment is close to levels unseen since the first moon landing. It ticked up last month but even that rise came as more workers came off the sidelines and started looking for work. So far about 5m jobs have been created under Trump. It is pretty dubious to claim presidents \u201ccreate\u201d jobs but they all take the credit when things are good; unsurprisingly Trump is no exception. The current recovery clearly began under the previous president, Barack Obama. Even with the unarguably impressive improvements under Trump, he has a way to go before he can fulfil his promise of being \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created\u201d. Bill Clinton holds the record for largest numeric increase in the workforce, 23m jobs over his two terms. Obama, who was elected in the teeth of the worst recession in living memory, added 10m jobs over his two terms. Trump is off to a great start, but it\u2019s just that. The US has experienced 99 months of consecutive jobs growth and a slowdown seems inevitable. Trump does, however, already have one over on Obama. Wage growth is finally picking up \u2013 a bit \u2013 after years of stagnation. In other areas, Trump\u2019s economic record is more discordant. Trump\u2019s single biggest policy achievement is the $1.5tn tax cut he pushed through in November 2017. Slammed by critics on the left and right as a giveaway for corporations and the 1%, it helped Democrats win in November\u2019s midterm elections. And then, of course, there\u2019s Trump\u2019s other most notable economic policy \u2013 trade wars. Trump has effectively torn up decades of trade agreements and antagonised his largest trading partners. The impact of the rancor he has sown is still being assessed but it has already triggered dramatic sell-offs on stock markets and may have contributed to a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Apple issued its first profits warning since 2002 earlier this month, blaming slowing business in China. There will be more warnings to come. Trump\u2019s economic populism helped get him elected. Whether he gets a second term will probably depend on whether he can keep the promises he made in the first, or whether the moves he made in the last two years come back to haunt him. Judiciary Call it Operation Patriarchy. Old white men are fighting a losing battle against changing demographics in the United States, but the 72-year-old president and 76-year-old Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, are doing their utmost to safeguard the supremacy of white men in American courts. For two years, they have been packing the courts with predominantly white male conservative judges, whose lifetime appointments will mean the federal benches look a lot less like the country they preside over. That may sound like business as usual for a party in power but it is actually the product of McConnell\u2019s long-term strategy. He blocked dozens of Obama nominees for the federal courts by refusing to hold Senate votes, gambling that in 2016 a Republican might win the presidency and present a roster of more conservative judges. After the 2016 death of the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, McConnell used his control of the Senate to keep the seat vacant for 293 days by refusing a hearing for Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland. For white evangelical Christians, a vacant seat on the supreme court was the most compelling reason to vote for Trump, the thrice-married alleged serial adulterer who boasted of sexually interfering with women. After winning the presidency, Trump nominated a conservative in Neil Gorsuch. In 2018, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s supreme court nomination was forced through after a vitriolic and incomplete examination of past sexual assault allegations, which he denied. Trump and McConnell delivered a conservative majority on the court, which could now last decades and gives hopes of overturning the the 1973 Roe v Wade decision, which enshrined the right to abortion. McConnell and Trump have also been moving rapidly to shift the appeal and district courts to the right. So far, 85 judges have been appointed by Trump \u2013 two to the supreme court, 30 for the US courts of appeal and 53 to district courts. That is a faster pace than Obama who, in eight years, appointed two supreme court justices, 55 appeal judges and 268 district judges. Trump has 70 more nominations in the pipeline which can be approved by a simple majority vote in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage. Dominated by white men, many under 50, Trump\u2019s appointments are already the least diverse crop of new judges for a generation. The House, newly controlled by the Democrats under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, can stop Republican legislation. But Democrats on Capitol Hill are helpless against Trump\u2019s determination to install as many judges as possible. Environment Trump\u2019s stewardship of the environment is perhaps best known for the president\u2019s dismissal of climate change as a Chinese hoax, or the allegations of flamboyant levels of corruption by Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, the now former heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and interior department, respectively. But it\u2019s the more mundane unspooling of arcane regulations by the administration that is most likely to leave a tangible mark on the health of Americans and the world around them. This work is ploddingly tenacious. For example, during the somnambulant period between Christmas and the New Year, the EPA decided that rules curbing emissions of mercury, linked to neurological disorders, heart and lung problems and compromised immune systems, are too onerous on coal plants and should be scrapped. The proposed reversal is just the latest in a list of about 80 environmental rules either dismantled or slated for abolition by the Trump administration. They include the destruction of the main Obama-era policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy, the halting of a planned ban of a pesticide deemed harmful to infants\u2019 development and a weakening of fuel efficiency standards for cars. The new vehicles regime sets up a bitter fight with California, which has stricter pollution rules for cars and trucks than the federal standards. A cavalcade of legal action on other issues is also expected to play out this year as environmental groups attempt to strike down the Trumpian rollbacks. However, unlike many other areas of life, any sort of delay is almost as harmful as active worsening, with the world\u2019s climate swiftly heating up to an unbearable point for many Americans, who already face increasingly punishing hurricanes, rising seas and apocalyptic wildfires. In October, a landmark report by UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned there is only a dozen years left to prevent global temperatures tipping beyond a point where droughts, floods, extreme heat and poverty become horrendously worse. In response, Trump claimed to have a \u201cnatural instinct for science\u201d because his uncle, John Trump, was a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The president added that the climate \u201cgoes back and forth, back and forth\u201d before delivering his verdict on the IPCC report itself. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. Immigration It took global condemnation and sustained bipartisan criticism at home for Donald Trump to show he had limits on how much suffering immigrants should endure for his own political gain. For three months in 2018 Trump admitted forcibly separating migrant children from their families, provoking scenes of desperation in border courtrooms and detention centres as mothers and fathers begged to have their children returned. In fact it may have been separating thousands of children since 2017. Trump\u2019s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka described those months as \u201ca low point\u201d for the administration, which formally abandoned the policy in June. And yet, a single U-turn aside, the administration continues to pursue an extremist agenda on immigration, keeping families separated in different, more insidious, ways. Trump\u2019s travel ban, targeting a number of Muslim-majority countries, has stopped family members in some of the world\u2019s most unstable regions from visiting their loved ones in America. Most recently a woman from Yemen was temporarily prevented from visiting her terminally ill two-year-old son, an American citizen. The administration, having supercharged immigration enforcement agents\u2019 power, continues to drive up the number of arrests and deportations of undocumented people \u2013 most with no serious criminal history. Now a record 44,000 people are held in immigration detention as the immigration court backlog swells to a record high. Thousands of those facing deportation have lived in America for decades, building families and new lives here. Meanwhile the administration has cut the number of refugees allowed into the country to a record low of 30,000. It has slashed the number of successful green card applications. And Trump has personally threatened to try to end birthright citizenship. Of course, there is also Trump\u2019s infamous campaign pledge to build a wall along the US\u2019s southern border, which he concedes will not now be funded by Mexico, or made of concrete. Despite a government shutdown over wall funding crippling parts of the federal government, it is those most vulnerable, namely asylum seekers forced to languish just outside the US, who endure the most as a consequence of Trump\u2019s relentless pursuit of an ineffective solution to a complex problem on the border.",

      "body": "<p>British manufacturers are being forced to build up financial buffers in preparation for a no-deal Brexit as the cost of stockpiling goods and materials puts companies under strain.</p> <p>Measures taken by manufacturers to prepare for a disorderly exit include creating cash cushions and taking out working capital loans to cover the costs of stockpiling.</p> <p>Manufacturers have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/02/factory-output-jumps-as-stockpiling-increases-amid-brexit-fears-uk\">spent millions storing raw materials and finished products</a> in case a no-deal Brexit causes delays at the border, tying up money that would otherwise be used to run day-to-day operations. Airbus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/brompton-bike-parts-hard-brexit\">Brompton Bicycle</a> are among the UK-based manufacturers that have started stockpiling as 29 March looms.</p> <p>Santander, one of the biggest lenders to business in the country, said its manufacturing clients were building up cash reserves and delaying capital expenditures as they sought to keep cash in the business. A source at another major high street bank said the lender was working with manufacturing clients on offering more working capital loans.</p> <p>Paul Brooks, the head of manufacturing at Santander UK, said: \u201cIn recent months we have seen manufacturers choosing to build up cash reserves and delay investments due to uncertainty over the economy\u2019s outlook.\u201cWe are working closely with our manufacturer customers to support them through this period, including helping them to manage their cashflow, spread the cost of buying assets and explore export opportunities in new international markets.\u201d</p> <p>Recent figures show lending patterns consistent with stockpiling by manufacturers. The Bank of England\u2019s fourth-quarter <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/credit-conditions-survey/2018/2018-q4\">survey of UK credit conditions</a> showed that demand for \u201cinventory finance\u201d, in which loans are secured against stock, rose much faster than average in the final quarter of 2018 after hitting a three-year high in the previous quarter. Overall demand for borrowing from manufacturers rose by 7% in the year to November, to \u00a318bn, according to data from UK Finance, the banking industry body; bucking the trend of falling demand for loans in most other sectors.</p> <p>The financial strain from Brexit preparations is spread throughout manufacturing supply chains. Demand for new lending facilities is particularly acute among smaller companies, which often only have a single banking relationship, a senior banker said.</p> <p>There is also evidence of payments deadlines being squeezed by suppliers and stretched by customers, said the banker, further increasing the default risks borne by smaller firms.</p> <p>Manufacturers, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/22/airbus-raises-range-of-fears-in-brutal-brexit-assessment\">largest companies such as Airbus</a> to much smaller suppliers, have warned repeatedly that a no-deal Brexit would harm British industry by delaying goods at the border. EEF, the manufacturing lobby group, said 60% of the companies it surveyed were looking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/03/uk-manufacturers-stockpile-goods-ahead-of-brexit\">stockpile goods in case supplies dry up</a>. At least a quarter are already doing so.</p> <p>Stephen Phipson, the EEF chief executive, said British companies were \u201cramping up their contingency operations\u201d in the face of \u201cterrifying uncertainty\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIncreasingly, companies are conducting in-depth audits of their supply chains to make cost efficiencies, while many are also reshoring where possible. We continue to talk to banks and other financial institutions on behalf of our members in order to make sure they have the financial support necessary for this extra expenditure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>British manufacturers have reached a \u201cpoint of maximum uncertainty\u201d on Brexit, one banker said, with the future of the trading relationship between the UK and the EU unclear before the 29 March exit date after the government\u2019s preferred deal suffered a historic defeat in parliament.</p> <p>Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u2019s managing director for commercial finance, said: \u201cBusinesses have been building up their cash deposits and tend to be slower to draw down on lending facilities. This suggests firms are exercising caution in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>However, banking industry insiders are confident that British lenders will be able to continue to lend to companies even if no deal is reached. The Bank of England said in November that its stress tests showed that Britain\u2019s largest banks would be able to lend to companies even if a no-deal Brexit causes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/28/bank-of-england-says-uk-banks-can-survive-disorderly-brexit\">worse decline in the UK economy than the 2008 financial crisis</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers are being forced to build up financial buffers in preparation for a no-deal Brexit as the cost of stockpiling goods and materials puts companies under strain. Measures taken by manufacturers to prepare for a disorderly exit include creating cash cushions and taking out working capital loans to cover the costs of stockpiling. Manufacturers have already spent millions storing raw materials and finished products in case a no-deal Brexit causes delays at the border, tying up money that would otherwise be used to run day-to-day operations. Airbus and Brompton Bicycle are among the UK-based manufacturers that have started stockpiling as 29 March looms. Santander, one of the biggest lenders to business in the country, said its manufacturing clients were building up cash reserves and delaying capital expenditures as they sought to keep cash in the business. A source at another major high street bank said the lender was working with manufacturing clients on offering more working capital loans. Paul Brooks, the head of manufacturing at Santander UK, said: \u201cIn recent months we have seen manufacturers choosing to build up cash reserves and delay investments due to uncertainty over the economy\u2019s outlook.\u201cWe are working closely with our manufacturer customers to support them through this period, including helping them to manage their cashflow, spread the cost of buying assets and explore export opportunities in new international markets.\u201d Recent figures show lending patterns consistent with stockpiling by manufacturers. The Bank of England\u2019s fourth-quarter survey of UK credit conditions showed that demand for \u201cinventory finance\u201d, in which loans are secured against stock, rose much faster than average in the final quarter of 2018 after hitting a three-year high in the previous quarter. Overall demand for borrowing from manufacturers rose by 7% in the year to November, to \u00a318bn, according to data from UK Finance, the banking industry body; bucking the trend of falling demand for loans in most other sectors. The financial strain from Brexit preparations is spread throughout manufacturing supply chains. Demand for new lending facilities is particularly acute among smaller companies, which often only have a single banking relationship, a senior banker said. There is also evidence of payments deadlines being squeezed by suppliers and stretched by customers, said the banker, further increasing the default risks borne by smaller firms. Manufacturers, from the largest companies such as Airbus to much smaller suppliers, have warned repeatedly that a no-deal Brexit would harm British industry by delaying goods at the border. EEF, the manufacturing lobby group, said 60% of the companies it surveyed were looking to stockpile goods in case supplies dry up. At least a quarter are already doing so. Stephen Phipson, the EEF chief executive, said British companies were \u201cramping up their contingency operations\u201d in the face of \u201cterrifying uncertainty\u201d. He said: \u201cIncreasingly, companies are conducting in-depth audits of their supply chains to make cost efficiencies, while many are also reshoring where possible. We continue to talk to banks and other financial institutions on behalf of our members in order to make sure they have the financial support necessary for this extra expenditure.\u201d British manufacturers have reached a \u201cpoint of maximum uncertainty\u201d on Brexit, one banker said, with the future of the trading relationship between the UK and the EU unclear before the 29 March exit date after the government\u2019s preferred deal suffered a historic defeat in parliament. Stephen Pegge, UK Finance\u2019s managing director for commercial finance, said: \u201cBusinesses have been building up their cash deposits and tend to be slower to draw down on lending facilities. This suggests firms are exercising caution in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty.\u201d However, banking industry insiders are confident that British lenders will be able to continue to lend to companies even if no deal is reached. The Bank of England said in November that its stress tests showed that Britain\u2019s largest banks would be able to lend to companies even if a no-deal Brexit causes a worse decline in the UK economy than the 2008 financial crisis.",

      "body": "<p>Last year a Dutch doctor called Bert Keizer was summoned to the house of a man dying of lung cancer, in order to end his life. When Keizer and the nurse who was to assist him arrived, they found around 35 people gathered around the dying man\u2019s bed. \u201cThey were drinking and guffawing and crying,\u201d Keizer told me when I met him in Amsterdam recently. \u201cIt was boisterous. And I thought: \u2018How am I going to cleave the waters?\u2019 But the man knew exactly what to do. Suddenly he said, \u2018OK, guys!\u2019 and everyone understood. Everyone fell silent. The very small children were taken out of the room and I gave him his injection. I could have kissed him, because I wouldn\u2019t have known how to break up the party.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/01/death-on-demand-has-euthanasia-gone-too-far-podcast\">Death on demand: has euthanasia gone too far? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Keizer is one of around 60 physicians on the books of the Levenseindekliniek, or End of Life Clinic, which matches doctors willing to perform euthanasia with patients seeking an end to their lives, and which was responsible for the euthanasia of some 750 people in 2017. For Keizer, who was a philosopher before studying medicine, the advent of widespread access to euthanasia represents a new era. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe have developed a space where people move towards death while we are touching them and they are in our midst. That\u2019s completely different from killing yourself when your wife\u2019s out shopping and the kids are at school and you hang yourself in the library \u2013 which is the most horrible way of doing it, because the wound never heals. The fact that you are a person means that you are linked to other people. And we have found a bearable way of severing that link, not by a natural death, but by a self-willed ending. It\u2019s a very special thing.\u201d</p> <p>This \u201cspecial thing\u201d has in fact become normal. Everyone in the Netherlands seems to have known someone who has been euthanised, and the kind of choreographed farewell that Keizer describes is far from unusual. Certainly, the idea that we humans have a variety of deaths to choose from is more familiar in the Netherlands than anywhere else. But the long-term consequences of this idea are only just becoming discernible. Euthanasia has been legal in the Netherlands for long enough to show what can happen after the practice beds in. And as an end-of-life specialist in a nation that has for decades been the standard bearer of libertarian reform, Keizer may be a witness to the future that awaits us all.</p> <p>In 2002, the parliament in the Hague legalised euthanasia for patients experiencing \u201cunbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement\u201d. Since then, euthanasia and its close relation, assisted dying, in which one person facilitates the suicide of another, have been embraced by Belgium and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/06/canada-debates-assisted-death-laws\">Canada</a>, while public opinion in many countries where it isn\u2019t on the national statute, such as Britain, the US and New Zealand, has swung heavily in favour.</p> <p>The momentum of euthanasia appears unstoppable; after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-33392195\">Colombia</a>, in 2015, and the Australian state of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/23/crossing-the-threshold-victoria-makes-history-with-assisted-dying-law\">Victoria</a>, in 2017, Spain may be the next big jurisdiction to legalise physician-assisted death, while <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9470537/assisted-suicide-where-legal\">one in six Americans</a> (the majority of them in California) live in states where it is legal. In Switzerland, which has the world\u2019s oldest assisted dying laws, foreigners are also able to obtain euthanasia.</p> <p>If western society continues to follow the Dutch, Belgian and Canadian examples, there is every chance that in a few decades\u2019 time euthanasia will be one widely available option from a menu of possible deaths, including an \u201cend of life\u201d poison pill available on demand to anyone who finds life unbearable. For many greying baby boomers \u2013 veterans of earlier struggles to legalise abortion and contraception \u2013 a civilised death at a time of their choosing is a right that the state should provide and regulate. As this generation enters its final years, the precept that life is precious irrespective of one\u2019s medical condition is being called into question as never before.</p> <p>As the world\u2019s pioneer, the Netherlands has also discovered that although legalising euthanasia might resolve one ethical conundrum, it opens a can of others \u2013 most importantly, where the limits of the practice should be drawn. In the past few years a small but influential group of academics and jurists have raised the alarm over what is generally referred to, a little archly, as the \u201cslippery slope\u201d \u2013 the idea that a measure introduced to provide relief to late-stage cancer patients has expanded to include people who might otherwise live for many years, from sufferers of diseases such as muscular dystrophy to sexagenarians with dementia and even mentally ill young people.</p> <p>Perhaps the most prominent of these sceptics is Theo Boer, who teaches ethics at the Theological University of Kampen. Between 2005 and 2014, Boer was a member of one of the <a href=\"https://english.euthanasiecommissie.nl/the-committees\">five regional boards</a> that were set up to review every act of euthanasia and hand cases over to prosecutors if irregularities are detected. (Each review board is composed of a lawyer, a doctor and an ethicist.) Recent government figures suggest that doubts over the direction of Dutch euthanasia are having an effect on the willingness of doctors to perform the procedure. In November, the health ministry revealed that in the first nine months of 2018 the number of cases was <a href=\"https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2018/10/fewer-cases-of-euthanasia-last-year-doctors-concerns-may-be-to-blame/\">down 9%</a> compared to the same period in 2017, the first drop since 2006. In a related sign of a more hostile legal environment, shortly afterwards the judiciary announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/09/doctor-to-face-dutch-prosecution-for-breach-of-euthanasia-law\">first prosecution</a> of a doctor for malpractice while administering euthanasia.</p> <p>It is too early to say if euthanasia in the Netherlands has reached a high-water mark \u2013 and too early to say if the other countries that are currently making it easier to have an assisted death will also hesitate if the practice comes to be seen as too widespread. But it is significant that in addition to the passionate advocacy of Bert Keizer \u2013 who positively welcomes the \u201cslippery slope\u201d \u2013 Boer\u2019s more critical views are being solicited by foreign parliamentarians and ethicists who are considering legal changes in their own countries. As Boer explained to me, \u201cwhen I\u2019m showing the statistics to people in Portugal or Iceland or wherever, I say: \u2018Look closely at the Netherlands because this is where your country may be 20 years from now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe process of bringing in euthanasia legislation began with a desire to deal with the most heartbreaking cases \u2013 really terrible forms of death,\u201d Boer said. \u201cBut there have been important changes in the way the law is applied. We have put in motion something that we have now discovered has more consequences than we ever imagined.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Bert Keizer carried out his first euthanasia in 1984. Back then, when he was working as a doctor in a care home, ending the life of a desperately ill person at their request was illegal, even if prosecutions were rare. When a retired shoemaker called Antonius Albertus, who was dying of lung cancer, asked to be put out of his misery, Keizer found that two sides of himself \u2013 the law-abiding doctor and the altruist \u2013 were at odds.</p> <p>\u201cAntonius wasn\u2019t in pain,\u201d Keizer told me, \u201cbut he had that particular exhaustion that every oncologist knows, a harrowing exhaustion, and I saw him dwindle before me.\u201d In the event, Keizer, who as an 11-year-old watched his mother suffer an excruciating death from liver disease, went with the altruist. He injected 40mg of Valium into Antonius \u2013 enough to put him in a coma \u2013 then gave him the anti-respiratory drug that ended his life.</p> <p>Keizer was not investigated after reporting an unnatural death at his own hand, and his career did not suffer as he feared it might. But what, I asked him, had prompted him to break the law, and violate a principle \u2013 the preservation of life \u2013 that has defined medical ethics since Hippocrates? Keizer paused to brush away a spider that had crawled uninvited on to my shoulder. \u201cIt was something very selfish,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf ever I was in his situation, asking for death, I would want people to listen to me, and not say, \u2018It cannot be done because of the law or the Bible.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few decades the Bible has been increasingly sidelined, and the law has vindicated the young doctor who put Antonius to sleep. As people got used to the new law, the number of Dutch people being euthanised began to rise sharply, from under 2,000 in 2007 to almost 6,600 in 2017. (Around the same number are estimated to have had their euthanasia request turned down as not conforming with the legal requirements.) Also in 2017, some 1,900 Dutch people killed themselves, while the number of people who died under palliative sedation \u2013 in theory, succumbing to their illness while cocooned from physical discomfort, but in practice often dying of dehydration while unconscious \u2013 hit an astonishing 32,000. Altogether, well over a quarter of all deaths in 2017 in the Netherlands were induced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea71d1d167819ab68c3900647d653a682f95ef85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea71d1d167819ab68c3900647d653a682f95ef85/0_141_3934_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MPs in Victoria, Australia, embrace after the passing of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MPs in Victoria, Australia, embrace after the passing of the Voluntary Assisted Dying bill in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Crosling/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the reasons why euthanasia became more common after 2007 is that the range of conditions considered eligible expanded, while the definition of \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d that is central to the law was also loosened. At the same time, murmurs of apprehension began to be heard, which, even in the marvellously decorous chamber of Dutch public debate, have risen in volume. Concerns centre on two issues with strong relevance to euthanasia: dementia and autonomy.</p> <p>Many Dutch people write advance directives that stipulate that if their mental state later deteriorates beyond a certain point \u2013 if, say, they are unable to recognise family members \u2013 they are to be euthanised regardless of whether they dissent from their original wishes. But Last January a medical ethicist called Berna Van Baarsen caused a stir when she resigned from one of the review boards in protest at the growing frequency with which dementia sufferers are being euthanised on the basis of a written directive that they are unable to confirm after losing their faculties. \u201cIt is fundamentally impossible,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.trouw.nl/samenleving/-euthanasie-bij-wilsonbekwame-dementiepatienten-is-niet-te-verdedigen-~a70bdd45/\">she told</a> the newspaper Trouw, \u201cto establish that the patient is suffering unbearably, because he can no longer explain it.\u201d</p> <p>Van Baarsen\u2019s scruples have crystallised in the country\u2019s first euthanasia malpractice case, which prosecutors are now preparing. (Three further cases are currently under investigation.) It involves a dementia sufferer who had asked to be killed when the \u201ctime\u201d was \u201cright\u201d, but when her doctor judged this to be the case, she resisted. The patient had to be drugged and restrained by her family before she finally submitted to the doctor\u2019s fatal injection. The doctor who administered the dose \u2013 who has not been identified \u2013 has defended her actions by saying that she was fulfilling her patient\u2019s request and that, since the patient was incompetent, her protests before her death were irrelevant. Whatever the legal merits of her argument, it hardly changes what must have been a scene of unutterable grimness.</p> <p>The underlying problem with the advance directives is that they imply the subordination of an irrational human being to their rational former self, essentially splitting a single person into two mutually opposed ones. Many doctors, having watched patients adapt to circumstances they had once expected to find intolerable, doubt whether anyone can accurately predict what they will want after their condition worsens.</p> <p>The second conflict that has crept in as euthanasia has been normalised is a societal one. It comes up when there is an opposition between the right of the individual and society\u2019s obligation to protect lives. \u201cThe euthanasia requests that are the most problematic,\u201d explains Agnes van der Heide, professor of medical care and end-of-life decision-making at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, \u201care those that are based on the patient\u2019s autonomy, which leads them to tell the doctor: \u2018You aren\u2019t the one to judge whether I am to die.\u2019\u201d She doesn\u2019t expect this impulse, already strong among baby boomers, to diminish among coming generations. \u201cFor our young people, the autonomy principle is at the forefront of their thinking.\u201d</p> <p>The growing divisions over euthanasia are being reflected in the deliberations of the review boards. Consensus is rarer than it was when the only cases that came before them involved patients with late-stage terminal illnesses, who were of sound mind. Since her resignation, Berna Van Baarsen has complained that \u201clegal arguments weigh more and more heavily\u201d on the committees, \u201cwhile the moral question of whether in certain cases good is done by killing, threatens to get snowed under\u201d.</p> <p>In this new, more ambiguous environment, the recent dip in euthanasia numbers doesn\u2019t seem surprising. Besides their fear of attracting prosecutors\u2019 attention, some doctors have been irked by the growing public perception that they are no-questions-asked purveyors of dignified death, and are pushing back. For Dutch GPs, fielding demands for euthanasia from assertive patients who resent the slightest reluctance on the part of their physician has become one of the more disagreeable aspects of their job.</p> <p>\u201cIn the coldest weeks of last winter,\u201d Theo Boer told me, \u201ca doctor friend of mine was told by an elderly patient: \u2018I demand to have euthanasia this week \u2013 you promised.\u2019 The doctor replied: \u2018It\u2019s -15C outside. Take a bottle of whisky and sit in your garden and we will find you tomorrow, because I cannot accept that you make me responsible for your own suicide.\u2019 The doctor in question, Boer said, used to perform euthanasia on around three people a year. He has now stopped altogether.</p> <p>Although he supported the 2002 euthanasia law at the time, Boer now regrets that it didn\u2019t stipulate that the patient must be competent at the time of termination, and that if possible the patient should administer the fatal dose themselves. Boer is also concerned about the psychological effect on doctors of killing someone with a substantial life expectancy: \u201cWhen you euthanise a final-stage cancer patient, you know that even if your decision is problematic, that person would have died anyway. But when that person might have lived decades, what is always in your mind is that they might have found a new balance in their life.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In November 2016, Monique and Bert de Gooijer, a couple from Tilburg, became minor celebrities when a regional paper, the Brabants Dagblad, devoted an entire issue to the euthanasia of their son, an obese, darkly humorous, profoundly disturbed 38-year-old called Eelco. His euthanasia was one of the first high-profile cases involving a young person suffering from mental illness. Of the hundreds of reactions the newspaper received, most of them supportive, the one that made the biggest impression on the de Gooijers came from a woman whose daughter had gone out one day, taking the empty bottles to the store, and walked in front of a train. \u201cShe envied us,\u201d Monique told me as I sat with her and Bert in their front room, \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t know why her daughter had done it. She said: \u2018You were able to ask Eelco every question you had. I have only questions.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Privately, even surreptitiously undertaken, suicide leaves behind shattered lives. Even when it goes according to plan, someone finds a body. That openly discussed euthanasia can cushion or even obviate much of this hurt is something I hadn\u2019t really considered before meeting the de Gooijers. Nor had I fully savoured the irony that suicide, with its high risk of failure and collateral damage, was illegal across Europe until a few decades ago, while euthanasia, with its apparently more benign \u2013 at least, more manageable \u2013 consequences, remains illegal in most countries.</p> <p>Whatever the act of killing a physically healthy young man tells us about Dutch views of human wellbeing, the demise of Eelco de Gooijer didn\u2019t traumatise a train driver or a weekender fishing in a canal. Eelco was euthanised only after long thought and discussions with his family. He enjoyed a good laugh with the undertaker who had come to take his measurements for a super-size coffin. He was able to say farewell to everyone who loved him, and he died, as Monique and Bert assured me, at peace. There might be a word for this kind of suicide, the kind that is acceptable to all parties. Call it consensual.</p> <p>\u201cYou try to make your child happy,\u201d Monique said in her matter-of-fact way, \u201cbut Eelco wasn\u2019t happy in life. He wanted to stop suffering, and death was the only way.\u201d Eelco came of age just as euthanasia was being legalised. After years of being examined by psychiatrists who made multiple diagnoses and prescribed a variety of ineffective remedies, he began pestering the doctors of Tilburg to end his life.</p> <p>Euthanasia is counted as a basic health service, covered by the monthly premium that every citizen pays to his or her insurance company. But doctors are within their rights not to carry it out. Unique among medical procedures, a successful euthanasia isn\u2019t something you can assess with your patient after the event. A small minority of doctors refuse to perform it for this reason, and others because of religious qualms. Some simply cannot get their heads around the idea that they must kill people they came into medicine in order to save.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"040ac4f3787db0351fe34b33b501d612a96c9adf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040ac4f3787db0351fe34b33b501d612a96c9adf/0_219_2129_1277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in the Hague in 2001, while the Dutch government was debating the legalisation of euthanasia, which passed in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in the Hague in 2001, while the Dutch government was debating the legalisation of euthanasia, which passed in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serge Ligtenberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who demur on principle are a small proportion of the profession, perhaps less than 8%, according to the end-of-life specialist Agnes van der Heide. The reason why there is no uniformity of response to requests for euthanasia is that the doctor\u2019s personal views \u2013 on what constitutes \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d, for instance \u2013 often weigh decisively. As the most solemn and consequential intervention a Dutch physician can be asked to make, and this in a profession that aims to standardise responses to all eventualities, the decision to kill is oddly contingent on the mercurial human conscience.</p> <p>A category of euthanasia request that Dutch doctors commonly reject is that of a mentally ill person whose desire to die could be interpreted as a symptom of a treatable psychiatric disease \u2013 Eelco de Gooijer, in other words. Eelco was turned down by two doctors in Tilburg; one of them balked at doing the deed because she was pregnant. In desperation, Eelco turned to the Levenseindekliniek. With its ideological commitment to euthanasia and cadre of specialist doctors, it has done much to help widen the scope of the practice, and one of its teams ended Eelco\u2019s misery on 23 November 2016. A second team from the same clinic killed another psychologically disturbed youngster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/17/assisted-dying-euthanasia-netherlands\">Aurelia Brouwers</a>, early last year.</p> <p>Ideally euthanasia is a structure with three struts: patient, doctor and the patient\u2019s loved ones. In the case of Eelco de Gooijer, the struts were sturdy and aligned. Eelco\u2019s death was accomplished with compassion, circumspection and scrupulous regard for the feelings of all concerned. It\u2019s little wonder that the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society, or NVVE, vaunts it as an example of euthanasia at its best.</p> <p>After leaving the de Gooijers, I drove northwards, bisecting hectares of plant nurseries, skirting Tesla\u2019s European factory, to a conference organised by the NVVE. Apart from being the parent organisation of the Levenseindekliek, the NVVE, with its membership of 170,000 (bigger than any Dutch political party) and rolling programme of public meetings, is one of the most powerful interest groups in the Netherlands. The conference that day was aimed at tackling psychiatrists\u2019 well known opposition to euthanasia for psychiatric cases \u2013 in effect, trying to break down the considerable opposition that remains among psychiatrists to euthanising disturbed youngsters like Eelco and Aurelia.</p> <p>The conference centre on the outskirts of Driebergen stood amid tall conifers and beehives. I was offered a beaker of curried pumpkin soup while the session that was underway when I arrived \u2013 titled \u201cGuidelines for terminating life on the request of a patient with a psychiatric disorder\u201d \u2013 came to an orderly close in the lecture hall. Precisely three minutes behind schedule, the Dutch planned-death establishment debouched for refreshments.</p> <p>I had met my first NVVE member quite by chance in Amsterdam. After watching her mother die incontinent and addled, this woman of around 70 signed an advance directive requesting euthanasia should she get dementia or lose control of her bowels. These conditions currently dominate the euthanasia debate, because so many people in their 60s and 70s want an opt-out from suffering they have observed in their parents. When I mentioned to the woman in Amsterdam the reluctance of many doctors to euthanise someone who isn\u2019t mentally competent, she replied, bristling: \u201cNo doctor has the right to decide when my life should end.\u201d</p> <p>At any meeting organised by the NVVE, you will look in vain for poor people, pious Christians or members of the Netherlands\u2019 sizeable Muslim minority. Borne along by the ultra-rational spirit of Dutch libertarianism (the spirit that made the Netherlands a pioneer in reforming laws on drugs, sex and pornography), the Dutch euthanasia scene also exudes a strong whiff of upper-middle class entitlement.</p> <p>Over coffee I was introduced to Steven Pleiter, the director of the Levenseindekliniek. We went outside and basked in the early October sun as he described the \u201cshift in mindset\u201d he is trying to achieve. Choosing his words with care, Pleiter said he hoped that in future doctors will feel more confident accommodating demands for \u201cthe most complex varieties of euthanasia, like psychiatric illnesses and dementia\u201d \u2013 not through a change in the law, he added, but through a kind of \u201cacceptance \u2026 that grows and grows over the years\u201d. When I asked him if he understood the scruples of those doctors who refuse to perform euthanasia because they entered their profession in order to save lives, he replied: \u201cIf the situation is unbearable and there is no prospect of improvement, and euthanasia is an option, it would be almost unethical [of a doctor] not to help that person.\u201d</p> <p>After the Levenseindekliniek was founded in 2012, Pleiter sat down with the insurance companies to work out what they would pay the clinic for each euthanasia procedure its doctors perform. The current figure is \u20ac3,000, payable to the clinic even if the applicant pulls out at the last minute. I suggested to Pleiter that the insurance companies must prefer to pay a one-off fee for euthanising someone to spending a vast sum in order to keep that person, needy and unproductive, alive in a nursing home.</p> <p>Pleiter\u2019s pained expression suggested that I had introduced a note of cynicism into a discussion that should be conducted on a more elevated plane. \u201cThere\u2019s not an atom in my body that is in sympathy with what you are describing,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about money \u2026 it\u2019s about empathy, ethics, compassion.\u201d And he restated the credo that animates right-to-die movements everywhere: \u2018I strongly believe there is no need for suffering.\u2019</p> <p>That not all planned deaths correspond to the experiences of Bert Keizer or the de Gooijer family is something one can easily forget amid the generally positive aura that surrounds euthanasia. The more I learned about it, the more it seemed that euthanasia, while assigning commendable value to the end of life, might simultaneously cheapen life itself. Another factor I hadn\u2019t appreciated was the possibility of collateral damage. In an event as delicately contractual as euthanasia, there are different varieties of suffering.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Back in the days when euthanasia was illegal but tolerated, the euthanising doctor was obliged to consult the relatives of the person who had asked to die. Due to qualms over personal autonomy and patient-doctor confidentiality \u2013 and an entirely proper concern to protect vulnerable people from unscrupulous relatives \u2013 this obligation didn\u2019t make it into the 2002 law that legalised euthanasia.</p> <p>This legal nicety would become painfully significant to a middle-aged motorcycle salesman from Zwolle called Marc Veld. In the spring of last year, he began to suspect that his mother, Marijke, was planning to be euthanised, but he never got the opportunity to explain to her doctor why, in his view, her suffering was neither unbearable nor impossible to alleviate. On 9 June, the doctor phoned him and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your mother passed away half an hour ago.\u201d</p> <p>Marc showed me a picture he had taken of Marijke in her coffin, her white hair carefully brushed and her skin glowing with the smooth, even foundation of the mortuary beautician. Between her hands was a letter Marc had put there and would be buried with her \u2013 a letter detailing his unhappiness, resentment and guilt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc63cf7fdb4279344eac3f9c963b99dbc22d3498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc63cf7fdb4279344eac3f9c963b99dbc22d3498/3_0_1007_1258/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marijke, who was euthanised at 76, with a letter from her son, written after her death, detailing his upset at her decision.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marijke, who was euthanised at 76, with a letter from her son, written after her death, detailing his upset at her decision.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Veld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is little doubt that Marijke spent much of her 76 years in torment, beginning with her infancy in a Japanese concentration camp after the invasion of the Dutch East Indies, in 1941, and recurring during her unhappy adulthood in the Netherlands. But Dutch doctors don\u2019t euthanise people because of depression \u2013 even if the more extreme advocates of the right to die think they should. As a result, it isn\u2019t uncommon for depressives or lonely people to emphasise a physical ailment in order to get their euthanasia request approved. During his time on the review board, Theo Boer came across several cases in which the \u201cdeath wish preceded the physical illness \u2026 some patients are happy to be able to ask for euthanasia on the basis of a physical reason, while the real reason is deeper\u201d.</p> <p>In Marijke\u2019s case, the physical reason was a terminal lung disease, which, Marc told me, she both exacerbated and exaggerated. She did this by cancelling physiotherapy sessions that might have slowed its progress, bombarding her GP with complaints about shortness of breath and slumping \u201clike a sack of potatoes\u201d whenever he visited. \u201cTo be sure of being euthanised,\u201d Marc said drily, \u201cyou need above all to take acting lessons.\u201d</p> <p>What torments him today is that his mother died while there was hope that her illness could be slowed. \u201cIf she had cancer and was feeling pain and it was the last three months of her life, I would have been happy for her to have euthanasia. But she could have lived at least a few more years.\u201d</p> <p>Defenders of personal autonomy would say that Marc had no business interfering in his mother\u2019s death, but beneath his anger lies the inconsolable sadness of a son who blames himself for not doing more. Marijke\u2019s euthanasia was carried out according to the law, and will raise no alarms in the review board. It was also carried out without regard to her relatedness to other human beings.</p> <p>For all the safeguards that have been put in place against the manipulation of applicants for euthanasia, in cases where patients do include relatives in their decision-making, it can never be entirely foreclosed, as I discovered in a GP\u2019s surgery in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium.</p> <p>The GP in question \u2013 we\u2019ll call her Marie-Louise \u2013 is a self-confessed idealist who sees it as her mission to \u201ccare, care, care\u201d. In 2017, one of her patients, a man in late middle-age, was diagnosed with dementia and signed a directive asking for euthanasia when his condition worsened. As his mind faltered, however, so did his resolve \u2013 which did not please his wife, who became an evangelist for her husband\u2019s death. \u201cHe must have changed his mind 20 times,\u201d Marie-Louise said. \u201cI saw the pressure she was applying.\u201d</p> <p>In order to illustrate one of the woman\u2019s outbursts, Marie-Louise rose from her desk, walked over to the filing cabinet and, adopting the persona of the infuriated wife, slammed down her fist, exclaiming, \u201cIf only he had the courage! Coward!\u201d</p> <p>Most medical ethicists would approve of Marie-Louise\u2019s refusal to euthanise a patient who had been pressured. By the time she went away on holiday last summer, she believed she had won from her patient an undertaking not to press for euthanasia. But she had not reckoned with her own colleague in the practice, a doctor who takes a favourable line towards euthanasia, and when Marie-Louise returned from holidays she found out that this colleague had euthanised her patient.</p> <p>When I visited Marie-Louise several months after the event, she remained bewildered by what had happened. As with Marc, guilt was a factor; if she hadn\u2019t gone away, would her patient still be alive? Now she was making plans to leave the practice, but hadn\u2019t yet made an announcement for fear of unsettling her other patients. \u201cHow can I stay here?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a doctor and yet I can\u2019t guarantee the safety of my most vulnerable patients.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While for many people whose loved ones have been euthanised, the procedure can be satisfactory and even inspiring, in others it has caused hurt and inner conflict. Bert Keizer rightly observes that suicide leaves scars on friends and family that may never heal. But suicide is an individual act, self-motivated and self-administered, and its force field is contained. Euthanasia, by contrast, is the product of society. When it goes wrong, it goes wrong for everyone.</p> <p>Even as law and culture make euthanasia seem more normal, it remains among the most unfamiliar acts a society can condone. It isn\u2019t enough that the legal niceties be observed; there needs to be agreement among the interested parties on why it is taking place, and to what end. Without consensus on these basic motivations, euthanasia won\u2019t be an occasion for empathy, ethics or compassion, but a bludgeon swinging through people\u2019s lives, whose handiwork cannot be undone.</p> <p>Two years ago the Netherlands\u2019 health and justice ministers issued a joint proposal for a \u201ccompleted life\u201d pill that would give anyone over 70 years of age the right to receive a lethal poison, cutting the doctor out of the equation completely. In the event, the fragmented nature of Dutch coalition politics stopped the proposal in its tracks, but doctors and end-of-life specialists I spoke to expect legislation to introduce such a completed-life bill to come before parliament in due course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/10/my-death-is-not-my-own-the-limits-of-legal-euthanasia\">\u2018My death is not my own\u2019: the limits of legal euthanasia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Assuming it could be properly safeguarded (a big assumption), the completed-life pill would not necessarily displease many doctors I spoke to; it would allow them to get back to saving lives. But while some applicants for euthanasia are furious with doctors who turn them down, in practice people are unwilling to take their own lives. Rather than drink the poison or open the drip, 95% of applicants for active life termination in the Netherlands ask a doctor to kill them. In a society that vaunts its rejection of established figures of authority, when it comes to death, everyone asks for Mummy.</p> <p>Even those who have grave worries about the slippery slope concede that consensual euthanasia for terminal illness can be a beautiful thing, and that the principle of death at a time of one\u2019s choosing can fit into a framework of care. The question for any country contemplating euthanasia legislation is whether the practice must inevitably expand \u2013 in which case, as Agnes van der Heide recognises, death will eventually \u201cget a different meaning, be appreciated differently\u201d. In the Netherlands many people would argue that \u2013 for all the current wobbles \u2013 that process is now irreversible.</p> <p><em>Christopher de Bellaigue will chair a discussion on euthanasia at the Dutch Centre in London EC2 on 23 Wednesday Jan at 7pm.

      "bodyText": "Last year a Dutch doctor called Bert Keizer was summoned to the house of a man dying of lung cancer, in order to end his life. When Keizer and the nurse who was to assist him arrived, they found around 35 people gathered around the dying man\u2019s bed. \u201cThey were drinking and guffawing and crying,\u201d Keizer told me when I met him in Amsterdam recently. \u201cIt was boisterous. And I thought: \u2018How am I going to cleave the waters?\u2019 But the man knew exactly what to do. Suddenly he said, \u2018OK, guys!\u2019 and everyone understood. Everyone fell silent. The very small children were taken out of the room and I gave him his injection. I could have kissed him, because I wouldn\u2019t have known how to break up the party.\u201d Keizer is one of around 60 physicians on the books of the Levenseindekliniek, or End of Life Clinic, which matches doctors willing to perform euthanasia with patients seeking an end to their lives, and which was responsible for the euthanasia of some 750 people in 2017. For Keizer, who was a philosopher before studying medicine, the advent of widespread access to euthanasia represents a new era. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe have developed a space where people move towards death while we are touching them and they are in our midst. That\u2019s completely different from killing yourself when your wife\u2019s out shopping and the kids are at school and you hang yourself in the library \u2013 which is the most horrible way of doing it, because the wound never heals. The fact that you are a person means that you are linked to other people. And we have found a bearable way of severing that link, not by a natural death, but by a self-willed ending. It\u2019s a very special thing.\u201d This \u201cspecial thing\u201d has in fact become normal. Everyone in the Netherlands seems to have known someone who has been euthanised, and the kind of choreographed farewell that Keizer describes is far from unusual. Certainly, the idea that we humans have a variety of deaths to choose from is more familiar in the Netherlands than anywhere else. But the long-term consequences of this idea are only just becoming discernible. Euthanasia has been legal in the Netherlands for long enough to show what can happen after the practice beds in. And as an end-of-life specialist in a nation that has for decades been the standard bearer of libertarian reform, Keizer may be a witness to the future that awaits us all. In 2002, the parliament in the Hague legalised euthanasia for patients experiencing \u201cunbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement\u201d. Since then, euthanasia and its close relation, assisted dying, in which one person facilitates the suicide of another, have been embraced by Belgium and Canada, while public opinion in many countries where it isn\u2019t on the national statute, such as Britain, the US and New Zealand, has swung heavily in favour. The momentum of euthanasia appears unstoppable; after Colombia, in 2015, and the Australian state of Victoria, in 2017, Spain may be the next big jurisdiction to legalise physician-assisted death, while one in six Americans (the majority of them in California) live in states where it is legal. In Switzerland, which has the world\u2019s oldest assisted dying laws, foreigners are also able to obtain euthanasia. If western society continues to follow the Dutch, Belgian and Canadian examples, there is every chance that in a few decades\u2019 time euthanasia will be one widely available option from a menu of possible deaths, including an \u201cend of life\u201d poison pill available on demand to anyone who finds life unbearable. For many greying baby boomers \u2013 veterans of earlier struggles to legalise abortion and contraception \u2013 a civilised death at a time of their choosing is a right that the state should provide and regulate. As this generation enters its final years, the precept that life is precious irrespective of one\u2019s medical condition is being called into question as never before. As the world\u2019s pioneer, the Netherlands has also discovered that although legalising euthanasia might resolve one ethical conundrum, it opens a can of others \u2013 most importantly, where the limits of the practice should be drawn. In the past few years a small but influential group of academics and jurists have raised the alarm over what is generally referred to, a little archly, as the \u201cslippery slope\u201d \u2013 the idea that a measure introduced to provide relief to late-stage cancer patients has expanded to include people who might otherwise live for many years, from sufferers of diseases such as muscular dystrophy to sexagenarians with dementia and even mentally ill young people. Perhaps the most prominent of these sceptics is Theo Boer, who teaches ethics at the Theological University of Kampen. Between 2005 and 2014, Boer was a member of one of the five regional boards that were set up to review every act of euthanasia and hand cases over to prosecutors if irregularities are detected. (Each review board is composed of a lawyer, a doctor and an ethicist.) Recent government figures suggest that doubts over the direction of Dutch euthanasia are having an effect on the willingness of doctors to perform the procedure. In November, the health ministry revealed that in the first nine months of 2018 the number of cases was down 9% compared to the same period in 2017, the first drop since 2006. In a related sign of a more hostile legal environment, shortly afterwards the judiciary announced the first prosecution of a doctor for malpractice while administering euthanasia. It is too early to say if euthanasia in the Netherlands has reached a high-water mark \u2013 and too early to say if the other countries that are currently making it easier to have an assisted death will also hesitate if the practice comes to be seen as too widespread. But it is significant that in addition to the passionate advocacy of Bert Keizer \u2013 who positively welcomes the \u201cslippery slope\u201d \u2013 Boer\u2019s more critical views are being solicited by foreign parliamentarians and ethicists who are considering legal changes in their own countries. As Boer explained to me, \u201cwhen I\u2019m showing the statistics to people in Portugal or Iceland or wherever, I say: \u2018Look closely at the Netherlands because this is where your country may be 20 years from now.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe process of bringing in euthanasia legislation began with a desire to deal with the most heartbreaking cases \u2013 really terrible forms of death,\u201d Boer said. \u201cBut there have been important changes in the way the law is applied. We have put in motion something that we have now discovered has more consequences than we ever imagined.\u201d * * * Bert Keizer carried out his first euthanasia in 1984. Back then, when he was working as a doctor in a care home, ending the life of a desperately ill person at their request was illegal, even if prosecutions were rare. When a retired shoemaker called Antonius Albertus, who was dying of lung cancer, asked to be put out of his misery, Keizer found that two sides of himself \u2013 the law-abiding doctor and the altruist \u2013 were at odds. \u201cAntonius wasn\u2019t in pain,\u201d Keizer told me, \u201cbut he had that particular exhaustion that every oncologist knows, a harrowing exhaustion, and I saw him dwindle before me.\u201d In the event, Keizer, who as an 11-year-old watched his mother suffer an excruciating death from liver disease, went with the altruist. He injected 40mg of Valium into Antonius \u2013 enough to put him in a coma \u2013 then gave him the anti-respiratory drug that ended his life. Keizer was not investigated after reporting an unnatural death at his own hand, and his career did not suffer as he feared it might. But what, I asked him, had prompted him to break the law, and violate a principle \u2013 the preservation of life \u2013 that has defined medical ethics since Hippocrates? Keizer paused to brush away a spider that had crawled uninvited on to my shoulder. \u201cIt was something very selfish,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf ever I was in his situation, asking for death, I would want people to listen to me, and not say, \u2018It cannot be done because of the law or the Bible.\u2019\u201d Over the past few decades the Bible has been increasingly sidelined, and the law has vindicated the young doctor who put Antonius to sleep. As people got used to the new law, the number of Dutch people being euthanised began to rise sharply, from under 2,000 in 2007 to almost 6,600 in 2017. (Around the same number are estimated to have had their euthanasia request turned down as not conforming with the legal requirements.) Also in 2017, some 1,900 Dutch people killed themselves, while the number of people who died under palliative sedation \u2013 in theory, succumbing to their illness while cocooned from physical discomfort, but in practice often dying of dehydration while unconscious \u2013 hit an astonishing 32,000. Altogether, well over a quarter of all deaths in 2017 in the Netherlands were induced. One of the reasons why euthanasia became more common after 2007 is that the range of conditions considered eligible expanded, while the definition of \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d that is central to the law was also loosened. At the same time, murmurs of apprehension began to be heard, which, even in the marvellously decorous chamber of Dutch public debate, have risen in volume. Concerns centre on two issues with strong relevance to euthanasia: dementia and autonomy. Many Dutch people write advance directives that stipulate that if their mental state later deteriorates beyond a certain point \u2013 if, say, they are unable to recognise family members \u2013 they are to be euthanised regardless of whether they dissent from their original wishes. But Last January a medical ethicist called Berna Van Baarsen caused a stir when she resigned from one of the review boards in protest at the growing frequency with which dementia sufferers are being euthanised on the basis of a written directive that they are unable to confirm after losing their faculties. \u201cIt is fundamentally impossible,\u201d she told the newspaper Trouw, \u201cto establish that the patient is suffering unbearably, because he can no longer explain it.\u201d Van Baarsen\u2019s scruples have crystallised in the country\u2019s first euthanasia malpractice case, which prosecutors are now preparing. (Three further cases are currently under investigation.) It involves a dementia sufferer who had asked to be killed when the \u201ctime\u201d was \u201cright\u201d, but when her doctor judged this to be the case, she resisted. The patient had to be drugged and restrained by her family before she finally submitted to the doctor\u2019s fatal injection. The doctor who administered the dose \u2013 who has not been identified \u2013 has defended her actions by saying that she was fulfilling her patient\u2019s request and that, since the patient was incompetent, her protests before her death were irrelevant. Whatever the legal merits of her argument, it hardly changes what must have been a scene of unutterable grimness. The underlying problem with the advance directives is that they imply the subordination of an irrational human being to their rational former self, essentially splitting a single person into two mutually opposed ones. Many doctors, having watched patients adapt to circumstances they had once expected to find intolerable, doubt whether anyone can accurately predict what they will want after their condition worsens. The second conflict that has crept in as euthanasia has been normalised is a societal one. It comes up when there is an opposition between the right of the individual and society\u2019s obligation to protect lives. \u201cThe euthanasia requests that are the most problematic,\u201d explains Agnes van der Heide, professor of medical care and end-of-life decision-making at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, \u201care those that are based on the patient\u2019s autonomy, which leads them to tell the doctor: \u2018You aren\u2019t the one to judge whether I am to die.\u2019\u201d She doesn\u2019t expect this impulse, already strong among baby boomers, to diminish among coming generations. \u201cFor our young people, the autonomy principle is at the forefront of their thinking.\u201d The growing divisions over euthanasia are being reflected in the deliberations of the review boards. Consensus is rarer than it was when the only cases that came before them involved patients with late-stage terminal illnesses, who were of sound mind. Since her resignation, Berna Van Baarsen has complained that \u201clegal arguments weigh more and more heavily\u201d on the committees, \u201cwhile the moral question of whether in certain cases good is done by killing, threatens to get snowed under\u201d. In this new, more ambiguous environment, the recent dip in euthanasia numbers doesn\u2019t seem surprising. Besides their fear of attracting prosecutors\u2019 attention, some doctors have been irked by the growing public perception that they are no-questions-asked purveyors of dignified death, and are pushing back. For Dutch GPs, fielding demands for euthanasia from assertive patients who resent the slightest reluctance on the part of their physician has become one of the more disagreeable aspects of their job. \u201cIn the coldest weeks of last winter,\u201d Theo Boer told me, \u201ca doctor friend of mine was told by an elderly patient: \u2018I demand to have euthanasia this week \u2013 you promised.\u2019 The doctor replied: \u2018It\u2019s -15C outside. Take a bottle of whisky and sit in your garden and we will find you tomorrow, because I cannot accept that you make me responsible for your own suicide.\u2019 The doctor in question, Boer said, used to perform euthanasia on around three people a year. He has now stopped altogether. Although he supported the 2002 euthanasia law at the time, Boer now regrets that it didn\u2019t stipulate that the patient must be competent at the time of termination, and that if possible the patient should administer the fatal dose themselves. Boer is also concerned about the psychological effect on doctors of killing someone with a substantial life expectancy: \u201cWhen you euthanise a final-stage cancer patient, you know that even if your decision is problematic, that person would have died anyway. But when that person might have lived decades, what is always in your mind is that they might have found a new balance in their life.\u201d * * * In November 2016, Monique and Bert de Gooijer, a couple from Tilburg, became minor celebrities when a regional paper, the Brabants Dagblad, devoted an entire issue to the euthanasia of their son, an obese, darkly humorous, profoundly disturbed 38-year-old called Eelco. His euthanasia was one of the first high-profile cases involving a young person suffering from mental illness. Of the hundreds of reactions the newspaper received, most of them supportive, the one that made the biggest impression on the de Gooijers came from a woman whose daughter had gone out one day, taking the empty bottles to the store, and walked in front of a train. \u201cShe envied us,\u201d Monique told me as I sat with her and Bert in their front room, \u201cbecause she didn\u2019t know why her daughter had done it. She said: \u2018You were able to ask Eelco every question you had. I have only questions.\u2019\u201d Privately, even surreptitiously undertaken, suicide leaves behind shattered lives. Even when it goes according to plan, someone finds a body. That openly discussed euthanasia can cushion or even obviate much of this hurt is something I hadn\u2019t really considered before meeting the de Gooijers. Nor had I fully savoured the irony that suicide, with its high risk of failure and collateral damage, was illegal across Europe until a few decades ago, while euthanasia, with its apparently more benign \u2013 at least, more manageable \u2013 consequences, remains illegal in most countries. Whatever the act of killing a physically healthy young man tells us about Dutch views of human wellbeing, the demise of Eelco de Gooijer didn\u2019t traumatise a train driver or a weekender fishing in a canal. Eelco was euthanised only after long thought and discussions with his family. He enjoyed a good laugh with the undertaker who had come to take his measurements for a super-size coffin. He was able to say farewell to everyone who loved him, and he died, as Monique and Bert assured me, at peace. There might be a word for this kind of suicide, the kind that is acceptable to all parties. Call it consensual. \u201cYou try to make your child happy,\u201d Monique said in her matter-of-fact way, \u201cbut Eelco wasn\u2019t happy in life. He wanted to stop suffering, and death was the only way.\u201d Eelco came of age just as euthanasia was being legalised. After years of being examined by psychiatrists who made multiple diagnoses and prescribed a variety of ineffective remedies, he began pestering the doctors of Tilburg to end his life. Euthanasia is counted as a basic health service, covered by the monthly premium that every citizen pays to his or her insurance company. But doctors are within their rights not to carry it out. Unique among medical procedures, a successful euthanasia isn\u2019t something you can assess with your patient after the event. A small minority of doctors refuse to perform it for this reason, and others because of religious qualms. Some simply cannot get their heads around the idea that they must kill people they came into medicine in order to save. Those who demur on principle are a small proportion of the profession, perhaps less than 8%, according to the end-of-life specialist Agnes van der Heide. The reason why there is no uniformity of response to requests for euthanasia is that the doctor\u2019s personal views \u2013 on what constitutes \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d, for instance \u2013 often weigh decisively. As the most solemn and consequential intervention a Dutch physician can be asked to make, and this in a profession that aims to standardise responses to all eventualities, the decision to kill is oddly contingent on the mercurial human conscience. A category of euthanasia request that Dutch doctors commonly reject is that of a mentally ill person whose desire to die could be interpreted as a symptom of a treatable psychiatric disease \u2013 Eelco de Gooijer, in other words. Eelco was turned down by two doctors in Tilburg; one of them balked at doing the deed because she was pregnant. In desperation, Eelco turned to the Levenseindekliniek. With its ideological commitment to euthanasia and cadre of specialist doctors, it has done much to help widen the scope of the practice, and one of its teams ended Eelco\u2019s misery on 23 November 2016. A second team from the same clinic killed another psychologically disturbed youngster, Aurelia Brouwers, early last year. Ideally euthanasia is a structure with three struts: patient, doctor and the patient\u2019s loved ones. In the case of Eelco de Gooijer, the struts were sturdy and aligned. Eelco\u2019s death was accomplished with compassion, circumspection and scrupulous regard for the feelings of all concerned. It\u2019s little wonder that the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society, or NVVE, vaunts it as an example of euthanasia at its best. After leaving the de Gooijers, I drove northwards, bisecting hectares of plant nurseries, skirting Tesla\u2019s European factory, to a conference organised by the NVVE. Apart from being the parent organisation of the Levenseindekliek, the NVVE, with its membership of 170,000 (bigger than any Dutch political party) and rolling programme of public meetings, is one of the most powerful interest groups in the Netherlands. The conference that day was aimed at tackling psychiatrists\u2019 well known opposition to euthanasia for psychiatric cases \u2013 in effect, trying to break down the considerable opposition that remains among psychiatrists to euthanising disturbed youngsters like Eelco and Aurelia. The conference centre on the outskirts of Driebergen stood amid tall conifers and beehives. I was offered a beaker of curried pumpkin soup while the session that was underway when I arrived \u2013 titled \u201cGuidelines for terminating life on the request of a patient with a psychiatric disorder\u201d \u2013 came to an orderly close in the lecture hall. Precisely three minutes behind schedule, the Dutch planned-death establishment debouched for refreshments. I had met my first NVVE member quite by chance in Amsterdam. After watching her mother die incontinent and addled, this woman of around 70 signed an advance directive requesting euthanasia should she get dementia or lose control of her bowels. These conditions currently dominate the euthanasia debate, because so many people in their 60s and 70s want an opt-out from suffering they have observed in their parents. When I mentioned to the woman in Amsterdam the reluctance of many doctors to euthanise someone who isn\u2019t mentally competent, she replied, bristling: \u201cNo doctor has the right to decide when my life should end.\u201d At any meeting organised by the NVVE, you will look in vain for poor people, pious Christians or members of the Netherlands\u2019 sizeable Muslim minority. Borne along by the ultra-rational spirit of Dutch libertarianism (the spirit that made the Netherlands a pioneer in reforming laws on drugs, sex and pornography), the Dutch euthanasia scene also exudes a strong whiff of upper-middle class entitlement. Over coffee I was introduced to Steven Pleiter, the director of the Levenseindekliniek. We went outside and basked in the early October sun as he described the \u201cshift in mindset\u201d he is trying to achieve. Choosing his words with care, Pleiter said he hoped that in future doctors will feel more confident accommodating demands for \u201cthe most complex varieties of euthanasia, like psychiatric illnesses and dementia\u201d \u2013 not through a change in the law, he added, but through a kind of \u201cacceptance \u2026 that grows and grows over the years\u201d. When I asked him if he understood the scruples of those doctors who refuse to perform euthanasia because they entered their profession in order to save lives, he replied: \u201cIf the situation is unbearable and there is no prospect of improvement, and euthanasia is an option, it would be almost unethical [of a doctor] not to help that person.\u201d After the Levenseindekliniek was founded in 2012, Pleiter sat down with the insurance companies to work out what they would pay the clinic for each euthanasia procedure its doctors perform. The current figure is \u20ac3,000, payable to the clinic even if the applicant pulls out at the last minute. I suggested to Pleiter that the insurance companies must prefer to pay a one-off fee for euthanising someone to spending a vast sum in order to keep that person, needy and unproductive, alive in a nursing home. Pleiter\u2019s pained expression suggested that I had introduced a note of cynicism into a discussion that should be conducted on a more elevated plane. \u201cThere\u2019s not an atom in my body that is in sympathy with what you are describing,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about money \u2026 it\u2019s about empathy, ethics, compassion.\u201d And he restated the credo that animates right-to-die movements everywhere: \u2018I strongly believe there is no need for suffering.\u2019 That not all planned deaths correspond to the experiences of Bert Keizer or the de Gooijer family is something one can easily forget amid the generally positive aura that surrounds euthanasia. The more I learned about it, the more it seemed that euthanasia, while assigning commendable value to the end of life, might simultaneously cheapen life itself. Another factor I hadn\u2019t appreciated was the possibility of collateral damage. In an event as delicately contractual as euthanasia, there are different varieties of suffering. * * * Back in the days when euthanasia was illegal but tolerated, the euthanising doctor was obliged to consult the relatives of the person who had asked to die. Due to qualms over personal autonomy and patient-doctor confidentiality \u2013 and an entirely proper concern to protect vulnerable people from unscrupulous relatives \u2013 this obligation didn\u2019t make it into the 2002 law that legalised euthanasia. This legal nicety would become painfully significant to a middle-aged motorcycle salesman from Zwolle called Marc Veld. In the spring of last year, he began to suspect that his mother, Marijke, was planning to be euthanised, but he never got the opportunity to explain to her doctor why, in his view, her suffering was neither unbearable nor impossible to alleviate. On 9 June, the doctor phoned him and said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your mother passed away half an hour ago.\u201d Marc showed me a picture he had taken of Marijke in her coffin, her white hair carefully brushed and her skin glowing with the smooth, even foundation of the mortuary beautician. Between her hands was a letter Marc had put there and would be buried with her \u2013 a letter detailing his unhappiness, resentment and guilt. There is little doubt that Marijke spent much of her 76 years in torment, beginning with her infancy in a Japanese concentration camp after the invasion of the Dutch East Indies, in 1941, and recurring during her unhappy adulthood in the Netherlands. But Dutch doctors don\u2019t euthanise people because of depression \u2013 even if the more extreme advocates of the right to die think they should. As a result, it isn\u2019t uncommon for depressives or lonely people to emphasise a physical ailment in order to get their euthanasia request approved. During his time on the review board, Theo Boer came across several cases in which the \u201cdeath wish preceded the physical illness \u2026 some patients are happy to be able to ask for euthanasia on the basis of a physical reason, while the real reason is deeper\u201d. In Marijke\u2019s case, the physical reason was a terminal lung disease, which, Marc told me, she both exacerbated and exaggerated. She did this by cancelling physiotherapy sessions that might have slowed its progress, bombarding her GP with complaints about shortness of breath and slumping \u201clike a sack of potatoes\u201d whenever he visited. \u201cTo be sure of being euthanised,\u201d Marc said drily, \u201cyou need above all to take acting lessons.\u201d What torments him today is that his mother died while there was hope that her illness could be slowed. \u201cIf she had cancer and was feeling pain and it was the last three months of her life, I would have been happy for her to have euthanasia. But she could have lived at least a few more years.\u201d Defenders of personal autonomy would say that Marc had no business interfering in his mother\u2019s death, but beneath his anger lies the inconsolable sadness of a son who blames himself for not doing more. Marijke\u2019s euthanasia was carried out according to the law, and will raise no alarms in the review board. It was also carried out without regard to her relatedness to other human beings. For all the safeguards that have been put in place against the manipulation of applicants for euthanasia, in cases where patients do include relatives in their decision-making, it can never be entirely foreclosed, as I discovered in a GP\u2019s surgery in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium. The GP in question \u2013 we\u2019ll call her Marie-Louise \u2013 is a self-confessed idealist who sees it as her mission to \u201ccare, care, care\u201d. In 2017, one of her patients, a man in late middle-age, was diagnosed with dementia and signed a directive asking for euthanasia when his condition worsened. As his mind faltered, however, so did his resolve \u2013 which did not please his wife, who became an evangelist for her husband\u2019s death. \u201cHe must have changed his mind 20 times,\u201d Marie-Louise said. \u201cI saw the pressure she was applying.\u201d In order to illustrate one of the woman\u2019s outbursts, Marie-Louise rose from her desk, walked over to the filing cabinet and, adopting the persona of the infuriated wife, slammed down her fist, exclaiming, \u201cIf only he had the courage! Coward!\u201d Most medical ethicists would approve of Marie-Louise\u2019s refusal to euthanise a patient who had been pressured. By the time she went away on holiday last summer, she believed she had won from her patient an undertaking not to press for euthanasia. But she had not reckoned with her own colleague in the practice, a doctor who takes a favourable line towards euthanasia, and when Marie-Louise returned from holidays she found out that this colleague had euthanised her patient. When I visited Marie-Louise several months after the event, she remained bewildered by what had happened. As with Marc, guilt was a factor; if she hadn\u2019t gone away, would her patient still be alive? Now she was making plans to leave the practice, but hadn\u2019t yet made an announcement for fear of unsettling her other patients. \u201cHow can I stay here?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a doctor and yet I can\u2019t guarantee the safety of my most vulnerable patients.\u201d * * * While for many people whose loved ones have been euthanised, the procedure can be satisfactory and even inspiring, in others it has caused hurt and inner conflict. Bert Keizer rightly observes that suicide leaves scars on friends and family that may never heal. But suicide is an individual act, self-motivated and self-administered, and its force field is contained. Euthanasia, by contrast, is the product of society. When it goes wrong, it goes wrong for everyone. Even as law and culture make euthanasia seem more normal, it remains among the most unfamiliar acts a society can condone. It isn\u2019t enough that the legal niceties be observed; there needs to be agreement among the interested parties on why it is taking place, and to what end. Without consensus on these basic motivations, euthanasia won\u2019t be an occasion for empathy, ethics or compassion, but a bludgeon swinging through people\u2019s lives, whose handiwork cannot be undone. Two years ago the Netherlands\u2019 health and justice ministers issued a joint proposal for a \u201ccompleted life\u201d pill that would give anyone over 70 years of age the right to receive a lethal poison, cutting the doctor out of the equation completely. In the event, the fragmented nature of Dutch coalition politics stopped the proposal in its tracks, but doctors and end-of-life specialists I spoke to expect legislation to introduce such a completed-life bill to come before parliament in due course. Assuming it could be properly safeguarded (a big assumption), the completed-life pill would not necessarily displease many doctors I spoke to; it would allow them to get back to saving lives. But while some applicants for euthanasia are furious with doctors who turn them down, in practice people are unwilling to take their own lives. Rather than drink the poison or open the drip, 95% of applicants for active life termination in the Netherlands ask a doctor to kill them. In a society that vaunts its rejection of established figures of authority, when it comes to death, everyone asks for Mummy. Even those who have grave worries about the slippery slope concede that consensual euthanasia for terminal illness can be a beautiful thing, and that the principle of death at a time of one\u2019s choosing can fit into a framework of care. The question for any country contemplating euthanasia legislation is whether the practice must inevitably expand \u2013 in which case, as Agnes van der Heide recognises, death will eventually \u201cget a different meaning, be appreciated differently\u201d. In the Netherlands many people would argue that \u2013 for all the current wobbles \u2013 that process is now irreversible. Christopher de Bellaigue will chair a discussion on euthanasia at the Dutch Centre in London EC2 on 23 Wednesday Jan at 7pm. See dutchcentre.com. This article was supported by funding from the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting \u2022 This article was amended on 23 and 24 January 2019. A previous version referred to \u201cmuscle-wasting diseases such as multiple sclerosis\u201d, where muscular dystrophy was meant. It was further amended because an earlier version said the decision to allow euthanasia was \u201ccontingent on a single, mercurial human conscience\u201d. Dutch law states that at least two doctors must be involved in any request for assisted dying. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

They bought into individualism. I think the left gave up on mass politics and power sometime in the early 70s, and went for a much more individualistic way of being radical, through art and self-expression. It became a nice way of being. But what you chart in Vice is a ruthless power grab. The really interesting thing about our time is that no one talks about power.

It was a complete sensation. It was funded by the State Department, not as a great conspiracy, but because of this idea that what you have to show people now is that we\u2019re just a world of individuals.

To challenge that, you\u2019re going to have to bring people together with a very powerful story. But that\u2019s frightening \u2013 potentially dangerous.

      "bodyText": "Adam McKay\u2019s Vice is a screwball biopic of Dick Cheney, the man widely reckoned to be the most powerful vice-president in US history. It traces his rise from beer-brained dropout to an intern during the Nixon administration, then covers his tenure as secretary of defense during the Gulf war, and his time as George W Bush\u2019s official deputy from 2001-2009. McKay, after establishing his career with comedies such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Step Brothers, moved into freewheeling, lightly fictionalised accounts of real-life events. His previous film was the financial-crash comedy The Big Short. McKay\u2019s kaleidoscopic approach \u2013 the narrative chopped up, and peppered with asides and data breaks \u2013 recalls the larky yet hard-hitting style of the British journalist and film-maker Adam Curtis, the person behind films such as The Power of Nightmares and Bitter Lake. The two men also share an interest in unpicking political narratives and in examining how the structure of society can be insidiously shifted by individuals \u2013 and, of course, they share a first name. So, we asked them to sit down together for a cup of tea with Paul MacInnes at the Soho hotel in London. They began by discussing Vice\u2019s key sequences, set in the late 1970s, when Cheney (Christian Bale) and Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) orchestrated a rightwing stealth-revolution that ushered in a sustained era of Republican power and idealism. Adam Curtis: It was a moment. Adam McKay: I thought that moment was everything. The oligarchs and the corporations were mobilised through [conservative and libertarian thinktanks] the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. This idea of Ronald Reagan saying: \u201cIf you lean towards government, you are weak \u2026 true individuals don\u2019t need government. And, oh, by the way, tax breaks for billionaires.\u201d Really, we\u2019re still living in that change. AC: The very interesting question is why the opposition let it happen. They bought into individualism. I think the left gave up on mass politics and power sometime in the early 70s, and went for a much more individualistic way of being radical, through art and self-expression. It became a nice way of being. But what you chart in Vice is a ruthless power grab. The really interesting thing about our time is that no one talks about power. The left don\u2019t talk about it; the liberals don\u2019t talk about it. AM: The entire reason I made the movie was because of what you just said. Nobody talks about power any more. Honest to God. There was the whole movement of taking power that we just ignored. AC: We didn\u2019t see it. AM: And the Democrats just rolled over. They betrayed the unions, and really started to believe in this idea of free trade, markets, banks and a load of gibberish. AC: I think you\u2019re spot on. It\u2019s the fundamental problem of why the left and liberals can\u2019t find a way of challenging what\u2019s rising up now. They gave in, and have given up talking about power. I think that\u2019s because power is quite frightening. AM: It\u2019s delicious. AC: Suddenly, you realise that you can make the world the way you want it to be. I think what you show Cheney beginning to realise is: if I get this, I can do anything. AM: Information warfare is where we\u2019re living now. More specifically, it\u2019s story warfare. There\u2019s this battle in the US where our oligarchs are claiming they are the Joseph Campbell heroes. That they\u2019re the ones who are going through the three-act structure of going into the unknown. Charles Koch is taking on the world. There\u2019s this weird thing going on where these traditional story structures really play bogus now. AC: That\u2019s because they have been appropriated by those people who really do have power. But that\u2019s also because politicians have given up telling stories. They have nothing to say any longer. AM: Nothing! AC: They\u2019ve become managers. AM: I met with some of these Democratic leaders, and they talk about polling and market testing like they\u2019re bad network executives. I have to tell them: the second you do that, you\u2019re dead. That\u2019s why the Democratic party is not tackling global warming \u2013 because it polls terribly. And why wouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019s about the end of human life. AC: That\u2019s because they present it as a doom-laden dystopia, and not an opportunity to do something to change the world in an extraordinary way. AM: The Green New Deal is exciting. AC: Exactly. Because that allows you to combine it with attacking austerity and the badness of the present day, and saying we can produce a better world, for now and for the future. But global warming is not presented as an opportunity to change the planet in an extraordinary and better way, is it? It\u2019s a dark force that we\u2019re being sucked into, and can do nothing about. The politicians and the thinktankers, say: \u201cOh my God! It\u2019s all going to die.\u201d My theory is that they\u2019re late baby boomers projecting their own fear of mortality on to the planet. They\u2019re trapping us in the depressed mind of a dying hippy. That\u2019s my theory. AM: So what\u2019s in the movie you\u2019re working on? AC: Its working title is What Is It That Is Coming? At the moment, I\u2019m on the seventh episode; I think there are going to be nine episodes. AM: I can\u2019t wait. AC: I don\u2019t know. Yesterday was not very good.

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s harsh treatment of its female celebrities has again come under scrutiny following outcry over the music industry\u2019s handling of an alleged assault on a member of a popular girl band. Social media users and TV commentators have joined the barrage of criticism targeting AKS, a music management agency, after Maho Yamaguchi, a singer with NGT48, went public this month with allegations she had been assaulted by two obsessive fans at the end of last year. Yamaguchi, 23, said on Twitter that AKS had failed to help her after the assault, which had left her deeply traumatised. At the time of her tweet, the agency representing NGT48 \u2013 a sister group to the hugely popular girl band AKB48 \u2013 had not commented on the incident. The furore intensified when Yamaguchi bowed deeply and apologised to fans for \u201ccausing trouble\u201d \u2013 making fans worry by speaking out about her assault \u2013 during a concert earlier this month. Many questioned why she felt she should apologise while her industry handlers remained silent. Her fans responded with a petition calling for NGT48\u2019s manager to resign that was signed by more than 53,000 people. Yamaguchi\u2019s case has highlighted the poor treatment of young women and girls by Japan\u2019s pop industry, particularly the insistence that they appear morally unimpeachable. Performers are subject to strict rules imposed by their management agencies, including, in many cases, a ban on having boyfriends to maintain the impression among their largely male \u2013 and, on occasion, dangerously obsessive \u2013 fan base that they are romantically available. In 2013, Minami Minegishi, then a 20-year-old member of AKB48, shaved her head \u2013 a traditional act of contrition in Japan \u2013 and issued a tearful apology after breaking her group\u2019s strict dating ban to spend a night with her boyfriend. In a comprehensive account of the latest incident, Twitter user @katbeee said Yamaguchi\u2019s experience highlighted the widespread mistreatment of women in Japan\u2019s idol industry. \u201cTo the West, all this \u201cidol drama\u201d can easily come off as \u201cWACKY JAPAN!\u201d nonsense \u2014 but these incidents and lack of regulation in the idol industry are as serious as the abuses committed in the Western entertainment industry,\u201d she said, adding that the industry was rife with \u201cpower harassment, sexual exploitation, emotional and psychological abuse and overwork\u201d. AKS eventually apologised for its handling of the issue, claiming it had remained silent throughout Yamaguchi\u2019s ordeal to allow the police to investigate. A spokesman said the firm had replaced the manager of the theatre in Niigata, northern Japan, regularly used by NGT48, adding that it would step up security around members of the group. The firm also admitted that a fellow NGT48 member had given the men Yamaguchi\u2019s address and told them when she might return home. The two men suspected of grabbing Yamaguchi\u2019s face and pinning her to the ground as she was entering her home in Niigata reportedly told police they had simply wanted to talk to her and were released without charge. NGT48 has cancelled three upcoming concerts in which Yamaguchi was to perform, according to Japanese media.",

Instead he fled Bahrain after being released on bail to play professional football.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Araibi has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/10/marise-payne-lobbies-thailand-to-release-refugee-footballer-hakeem-al-araibi\">granted refugee status by Australia</a>, which determined he had a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of origin, and travelled to Thailand with his wife intending to honeymoon. He claims he received Australian government advice that he was safe to travel.</p> <p>He was arrested in Bangkok after Interpol erroneously approved Bahrain\u2019s request for a red notice warrant, against its own protocols to protect refugees from the countries they fled.</p> <p>The 2014 conviction, delivered in absentia and with a 10-year jail sentence, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/15/un-urged-to-seek-australia-based-hakeem-al-araibis-freedom-from-thai-jail\">based on the alleged coerced confession of his co-defendant and brother</a>, that they committed an act of vandalism against a police station.</p> <p>The act occurred at the same time, or very soon after, Al-Araibi was playing in a televised football match, and the trial judge \u2013 a member of the royal family \u2013 has been accused of ignoring key evidence.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy south-east Asia director, Phil Robertson, described the conviction as \u201cbogus\u201d.</p> <p>The government spokesman, who described the vandalism as \u201cterrorism-related\u201d, said all Bahraini individuals were entitled to legitimate legal representation and appeals, and convictions in Bahrain\u2019s criminal court related to the penal code and \u201cdo not in any way relate to political views or the right to expression\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn all cases brought by the public prosecutor, litigants are accorded their full legal rights and guaranteed an independent and transparent trial in line with international standards that insure fair and equal treatment for all,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Amnesty International Australia said it had repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde11/6790/2017/en/\">recorded and exposed</a> repressive tactics by the Bahraini government against civil society including travel bans, dissolution of opposition groups and media, and arbitrary detention of human rights defenders.</p> <p>\u201cAs recently as December, the conviction and sentencing of prominent human rights defender <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/12/bahrain-five-year-prison-sentence-over-tweets-upheld-for-nabeel-rajab/\">Nabeel Rajab </a>has demonstrated Bahrain\u2019s farcical justice system,\u201d Amnesty\u2019s national director, Claire Mallinson, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cTo assert that he \u2018has only been sentenced to imprisonment\u2019 does not reflect the real danger of torture that Hakeem will face if returned, and that he himself has previously attested to.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 Al-Araibi detailed his previous imprisonment and torture in a Bahrain prison.</p> <p>Bahrain\u2019s spokesman said the kingdom took allegations of mistreatment \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had established a special investigations unit and ombudsman which he claimed had received \u201cinternational recognition\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBahrain remains committed to upholding the rule of law and safeguarding individual rights protected by the kingdom\u2019s constitution.\u201d</p> <p>However according to the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, Al-Araibi\u2019s claims of abuse and torture were never investigated and no security personnel were held accountable.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bahraini government are trading on the legal procedures to distract the international public opinion,\u201d Yahya Alhadid, president of the GIDHR, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIf

      "bodyText": "Hakeem al-Araibi\u2019s life is not under threat and he could appeal his conviction if he returned to Bahrain, the Bahraini government has said in its first significant response to the international outrage at its efforts to reclaim the dissident refugee. Al-Araibi, who is a permanent resident of Australia, has been detained in Bangkok for almost two months while Thai authorities process an extradition request from Bahrain. The 25-year-old has said he fears Bahrain authorities will imprison and torture or possibly kill him if he is returned. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In response to an opinion piece published on Thursday, the Bahrain government told the Guardian there was \u201cno threat to his life\u201d. \u201cActivists claiming to speak on his behalf suggest his life is in danger if he returns to Bahrain, but he has only been sentenced to imprisonment,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cHad Al-Araibi remained in Bahrain, he would also have had the chance to appeal alongside his co-accused. Instead he fled Bahrain after being released on bail to play professional football.\u201d Al-Araibi has been granted refugee status by Australia, which determined he had a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of origin, and travelled to Thailand with his wife intending to honeymoon. He claims he received Australian government advice that he was safe to travel. He was arrested in Bangkok after Interpol erroneously approved Bahrain\u2019s request for a red notice warrant, against its own protocols to protect refugees from the countries they fled. The 2014 conviction, delivered in absentia and with a 10-year jail sentence, was based on the alleged coerced confession of his co-defendant and brother, that they committed an act of vandalism against a police station. The act occurred at the same time, or very soon after, Al-Araibi was playing in a televised football match, and the trial judge \u2013 a member of the royal family \u2013 has been accused of ignoring key evidence. Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy south-east Asia director, Phil Robertson, described the conviction as \u201cbogus\u201d. The government spokesman, who described the vandalism as \u201cterrorism-related\u201d, said all Bahraini individuals were entitled to legitimate legal representation and appeals, and convictions in Bahrain\u2019s criminal court related to the penal code and \u201cdo not in any way relate to political views or the right to expression\u201d. \u201cIn all cases brought by the public prosecutor, litigants are accorded their full legal rights and guaranteed an independent and transparent trial in line with international standards that insure fair and equal treatment for all,\u201d he said. Amnesty International Australia said it had repeatedly recorded and exposed repressive tactics by the Bahraini government against civil society including travel bans, dissolution of opposition groups and media, and arbitrary detention of human rights defenders. \u201cAs recently as December, the conviction and sentencing of prominent human rights defender Nabeel Rajab has demonstrated Bahrain\u2019s farcical justice system,\u201d Amnesty\u2019s national director, Claire Mallinson, told the Guardian. \u201cTo assert that he \u2018has only been sentenced to imprisonment\u2019 does not reflect the real danger of torture that Hakeem will face if returned, and that he himself has previously attested to.\u201d In 2016 Al-Araibi detailed his previous imprisonment and torture in a Bahrain prison. Bahrain\u2019s spokesman said the kingdom took allegations of mistreatment \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had established a special investigations unit and ombudsman which he claimed had received \u201cinternational recognition\u201d. \u201cBahrain remains committed to upholding the rule of law and safeguarding individual rights protected by the kingdom\u2019s constitution.\u201d However according to the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, Al-Araibi\u2019s claims of abuse and torture were never investigated and no security personnel were held accountable. \u201cThe Bahraini government are trading on the legal procedures to distract the international public opinion,\u201d Yahya Alhadid, president of the GIDHR, told the Guardian. \u201cIf Hakeem is extradited back to Bahrain, he will face continuous electric shocks, because he dared to criticise a member of the royal family. \u201cWe had previous experience with the political detainee the athlete Hamad Al-Fahed, whose sentence was [increased] from 15 years in prison to a life sentence after speaking out about the torture he was subjected to: electric shocks, and stripping him naked.\u201d GIDHR\u2019s Fatima Yazbek said security forces were considered infallible in Bahrain, the UN special rapporteur was still banned from entering the country, and the ombudsman was essentially a public relations exercise. The Australian government, international NGOs, and football player associations are among countless groups lobbying for the release of Al-Araibi back to Australia, particularly in light of Thailand\u2019s decision not to return 18-year-old Rahaf Al-Qunun back to Saudi Arabia last week. Key questions about the complicated case remain unanswered, including the actions of the Australian federal police and its officers seconded to the country\u2019s Interpol bureau, which alerted Thailand to Al-Araibi\u2019s travel plans because of the red notice against him.",

      "bodyText": "Victoria police have arrested a 20-year-old man in connection with the death of the student Aiia Maasarwe in the Melbourne suburb of Bundoora. The man was arrested in Greensborough on Friday morning in a joint operation by local police and homicide detectives, police said. Police believe Maasarwe was attacked just after midnight on Tuesday. She was found about 50m from the tram stop on the corner of Plenty Road and Main Drive, and was on a video call to her sister when she was attacked. The student boarded the No 86 tram home to her apartment near Latrobe University in Bundoora on Tuesday night after attending a gig at the Comics Lounge in North Melbourne. Her father, Saeed Maasarwe, arrived in Australia on Thursday to identify her body and visited the site where his daughter was found on Friday. She was discovered at the top of a slight rise below the double-story shopping centre car park, partially concealed behind some bushes. The area is now covered in flowers. He told reporters that he was thankful for the help and support he and his family had received from police, Latrobe university, and the broader community, and was moved to see the flowers. \u201cI am sad because this is the last place my daughter was, here,\u201d he said. \u201cI have many dreams to be with her but I cannot now ... someone decided I cannot be.

He said she was \u201call the time smiling,\u201d an opinionated, clever woman who loved to study and explore new cultures. \u201cHer mind was open for everything,\u201d he said. Before the arrest, hundreds had gathered at Latrobe University in a vigil for Maasarwe, 21, whose body was found behind a bush outside the car park to the Polaris shopping centre in Bundoora about 7am on Wednesday. Latrobe vice chancellor John Dewar told a gathering at the university\u2019s Bundoora campus on Friday that the university would do \u201ceverything in our power to ensure that this never happens again\u201d. \u201cWomen must be able to feel safe to walk in this city after dark,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do everything we can to make sure that that happens.\u201d Therapy dogs walked through the crowd. Most of those in attendance, like former Latrobe University international student Sofia Dahlgren, had not met Maasarwe but had often made the same journey after dark. \u201cWhen I was a student and I lived on campus, I walked to that supermarket many times late at night,\u201d Dahlgren said. Claire Lowe, 30, lives just above the area where the alleged attack took place, and said she walked past the site every morning and evening to get to work. \u201cOne of the reasons I like this area is that it\u2019s always so busy,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI have walked home from Polaris [shopping centre] at 12.30am and it\u2019s still busy, you feel safe.\u201d The Northern Centre Against Sexual Assault has set up a booth on campus and students have been given information about free counselling and security services, including after-dark escorts, available to all students and staff. More than 1,000 people were also expected to gather for a silent vigil on the steps of Victoria\u2019s Parliament House in Melbourne on Friday evening. Maasarwe, a Palestinian Arab of Israeli citizenship, had been in Melbourne for six months on a student exchange program and was working towards a business degree, with intentions to work with her father in China. Instead, her father arrived in Melbourne on Thursday morning to identify her body. Her uncle, Rame Maasarwe, told Guardian Australia the family was shocked by her death: \u201cWe thought it was very safe there in Australia.\u201d Police have described it as an \u201cabsolutely horrendous, horrific attack\u201d. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, have expressed their condolences over Maasarwe\u2019s death. Morrison said he was \u201csickened\u201d and \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the attack. \u201cI know the police will do their job and they\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he told reporters in Fiji. \u201cBut the rest of the country has to wake up today and deal with the most despicable of crimes \u2026 And on behalf of myself and Jenny and my family to her family, just pray you can find whatever comfort you can in the worst of all circumstances.\u201d Those attending the vigil on the steps of the parliament were asked to wear black and to bring flowers, particularly red roses, which would be taken along the No 86 tram to Bundoora at 8pm. Jane Pickering, the organiser of the silent vigil, said: \u201cI felt that fear and rage and despair and sadness, and I thought of all the other women and girls who went out to see their friends on the same night and caught the tram home on the same night and how all of us live with that fear and risk. It just feels like we can\u2019t stop having vigils; it happens too much.\u201d Vigils and marches were held after the rape and murders of Eurydice Dixon in Carlton\u2019s Princes Park last year; Masa Vukotic in 2015; and Jill Meagher in 2012. Pickering said Maasarwe\u2019s decision to call her sister when walking home after dark was a behaviour every woman would recognise; a safety tip as recognisable as holding keys through your fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s like something from a horror movie,\u201d she said. \u201cI think for most, the idea that that could somehow protect you is now gone.\u201d The Victoria police assistant commissioner Bob Hill told 3AW that patrols had been increased. \u201cBe concerned, but be conscious of the fact [Victoria] is a safe state, this is a safe country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an isolated incident.

      "body": "<p>One might forgive Ellyse Perry if she were content with what she has already achieved in her career, all before the age of 30. She is a World Cup winner, not once but five times. She has represented Australia not only in cricket but football too, and won countless domestic titles with the NSW Breakers and Sydney Sixers. Then there are the individual awards, such as the Belinda Clark medal at both state and national level, marking her out as one of the top female players in the world.</p> <p>However there has been a small blot on her otherwise impeccable copy book: in the shortest format of the game, Twenty20 cricket. The 28-year-old has been part of the Australian set up at T20 World Cups and is one of the few players to have played in every edition of the competition that began in 2009. Her role within the side has been to bowl her pace, be one of the best fielders and occasionally bash a few late runs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/17/wbbls-elite-level-product-pays-off-in-numbers\">WBBL's elite level product pays off in numbers | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Perry hasn\u2019t been able to stamp her authority with the bat on T20 cricket in the same way she has in other formats of the game. Until now, that is. Few cricketers have been able to master all formats,&nbsp;yet remarkably since her return from Australia\u2019s successful Women\u2019s World T20 in the West Indies last year, Perry has managed to take her T20 game to another level and delivered the most dominant individual season in Women\u2019s Big Bash League history.</p> <p>At November\u2019s tournament in the Caribbean, where Australia raised the trophy for an unprecedented fourth time, Perry hardly had the opportunity to impress with the bat but played an important role with the ball, picking up the second most number of wickets for her side with nine at an impressive economy rate of 5.56.</p> <p>Batting as low as No 7, some were left scratching their heads and wondering why she was so far down the order, given her 552 runs in last editions of the WBBL. The key factor was that Perry\u2019s strike rate was a below-par 98, whereas her top order teammates were all up above 120.

      "bodyText": "One might forgive Ellyse Perry if she were content with what she has already achieved in her career, all before the age of 30. She is a World Cup winner, not once but five times. She has represented Australia not only in cricket but football too, and won countless domestic titles with the NSW Breakers and Sydney Sixers. Then there are the individual awards, such as the Belinda Clark medal at both state and national level, marking her out as one of the top female players in the world. However there has been a small blot on her otherwise impeccable copy book: in the shortest format of the game, Twenty20 cricket. The 28-year-old has been part of the Australian set up at T20 World Cups and is one of the few players to have played in every edition of the competition that began in 2009. Her role within the side has been to bowl her pace, be one of the best fielders and occasionally bash a few late runs. But Perry hasn\u2019t been able to stamp her authority with the bat on T20 cricket in the same way she has in other formats of the game. Until now, that is. Few cricketers have been able to master all formats, yet remarkably since her return from Australia\u2019s successful Women\u2019s World T20 in the West Indies last year, Perry has managed to take her T20 game to another level and delivered the most dominant individual season in Women\u2019s Big Bash League history. At November\u2019s tournament in the Caribbean, where Australia raised the trophy for an unprecedented fourth time, Perry hardly had the opportunity to impress with the bat but played an important role with the ball, picking up the second most number of wickets for her side with nine at an impressive economy rate of 5.56. Batting as low as No 7, some were left scratching their heads and wondering why she was so far down the order, given her 552 runs in last editions of the WBBL. The key factor was that Perry\u2019s strike rate was a below-par 98, whereas her top order teammates were all up above 120. Australia\u2019s style is to go hard at the top of the order and, while Perry\u2019s ability with the bat cannot be questioned, her services weren\u2019t really required. Within a matter of days of arriving back from Antigua, she was leading the Sixers again in her accustomed position at the top of the order. She came out and went \u201cbang, bang\u201d in the first six matches, scoring two tons and three half centuries. The amount of runs was impressive but it was how quickly she compiled them that made people stand up and take notice: 419 runs at a jaw-dropping strike rate of 142. No doubt she had been working hard on her batting for a number of years, but all of a sudden a switch had been flicked; she was now pulverising bowlers a little earlier in her innings and racking up records in doing so. So far this season, she has broken the record for the amount of runs in a season \u2013 the previous best was Meg Lanning with 560 runs; Perry is already on 690 runs at a Bradman-esque average of 86 with potentially two more matches to play \u2013 and she has also become the first player (male or female) to score 2,000 Big Bash runs. Perry is the ultimate professional. Long before the ambassadorial roles she has taken on, the marketing contracts, the sponsorships and the remuneration for her services to cricket, she has always been meticulous about her preparation. Spending hours upon hours with her father Mark in the Cricket NSW nets, working on her batting technique, she would then go through her bowling paces. If she hadn\u2019t already completed a gym session, she would do so after a two or three-hour net session. Elite sport is a matter of small margins and the best athletes in the world are always striving to find that extra 1% to gain any advantage. Perry already falls into that category.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has dramatically escalated his feud with House speaker Nancy Pelosi amid the US government shutdown by canceling her previously undisclosed trip abroad and denying her the use of a military aircraft to visit American troops in Afghanistan. The president\u2019s move came a day after Pelosi suggested the president either postpone or submit in writing his 29 January State of the Union address, citing security concerns stemming from the partial shutdown of the federal government. Hours after Pelosi said Trump had been \u201csilent\u201d in response to her request, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders posted a letter from Trump to the House speaker postponing her travel. \u201cDue to the shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan has been postponed,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cIn light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.\u201d He added: \u201cIt would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement. If you would like to make your journey flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.\u201d Pelosi was due to depart on Thursday with a congressional delegation that included House intelligence chief Adam Schiff and Eliot Engel, the foreign affairs committee chairman. Schiff on Thursday sharply criticized the president for revealing the travel plans. \u201cI think the president\u2019s decision to disclose a trip the speaker\u2019s making to a war zone was completely and utterly irresponsible in every way,\u201d Schiff said. Overseas trips by a group of members of Congress \u2013 often referred to as a Codel \u2013 are not typically made public until the members arrive because of security reasons. It is commonplace for military transportation to be provided for congressional delegations and the House speaker, who is second in line for the presidency. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said the trip to Afghanistan required a stop in Brussels for the pilot to rest, while noting the delegation planned \u201cto meet with top Nato commanders, US military leaders and key allies\u201d. Hammill wrote on Twitter the weekend visit did not include a stop in Egypt, while the Afghanistan trip was intended \u201cto express appreciation &amp; thanks to our men &amp; women in uniform for their service &amp; dedication, &amp; to obtain critical national security &amp; intelligence briefings from those on the front lines\u201d. Some experts said Trump\u2019s move publicizing the trip to Afghanistan of such a senior delegation would pose a security risk in the future. \u201cThe president has now potentially endangered the speaker of the House and anyone who would travel with her by announcing that she plans to travel to a specific war zone in the near future,\u201d said Ryan Goodman, a former special counsel at the Pentagon and co-editor of the Just Security blog. A White House official said all other Codels were being canceled while the government remained closed. Pelosi\u2019s office countered that Trump traveled to Iraq during the shutdown, as did a Codel led by Republican representative Lee Zeldin. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision took Pelosi\u2019s congressional delegation by surprise, as some lawmakers were reportedly already sitting on a US air force bus outside the Capitol trying to determine if they should proceed with their travel plans. Even some of the president\u2019s allies expressed frustration at his retaliatory action. \u201cOne sophomoric response does not deserve another,\u201d said South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, a usually reliably vocal Trump ally in recent months. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political. President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel to visit our troops in Afghanistan, our allies in Egypt and Nato is also inappropriate.\u201d Trump also canceled his delegation\u2019s travel plans to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, citing concerns about the shutdown.

      "bodyText": "There has been \u201ca rising torrent of concern that the system is faltering\u201d and may not be fit for purpose, the first hearing of the aged care royal commission has been told. Commissioners Richard Tracey and Lynelle Briggs outlined how the inquiry would operate on Friday morning, in a hearing that lasted just over an hour. Briggs acknowledged there were many positive examples of high-quality care within the sector. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tracey said the royal commission into aged care quality and safety was a \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity\u201d for the nation to create a better system that aligned with community expectations. \u201cThe hallmark of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable people and our elderly are often amongst our most physically, emotionally and financially vulnerable,\u201d he said. The hearing acknowledged that a new regulation regime and new watchdog, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission started in January. He encouraged people to make public submissions and emphasised they could be made lodged anonymously. The deadline is mid-year. Tracey said the commission would be \u201cgravely concerned\u201d if aged care providers or government bodies were telling staff or would-be whistleblowers not to assist the inquiry or to withhold information. \u201cIt would be unlawful for an employer to take punitive action against an employee or former employee who has assisted us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a criminal offence to injure a person who has appeared as a witness or produced a document or given information or a statement \u2026 suing someone would almost certainly fall within this prohibition against injury.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, established the inquiry last year in response to damning incidents of neglect, abuse and negligence in nursing homes across the country. Counsel assisting Peter Gray said the commission had received more than 300 public submissions since Christmas Eve and 81% concerned provision of care in residential facilities, with staff ratios and substandard care the most common themes. The federal health department has also passed on 5,000 submissions it received before the commission\u2019s terms of reference were set. Aged care workers and family members with loved ones in nursing homes are backing a push to increase staff numbers in facilities. But the aged care minister, Ken Wyatt, ruled out changes before the royal commission wraps up next year, saying he wanted \u201cdiscussions to evolve\u201d. \u201cOne of the challenges that we have with establishing staffing ratios is we have providers in rural, regional and remote Australia who struggle to get the staff they need. In fact, they fly them in and fly them out, which is high cost,\u201d Wyatt told ABC TV on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disadvantage that group.\u201d Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, indicated the opposition was more inclined to act early on staff ratios. \u201cWe think there aren\u2019t enough staff,\u201d she told reporters in Hobart on Friday. \u201cWe want to make sure they are trained properly and have appropriate qualifications and that they\u2019re paid well.\u201d On the eve of the commission\u2019s first hearing, Wyatt announced a crackdown on the use of chemical and physical restraints in nursing homes. There are no rules in Australia governing the use of restraints in aged care facilities, unlike the US, Britain and Europe. \u201cThe use of antipsychotic medicines must be a clinical decision made by medical practitioners with the care recipient, and their carer or family involved at all times,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cIncidents of over use of physical and chemical restraint will not be tolerated and draft changes to regulations are expected to be released within weeks.\u201d The aged care industry body Aged and Community Services Australia said it did not fear the scrutiny of the royal commission. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for abuse and neglect where it occurs, and we are committed to continuous improvement to address problems as they arise,\u201d its chief executive Pat Sparrow said.

Anning\u2019s business, Gazelle Rentals Pty Ltd, has been in liquidation since April 2016, and in May 2018 owed $216,000 to creditors, according to documents filed to the corporate regulator. Anning is currently listed as the company\u2019s secretary, director and one of two shareholders, but has not disclosed his involvement with Gazelle Rentals to parliament in his register of interests. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The business is under external administration and the liquidation was meant to be complete by the end of last year. But the liquidator, BRI Ferrier principal Alan Scott, says it has been delayed because Anning has failed to hand over documents related to the business. \u201cMr Anning has been somewhat remiss in providing me with the material I\u2019ve been asking for,\u201d Scott told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking him for about six to eight months for documents and he keeps saying \u2018oh yes I\u2019ll get you them\u2019, but they never appear.\u201d Gazelle Rentals lists its current principal place of business as Anning\u2019s old residential property in Maroochydore, Queensland. Anning previously faced bankruptcy proceedings in the federal circuit court, launched by a subsidiary of the Adelaide and Bendigo Bank, over debts owed by Gazelle Rentals. Anning and his wife had acted as guarantors for a loan taken out by Gazelle Rentals in 2005, but court documents said the agreed loan payments were stopped in February 2008 and the company \u201cceased making any payments from 18 January 2012\u201d. The bank\u2019s subsidiary, ABL Nominees, claimed it was owed $239,393.49. But creditors withdrew the bankruptcy case in October 2017, and Anning avoided any finding against him. Despite the withdrawal of the legal proceedings, Asic and BRI Ferrier confirmed to Guardian Australia that Gazelle Rentals remains in external administration. Anning did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Guardian Australia is not suggesting he deliberately attempted to hide his involvement with Gazelle Rentals from parliament. The bankruptcy proceedings involving Gazelle Rentals and Anning received some publicity before his arrival in parliament, so his links to the company were on the public record. Anning, an independent senator who won 19 primary votes, initially entered parliament as a One Nation senator, replacing Malcolm Roberts. He later defected to Katter\u2019s Australia Party, but was expelled in October, two months after he made a speech calling for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to immigration. He now sits as an independent. The bankruptcy proceedings had raised questions about the strength of One Nation\u2019s vetting procedures, given the constitution prevents undischarged bankrupts or those who are insolvent from sitting in parliament. Anning attracted scrutiny this month when he announced he would bill taxpayers to travel to a rally involving far-right extremists in St Kilda. The senator has also billed taxpayers for trips to the regional Queensland town of Babinda for \u201celectorate duties\u201d while staying at his brother\u2019s hotel.",

Nearly all House Republicans routinely have voted against House Democratic spending bills over the last two weeks in an effort to stay in lockstep with President Trump\u2019s demand for border wall funding. And it\u2019s important to their messaging that they show unity against the Democratic bills.</p> <p>When the bill came up, the Democrat presiding over the House, North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, called for a voice vote and declared the resolution passed. This is a standard majority move. What\u2019s supposed<em> </em>to happen afterward, though, is for a member who wants a recorded vote to call for a recorded vote. The Republican at the lectern responsible for this task was Kentucky Rep. Brett Guthrie. Either he didn\u2019t call for the recorded vote, or Butterfield didn\u2019t hear him. (If Guthrie did say something, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?456931-2/house-session-part-2\">certainly not audible on the C-SPAN</a> replay.)

Experts and House and Senate leaders see the plan a bit differently, and worry that the policy will only incentivize Russia and China to bolster their arsenals. Congressman Tom Marino, a Republican for Pennsylvania and earlier supporter of Donald Trump, resigned today, leaving his post for a job in the private sector. Marino was once Trump\u2019s pick to head the National Office of Drug Control Policy and tackle the opioid epidemic but withdrew under controversy after reporters revealed he\u2019d taken $100,000 from pharmaceutical lobbyists and supported for a bill that hampered efforts to crack down on opioid-distributing drug companies. He also quit a previous job as a US attorney after a DOJ investigation found he may have helped secure a casino license for someone with mob connections. Goodnight everybody! With no solutions to the shutdown in sight, the Food and Drug Administration announced today that it would roll out new cost-saving measures to buy a few more weeks of life for the agency\u2019s drug reviews. The Washington Post reports that more workers will be furloughed and \u201cdiscretionary activities\u201d will cease until the shutdown ends. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is to keep the review process continuing because of important drugs in the pipeline\u201d, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told The Post, explaining that new treatments for cancer, depression, and diabetes are on the line. \u201cA core part of the FDA is advancing innovations that will benefit patient care,\u201d Gottlieb added. \u201cWe are trying to make prudent decisions to keep that process going.\u201d According to NBC news, far-right troll Chuck Johnson \u2014 who was spotted with Congressmen Andy Harris and Phil Roe yesterday, reportedly to \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cgenetics\u201d \u2014 posted on Facebook that he believes Muslims are \u201cgenetically different in their propensity for violence or rape\u201d and that African Americans possess a violence gene. The meeting happened not long after the House resoundingly voted to condemn white supremacy, but the congressmen responded saying they didn\u2019t know about Johnson\u2019s reputation for racism before the meeting. Per NBC: Spokespersons for Harris and Roe both confirmed to NBC News that they had met with Johnson Thursday, and a spokesperson for Roe said they had discussed \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cgenetics.\u201d Johnson and Harris would not identify the company when asked. Roe\u2019s office said it did not know the identity of the company. Johnson is best known for his conspiracy-filled right-wing news websites, connections to white supremacists, and downplaying the severity of the Holocaust in an online forum. He declined to comment on his new endeavor or the meeting, telling NBC News in a series of text messages, \u2018I don\u2019t discuss my work with people who don\u2019t understand it\u2019\u201d. According to CNN, President Trump wasn\u2019t pleased to learn that his AG pick was so close with special counsel Robert Mueller. AG nominee William Barr referred to Mueller as \u201cBob\u201d during the first day of his Senate confirmation hearing, and said that \u201cthe Barrs and Muellers were good friends and would be good friends when this was all over\u201d. He also described Mueller as a \u201cstraight-shooter\u201d. While Barr said during his hearing that Trump \u2018was interested\u2019 in hearing about the friendship, the details that emerged this week caught the President off guard, the three sources said. He bristled at Barr\u2019s description of the close relationship, complaining to aides he didn\u2019t realize how much their work overlapped or that they were so close\u201d. Reuters is reporting that four Volkswagen managers from the car company\u2019s luxury Audi unit have been indicted for their role in the 2015 scandal over the automaker\u2019s attempt to evade US exhaust emissions tests. The four are charged in a 12-count indictment with conspiring to evade U.S. emissions standards in diesel vehicles sold in the United States with 3.0-liter engines. The vehicles include the 2009-2015 Audi Q7 vehicles as well as other Q5, A6, A7, and A8 diesel models. They are accused of wire fraud, violating the Clean Air Act and conspiracy. Volkswagen spokesman Pietro Zollino said the company continues \u2018to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases\u2019\u201d. Amid criticism over Trump\u2019s move today to ground Pelosi\u2019s plane for a scheduled trip to visit Nato officials and troops in Afghanistan and Brussels, the President has also canceled his delegation\u2019s travel plans to the World Economic Forum in Davos citing concerns about the shutdown. The delegation included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell and was lead by Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The annual conference that convenes in Switzerland is an important meeting that brings together business and governmental leaders from across the world. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cGlobalization 4.0: Shaping a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d. It appears that a certain someone is enjoying life post-politics. Instead of being stressed over shutdown battles, these days Former House Speaker John Boehner is busy peddling pot to investors as America\u2019s next cash crop. Others are beginning to weigh in on Trump\u2019s decision to cancel Pelosi\u2019s trip. \u201cThe President\u2019s comment that lawmakers visiting Afghanistan is a \u2018public relations event\u2019 is an insult to the brave men and women serving in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Virginia Congresswoman Elaine Luria said in a statement. \u201cAs a 20-year Navy veteran, new member of the House Armed Services Committee, and new member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, it is my duty to support our troops and learn everything I can about their mission. Oversight is the responsibility of Congress, and it is inappropriate for the President to interfere with our constitutional duties.\u201d California Congressman Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Trump\u2019s decision to cancel Pelosi\u2019s trip \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d and \u201cobviously an action directed at the Speaker\u201d for her letter requesting to move the State of the Union. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow the President of the United States to tell the Congress it can\u2019t fulfill its oversight responsibilities, it can\u2019t ensure that our troops have what they need whether our government is open or closed,\u201d Schiff told reporters Thursday. \u201cThat work must go on and I think it\u2019s vitally important now, in particular that the President has announced withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, that we understand the situation on the ground.\u201d Schiff continued: \u201cWe had anticipated important defense and intelligence briefings in Afghanistan. We were looking forward to the opportunity to reassure NATO allies and those shaken by reports that the president has questioned his staff about leaving NATO. We\u2019re determined to make sure that our NATO allies understand that on a very bipartisan basis our commitment to NATO is strong.\u201d Democratic leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees expressed concerns over a newly announced Trump Administration plan to expand US missile stockpiles that would include space-based sensors. Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington expressed concerns that the move will \u201cfuel a nuclear arms race.\u201d \u201cStrategic stability is an essential component of U.S. national security, and it does not serve our long-term interest to take steps that incentivize Russia and China to increase the number and capability of their nuclear weapons,\u201d Smith said in a statement. Meanwhile, Senator Edward Markey likened the move to a \u201cbad Star Wars sequel\u201d. \u201cWhile it is true that the missile threat environment America now faces is different, the answer is not to build a wall in space,\u201d Markey told the AP. He added that Trump\u2019s \u201cmisguided rush to weaponize space would be as ineffective, costly, and dangerous as it was more than three decades ago when it was soundly rejected.\u201d This is Gabrielle Canon and Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Ben Jacobs. If you are just tuning in, here\u2019s what has happened so far today: The shutdown stalemate continues, now in its 27th day, with political finger-pointing and partisan bickering. President Trump has yet to officially respond to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request that he postpone his state of the union address until after the shutdown ends, but he did push back by refusing to provide military aircraft for Pelosi and other representatives for a previously scheduled trip to meet with Nato commanders and troops in Afghanistan and Brussels. She was set to leave today, along with chairs of the House Foreign Affairs and the House Intelligence Committees. Trump has begun fundraising off of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s proposal that he delay the State of the Union speech, and a new poll found 57% of voters would definitely vote against the president in 2020. Vice-President Mike Pence pushed back against criticism over his wife\u2019s new teaching job at a school that bans gay children and parents, reframing the comments as \u201ccriticism of Christian education\u201d. The wife of acting attorney general Matt Whitaker has sent a very long, very defensive email to a reporter at Slate and it\u2019s worth a read. Legislators in New Jersey have agreed to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. The House of Representatives is holding re-vote next week after Republicans were caught napping on a voice vote to revote the government. As Jim Newell of Slate reports, things got peculiar: The House was voting on another stopgap bill to reopen the government, this one until Feb. 28. Nearly all House Republicans routinely have voted against House Democratic spending bills over the last two weeks in an effort to stay in lockstep with President Trump\u2019s demand for border wall funding. And it\u2019s important to their messaging that they show unity against the Democratic bills. When the bill came up, the Democrat presiding over the House, North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, called for a voice vote and declared the resolution passed. This is a standard majority move. What\u2019s supposed to happen afterward, though, is for a member who wants a recorded vote to call for a recorded vote. The Republican at the lectern responsible for this task was Kentucky Rep. Brett Guthrie. Either he didn\u2019t call for the recorded vote, or Butterfield didn\u2019t hear him. (If Guthrie did say something, it\u2019s certainly not audible on the C-SPAN replay.) Butterfield waited about 30 seconds and then moved on to the next item of business. As Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s road trip continues, the former Texas congressman chronicles that he stopped in Liberal, Kansas for pancakes this morning. This was the most intense fog I\u2019d seen. A thick all encompassing blanket. I figured that by the time I\u2019d finished breakfast at the Pancake House in Liberal (top three pancakes I\u2019ve ever had) the sun would burn through, but it didn\u2019t. I left Liberal with a full stomach, and with gratitude for my hosts at Southwind. But since I came in at night and left in a fog, I had no idea what the town really looked like. Pelosi\u2019s spokesman responds to the cancellation. He says the trip was not scheduled to visit Egypt and notes that Trump visited Iraq during the shutdown. The powerhouse law firm Skadden Arps has just agreed to a $4.6 million settlement with the Department of Justice over its representation of Paul Manafort and retroactively register as a foreign agent. Trump is now fundraising off the State of the Union showdown. Lindsey Graham has condemned Trump\u2019s decision in a series of tweets. Among those scheduled to go with Pelosi it seems are the chairs of the House Foreign Affairs and the House Intelligence Committees. Apparently there are a bunch of members of Congress sitting on an Air Force bus right now trying to figure out what is going on. Pelosi had reportedly been scheduled to leave at 3PM EST on the trip, less than an hour before Trump canceled it. Apparently Trump is cancelling all trips abroad by members of Congress not just Pelosi. It had been unclear if the trip, which was previously not public, would have gone forward even before this letter. The House had been scheduled to be in recess next week but it is staying in session due to the shutdown. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has posted a letter saying that Trump will refuse to provide military aircraft for Pelosi to travel abroad to Brussels, Egypt and Afghanistan because of the shutdown. The military is not affected by the shutdown. He has said Pelosi can still travel commercial if the highest ranking woman in American history still wishes to visit Afghanistan. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer says that a Republican congressman shouted \u201cgo back to Puerto Rico\u201d today at Tony Cardenas, an Hispanic congressman from California. Mike Pence has described criticism of his wife for teaching art at a school that bans gay children and parents as \u201ccriticism of Christian education\u201d in an interview with a conservative Catholic television network. In the aftermath of the report that Michael Cohen tried to rig an online poll on Drudge Report on Trump\u2019s behalf, it doesn\u2019t appear that Matt Drudge is very happy with the president. Tulsi Gabbard has issued an apology video for past homophobic comments. The Hawaii Democrat announced that she would mount a presidential bid over the weekend. The House overwhelmingly approved a resolution to keep the Trump Administration from rolling back sanctions on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The vote was entirely symbolic as the effort failed in the Senate yesterday and it requires the approval of both chambers of Congress. Congressman Eric Swalwell of California, a potential presidential candidate, is heading to Atlanta this weekend for Martin Luther King Jr. Day events. Pennsylvania congressman Tom Marino, an early Trump endorser, is resigning from Congress for a private sector job. Trump won the district in 2016 by a margin of 66% to 30%. Talking Points Memo reports that Donald Trump\u2019s companies have reached a ten year high in the number of foreign workers that they have recruited for low wage, unskilled jobs at Trump companies. Trump has long campaigned on restricting immigration to the United States. The Trump Organization requested and received at least 192 visas for foreign workers in 2018, according to Department of Labor data. That number appears to be the highest for the company going back to at least 2008 and likely much earlier, based on public records. The nearly two decades\u2019 worth of data were pulled together by the Democratic research group American Bridge and shared with TPM, which then reviewed the raw Labor Department information files.Those visas were almost entirely for the type of low-skilled foreign workers that Trump has claimed drive down American wages. Cooks, servers, housekeepers and farmworkers make up a large chunk of the Trump Organization\u2019s requests, most of them making between $10 and $15 hourly. Trump claims that before he ran he was one of the most popular people in the world and now notes that polls say he is not popular in Europe. He adds \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Speaking at the Pentagon, Trump tries to blame Pelosi for the shutdown. \u201cWhile Dems would like to make a deal, Speaker Pelosi will not let them negotiate. The party has been hijacked by open border fringe within the party\u201d The Hill reports that Chuck Schumer is recruiting Congressman Ruben Gallego to run in the 2020 Arizona special election for the Senate seat vacated by John McCain\u2019s death. Gallego is a third term congressman who graduated from Harvard and served in combat in Iraq. The Democratic nominee for the seat would likely face Martha McSally, the former congresswoman who was appointed to fill the seat in January. A new poll of Democratic primary voters shows that the two candidates with the highest unfavorables are Bernie Sanders who is viewed unfavorably by 28% and Michael Bloomberg who is viewed unfavorably by 27% of primary voters. An infamous Holocaust denier and far right wing troll met with two members of Congress yesterday. Republicans Phil Roe of Tennessee and Andy Harris of Maryland met with Chuck Johnson yesterday about \u201cDNA sequencing.\u201d One colleague has come to Steve King\u2019s defense. Congressman Louie Gohmert of Texas complained that King \u201cwas not given due process\u201d in an interview with the Tyler Morning Telegraph. \u201cAnd, in fact, if our minority leader (Kevin) McCarthy had gotten the same lack of due process against him previously, I can assure you he would not have been majority leader and he would not now be minority leader.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris has come out in opposition to Bill Barr\u2019s nomination to be attorney general. The California Democrat, who is expected to run for president, was expected to oppose Barr. Nancy Pelosi says she has yet to receive a response to her letter about the State of the Union from Trump. CBS reports that the White House is mulling the option of having President Donald Trump deliver the State of the Union in the Senate chamber after Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked him to delay the address until after the shutdown. The Wall Street Journal reports that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen billed Donald Trump $50,000 for work for an IT firm that unsuccessfully rigged online polls on Trump\u2019s behalf as well as creating the Twitter account @womenforcohen. However, Cohen paid the company between $12,000 and $13,000 in cash. The Women for Cohen Twitter account still exists and describes itself as by \u201cWomen who love and support Michael Cohen. Strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense, business oriented, and ready to make a difference!\u201d Good morning. The partial government shutdown is on its 27th day with no sign of any progress, a new poll has 57% of voters saying they would definitely vote against President Donald Trump in 2020 and Trump will go to the Pentagon today for an announcement on the missile defense review. It\u2019s Thursday in American politics.",

Lawyers for the detainee, who does not know where he was born and has no country that will claim him, are seeking to have the 2004 Al-Kateb v Godwin case reopened. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lawyer Alison Battisson, of Human Rights For All, said they hoped this \u201cwill be the case that starts the process to end arbitrary, ongoing detention for indeterminate periods of time in Australia.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s arbitrary administrative detention, but we say it\u2019s starting to infringe on the separation of powers between punitive, which courts can do, and administrative, which the executive can do.\u201d In 2004 a four-three majority of the high court ruled on Al-Kateb v Godwin, effectively finding that a court was only required in the instance of detaining a person if that detention was punitive.

The result has been the alleged indefinite detention of asylum seekers and others termed \u201cunlawful non-citizens\u201d, such as a stateless man Said Imasi, who has been in immigration detention for almost nine years. Imasi told Guardian Australia he just wanted a country to accept him, and to \u201cwant me to be in their country\u201d, noting Canada\u2019s recent resettlement of Saudi teenager Rah Al-Qunun. \u201cBeing stateless is awful, it\u2019s the worst feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have documents it\u2019s like you don\u2019t have legs, you don\u2019t have rights in the world. You feel tortured every day.\u201d The submission on Imasi\u2019s case said that while the Australian government did not accept that Imasi was stateless, it did agree \u201cthere is currently no third country willing to accept him as a national or as a person with a right of entry\u201d. Imasi is held in Villawood, Sydney, and his lawyers have told the high court there was \u201cno real possibility, prospect or likelihood of the plaintiff being removed from Australia, at any time\u201d. Imasi\u2019s story echoes that of Ahmed Al-Kateb, who arrived in Australia by boat, stateless, and after his refugee claim was rejected he pleaded to be removed from immigration detention and the country of Austraia, but no nation would take him. Imasi has previously told his story to Guardian Australia. He believes \u2013 but does not know \u2013 that he was born in the Canary Islands and was taken to the Western Sahara, which is a disputed territory, as a newborn baby. In January 2010 he arrive in Melbourne by plane, having travelled on a Norwegian passport which he destroyed before presenting himself to immigration as a \u201ccitizen\u201d of Western Sahara, according to court documents filed by his lawyers. Imasi had a residency permit for Norway which expired in September that year, six months prior to which he asked the immigration department to remove him from Australia. After the Norwegian permit expired he reapplied but was rejected. He has not been the subject of any adverse security assessment and has no pending applications before the Australian government, having exhausted his appeal and review rights. The case argued Imasi\u2019s detention was punitive in its indefinite length. The Al-Kateb case, his lawyers submitted, \u201cauthorised the continued detention of an unlawful non-citizen even in circumstances where his removal from Australia was not reasonably practicable in the foreseeable future\u201d, and that case law since the finding had reaffirmed that detention must be seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation and limited to the time necessary to do it. The difference with Imasi, however, was there was no reasonable prospect he would be removed from Australia \u201cduring the course of his natural life\u201d, the submission said. Imasi\u2019s lawyers argued there were three possibilities: That the Al-Kateb ruling couldn\u2019t apply in such a distinct and more extreme case, where removal of the detainee is not likely to ever happen. That two legislative amendments \u2013 allowing community detention orders and ministerial discretion to grant any visa \u2013 mean the Al-Kateb ruling no longer governs the construction of the Migration Act. That the Al-Kateb case was wrong and should be reopened. The government is not yet required to file its submissions but at a hearing last year its lawyer said there were legal differences in the cases, including statements about statelessness. She also noted it was agreed the government was \u201cpresently taking steps to identify countries that they may send the plaintiff to\u201d. In a separate submission, the Australian Human Rights Council said Imasi was not claiming a right to be released. \u201cThe plaintiff has no right to resist removal from Australia (should it become practicable), but it does not follow that he is not entitled to be free from executive detention,\u201d it said. Imasi said being in detention was \u201cworse than a life sentence\u201d. \u201cYou have no name, you have no hope,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople with a life sentence in prison, like the Bali Nine, were helping in prison or doing something, but here you get nothing, not even study.

      "body": "<h2>1) How Spurs fare without Kane and Son</h2> <p>If Mauricio Pochettino could have picked one Premier League team to start playing against without his top scorer and his most in-form attacker, then he would surely have plumped for Fulham. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s defensively chaotic side are the perfect opponents in a far-from-ideal scenario for Tottenham, who must learn to cope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/15/tottenham-lose-harry-kane-until-march-due-to-ankle-ligament-injury\">without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min</a>. It will still be interesting to see how Mauricio Pochettino tries to overcome those losses. Perhaps he will ask Dele Alli or Lucas Moura to play as a shifty striker or maybe he\u2019ll deploy Fernando Llorente, a more conventional centre-forward who netted a hat-trick in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/04/tranmere-tottenham-fa-cup-match-report\">recent annihilation of Tranmere Rovers</a>? Or the manager might even push his faith in youth to an unprecedented extreme by giving a start to the highly promising 16-year-old Irish striker Troy Parrott, who has yet to appear for the senior team? Whatever the manager opts for, Spurs can be confident of victory given that Fulham have been so hapless this season that they even managed to concede two goals last week despite restricting Burnley to no shots on target. <strong>PD</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2) Puel getting an unfairly rough ride</h2> <p>The talk of Claude Puel being on the verge of the sack at Leicester is a nonsense, or at least it should be. The Frenchman was booed during last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/12/leicester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">defeat to Southampton</a> but fans and certain journalists seem to have the blinkers on to the wider picture, hungry for the next headline. Leicester sit eighth, one place and one point off their highest realistic target of seventh. In the last month they have beaten Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton. Yes, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/newport-county-leicester-city-fa-cup-match-report\">FA Cup defeat to Newport</a> was poor but more lasting positives \u2013 from Puel\u2019s immaculate conduct and poise in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/01/leicester-city-vichai-srivaddhanaprabha-claude-puel-helicopter\">their chairman\u2019s death</a> to his role in the development of James Maddison and Ben Chilwell \u2013 should endear him to both the board and his fans. Moreover, who would even replace Puel? Brendan Rodgers and Chris Coleman seem to be the favourites to replace him. Whatever the result against Wolves this weekend, Leicester should stick with Claude. <strong>MB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a88cb16bc68290a92d628fc91bef94e2acdbf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a88cb16bc68290a92d628fc91bef94e2acdbf3/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Vardy, dressed as Spider-Man, during training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Vardy, dressed as Spider-Man, during training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s continuing improvement</h2> <p>One of the more interesting developments of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/14/six-wins-out-of-six-suggest-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-is-more-than-a-mood-enhancer-manchester-united\">brief but eventful tenure at Manchester United</a> has been Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s drastic improvement.

Eddie Howe? Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo? Manuel Pellegrini? Rafael Ben\u00edtez? He\u2019s rarely in the discussion but, on this season\u2019s evidence, it has to be Javi Gracia. The understated Spaniard, who on Monday celebrates a year in charge of Watford, has guided his team to seventh as the \u201cbest of the rest\u201d and, bar a run of three defeats in late November/early December, two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/24/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">against Liverpool</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/04/watford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">and Manchester City</a>, the expected winter slump hasn\u2019t materialised.

An encounter against a resurgent Burnley, led by Watford old boy Sean Dyche, presents its own complications but Gracia\u2019s malleable and adaptive style has, so far, shown Watford capable of playing their way around teams or winning ugly. <strong>JP</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/17/huddersfield-sporting-director-leaves-olaf-rebbe-david-wagner-sagnol-siewert\">Huddersfield\u2019s sporting director follows David Wagner out of club</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>9) Hudson has to lift gloom at Huddersfield</h2> <p>The atmosphere at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium has been among the best in the Premier League, even during a campaign in which results and luck have gone against Huddersfield with dispiriting regularity.

Mark Hudson, temporarily promoted from his U-23 coaching job, has the mighty task of trying to pick up a team that has not won in 10 matches and getting them to stop a <br>Manchester City side in ominous title-chasing mode. Might there still be <br>wonders at Huddersfield after Wagner? <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>10) Redmond remaining key for Saints</h2> <p>Nathan Redmond was in the news for the wrong reasons on Thursday \u2013 it was his penalty miss that was decisive in Southampton\u2019s FA Cup shootout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/16/southampton-derby-fa-cup-third-round-replay-match-report\">defeat to Derby</a>. But the 24-year-old also scored a delicious goal \u2013 dinking in a cute finish \u2013 and anyone watching Saints since the arrival of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl will know the forward has been a revelation of late with five goals in the past seven games. But it is also his defensive discipline that is so valued by Hasenh\u00fcttl, who this week declared \u201cwhat he did [in the win over Leicester], defending his own box and clearing the ball \u2013 that is a new Nathan Redmond.\u201d The Austrian will be hoping Redmond gets over his penalty disappointment for the visit of Everton and puts in another big performance against Everton.

      "bodyText": "1) How Spurs fare without Kane and Son If Mauricio Pochettino could have picked one Premier League team to start playing against without his top scorer and his most in-form attacker, then he would surely have plumped for Fulham. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s defensively chaotic side are the perfect opponents in a far-from-ideal scenario for Tottenham, who must learn to cope without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. It will still be interesting to see how Mauricio Pochettino tries to overcome those losses. Perhaps he will ask Dele Alli or Lucas Moura to play as a shifty striker or maybe he\u2019ll deploy Fernando Llorente, a more conventional centre-forward who netted a hat-trick in the recent annihilation of Tranmere Rovers? Or the manager might even push his faith in youth to an unprecedented extreme by giving a start to the highly promising 16-year-old Irish striker Troy Parrott, who has yet to appear for the senior team? Whatever the manager opts for, Spurs can be confident of victory given that Fulham have been so hapless this season that they even managed to concede two goals last week despite restricting Burnley to no shots on target. PD 2) Puel getting an unfairly rough ride The talk of Claude Puel being on the verge of the sack at Leicester is a nonsense, or at least it should be. The Frenchman was booed during last week\u2019s defeat to Southampton but fans and certain journalists seem to have the blinkers on to the wider picture, hungry for the next headline. Leicester sit eighth, one place and one point off their highest realistic target of seventh. In the last month they have beaten Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton. Yes, the FA Cup defeat to Newport was poor but more lasting positives \u2013 from Puel\u2019s immaculate conduct and poise in the aftermath of their chairman\u2019s death to his role in the development of James Maddison and Ben Chilwell \u2013 should endear him to both the board and his fans. Moreover, who would even replace Puel? Brendan Rodgers and Chris Coleman seem to be the favourites to replace him. Whatever the result against Wolves this weekend, Leicester should stick with Claude. MB 3) Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s continuing improvement One of the more interesting developments of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s brief but eventful tenure at Manchester United has been Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s drastic improvement. The centre-back has completed 90 minutes in all five Premier League matches under Solskj\u00e6r and been excellent; positionally sound, dominant in the air and with the sort of ferocious but well-timed tackles that made Nemanja Vidic such a cult figure. The visit of Brighton shouldn\u2019t present as stern an examination as Kane and Son at Wembley last Sunday, the Seagulls have scored nine times on the road in the league this season, but holds a degree of symbolism for the Swede. The reverse fixture last August witnessed a performance the polar opposite of his current form as United lost 3-2, while a mistake against Spurs the following week, prompted Jamie Carragher to rule: \u201cI actually feel a bit sorry for him, he should not be playing at this level.\u201d Lindel\u00f6f is making that assessment look increasingly rash. JP 4) Zaha testing Liverpool\u2019s injury issues Wilfried Zaha has blown hot and cold in recent months but he is still one of the last opponents a side would wish to face when shorn of their best right-backs. The injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold, on top of the absence of Joe Gomez, means that for the visit to Anfield of Crystal Palace, J\u00fcrgen Klopp will probably have to resort to the plan that he was so eager to avoid at Brighton and use James Milner at right-back. As a bona fide utility superman, Milner can be expected to do as well in the role as he did in recent wins over Wolves and Bournemouth but that will not be good enough if Zaha is on song. On the plus side for Liverpool, having to play Milner (and Fabinho) in defence practically obliges Klopp to start Xherdan Shaqiri in midfield again. The Swiss was below par at Brighton but has previously demonstrated that he has the ingenuity required to link sharply with Liverpool\u2019s front trio. Get that connection right and Liverpool should open up a seven-point lead on Saturday before Manchester City take on Huddersfield a day later. PD 5) A crucial contest at St James\u2019 Park Newcastle\u2019s 4-2 victory over Championship side Blackburn in their FA Cup third round replay on Tuesday was comprehensively their biggest of the campaign (albeit inside 120 minutes) and only time the fifth time they\u2019ve beaten an opponent by two goals or more since the start of the 2017-18 season. On just three occasions have they found the target more than once this term while Saturday\u2019s opponents are equally as awful in the final third, Cardiff having scored one goal in their last five games in all competitions. Unsurprisingly, the two teams rank 17th and 18th in the Premier League for chances created per game (Newcastle 7.6, Cardiff 7.4) and average shots on target (Newcastle 3.2, Cardiff 3.0), which adds up to a bleak afternoon on Tyneside. That being said, if one individual \u2013 Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n or Ayoze P\u00e9rez for the hosts and Callum Paterson or V\u00edctor Camarasa for the Welsh side \u2013 can produce, it\u2019s likely to be decisive and absolutely vital in the context of the relegation battle. JP 6) Giroud\u2019s role at Chelsea It will be interesting to see if Maurizio Sarri deploys Olivier Giroud against the Frenchman\u2019s former club, Arsenal, this weekend. The World Cup winner will be itching for his first start of 2019; not only is there a point to prove to Gunners fans but with possibly the last chance to remind those in blue of his undeniable quality before Gonzalo Higua\u00edn\u2019s probable arrival at Stamford Bridge. Barcelona have been linked with a move for the 32-year-old this week and if Sarri opts for a more mobile central striker at Arsenal \u2013 Hazard played there last week against Newcastle \u2013 one could forgive Giroud for dreaming of Catalonia. MB 7) Clyne\u2019s Anderson assignment Nathaniel Clyne was last included in an England squad in May 2017 but his subsequent time in the wilderness at Liverpool, through injury and the emergence of Alexander-Arnold and Gomez, has left him firmly out of the international picture. That undoubtedly influenced the right-back decision to move to Bournemouth on loan where he has played 90 minutes in both of the Cherries\u2019 games since his switch south. He\u2019s set to make his first home Premier League start for his new club against West Ham in what will be a significant test, matched up against Felipe Anderson. The Brazilian presents a unique threat; whether he opts to dribble 1v1, drift inside and potentially drag his marker out of position with Aaron Cresswell overlapping, make a run behind the defence or attempt to play one of his clever inside passes. A strong performance at the Vitality Stadium can help Clyne show he deserves to still be part of the England conversation. JP 8) Gracia flying under the radar Who\u2019s the best manager outside of the top six? Eddie Howe? Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo? Manuel Pellegrini? Rafael Ben\u00edtez? He\u2019s rarely in the discussion but, on this season\u2019s evidence, it has to be Javi Gracia. The understated Spaniard, who on Monday celebrates a year in charge of Watford, has guided his team to seventh as the \u201cbest of the rest\u201d and, bar a run of three defeats in late November/early December, two against Liverpool and Manchester City, the expected winter slump hasn\u2019t materialised. This is following a minimal transfer spend in the summer (approximately \u00a326m) plus the sale of their most potent attacking player in Richarlison, highlighting the weight of Gracia\u2019s coaching ability and the methodical squad planning behind the scenes at Vicarage Road. An encounter against a resurgent Burnley, led by Watford old boy Sean Dyche, presents its own complications but Gracia\u2019s malleable and adaptive style has, so far, shown Watford capable of playing their way around teams or winning ugly. JP 9) Hudson has to lift gloom at Huddersfield The atmosphere at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium has been among the best in the Premier League, even during a campaign in which results and luck have gone against Huddersfield with dispiriting regularity. But the mood could be different on Sunday as there will inevitably be at least a hint of sadness at the absence from the sideline of David Wagner, who remains much loved despite the club\u2019s position at the foot of the Premier League and his departure from the role of manager this week. Mark Hudson, temporarily promoted from his U-23 coaching job, has the mighty task of trying to pick up a team that has not won in 10 matches and getting them to stop a Manchester City side in ominous title-chasing mode. Might there still be wonders at Huddersfield after Wagner? PD 10) Redmond remaining key for Saints Nathan Redmond was in the news for the wrong reasons on Thursday \u2013 it was his penalty miss that was decisive in Southampton\u2019s FA Cup shootout defeat to Derby. But the 24-year-old also scored a delicious goal \u2013 dinking in a cute finish \u2013 and anyone watching Saints since the arrival of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl will know the forward has been a revelation of late with five goals in the past seven games. But it is also his defensive discipline that is so valued by Hasenh\u00fcttl, who this week declared \u201cwhat he did [in the win over Leicester], defending his own box and clearing the ball \u2013 that is a new Nathan Redmond.\u201d The Austrian will be hoping Redmond gets over his penalty disappointment for the visit of Everton and puts in another big performance against Everton.

      "bodyText": "An old school photo slides from the printer into Frank Bright\u2019s hands. It is black and white because it dates from May 1942. But since it was taken, tiny red and blue stickers have been scattered over the image. Red for dead; blue for survived. Most are red. Bright, now 90, points to a younger version of himself, a tall lad in the back row. Some time after the photo was taken, he and his mother arrived at Auschwitz. She was immediately sent to the gas chambers; his father had already been killed at the camp. Bright spent years researching the fate of his classmates, cataloguing them on a spreadsheet. Number 24: \u201cShe had ginger hair as far as I remember \u2026 sent to Auschwitz in October 1944, did not survive.\u201d Number 9: \u201cA very pretty girl \u2013 I think I had a crush on her but from a distance. Sent to Auschwitz, did not survive.\u201d In the BBC documentary The Last Survivors \u2013 to be broadcast on Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January \u2013 Bright says: \u201cI can\u2019t really communicate with others properly because they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. I mean how many people in England have their parents murdered, or see a gas chamber in action? It has affected me, yes.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to forget about it, you\u2019ve got to wear blinkers.\u201d If one got too emotionally involved, \u201cI\u2019d be sitting here crying my eyes out\u201d. The Last Survivors features a handful of people, now in their 80s and 90s, who were children when they experienced the horrors of the Holocaust and the Nazi death camps. There is no central record of Holocaust survivors in the UK, and the exact number of those still alive is unknown. But these are among the last people who can provide first-hand testimony of what happened. Arthur Cary, the documentary\u2019s director, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a film that will be very difficult to make in five or 10 years from now simply because there won\u2019t be many survivors left, and those that are still here may not be in a position to engage in the same way. \u201cAnd even though the film is not overtly political, this is an important time to make a film like this.

Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, 93, who survived Auschwitz because she played the cello in the camp orchestra, says the Holocaust was \u201cnot family conversation \u2026 It doesn\u2019t fit into normal life and I wanted to have a normal life\u201d.
