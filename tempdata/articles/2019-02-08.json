Harris, an anaesthetist and diver from Adelaide, and Challen, a champion diver from Wangara, Western Australia, were part of the global team that freed the trapped Wild Boars football team in July 2018. They have been friends and cave diving partners for years. The men, who stayed in the underwater Tham Luang cave system for three days, swimming multiple kilometres in hazardous conditions, have written to the prime minister of Thailand, with the support of the foreign affairs department, to release Al-Araibi from jail. According to the ABC, a letter was sent a few days ago to the Thai prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, asking him to consider freeing Al-Arabi, who is waiting for an extradition hearing to be taken back to Bahrain, which is seeking his extradition for a 10-year jail sentence which al-Araibi claims is politically motivated. The Melbourne-based footballer was detained on 27 November by the Thai authorities when he arrived in Bangkok for his honeymoon. Australia has demanded his release and return. He was formally granted refugee status in 2017. On Saturday, foreign affairs minister Marise Payne wouldn\u2019t tell reporters the contents of the letter Harris and Challen had sent. Instead she said the government had \u201cengaged at the highest level\u201d with the Thai government to ensure that Al-Araibi was returned to his home in Melbourne \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \u201cI did that myself when I was in Bangkok last month,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously there are legal proceedings underway and we are monitoring those. \u201cWe\u2019re providing the necessary assistance to Mr Al-Araibi\u2019s defence lawyer to ensure that he does have the best chance of returning home and I remain in close touch with our post in Bangkok on that.\u201d On Tuesday, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, had said seeing Al-Araibi in shackles had prompted him to write to his Thai counterpart for the second time, after first writing last week to call for Al-Araibi to be sent back to Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve written to him again, because I was very disturbed at the appearance of Hakeem at the hearing the other day,\u201d Morrison had told Sky News. \u201cHe was shackled and I thought that was very upsetting and I know it would have upset many Australians. \u201cI\u2019m respectfully reminding the Thai prime minister that Australians feel very strongly about this, very very strongly.\u201d The images, which were broadcast internationally, have also upset Thai people.

      "bodyText": "The Australian-born journalist at the centre of the Jeff Bezos scandal is known for his relentless pursuit of stories. As a sports reporter at Channel Seven in Melbourne in 2004, Dylan Howard\u2019s colleagues believed he had a big future ahead of him. The RMIT drop-out was dogged and didn\u2019t let anything stand in his way. \u201cHe clearly wanted to succeed in the entertainment space,\u201d a former Seven colleague told Guardian Australia. Despite his reputation as an ambitious journalist, former colleagues were surprised to read that Howard was the Australian-born journalist behind the emailed threats to the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos. No one predicted Howard would rise to the top of the US entertainment media industry just a few years after quitting Seven in 2008 when his contract was not renewed. He headed straight for New York where he worked the red carpet as an entertainment reporter. After producing and editing for Reuters, RadarOnline and Celebuzz, he joined American Media Inc and by 2014 he had risen to chief content officer and vice-president. AMI is the largest publisher of celebrity and entertainment titles in the US, including the National Enquirer, Us Weekly, RadarOnline.com and OK! On LinkedIn the 37-year-old describes himself as a \u201cmetrics-driven digital, print and television media executive who has developed, re-invented and created entertainment and news brands\u201d. Howard wrote to Bezos: \u201c[I]n the interests of expediating [sic] this situation, and with The Washington Post poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of The National Enquirer\u2019s initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering\u201d. His email was published by the richest man in the world on Friday. The email, with redactions of personal information, went on to say that the National Enquirer had obtained a \u201cbelow the belt selfie \u2014 otherwise colloquially known as a \u2018d*ck pick\u2019\u201d as well as nine other images. Those included a selfie, a shirtless photo of him holding his phone \u201cwhile wearing his wedding ring\u201d, a \u201cfull-length body selfie\u201d of him in his underwear, and photos and messages from Lauren S\u00e1nchez, a former TV anchor. \u201cIt would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail \u2014 and quickly,\u201d Howard allegedly wrote. Howard has been approached for comment. Seven\u2019s news director when Howard was a sports reporter, Steve Carey, says the Howard he knew between 2004 and 2008 was a great reporter who broke dozens of stories for the network. \u201cHe was an extraordinarily talented and driven journalist,\u201d Carey said. \u201cWhen I had him in my news room he was always hard-edged; always determined to get the story. \u201cHe was an absolute gun as a sports reporter. A bloodhound in terms of finding stories and a crusader in trying to get to the truth of things.\u201d One of Howard\u2019s stories, which broadcast confidential details of an AFL player\u2019s drug use, put Seven at war with the AFL and led to the couple who sold the documents to Howard pleading guilty to theft. The network stood by Howard, who was cleared by a police investigation. \u201cA witness was present for all dealings between Dylan and the individuals in question,\u201d the network said. \u201cWe support Dylan Howard and can vouch for the fact that Dylan\u2019s conduct was entirely appropriate.\u2019\u2019 Carey says it was a myth that Howard was sacked by Seven as a result of the controversial story and that his contract was simply not renewed a year after the incident. He had not seen him since and he said he did not recognise the man he knew in 2008 in the news reports about Bezos. But other Seven sources said it was obvious Howard didn\u2019t play by the rules. He ran his own race, they said. He didn\u2019t respect confidences, he\u2019d take the most sensational angle and never \u201clooked after\u201d his contacts. \u201cHe\u2019d be nice to your face but you wouldn\u2019t trust him not to stab you in the back,\u201d a former staffer said. Another Australian journalist who met Howard later, in 2009 after he\u2019d moved to the States, also described him as a go-getter, but added that he could be charming and likeable. Howard was working the red carpet for stories and paying B-grade celebrities to be in video stories for RadarOnline, the Australian journalist said. \u201cHe was just ruthless.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sharks could soon become more numerous in Hawaii waters \u2013 and advocates say that\u2019s a good thing. Lawmakers in Honolulu advanced a proposed ban on killing sharks in state waters on Wednesday, after receiving hundreds of calls and letters of support from around the country. The law, which would provide sweeping protection for any shark, rather than select species, could be the first of its kind in the United States. \u201cThese amazing animals are getting wiped out before our eyes, and people don\u2019t even realize what they\u2019re missing out on,\u201d said Ocean Ramsey, a Hawaii-based shark conservationist, researcher and tour operator who has been instrumental in lobbying for the bill, in an interview with the Guardian. Last month, a photo of Ramsey swimming with a 6-metre (20ft) great white shark off the coast of Oahu went viral. Along with killing the animals, capturing or harming them would also incur fines and count as a misdemeanor offense. Sharks, Ramsey said, are deeply misunderstood. Their presence in the ocean is unlike any other animal\u2019s, she noted. \u201cEverything else in the ocean swims away from you, but you can have these incredible interactions with sharks because they\u2019re apex predators and they\u2019re not afraid of you.\u201d The threats to Hawaii\u2019s sharks are numerous, proponents of the bill argue. Shark meat isn\u2019t a popular food source, but Ramsey said she has seen sharks left to die on shore, and has encountered images of local fishermen using sharks as bait to catch giant kingfish. In addition, shark fins can sometimes sell for as much as $500 a pound (\u00a3850 per kg). Shark fin soup, a delicacy once favored by Chinese emperors, has become widely popular as a status symbol in modern China. As a result, nearly 100 million sharks are killed globally each year, and species are disappearing. A combination of state and federal laws prohibit the possession of shark fins, as well as \u201cfinning\u201d, the brutal fishing technique where sharks are caught, have their fin cut off and are thrown back in the water to die, but the practice continues. In November, a dozen men who had worked onboard a Japanese fishing vessel were arrested by federal agents as they tried to board a flight bound for Indonesia. Inside their bags was 190lb (86kg) of shark fins, worth $57,850 on the black market, according to Hawaii\u2019s US attorney\u2019s office. Some of the fins were from internationally protected species of sharks, such as the oceanic whitetip, which has declined by 80-95% across the Pacific Ocean since the 1990s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Sharks have also been the target of tour operators\u2019 nighttime \u201cbig game\u201d shark-fishing excursions off Waikiki beach on Oahu and other islands. Critics of the bill argue that sharks already have enough protections in Hawaii. Dr Kim Holland, a research professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa\u2019s Institute of Marine Biology, argued that Hawaii\u2019s shark population has been stable for years. \u201cI think if you wanted to be born a shark on the planet, this is where you\u2019d choose,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure this law is well-intentioned, but I\u2019m not sure what the motivation for it is.\u201d Sharks are crucial to Hawaii\u2019s marine ecosystem, and oceans worldwide. \u201cThey\u2019re the ocean\u2019s immune system,\u201d Ramsey said. Multiple studies have linked shark populations to overall ocean health. They serve a critical purpose by picking off sick and injured marine animals and keeping smaller fish populations under control. When the shark population declines, large predatory fish can overproduce and decimate the populations of small plant-eating fish, which are crucial to keeping algae down and supporting reef systems. In some places, shark loss has wreaked havoc on local economies, too. In North Carolina\u2019s offshore waters, the overfishing of sharks led to an increased number of rays that consumed the area\u2019s prized bay scallops and forced fisheries to close. Although sharks are often feared and vilified in films, attacks are relatively uncommon in Hawaii, state data shows. Hawaii has 1.4 million residents and more than 9 million annual visitors. In 2018, there were three shark attacks across the islands, two of which were relatively minor, but one in which the victim lost their right leg below the knee. Aside from protecting sharks, the proposed law also expands protections for rays which, like sharks, are slow-growing, long-living animals that begin reproducing at a relatively mature age, and have fewer offspring than other ocean creatures. Ramsey said she hopes the law will be passed in Hawaii and inspire similar laws in other states, and, ultimately, around the globe. \u201cThese animals have been around for 450m years, and during my lifetime so many of them will go extinct,\u201d she said. \u201cI want it to stop. It\u2019s not fair to them and it\u2019s not fair to future generations.\u201d",

We have to make sure we get our things right because if we produce something similar [to last week], the Scots are a great team and they\u2019ve shown us that here as recently as two years ago.\u201d</p> \n<p>That day in 2017 produced plenty of frustration in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/04/scotland-ireland-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">Irish ranks as they went down 27-22</a>, with Schmidt going out of his way to complain about the team bus being delayed en route to Murrayfield.

      "bodyText": "One defeat is damaging enough. Two in the space of eight days would surely end Ireland\u2019s hopes of retaining the Six Nations, and perhaps also of regaining the affections of some of those fans who felt so cruelly disillusioned by their loss to England in Dublin a week ago. Joe Schmidt\u2019s team will be under considerable pressure at Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon against a Scotland side who though by no means perfect in their 33-20 win over Italy, still scored five tries to enhance the impression that under Gregor Townsend they are continuing to mature at a fair rate. Ireland\u2019s captain, Rory Best, is confident the pressure will not induce panic, however, and he is equally sure they know how to rectify matters. \u201cWe fell down last week but it doesn\u2019t mean we throw everything out and attempt to start again,\u201d the Ulster hooker said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a lot of things over the last number of years and it\u2019s times like this where you have to stick to what you know. We have to make sure we get our things right because if we produce something similar [to last week], the Scots are a great team and they\u2019ve shown us that here as recently as two years ago.\u201d That day in 2017 produced plenty of frustration in Irish ranks as they went down 27-22, with Schmidt going out of his way to complain about the team bus being delayed en route to Murrayfield. Last week\u2019s loss to England has also bred frustration and Best is welcoming the chance to exorcise it. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration in the camp after last week and it was a bit around the way we were perceived to be bullied, but it was probably mostly around our accuracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe accuracy was the thing we felt let us down the most. The good thing is it\u2019s a seven-day turnaround to go again, and it wasn\u2019t one of the fallow weeks [where] you have to wait two weeks.\u201d For their part, Scotland\u2019s approach has been a low-key one and which began shortly after full-time last Saturday, when Townsend insisted his team would have to put in one of their \u201cbest-ever performances\u201d to beat Ireland. Hence the decision to go for maximum possible experience in the starting lineup, and to bring in Sean Maitland in place of Blair Kinghorn, scorer of a hat-trick hero last week but who has been relegated to the bench. Kinghorn\u2019s prowess as a strike runner may yet have a say in the outcome, but it is more than likely that no single player will have as big a part to play as Storm Erik, which is expected to bring winds of up to 55mph swirling around Murrayfield. At pitch level that could well narrow the game down, restricting some of the wide moves that Scotland will need to stretch the Irish. Ireland have been hit by a string of injuries \u2013 it was also announced on Friday that the lock Devin Toner will be out for two months because of ankle surgery \u2013 while Scotland welcome back Maitland and Jonny Gray as starters, with Fraser Brown and Pete Horne back on the bench. The notion that the home squad is close to full strength could hardly be more inaccurate, however. Both WP Nel and Sam Skinner would have been involved on Saturday but for injury, and there are also the longer-term casualties, including all three members of what is arguably the first-choice back row: Magnus Bradbury, John Barclay and Hamish Watson. Advantage Ireland when it comes to the breakdown, then. Advantage Ireland in midfield too, where the defensive vulnerability of Huw Jones is likely to be tested by Chris Farrell \u2013 one of five changes from last week \u2013 in a way the Italians could not manage. But Scotland were at least sharper at the breakdown against Italy than they have been, and if they can avoid getting bogged down there Greig Laidlaw is confident they can find a way to get on top \u2013 albeit by a more circuitous route than the one taken by England. \u201cEverybody knows the way Scotland want to play the game,\u201d the captain said. \u201cWe won\u2019t really deviate from that, but we\u2019ve got to be smart and pick the times when we play, so we\u2019ll get a gauge on the weather when we arrive tomorrow and set a gameplan for that. \u201cIreland will be hurting from England winning the physical battle, so that will be tough for us.

      "bodyText": "Unai Emery believes a top-three Premier League finish is beyond Arsenal and has said his club are outsiders in the fight for fourth place with Chelsea and Manchester United. Emery was charged with returning Arsenal to the Champions League when appointed last May and reacquainting them with the financial clout of Europe\u2019s elite competition. According to the most recent accounts, the club\u2019s revenues fell by \u00a329.9m last season because of their participation in the Europa League. But after a damaging sequence of away results, in which Emery\u2019s team have taken two points from an available 18, they are three points behind Chelsea in fourth and one short of United in fifth. The gap to third-placed Tottenham is 10 points. Arsenal will qualify for the Champions League if they win the Europa League; they face Bate Borisov in the last 32, with the first leg on Thursday in Belarus. \u201cIt is so far,\u201d Emery said, when asked whether the Premier League\u2019s top three were out of reach. \u201cWe are going to play at Tottenham in one month [on 2 March] but now we need to think about the next games and the next teams ahead of us, who are Chelsea and Manchester United. \u201cAre we outsiders for fourth place? Now, yes. Because we are sixth. It\u2019s practical but it is like that. I trust in our capacity to take [fourth] but it is like that. There are teams now that are better than us and who have an advantage to us. \u201cLiverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham also \u2013 there is a big difference between us and them. Chelsea and Manchester United, two very big teams, also have a difference [to the top three] but they are closer than us. We need to continue thinking to be in the top four but knowing it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s not to think we\u2019re playing under pressure \u2013 it\u2019s to be demanding and with the ambition to be in the top four [while] also knowing other teams have an advantage to us.\u201d Emery, who takes his team to Huddersfield on Saturday, discussed the emergence of the summer signing Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi and suggested that the midfielder\u2019s decision to miss the European Under-19 Championship with France last July was pivotal. \u201cThe first impression from him is very good and we saw this from the first weeks of pre-season when he arrived here,\u201d Emery said. \u201cHe made the very big decision not to play with the national team in the summer because he wanted to work with us and show his capacity in pre-season. His adaptation was very quick and his progress is very good.\u201d",

Perfect Planet, Frozen Planet II and Planet Earth III will be shown on the BBC over the coming years, building on the success of 2017\u2019s enormously popular Blue Planet II, which helped push the issue of plastic recycling to the top of the political agenda. The announcement comes after senior staff left the BBC\u2019s Natural History Unit, lured to the commercial sector by the prospect of working for rapidly-growing streaming services, which can offer bigger budgets. Attenborough, who is synonymous with the BBC\u2019s natural history output, has already agreed to provide the voiceover for a forthcoming Netflix series named Our Planet which is due to be released in April and has involved 600 crew members filming for four years around the world. Despite its name, the programme, produced by former Natural History Unit staff, is not part of the official BBC Planet series and the similarity is thought to have angered the corporation\u2019s bosses. In an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday, Attenborough said he would still work with the BBC but was enthused by Netflix\u2019s global reach, with its programmes made available around the world at the same time: \u201cIt\u2019s over 200 million people, it\u2019s urgent, it\u2019s instantaneous.

Chambers, who last ran in a GB vest in 2014, remains a controversial figure because he received a two-year ban for doping in 2004 \u2013 although he subsequently apologised, paid back a six-figure prize-money sum and now gives talks about the dangers of drugs. Mitchell-Blake, who ran the anchor leg when Britain\u2019s 4x100m team won gold at the 2017 world championships, insisted he had no concerns going up against Chambers in the 60m on Saturday despite his past. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable racing against anyone who is in the seven lanes beside me,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has a past and everyone has a future. I\u2019m not here to judge, I\u2019m here to race. \u201cI am a fan of the sport and Dwain himself. He is a world indoor [2010] and European champion [2006], and European record holder over 60m [2009] \u2026 6.42sec is not a bad time and not many have gone faster. I have spoken to him in the past and got tips on how to get better in the 60m.\u201d Chambers is seen by many to have a live shot at qualifying for next month\u2019s European championships in Glasgow and needs to finish in the top two and run 6.60sec or less against a field that includes Mitchell-Blake and Richard Kilty, the 2014 world indoor champion. However Mitchell-Blake, who has moved to Florida to work with the US sprint coach Lance Baumann, trainer of the 200m runner Noah Lyles, Tyson Gay and Britain\u2019s Matthew Hudson-Smith, says he is relishing the prospect of showing what he can do. \u201cI\u2019ve been training intensely since October so it\u2019s an opportunity to see where I\u2019m at.

One Six Nations win for France at Twickenham in almost two decades does not instantly suggest an away win this time, particularly if the hosts\u2019 superior fitness starts to tell. If someone were to offer France an injury-free 10-point loss in advance, they would probably take it.",

The former Labor prime minister has re-entered the domestic political debate in an election year, using a new wide ranging essay called The Complacent Country to outline thoughts on identity, population, values, the influence and \u201cunapologetic bias\u201d of the Murdoch media, the deficiencies of the \u201cfaux left\u201d, and to assess Australia\u2019s place in the world. Rudd says in the absence of continuing significant migration flows, \u201cwho on earth is going to fund our most fundamental future national needs, from health and aged care, to retirement incomes to national defence in an increasingly unstable region\u201d. \u201cWe run the risk of being a young country which becomes old before its time. These are the seeds of national decline.\u201d The former prime minister\u2019s intervention cuts sharply across the tone of the current political debate in Australia, with the Morrison government telegraphing a reduction in immigration, and policies encouraging migrants to settle outside Sydney and Melbourne. Labor has called on the government to develop a joint population policy, but Bill Shorten has not yet said whether he favours a cut in the immigration rate. While Rudd excoriates Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton in the essay, and the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also cops a serve, derided at one point as \u201clittle more than Tony Abbott with manners\u201d \u2013 the former prime minister says his ideas are not intended as an implicit rebuke of Shorten. Rudd says his new manifesto is not also intended as a \u201cprescription for what Labor should do if it forms the next government of Australia\u201d. \u201cThat is a matter for the parliamentary party to determine. Rather this is an attempt by a private citizen to encourage a genuine national debate on the big, existential questions facing our nation\u2019s future.\u201d On population, he contends Australia will not be able to sustain its future standard of living and meet emerging social policy and national security policy needs in the absence of a \u201cmuch larger population\u201d, and adds the imperative is \u201cto plan effectively for an optimum population size\u201d. He says infrastructure will need to keep pace with the rate of population growth, and also floats a \u201cnew type of nation building bond\u201d to help fund projects, such as high speed rail between the capital cities, \u201cotherwise we will be full of plans but with limited finance to give them effect, and our growth potential will be strangled as a result\u201d. Rudd addresses questions about sustainability by saying Australia must transform itself \u201cover time\u201d into a zero-carbon economy. While Labor has walked away from an economy-wide carbon price in favour of policies driving abatement in specific sectors, Rudd says \u201cwe need a globally competitive carbon price set through the market mechanism of an emissions trading scheme\u201d. He also says the existing renewable energy target should be maintained. Rudd also spends a portion of the essay restating recent, strongly worded criticisms he has made about the political influence of the Murdoch media, but the ABC also cops a serve for being \u201cso terrified of funding cuts from the conservatives that they will bend over backwards to attack Labor in order to be seen by the Liberals as \u2018balanced\u2019, comfortable in their cynical assumption that a Labor incumbency would never cut their funding, but only enhance it\u201d.

Ethical lobbying is a valuable and important element of a healthy democracy. It helps those who have a stake in government policy to convey their views and expertise. There are two broad types of lobbyists: third-party lobbyists, who are engaged as consultants; in-house lobbyists, who work directly for corporations or interest groups.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who hires lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>For many Australians, lobbying conjures images of powerful corporations working to sway politicians behind the scenes. There is a truth in that. The big banks, mining and energy giants, pharmaceutical companies, casinos, Amazon, Google and Facebook all engage lobbyists. But lobbyists also work on behalf of not-for-profits and community groups, including for veterans, social workers, aged-care staff, school principals and environmental organisations.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist register? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The lobbyist register is the public's only window into the world of lobbying. It's a publicly available online list of lobbying firms, individual lobbyists and their clients. The register was a huge step forward when it was introduced in 2008, but remains frustratingly opaque. It doesn't tell us who is lobbying whom, about what, or when. Compare that with the ACT, where lobbyists are required to file quarterly reports on their activities, or NSW, where ministers are required to publish their diaries. The federal register is also completely blind to the activities of in-house lobbyists.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the lobbyist code of conduct?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The code tells lobbyists how they must behave when approaching the government and is designed to maintain ethical standards. But the code is not legislated and has no real teeth. It goes largely unenforced and the punishments are weak. The worst sanction available to authorities is removing a lobbyist from the register. The US and Canada have fines or jail terms for law breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who keeps an eye on lobbyists? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Federally it's the prime minister's&nbsp; department that loosely oversees lobbying. It takes on a largely administrative role, rather than an investigative or regulatory one. Its core job is to maintain the register and communicate the code's requirements to lobbyists. It lacks independence, relies on reports of bad lobbying and rarely, if ever, takes enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The documents reveal similar complaints were made in 2016 and 2017.</p> \n<p>One complaint, made to the secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet in April 2016, reported a \u201cserious breach of the lobbying code of conduct by [redacted]\u201d.

Party executives wield significant influence, helping to determine policy, raise funds and organise campaigns and preselections. In 2016, the practice was dubbed a potential corruption risk by former prime minister Tony Abbott, who has attempted to stamp it out since 2013. The documents, obtained through freedom of information laws, show the practice has prompted a string of complaints in recent years. One complaint was made directly to Turnbull, the then prime minister, on 8 April 2016, only months before the federal election. The Liberal party was conducting preselections in New South Wales at the time. An unidentified complainant wrote to Turnbull: \u201cDear Malcolm,\u201d the complainant said. \u201cBefore any more preselections take place next week in faction-ruled NSW, there is an urgent need for you to reaffirm the Abbott/O\u2019Farrell ban on lobbyists in executive roles.\u201d Large slabs of detail are redacted from the note, before it finishes: \u201cWho can I talk to in your office about this?\u201d The documents reveal similar complaints were made in 2016 and 2017.

The novice full-back who had confronted and contained Christian Eriksen, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Eden Hazard on his first three senior outings and has established himself as the most prolific and cleanest tackler across Europe\u2019s elite five leagues, was backstage at his old school, Good Shepherd, when his name was announced inside the assembly hall.</p> <p>The boy from New Addington turned Crystal Palace full-back had anticipated an audience with a couple of classes at most, so the ear-splitting din summoned by the excitable throng, 250-strong, rocked him on his heels.

His parents still live round the corner from the school, across from the sloped field where he first ventured out with his older brother, Kevin, for a kickabout. \u201cThere\u2019d be balls flying everywhere, a free for all. The council would cut the grass every now and then and we\u2019d play proper 15-a-side matches, and I\u2019d be first pick, even though I was probably the youngest. It was the skills. The free-styling. I loved watching Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho expressing themselves, so that\u2019s what I copied.\u201d</p> <p>These days the kids tend to spot his car on his visits home, before camping outside the Wan-Bissakas\u2019 house, taking turns to ring the doorbell and pester for an autograph. Up at the community centre in nearby Fieldway, where the <a href=\"https://www.palaceforlife.org/\" title=\"\">Palace for Life Foundation</a> teams up with Croydon council and the Metropolitan Police to run coaching courses aimed at tackling youth violence, he is the poster boy. Those in attendance at Good Shepherd included a local publican seeking a signature on a pair of boots, and Father Boyle, brandishing the player\u2019s baptism certificate, from the neighbouring church. Wan-Bissaka is the local lad, from one of the borough\u2019s poorest wards, made spectacularly good.</p> <p>Most remarkable is the ease with which he has taken to the Premier League. At 14 there had been a debate at Palace as to whether Wan-Bissaka, a quiet, gangly kid, should be retained. By early 2017 the boyhood Arsenal supporter was still essentially striving to make his mark at a club brimming with wingers. Twelve months ago, as an unused fourth-choice right-back, he had pushed for a move to League Two. On Saturday he confronts West Ham as the best one-on-one defender in the division this season having mustered more successful tackles (66 of 91) than anyone in the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue Un or Primera Liga.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is the only player in England to boast 40 or more tackles, completed take-ons (40) and interceptions (57), and only seven opponents have successfully wriggled beyond him. The raw numbers are mind-boggling. More striking still is the deflation he instils in opponents as those telescopicl legs \u2013 his nickname is \u2018Spider\u2019 \u2013 wrest back possession. And all this from a player \u2013 his nickname is \u201cSpider\u201d \u2013 who has never received any formal coaching on how to tackle. \u201cNo, none. Never. I have no idea where I get it from, and I\u2019m just as confused when I see all the stats. I\u2019d never tackle on Walton Green. I was too busy doing the tricks, and I just didn\u2019t like defending. I\u2019d intercept the ball because I was quick, but I only probably started tackling in the under-23s.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d always been a forward, from playing above my age group at [the local grassroots club] Junior Elite, where my brother played \u2013 he was better than me \u2013 to joining Palace at 11. I went through all the teenage stuff, where you don\u2019t see the pathway and do things without thinking, but Palace and my dad, Ambrose, snapped me out of it. He\u2019s always been a guiding light: \u2018Keep going, work hard, things will turn.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"502cac1d6dbba3210eb37f6efda9d1a10b51bad2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/502cac1d6dbba3210eb37f6efda9d1a10b51bad2/0_214_4224_2534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Wan-Bissaka dispossesses Liverpool\u2019s Naby Ke\u00efta at Anfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Wan-Bissaka dispossesses Liverpool\u2019s Naby Ke\u00efta at Anfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The then first-team coach, Kevin Keen, had hauled him from the academy to make up the numbers and was impressed with the way he succeeded in nullifying Wilfried Zaha. Yet it was the under-23 coaches, Richard Shaw and Dave Reddington, who took the plunge by employing the tearaway winger at right-back in a 2-2 draw at Charlton. The rookie was exposed at times.</p> <p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t enjoy it,\u201d said Wan-Bissaka. \u201cI couldn\u2019t express myself going forward, the defending was all new, and I came away thinking: \u2018This isn\u2019t me.\u2019 I never said anything, but Redders and Shawsy knew. They started working with me, doing second sessions, practising defensive drills. That\u2019s when it started.</p> <p>\u201cTraining up against Wilf and Yannick Bolasie toughened me up. When I was younger my playing style was like Wilf\u2019s, so that sort of gave me a heads-up, but he\u2019s still a tricky one. As an ex-winger, you get a sense of what they\u2019re trying to do: which way they might go, how they\u2019re thinking. You can anticipate things easier. When Roy Hodgson changed my timetable to full-time with the first team, I knew I was making progress even if I still never played.</p> <p>\u201cLast January there was interest from League Two in a loan but towards the end of the window nothing had happened and I was panicking. I asked Brighty [Mark Bright, the club\u2019s director of under-23s\u2019 development] to put the question in, and he came back saying the manager wanted to see me. I went in on my day off, just before the first team were training.</p> <p>\u201cI was in the changing-room for 30 minutes, waiting, only for [Hodgson] eventually to come in and say he didn\u2019t feel I\u2019d benefit from the type of football I\u2019d play at that level, and that I should stay and learn. I was a bit upset because I\u2019d really wanted to go. I just didn\u2019t see myself playing any time soon. But he actually made me put my kit on and train then and there.\u201d</p> <p>It would take an injury crisis four weeks later to offer an opportunity to become the first academy graduate to make his debut for the senior side for 2,148 days. \u201cOn the day before the game with Tottenham Hotspur I\u2019d counted up there were 19 of us training, including two other under\u201123s, so I was sure I\u2019d make the bench. We all piled into the analysis meeting where they put the lineup up on the whiteboard. I\u2019d always scan the bench first, at the bottom, because I\u2019m realistic. But I wasn\u2019t on it. I was gutted.

      "bodyText": "Evidence Aaron Wan-Bissaka does actually do flustered surfaced at a little after 2pm on Tuesday. The novice full-back who had confronted and contained Christian Eriksen, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Eden Hazard on his first three senior outings and has established himself as the most prolific and cleanest tackler across Europe\u2019s elite five leagues, was backstage at his old school, Good Shepherd, when his name was announced inside the assembly hall. The boy from New Addington turned Crystal Palace full-back had anticipated an audience with a couple of classes at most, so the ear-splitting din summoned by the excitable throng, 250-strong, rocked him on his heels. There was a flicker of apprehension, a sheepish smile as he edged into the hall, and disbelief at the delighted bedlam. \u201cIt\u2019s mad to see,\u201d he offered once the Q&amp;A and quiz had been successfully negotiated. \u201cA lot of the time I can\u2019t really get my head around it, but it shows I\u2019ve come a long way. I have to be grateful.\u201d Wan-Bissaka is slowly coming to terms with the adulation, even if trips back to this corner of Croydon tend to labour the point. His parents still live round the corner from the school, across from the sloped field where he first ventured out with his older brother, Kevin, for a kickabout. \u201cThere\u2019d be balls flying everywhere, a free for all. The council would cut the grass every now and then and we\u2019d play proper 15-a-side matches, and I\u2019d be first pick, even though I was probably the youngest. It was the skills. The free-styling. I loved watching Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho expressing themselves, so that\u2019s what I copied.\u201d These days the kids tend to spot his car on his visits home, before camping outside the Wan-Bissakas\u2019 house, taking turns to ring the doorbell and pester for an autograph. Up at the community centre in nearby Fieldway, where the Palace for Life Foundation teams up with Croydon council and the Metropolitan Police to run coaching courses aimed at tackling youth violence, he is the poster boy. Those in attendance at Good Shepherd included a local publican seeking a signature on a pair of boots, and Father Boyle, brandishing the player\u2019s baptism certificate, from the neighbouring church. Wan-Bissaka is the local lad, from one of the borough\u2019s poorest wards, made spectacularly good. Most remarkable is the ease with which he has taken to the Premier League. At 14 there had been a debate at Palace as to whether Wan-Bissaka, a quiet, gangly kid, should be retained. By early 2017 the boyhood Arsenal supporter was still essentially striving to make his mark at a club brimming with wingers. Twelve months ago, as an unused fourth-choice right-back, he had pushed for a move to League Two. On Saturday he confronts West Ham as the best one-on-one defender in the division this season having mustered more successful tackles (66 of 91) than anyone in the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue Un or Primera Liga. He is the only player in England to boast 40 or more tackles, completed take-ons (40) and interceptions (57), and only seven opponents have successfully wriggled beyond him. The raw numbers are mind-boggling. More striking still is the deflation he instils in opponents as those telescopicl legs \u2013 his nickname is \u2018Spider\u2019 \u2013 wrest back possession. And all this from a player \u2013 his nickname is \u201cSpider\u201d \u2013 who has never received any formal coaching on how to tackle. \u201cNo, none. Never. I have no idea where I get it from, and I\u2019m just as confused when I see all the stats. I\u2019d never tackle on Walton Green. I was too busy doing the tricks, and I just didn\u2019t like defending. I\u2019d intercept the ball because I was quick, but I only probably started tackling in the under-23s. \u201cI\u2019d always been a forward, from playing above my age group at [the local grassroots club] Junior Elite, where my brother played \u2013 he was better than me \u2013 to joining Palace at 11. I went through all the teenage stuff, where you don\u2019t see the pathway and do things without thinking, but Palace and my dad, Ambrose, snapped me out of it. He\u2019s always been a guiding light: \u2018Keep going, work hard, things will turn.\u2019\u201d The then first-team coach, Kevin Keen, had hauled him from the academy to make up the numbers and was impressed with the way he succeeded in nullifying Wilfried Zaha. Yet it was the under-23 coaches, Richard Shaw and Dave Reddington, who took the plunge by employing the tearaway winger at right-back in a 2-2 draw at Charlton. The rookie was exposed at times. \u201cI really didn\u2019t enjoy it,\u201d said Wan-Bissaka. \u201cI couldn\u2019t express myself going forward, the defending was all new, and I came away thinking: \u2018This isn\u2019t me.\u2019 I never said anything, but Redders and Shawsy knew. They started working with me, doing second sessions, practising defensive drills. That\u2019s when it started. \u201cTraining up against Wilf and Yannick Bolasie toughened me up. When I was younger my playing style was like Wilf\u2019s, so that sort of gave me a heads-up, but he\u2019s still a tricky one. As an ex-winger, you get a sense of what they\u2019re trying to do: which way they might go, how they\u2019re thinking. You can anticipate things easier. When Roy Hodgson changed my timetable to full-time with the first team, I knew I was making progress even if I still never played. \u201cLast January there was interest from League Two in a loan but towards the end of the window nothing had happened and I was panicking. I asked Brighty [Mark Bright, the club\u2019s director of under-23s\u2019 development] to put the question in, and he came back saying the manager wanted to see me. I went in on my day off, just before the first team were training. \u201cI was in the changing-room for 30 minutes, waiting, only for [Hodgson] eventually to come in and say he didn\u2019t feel I\u2019d benefit from the type of football I\u2019d play at that level, and that I should stay and learn. I was a bit upset because I\u2019d really wanted to go. I just didn\u2019t see myself playing any time soon. But he actually made me put my kit on and train then and there.\u201d It would take an injury crisis four weeks later to offer an opportunity to become the first academy graduate to make his debut for the senior side for 2,148 days. \u201cOn the day before the game with Tottenham Hotspur I\u2019d counted up there were 19 of us training, including two other under\u201123s, so I was sure I\u2019d make the bench. We all piled into the analysis meeting where they put the lineup up on the whiteboard. I\u2019d always scan the bench first, at the bottom, because I\u2019m realistic. But I wasn\u2019t on it. I was gutted. I don\u2019t know who tapped me on the shoulder first, but that made me look at the top of the list and there I was, second down, at right-back. \u201cSpurs, Christian Eriksen ... the first thing that went through my mind was it was going to be a long afternoon. But the manager clearly had faith in me. My aim has always been to make him proud because he gave me a chance.

If so, the number of confirmed cases of the disease will rise to seven, as Raise A Spark is one of three fresh cases of equine flu identified at McCain\u2019s Bankhouse Stables following tests on the trainer\u2019s entire string on Thursday. The nine-year-old, who finished 22 lengths behind the third-placed horse when last in a four-runner contest at Ayr on Wednesday, is the only one of six positives in the McCain yard to have raced in recent days.</p> \n<p>Menzies said in a statementon Friday evening that \u201cwe have today, together with the BHA, taken the precaution to submit test swabs for analysis to the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket as a precaution following the sickness of three horses stabled in an isolation yard on our premises.\u201d</p> \n<p>The statement added: \u201cAt this stage we have not received the results, our horses in training all appear healthy and thriving, and of course I fully support the actions of the BHA and I look forward to a swift conclusion for our industry so we can get back to providing enjoyment for so many.\u201d</p> \n<p>The BHA\u2019s latest update on the equine influenza outbreak on Friday afternoon said that the test result from Raise A Spark \u201crelates to a sample taken the following day [7 Feb], and the horse showed no clinical symptoms on raceday.\u201d</p> \n<p>It continued: \u201cIt was in anticipation of this risk that the decision was taken by the BHA to restrict movement of horses on a precautionary basis at the yards of 120 other trainers who competed at these fixtures, and to suspend racing until Wednesday at the earliest.\u201d</p> \n<p>All horses which are in yards currently on lockdown will be tested for equine influenza. The scale of the task facing the authorities is increasing rapidly, however, with the strings of nearly a third of the country\u2019s 600 licensed trainers now undergoing tests.</p> \n<p>The BHA admitted on Friday that testing will not be complete by the end of the weekend, when the Authority will discuss the latest situation with its veterinary advisors before deciding whether to extend the current shutdown of British racing beyond next Wednesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will not be possible to test every horse from every yard before the end of the weekend,\u201d its statement said, \u201cbut we will work with trainers to identify any priority or risk horses and ensure that they are tested.

      "bodyText": "Concern that an outbreak of equine influenza could extend the shutdown of British racing beyond next Wednesday deepened on Friday, when the British Horseracing Authority confirmed that what is suspected to be a fresh case of the disease has been identified in Rebecca Menzies\u2019 stable in County Durham. Menzies\u2019 recent runners had no obvious point of contact with Donald McCain\u2019s yard in Cheshire. The news followed the disclosure that McCain\u2019s gelding Raise A Spark, who finished last in a race at Ayr on Wednesday, had tested positive for equine flu. Menzies\u2019 yard sent runners to the all-weather Flat meetings at Newcastle on Tuesday and Wolverhampton the following evening. As a result a further 52 training yards which also had runners at these meetings have been added to those already on lockdown after the initial outbreak at the McCain stable, bringing the total number of yards on lockdown to 174. The BHA expects to confirm on Saturday morning the initial fears that Menzies\u2019 horse, which had been vaccinated against equine flu, has tested positive. If so, the number of confirmed cases of the disease will rise to seven, as Raise A Spark is one of three fresh cases of equine flu identified at McCain\u2019s Bankhouse Stables following tests on the trainer\u2019s entire string on Thursday. The nine-year-old, who finished 22 lengths behind the third-placed horse when last in a four-runner contest at Ayr on Wednesday, is the only one of six positives in the McCain yard to have raced in recent days. Menzies said in a statementon Friday evening that \u201cwe have today, together with the BHA, taken the precaution to submit test swabs for analysis to the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket as a precaution following the sickness of three horses stabled in an isolation yard on our premises.\u201d The statement added: \u201cAt this stage we have not received the results, our horses in training all appear healthy and thriving, and of course I fully support the actions of the BHA and I look forward to a swift conclusion for our industry so we can get back to providing enjoyment for so many.\u201d The BHA\u2019s latest update on the equine influenza outbreak on Friday afternoon said that the test result from Raise A Spark \u201crelates to a sample taken the following day [7 Feb], and the horse showed no clinical symptoms on raceday.\u201d It continued: \u201cIt was in anticipation of this risk that the decision was taken by the BHA to restrict movement of horses on a precautionary basis at the yards of 120 other trainers who competed at these fixtures, and to suspend racing until Wednesday at the earliest.\u201d All horses which are in yards currently on lockdown will be tested for equine influenza. The scale of the task facing the authorities is increasing rapidly, however, with the strings of nearly a third of the country\u2019s 600 licensed trainers now undergoing tests. The BHA admitted on Friday that testing will not be complete by the end of the weekend, when the Authority will discuss the latest situation with its veterinary advisors before deciding whether to extend the current shutdown of British racing beyond next Wednesday. \u201cIt will not be possible to test every horse from every yard before the end of the weekend,\u201d its statement said, \u201cbut we will work with trainers to identify any priority or risk horses and ensure that they are tested. This will all form part of the picture that is built in order to assist the decisions that will be made on Monday.\u201d While it has now been confirmed that a horse incubating equine influenza was one of 64 to compete at Ayr\u2019s jumps meeting on Wednesday, the emergence of a possible fresh case of the disease in an unconnected stable could prove to have greater long-term significance if the suspicions are confirmed on Saturday. All of the horses which raced at the Scottish track on Wednesday, most of which would have had little or no direct contact with Raise A Spark, have been confined to their yards since Thursday morning in order to minimise the chance of further spread of the disease. The fresh case of equine influenza in a stable with no obvious point of contact with McCain\u2019s, however, could suggest the BHA\u2019s attempts to contain the outbreak have not been wholly successful. That, in turn, could leave the Authority with little option but to extend the current shutdown of racing beyond next Wednesday as it waits for the results of tests on horses from all of the 174 stables which are now on lockdown. Trainer\u2019s tale Tony Carroll is a dual-purpose trainer with a stable near Cropthorne in Worcestershire. He trained the last winner before British racing\u2019s shutdown, Toni\u2019s A Star, at Wolverhampton on Wednesday I didn\u2019t hear that racing had been cancelled until Thursday morning.

It\u2019s clear that no one is going to die wondering in this election year, except perhaps, the voting public, who remain resolutely nonplussed at the whole freewheeling, self-justifying, shebang. A couple of final observations about the imperative of building fighting machines. The imperative does help to rapid set one of the more genuinely interesting dynamics of the looming federal contest. The whole boomers versus millennials motif is a generalisation that can be overworked to the point of cliche, but there will be an element of generational face-off in the coming contest, because the programs of the major parties are inviting that debate. If we think again about franking credits, and the government\u2019s efforts to mobilise on that issue, Labor will attempt to counter with a mobilisation on a sustainable funding of public services message, and on climate change. The franking credits issue is hottest in the coastal communities where self-funded retirees cluster, but the risks of climate change is also red hot in those same coastal communities, where anxiety is currently at 2007 levels because of the wild summer. We are building, inexorably, towards a clash of clans in May.",

In the 2016 Texas case, the court found that requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, \u201cprovides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \u2018undue burden\u2019 on their constitutional right to do so\u201d.

Although Kavanaugh does not have an extensive record ruling on reproductive rights cases, Trump promised to appoint only \u201cpro-life\u201d justices. Kavanaugh is Catholic. That the case made its way to the US supreme court at all shows the power of federal appeals court judges, which the Trump administration has made a priority of confirming. Supreme court precedent is supposed to guide appeals court judges, but in a decision advocates called \u201crogue\u201d, the conservative fifth circuit in Louisiana defied the supreme court\u2019s recent decision and voted to allow the law to go into effect.

      "bodyText": "A Sumatran tiger kept at London zoo has been killed by its potential mate during their first meeting. Keepers had hoped the big cats would breed but have been left devastated after Asim, the male they brought in, attacked Melati. The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) kept the two tigers in adjacent enclosures for 10 days to allow them to become accustomed to each other. After their keepers saw positive signs, they decided to make the \u201chigh-risk\u201d introduction on Friday morning. \u201cTheir introduction began as predicted but quickly escalated into a more aggressive interaction. Zoo staff immediately implemented their prepared response, using loud noises, flares and alarms to try and distract the pair, but Asim had already overpowered Melati,\u201d the ZSL said. \u201cZookeepers were eventually able to secure Asim in a separate paddock so that they could safely get to Melati where our vets confirmed that she had sadly died. Everyone at ZSL London Zoo is devastated by the loss of Melati, and we are heartbroken by this turn of events.\u201d The 10-year-old female had had three litters with her former mate, Jae Jae, and an image of her playing with one of her cubs was featured among the Guardian\u2019s photos of the day in September 2016. The ZSL said five of her cubs survived to adulthood and have since been rehoused across Europe. Asim, who is seven years old, was brought in from Denmark on 29 January, with Jae Jae heading to a French park. Keepers had assessed Asim as a \u201cconfident cat who is known for being very affectionate with the ladies\u201d. He was matched with Melati through a Europe-wide breeding programme that aims to save the species from extinction and keepers in London had high hopes the plan would work. Early signs were encouraging. \u201cThere has been lots of \u2018chuffing\u2019, which is a happy sound they make to let each other know they have good intentions,\u201d they said shortly after Asim\u2019s arrival in London. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see that they\u2019re interested in each other already.\u201d But they cautioned meetings between big cats, however carefully planned, are \u201calways considered to be high risk\u201d. ZSL said its Tiger Territory attraction would remain closed for the rest of Friday while its team focused on caring for Asim.",

      "bodyText": "The eye-catching victory of AlphaZero, the artificial-intelligence program that taught itself to play chess, over the No 1 computer engine Stockfish, has evoked comparisons with human legends. Garry Kasparov has written a foreword for a newly published book in which he says AlphaZero\u2019s \u201cdynamic, sacrificial style \u2026 mirrored my own \u2026 AlphaZero prefers piece activity and attacking chances\u201d. He also compares it to \u201cAlexander Alekhine, with dazzling sacrifices and a fondness for unbalanced positions\u201d. The book is Game Changer by Matthew Sadler and Natasha Regan (New in Chess, \u00a319.95) which features an in-depth analysis by Sadler, a grandmaster and former British champion, of recurrent motifs in AlphaZero\u2019s style which can be adapted by human players. Among the many themes which Sadler identifies, AZ likes Harry the h pawn to spearhead its long-term attacks with an advance to h6 which entombs a rook or bishop at h8. In the Queen\u2019s Gambit Exchange it avoids the traditional queen\u2019s side minority attack and will allow Bg4xf3 doubling White\u2019s f pawns to create attacking chances. It values piece mobility highly, and is ready to sacrifice material for a complex initiative.

Like Vlad Kramnik, it uses the Berlin Wall 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6. Its principal reply to 1 d4 is the Ragozin Queen\u2019s Gambit, all implying a rather narrow repertoire as Black which, since top grandmasters specialise in prepared lines, is something which at least in theory a future human opponent might exploit. However, there have been no AZ games published against any humans, and indeed none published against any opponent other than Stockfish. Such games probably happened, for AZ\u2019s creator Demis Hassabis is an expert player while its team also includes Dharshan Kumaran who during his career in the 1990s was a grandmaster and world under-16 champion. At the back of Game Changer there are two photographs of the authors playing AZ in May last year, but there are no accompanying game moves or even any description of what happened. The only detail given is that Natasha Regan played a Reti Opening. The overriding impression from Game Changer is that the AZ v Stockfish matches were full of creative ideas, so I went to the website chessgames.com which has a dedicated AlphaZero page with 220 games against Stockfish. What stands out there is something rather different. Of the 220 games games 123 were marathons of 100 moves or more;123 games, 33 of these, every one drawn, exceeded 200 moves. Several lasted 251 or 255 moves, where there seems to be a termination rule. Human games of over 100 moves are rare and the record length is 269-moves played at Belgrade half a century ago. The all-time No 1 Garry Kasparov famously lost to IBM Deep Blue in 1997, and the next world champion Vlad Kramnik was beaten by Deep Fritz in 2006 after allowing a mate in one. After that it became received wisdom that human v computer matches were no longer viable, but America\u2019s Hikaru Nakamura defeated Rybka in a speed game in 2008, and in 2011 and 2018 tied with Komodo receiving small material odds. LeelaZero is a free open-source engine using the same self-learning method as AlphaZero, and in little over a year it has become one of the strongest competitors. You can watch it or even play it at lichess, and its match currently in progress against Stockfish can be viewed at chessbomb or chess24. AlphaZero has succeeded in reaching a wider audience with greater media exposure than any of its rivals. Its absence of human opponents could even be deliberate in a quest for what now looks the ultimate pairing, AlphaZero v Magnus Carlsen. Could it happen? On the face of it, no.

But though Foakes is now fully fit and has trained during the lead-up to the St Lucia Test, Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss have opted to leave him out for tactical reasons. Taken in isolation it could be viewed as a harsh call on Foakes, who after replacing the injured Bairstow in Sri Lanka emerged as player of the series in a 3-0 victory through a century on debut in Galle and some immaculate glove work. But Bairstow had been first choice behind the stumps for the best part of three years and, though he made a century on returning to the team in Colombo as a specialist batsman atNo 3, the Yorkshireman has made little secret of his desire to drop back down the order and keep wicket.

      "bodyText": "A crunch vote in which MPs could force Theresa May\u2019s hand on Brexit is set to be delayed until the end of the month or even later, it has emerged, as the prime minister travelled to Dublin for urgent talks with fewer than 50 days left to departure from the EU. Under the timetable agreed by the government, May must either present a revised Brexit deal to the Commons on Thursday, which appears unlikely to happen, or else table a motion to which MPs can add amendments. In a similar process just over a week ago, the Commons supported May\u2019s attempt to renegotiate the Irish backstop but voted down amendments tabled by cross-party alliances of Brexit-sceptic MPs that would have extended article 50 and given parliament more control. It had been expected the MPs would try again on Thursday if May did not return with a deal. But sources close to the group, led by the Tory MP Nick Boles and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, said it seemed likely that the prime minister would be given more time to discuss a Labour Brexit proposal and hold more talks with Brussels. \u201cThe Tory MPs are keen to give the PM a chance to follow up on the cross-party talks, and negotiations with the EU,\u201d the source said. A bill laying out how MPs could seek to avoid a no-deal departure may nonetheless be published next week, they said. \u201cThere\u2019s a definite sense that lots of Tories are worried about no deal, but they don\u2019t want to look like they are trying to obstruct her negotiations,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere is very definitely a majority in parliament against no deal, but it\u2019s a question of how to proceed and when.\u201d The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who supported the last Cooper-Boles amendment, told the Guardian: \u201cOur position is that the ball is in the PM\u2019s court. What we do depends on what the PM does.\u201d Any further delay would be contingent on May promising a future date for either a vote on her deal or another amendable motion, he said, adding: \u201cParliament has to have its say.\u201d It sets the scene for an increasingly tense couple of weeks in which May will attempt to stitch together a Brexit plan that can get a parliamentary majority while the EU and backbenchers watch the clock tick down towards 29 March. After a bruising set of talks in Brussels on Thursday in which the European council president, Donald Tusk, mentioned Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposals as a way of breaking the impasse, May was to meet the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, for a dinner in Dublin on Friday. The talks were intended to build on discussions May had in Northern Ireland and Brussels this week, her spokeswoman said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be emphasising what we are looking for: seeking the legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement that parliament said it needs to approve the deal.\u201d Earlier on Friday the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, met his Irish counterpart, S\u00e9amus Woulfe, for talks on the backstop, the insurance policy intended to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland if no permanent agreement can be reached. May and Cox are pushing for changes to the backstop such as a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK, a key demand of the DUP and many Conservative backbenchers, but the chances of any progress seem slight. Speaking earlier in Belfast, where he met Northern Irish parties, Varadkar said that while the meal with May was an opportunity to \u201cshare perspectives\u201d on Brexit, actual negotiations \u201ccan only be between the European Union and the United Kingdom\u201d. \u201cThere is much more that unites us than divides us and time is running short, and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible,\u201d he said. In an interview shown on RTE, the Irish state broadcaster, on Friday night, Varadkar said he thought a deal could be done, but he was unsure if it would happen before the UK leaves the EU. \u201cI think that on balance we will secure a deal \u2013 whether it will be by the end of March or after an extension, I can\u2019t say,\u201d he said. May has yet to formally respond to Corbyn\u2019s letter on Wednesday in which he said Labour would support her Brexit deal if she makes five legally binding commitments, including joining a customs union. The Labour leader faces disquiet from some of his MPs over the move, which some have interpreted as a shift away from the possibility of pushing for a second referendum.",

      "body": "<p>A true story worthy of a Patricia Highsmith thriller was <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions\" title=\"\">published this week</a> in the New Yorker. The magazine detailed the deceptions of Dan Mallory, who is the author, under the pseudonym AJ Finn, of the bestselling psychological thriller The Woman in the Window. But his launch into authordom came after a career in publishing in London and New York, during which, the investigation found, Mallory had deceived colleagues, telling them a range of stories including that his mother had died of cancer (she is alive); his brother had killed himself (he is alive); and that he himself had suffered from brain cancer. Mallory has admitted to some of this, saying that he used the excuse of brain cancer to cover up his shame at his real suffering from mental illness.</p> <p>His account would not explain instances where he inflated his professional experience to smooth his rapid advance up the ranks of publishing. When the immediate thrill of reading the New Yorker\u2019s expos\u00e9 had passed, many working in the industry reflected on what the story reveals about their profession. While publishing as a whole is dominated by women, specifically white women, its most powerful positions are still mostly occupied by white men. Hachette UK, the parent company of Little, Brown where Mallory <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/little-brown-promotes-daniel-mallory\" title=\"\">worked</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/23/gender-pay-gap-figures-reveal-big-publishings-great-divide\" title=\"\">last year announced</a> that it had a median gender pay gap of 24.71%, and a mean gender pay gap of 29.69%. Women working in publishing say that all too often they see bright, likely looking young men fast-tracked for promotion, while they toil unrecognised. That Mallory was helped to rise with such speed, on the back of unchecked claims about his experience and competence, is not only depressing for those working honestly in the industry, but also deeply infuriating.</p> <p>One of the ironies of the New Yorker expos\u00e9, thrilling reading as it is, is that it almost cannot help but glamorise Mallory\u2019s actions. The attractive chancer, the charming fantasist, the unscrupulous but amusing rogue: this is a stock literary character, and there are Mallorys in books by authors from Apuleius to Thackeray. Real-life rapscallions have been narrativised in similar terms \u2013 think of Frank Abagnale, a fraudster who posed as an airline pilot, who became the central character in the film Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. (Mr Abagnale later worked for the FBI, and is now a security consultant.) Missing from Mallory\u2019s story, by definition, are the people who could have been promoted, and should have flourished, but were blocked because of Mallory\u2019s successful deceptions. These are his invisible victims. If things had gone better, different authors, other books, might have reached readers. Perhaps better ones.</p> <p>The subject of Mallory\u2019s uncompleted postgraduate research was the novelist Patricia Highsmith. Last year, long before the recent revelations, Mallory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/14/crime-fiction-daniel-mallory-woman-in-the-window-debut-interview\" title=\"\">talked to the Observer</a> about her character Tom Ripley, who lies and deceives his way to success. Mallory said: \u201cI think one of the reasons I was attracted to Highsmith is that most crime fiction is morally educative: morals will be upheld, justice will be doled out, wrongdoers will be caught and punished. But that did not happen with Tom Ripley and it fascinated me to see this character get away with stuff. It fascinated me more to find myself rooting for him. I still think that is a pretty nifty trick.\u201d The Woman in the Window, the film version of Mallory\u2019s thriller, is on its way. But the movie of Mallory\u2019s life cannot be far behind. Society\u2019s capacity to forgive, or even admire, a rogue is boundless \u2013 but not especially admirable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A true story worthy of a Patricia Highsmith thriller was published this week in the New Yorker. The magazine detailed the deceptions of Dan Mallory, who is the author, under the pseudonym AJ Finn, of the bestselling psychological thriller The Woman in the Window. But his launch into authordom came after a career in publishing in London and New York, during which, the investigation found, Mallory had deceived colleagues, telling them a range of stories including that his mother had died of cancer (she is alive); his brother had killed himself (he is alive); and that he himself had suffered from brain cancer. Mallory has admitted to some of this, saying that he used the excuse of brain cancer to cover up his shame at his real suffering from mental illness. His account would not explain instances where he inflated his professional experience to smooth his rapid advance up the ranks of publishing. When the immediate thrill of reading the New Yorker\u2019s expos\u00e9 had passed, many working in the industry reflected on what the story reveals about their profession. While publishing as a whole is dominated by women, specifically white women, its most powerful positions are still mostly occupied by white men. Hachette UK, the parent company of Little, Brown where Mallory worked, last year announced that it had a median gender pay gap of 24.71%, and a mean gender pay gap of 29.69%. Women working in publishing say that all too often they see bright, likely looking young men fast-tracked for promotion, while they toil unrecognised. That Mallory was helped to rise with such speed, on the back of unchecked claims about his experience and competence, is not only depressing for those working honestly in the industry, but also deeply infuriating. One of the ironies of the New Yorker expos\u00e9, thrilling reading as it is, is that it almost cannot help but glamorise Mallory\u2019s actions. The attractive chancer, the charming fantasist, the unscrupulous but amusing rogue: this is a stock literary character, and there are Mallorys in books by authors from Apuleius to Thackeray. Real-life rapscallions have been narrativised in similar terms \u2013 think of Frank Abagnale, a fraudster who posed as an airline pilot, who became the central character in the film Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. (Mr Abagnale later worked for the FBI, and is now a security consultant.) Missing from Mallory\u2019s story, by definition, are the people who could have been promoted, and should have flourished, but were blocked because of Mallory\u2019s successful deceptions. These are his invisible victims. If things had gone better, different authors, other books, might have reached readers. Perhaps better ones. The subject of Mallory\u2019s uncompleted postgraduate research was the novelist Patricia Highsmith. Last year, long before the recent revelations, Mallory talked to the Observer about her character Tom Ripley, who lies and deceives his way to success. Mallory said: \u201cI think one of the reasons I was attracted to Highsmith is that most crime fiction is morally educative: morals will be upheld, justice will be doled out, wrongdoers will be caught and punished. But that did not happen with Tom Ripley and it fascinated me to see this character get away with stuff. It fascinated me more to find myself rooting for him. I still think that is a pretty nifty trick.\u201d The Woman in the Window, the film version of Mallory\u2019s thriller, is on its way. But the movie of Mallory\u2019s life cannot be far behind. Society\u2019s capacity to forgive, or even admire, a rogue is boundless \u2013 but not especially admirable.",

As the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit grows, some ministers and officials have returned to the work in search of emergency levers to pull in the event of a downturn, the Guardian has been told. These are the options that could be open to ministers:</p> <h2>Tariffs</h2> <p>Under a disorderly Brexit, Britain\u2019s imports and exports will switch to World Trade Organization rules, which would mean higher tariffs than under existing EU arrangements. </p> <p>Some free-market economists and politicians have called for the UK to cut its tariff rates to zero to offset the cost to consumers. However, this would probably damage UK firms that could be undercut by foreign imports, particularly for manufacturing and agriculture.</p> <p>However, there could be a benefit from a WTO regime. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist of the consultancy Capital Economics, said WTO-level border taxes could bring in about \u00a310bn a year extra for the public purse. This could be used to finance tax cuts to maintain consumer spending.</p> <h2>VAT</h2> <p>Economists said cutting VAT paid on goods in the shops from the current level of 20% would help to support consumer spending. A no-deal Brexit is forecast to cause a slide in the value of the pound, which would push up the cost of imports, leading to higher inflation and eroding consumer spending power.</p> <h2>Income tax</h2> <p>Philip Hammond announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/low-earners-gain-little-from-hammonds-3bn-tax-giveaway\">tax cuts</a> in the autumn budget, and could raise the personal allowance \u2013 the rate at which people start paying tax on income \u2013 further to put more money in consumers\u2019 pockets to help them keep spending. He could also cut income tax, although he would probably face political pressure not to cut taxes for wealthier voters. He could also cut stamp duty to help stimulate the housing market.</p> <h2>Benefits</h2> <p>Hammond could overturn the benefit freeze to put more money in the pockets of lower-income households \u2013 helping to maintain spending. Real-terms welfare cuts worth \u00a31.5bn per year are due to kick in from April, and will lose the average lower-income-bracket couple with children about \u00a3200.</p> <h2>Spending</h2> <p>The chancellor held about \u00a315.4bn worth of spending firepower in reserve at the last budget, which he could unleash to stimulate economic growth. Dales said an additional \u00a310bn of spending would boost economic growth by about 0.5% per year.</p> <p>Spending on infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges and railways, would have the biggest impact. However, it would take time to get started. Economists said tax cuts were quicker and easier, and therefore more likely to be deployed.</p> <h2>Austerity</h2> <p>Public borrowing could expand rapidly in the event of no-deal Brexit.

The Conservatives have, however, imposed austerity. Many economists believe that higher spending immediately after the 2008 financial crisis by the Labour government helped avoid a more damaging recession.</p> <h2>Border checks</h2> <p>Some Brexit supporters have suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/11/rees-mogg-no-need-for-customs-checks-at-dover-in-no-deal-brexit\">customs checks at UK borders could be relaxed</a> to help smooth international trade.</p> <p>There are fears the government could lower UK regulations, including food standards, to strike trade deals around the world.

The Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/07/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-cuts-growth-forecast\">kept interest rates on hold at 0.75% this week</a> as it warned that the outlook for the UK economy was the worst since the financial crisis, in a move that helps keep borrowing costs low for consumers and companies to maintain spending.</p> <p>City economists believe Threadneedle Street would cut interest rates to 0.25% in the event of no-deal Brexit to further stimulate growth, although the Bank said such a reaction would not be automatic. </p> <p>Should the economy require additional support from the Bank, it could relaunch its programme of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\">quantitative easing</a> \u2013 buying UK government bonds from commercial banks to flood the financial system with additional money.

Trump has also waged a running war of words against Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, which he frequently denounces as part of the \u201cfake news media\u201d.</p> <p>The White House remained silent on the matter but two more threads raised questions about a potential association. In a TV interview, a Post reporter claimed that Bezos\u2019s camp believes the National Enquirer\u2019s conduct might have been politically motivated and that a \u201cgovernment entity\u201d might have got hold of his text messages, though which government might be involved was not indicated.</p> <p>Bezos himself, laying out his allegations in an extraordinary 2,000-word blogpost, noted that Pecker and AMI have been \u201cinvestigated for various actions they\u2019ve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government\u201d. He added that \u201cfor reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve\u201d.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear why Bezos made the Saudi connection, but political commentators were quick to recall that Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi government, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, focusing often critical attention on Trump\u2019s cosy relationship with the kingdom.</p> <p>PEN America, which promotes freedom of expression, condemned AMI\u2019s actions and Trump\u2019s possible links. Suzanne Nossel, its chief executive, said: \u201cComing against the backdrop of credible reports of past coordination between President Donald Trump and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, these revelations assume a truly sinister cast.</p> <p>\u201cIf indeed AMI\u2019s threats and acts of intimidation toward the press were coordinated with the president or done at his request, it would represent a perilous escalation of the president\u2019s war on the first amendment and the role of a free press. Congress should act immediately to investigate these serious allegations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/08/jeff-bezos-the-man-behind-the-amazon-phenomenon\">Jeff Bezos: the Amazon billionaire and Trump bete noire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The intrigue, which has shaken the worlds of New York media and Washington politics, began on 9 January when Bezos announced on Twitter that he was getting divorced from his wife of 25 years, novelist MacKenzie Bezos.</p> <p>A day later, the National Enquirer published a story about the billionaire Amazon chief executive\u2019s relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. It reported that Bezos sent \u201csleazy text messages and gushing love notes\u201d to Sanchez. He wrote: \u201cI am crazy about you. All of you.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not miss the chance to gloat over his perceived adversary and praise the Enquirer. He tweeted: \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!\u201d</p> <p>Bezos, meanwhile, hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid acquired the texts and photos. Bezos writes in his blogpost on Medium that he learned Pecker was \u201capoplectic\u201d about the investigation. AMI later approached Bezos\u2019s representatives with an offer. \u201cThey said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn\u2019t stop our investigation,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Bezos also wrote that this week, the tabloid\u2019s editor, Dylan Howard, emailed a lawyer for Bezos\u2019s longtime security consultant to describe photos including a \u201cbelow-the-belt selfie\u201d of Bezos and him in tight boxer shorts and wearing only a towel, as well as several revealing photos of Sanchez.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d804fe0b4a9d0add1d4010ced361baf95de7aec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d804fe0b4a9d0add1d4010ced361baf95de7aec/0_23_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Pecker, chairman and CEO of American Media, which has admitted engaging in the practice of \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019 of stories it wished to suppress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Pecker, chairman and CEO of American Media, which has admitted engaging in the practice of \u2018catch-and-kill\u2019 of stories it wished to suppress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer ./Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the emails released by Bezos, AMI offered a formal deal: the tabloid would agree to not publish the photos if Bezos and his investigators would release a public statement \u201caffirming that they have no knowledge or basis\u201d to suggest the Enquirer\u2019s coverage was \u201cpolitically motivated or influenced by political forces\u201d.</p> <p>But in a move that has earned widespread public praise, Bezos said he decided to publish the emails sent to his team \u201crather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail\u201d, despite the \u201cpersonal cost and embarrassment they threaten\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-blackmail-claims-trump\">Bezos blackmail claims add new twist to tale of Trump, Russia and the media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want personal photos published, but I also won\u2019t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption.

Ronan Farrow, an investigative reporter at HBO and the New Yorker, tweeted:<strong> </strong>\u201cI and at least one other prominent journalist involved in breaking stories about the National Enquirer\u2019s arrangement with Trump fielded similar \u2018stop digging or we\u2019ll ruin you\u2019 blackmail efforts from AMI.\u201d</p> <p>Pecker and AMI have a storied relationship with Trump, though it was said to have cooled in recent months. The company recently admitted secretly aiding Trump\u2019s election campaign by paying $150,000 to a Playboy model for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with the then candidate. AMI then suppressed the story until after the 2016 election.</p> <p>The justice department agreed last September to a non-prosecution agreement with AMI, which requires the company and some top executives, including Pecker and Howard, to cooperate with authorities.</p> <p>But in the wake of the new revelations the Associated Press has reported that federal investigators are now looking at whether the recent revelations mean AMI has violated that agreement. The agreement requires AMI commit no crimes for three years.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A sprawling international scandal involving Jeff Bezos \u2013 the owner of Amazon and world\u2019s richest man \u2013 and allegations of \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d by a tabloid publisher threatened on Friday to also engulf Donald Trump as several key questions went unanswered. Bezos alleges that David Pecker, the owner of the National Enquirer and a longtime friend of the US president, warned him he would publish revealing intimate photos of him unless he stopped investigating how the tabloid obtained text messages exposing his extramarital affair. Pecker is the chief executive of American Media Inc (AMI), which said on Friday that it \u201cacted lawfully\u201d in its reporting on Bezos and that it would \u201cthoroughly investigate\u201d his claims of blackmail and take \u201cwhatever appropriate action is necessary\u201d. But Pecker is also close to Trump, and AMI has admitted in the past that it engaged in a practice known as \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d \u2013 suppressing potentially damaging stories \u2013 to help Trump become president. Trump has also waged a running war of words against Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, which he frequently denounces as part of the \u201cfake news media\u201d. The White House remained silent on the matter but two more threads raised questions about a potential association. In a TV interview, a Post reporter claimed that Bezos\u2019s camp believes the National Enquirer\u2019s conduct might have been politically motivated and that a \u201cgovernment entity\u201d might have got hold of his text messages, though which government might be involved was not indicated. Bezos himself, laying out his allegations in an extraordinary 2,000-word blogpost, noted that Pecker and AMI have been \u201cinvestigated for various actions they\u2019ve taken on behalf of the Saudi Government\u201d. He added that \u201cfor reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve\u201d. It was not immediately clear why Bezos made the Saudi connection, but political commentators were quick to recall that Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi government, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, focusing often critical attention on Trump\u2019s cosy relationship with the kingdom. PEN America, which promotes freedom of expression, condemned AMI\u2019s actions and Trump\u2019s possible links. Suzanne Nossel, its chief executive, said: \u201cComing against the backdrop of credible reports of past coordination between President Donald Trump and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, these revelations assume a truly sinister cast. \u201cIf indeed AMI\u2019s threats and acts of intimidation toward the press were coordinated with the president or done at his request, it would represent a perilous escalation of the president\u2019s war on the first amendment and the role of a free press. Congress should act immediately to investigate these serious allegations.\u201d The intrigue, which has shaken the worlds of New York media and Washington politics, began on 9 January when Bezos announced on Twitter that he was getting divorced from his wife of 25 years, novelist MacKenzie Bezos. A day later, the National Enquirer published a story about the billionaire Amazon chief executive\u2019s relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. It reported that Bezos sent \u201csleazy text messages and gushing love notes\u201d to Sanchez. He wrote: \u201cI am crazy about you. All of you.\u201d Trump did not miss the chance to gloat over his perceived adversary and praise the Enquirer. He tweeted: \u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!\u201d Bezos, meanwhile, hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid acquired the texts and photos. Bezos writes in his blogpost on Medium that he learned Pecker was \u201capoplectic\u201d about the investigation. AMI later approached Bezos\u2019s representatives with an offer. \u201cThey said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn\u2019t stop our investigation,\u201d he wrote. Bezos also wrote that this week, the tabloid\u2019s editor, Dylan Howard, emailed a lawyer for Bezos\u2019s longtime security consultant to describe photos including a \u201cbelow-the-belt selfie\u201d of Bezos and him in tight boxer shorts and wearing only a towel, as well as several revealing photos of Sanchez. According to the emails released by Bezos, AMI offered a formal deal: the tabloid would agree to not publish the photos if Bezos and his investigators would release a public statement \u201caffirming that they have no knowledge or basis\u201d to suggest the Enquirer\u2019s coverage was \u201cpolitically motivated or influenced by political forces\u201d. But in a move that has earned widespread public praise, Bezos said he decided to publish the emails sent to his team \u201crather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail\u201d, despite the \u201cpersonal cost and embarrassment they threaten\u201d. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want personal photos published, but I also won\u2019t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\u201d Other journalists appeared to back Bezos\u2019s allegations about AMI tactics. Ronan Farrow, an investigative reporter at HBO and the New Yorker, tweeted: \u201cI and at least one other prominent journalist involved in breaking stories about the National Enquirer\u2019s arrangement with Trump fielded similar \u2018stop digging or we\u2019ll ruin you\u2019 blackmail efforts from AMI.\u201d Pecker and AMI have a storied relationship with Trump, though it was said to have cooled in recent months. The company recently admitted secretly aiding Trump\u2019s election campaign by paying $150,000 to a Playboy model for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with the then candidate. AMI then suppressed the story until after the 2016 election. The justice department agreed last September to a non-prosecution agreement with AMI, which requires the company and some top executives, including Pecker and Howard, to cooperate with authorities. But in the wake of the new revelations the Associated Press has reported that federal investigators are now looking at whether the recent revelations mean AMI has violated that agreement. The agreement requires AMI commit no crimes for three years.",

      "body": "<p>Because he made his name on screen in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/feb/08/king-of-kitchen-sink-albert-finney-a-life-in-pictures\">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</a>, Albert Finney was often characterised as one of the new rugged, working-class school of actors. In fact, his father was a successful Salford bookmaker and, on stage, Finney was built in the heroic mould. He had that indefinable quality called \u201cweight\u201d and played many of the big roles: Macbeth and Hamlet, Marlowe\u2019s Tamburlaine, Pirandello\u2019s Henry IV. He could do farce and comedy equally well but you felt he was born to play the classic heavies. The irony is that the nearest he got to playing King Lear was as \u201cSir\u201d in the movie of Ronald Harwood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085461/\">The Dresser</a>.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m happy to say I cottoned on to Finney early. As a theatre-mad teenager, I went one afternoon in 1956 to see a whimsical Irish melodrama, Happy as Larry, at the old Birmingham Rep. It included a chorus of dancing tailors and my attention was riveted by a stocky, square-shouldered figure with a centre parting that looked as it had been ironed across his head: his name, I discovered, was Albert Finney and he was a 20-year-old just out of Rada.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80b2baa6-9516-493a-9eeb-3e5550a9056f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NGOlH24mDpI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After that, I saw everything he did at the Rep. He was an astonishing Henry V: a young warrior with the impishness of a practical joker. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,567652,00.html\">Kenneth Tynan</a>, then the Observer drama critic, was also quick to spot Finney and compared him, in his muscular authority and latent power, to Spencer Tracy. You saw what Tynan meant when Finney took the lead in a modern play, The Lizard on the Rock, and died an unforgettable death: shot at point-blank range, he stared at his killer in agonised disbelief, uttered three faint cries and then keeled irrevocably over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec3dae444c9c2d2409e6b7fc22bb536b1d271611\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3dae444c9c2d2409e6b7fc22bb536b1d271611/0_0_1824_2331/782.jpg\" alt=\"A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, 1968.\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, 1968.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Finney\u2019s stage career in the 60s blossomed alongside his movie stardom. In 1960 he was the first stage Billy Liar and in 1961 played the title-role in John Osborne\u2019s Luther. He superbly embodied Osborne\u2019s idea of Luther as the architect of the individual conscience obedient to no earthly authority. But Finney also gave us, again in Tynan\u2019s words, \u201cthe infinitely vulnerable Everyman who looks like a reincarnation of the young Henry Irving fattened up for some cannibal feast\u201d.</p> \n<p>Finney was also a vital part of Laurence Olivier\u2019s 1960s National Theatre company at the Old Vic and two performances stand out for their comic finesse. In Peter Shaffer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.samuelfrench.co.uk/p/2990/black-comedy/\">Black Comedy</a> he played a camp antique-dealer pointing out to a naive young woman that \u201cactually there wasn\u2019t a Mrs Michelangelo\u201d. Even finer was Finney\u2019s performance as the physically identical heroes \u2013 a smart Parisian bourgeois and a lumpen hotel porter \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/plays/a-flea-in-her-ear-iid-150979\">Feydeau\u2019s A Flea In Her Ear</a>. Finney\u2019s genius was never to exaggerate the difference between the two men so that the mistaken-identity plot became wholly plausible.</p> \n<p>Inevitably, Finney\u2019s film career began to take over but everything he did on stage showed his versatility. For Michael Blakemore at the Glasgow Citizens, he played the insane king in Pirandello\u2019s Henry IV and the ironic schoolmaster in Peter Nichols\u2019s A Day in the Death of Joe Egg. He also had a golden period at the Royal Court in the early 1970s when he played the maritally agonised hero of Ted Whitehead\u2019s Alpha Beta and the reminiscent protagonist in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Krapp\u2019s Last Tape. Beckett may be the poet of terminal stages but Finney reminded us that the senile Krapp has known moments of happiness: as he recalled his afternoon with a girl in a punt, Finney allowed his head to sink into the crook of his arm as if remembering a paradise lost.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d6aff2953de8b7b4a6d9aee467356a7096efe40\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6aff2953de8b7b4a6d9aee467356a7096efe40/0_461_3783_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney in Art on London\u2019s West End in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Finney in Art on London\u2019s West End in 1996.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was often claimed that Finney, having made his fortune in films, drifted away from theatre. No-one, however, could have worked harder in support of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/13/peter-hall-died-british-theatre-rsc\">Peter Hall</a> at the foundation of the National Theatre at the Southbank in 1976. He played Hamlet, Macbeth (less excitingly than he had in Birmingham), Lopakhin in The Cherry Orchard, Mr Horner in The Country Wife and the inordinate hero in Marlowe\u2019s Tamburlaine. I remember that Finney was suffering badly from bronchitis on opening-night but he still gave us the vaunting rhetoric and flamboyant theatricality of Marlowe\u2019s overweening hero. I suggested at the time that he was all armour and no chink but it was still a brave, commanding performance.</p> \n<p>If any one stage performance stands out from his later years, it was as one of the three characters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/30/art-review-finney-stott-and-courtenay-are-a-blistering-trio\">Yasmina Reza\u2019s study of the dangers of unremitting truth-telling, Art</a>: it was especially moving to see Finney reunited with an actor whose career often ran in tandem with his own, Tom Courtenay. But my final memory is of meeting Finney when we were co-panellists in a celebration at Chichester of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/06/sir-peter-shaffer-obituary\">Peter Shaffer</a> a couple of years ago and where he jokingly asked Shaffer why he hadn\u2019t written him more roles. Although he was visibly unwell, it was a vivid reminder that Albert was an actor to his fingertips.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Because he made his name on screen in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Albert Finney was often characterised as one of the new rugged, working-class school of actors. In fact, his father was a successful Salford bookmaker and, on stage, Finney was built in the heroic mould. He had that indefinable quality called \u201cweight\u201d and played many of the big roles: Macbeth and Hamlet, Marlowe\u2019s Tamburlaine, Pirandello\u2019s Henry IV. He could do farce and comedy equally well but you felt he was born to play the classic heavies. The irony is that the nearest he got to playing King Lear was as \u201cSir\u201d in the movie of Ronald Harwood\u2019s The Dresser. I\u2019m happy to say I cottoned on to Finney early. As a theatre-mad teenager, I went one afternoon in 1956 to see a whimsical Irish melodrama, Happy as Larry, at the old Birmingham Rep. It included a chorus of dancing tailors and my attention was riveted by a stocky, square-shouldered figure with a centre parting that looked as it had been ironed across his head: his name, I discovered, was Albert Finney and he was a 20-year-old just out of Rada. After that, I saw everything he did at the Rep. He was an astonishing Henry V: a young warrior with the impishness of a practical joker. Kenneth Tynan, then the Observer drama critic, was also quick to spot Finney and compared him, in his muscular authority and latent power, to Spencer Tracy. You saw what Tynan meant when Finney took the lead in a modern play, The Lizard on the Rock, and died an unforgettable death: shot at point-blank range, he stared at his killer in agonised disbelief, uttered three faint cries and then keeled irrevocably over. Finney\u2019s stage career in the 60s blossomed alongside his movie stardom. In 1960 he was the first stage Billy Liar and in 1961 played the title-role in John Osborne\u2019s Luther. He superbly embodied Osborne\u2019s idea of Luther as the architect of the individual conscience obedient to no earthly authority. But Finney also gave us, again in Tynan\u2019s words, \u201cthe infinitely vulnerable Everyman who looks like a reincarnation of the young Henry Irving fattened up for some cannibal feast\u201d. Finney was also a vital part of Laurence Olivier\u2019s 1960s National Theatre company at the Old Vic and two performances stand out for their comic finesse. In Peter Shaffer\u2019s Black Comedy he played a camp antique-dealer pointing out to a naive young woman that \u201cactually there wasn\u2019t a Mrs Michelangelo\u201d. Even finer was Finney\u2019s performance as the physically identical heroes \u2013 a smart Parisian bourgeois and a lumpen hotel porter \u2013 in Feydeau\u2019s A Flea In Her Ear. Finney\u2019s genius was never to exaggerate the difference between the two men so that the mistaken-identity plot became wholly plausible. Inevitably, Finney\u2019s film career began to take over but everything he did on stage showed his versatility. For Michael Blakemore at the Glasgow Citizens, he played the insane king in Pirandello\u2019s Henry IV and the ironic schoolmaster in Peter Nichols\u2019s A Day in the Death of Joe Egg. He also had a golden period at the Royal Court in the early 1970s when he played the maritally agonised hero of Ted Whitehead\u2019s Alpha Beta and the reminiscent protagonist in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Krapp\u2019s Last Tape. Beckett may be the poet of terminal stages but Finney reminded us that the senile Krapp has known moments of happiness: as he recalled his afternoon with a girl in a punt, Finney allowed his head to sink into the crook of his arm as if remembering a paradise lost. It was often claimed that Finney, having made his fortune in films, drifted away from theatre. No-one, however, could have worked harder in support of Peter Hall at the foundation of the National Theatre at the Southbank in 1976. He played Hamlet, Macbeth (less excitingly than he had in Birmingham), Lopakhin in The Cherry Orchard, Mr Horner in The Country Wife and the inordinate hero in Marlowe\u2019s Tamburlaine. I remember that Finney was suffering badly from bronchitis on opening-night but he still gave us the vaunting rhetoric and flamboyant theatricality of Marlowe\u2019s overweening hero. I suggested at the time that he was all armour and no chink but it was still a brave, commanding performance. If any one stage performance stands out from his later years, it was as one of the three characters in Yasmina Reza\u2019s study of the dangers of unremitting truth-telling, Art: it was especially moving to see Finney reunited with an actor whose career often ran in tandem with his own, Tom Courtenay. But my final memory is of meeting Finney when we were co-panellists in a celebration at Chichester of Peter Shaffer a couple of years ago and where he jokingly asked Shaffer why he hadn\u2019t written him more roles. Although he was visibly unwell, it was a vivid reminder that Albert was an actor to his fingertips.",

Like Richard Burton before him and Kenneth Branagh after him, he was expected to become the new Laurence Olivier, the leader of his profession, on stage and on screen.</p> \n<p>That this never quite happened was no fault of Finney\u2019s. He worked intensely in two periods at the National Theatre, was an active film producer as well as occasional director, and remained a glowering, formidable presence in the movies long after he had been nominated five times for an Oscar (without ever winning).

He never courted publicity.</p> \n<p>His unusual, cherubic face, slightly puffy and jowly, but with high cheekbones, the face of an unmarked boxer, was always a reminder of his sensational breakthrough in two signature British films, <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/451812/index.html\" title=\"\">Karel Reisz</a>\u2019s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) \u2013 his line as the Nottingham bruiser Arthur Seaton, \u201cWhat I want is a good time; the rest is all propaganda\u201d, could serve as a professional epitaph \u2013 and Tony Richardson\u2019s Tom Jones (1963), a lubricious historical romp that imparted a metaphorical mood of the swinging 60s.</p> \n<p>Finney was the new roaring boy of that high-spirited, colourful decade \u2013 cheeky, northern and working-class. Born in Salford, he was the son of Albert Finney Sr, a bookmaker, and his wife, Alice (nee Hobson); as it happens, also born that day was another northern \u201cnew wave\u201d actor, Glenda Jackson.</p> \n<p>Young Albert attended Tootal Drive primary school and Salford grammar. He flunked his exams but played leading roles in 15 school plays and went south to London and Rada, where he was in a class that included Peter O\u2019Toole, Tom Courtenay, Frank Finlay, John Stride and Brian Bedford. While still a student, as Troilus in a modern play, he was spotted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,567652,00.html\" title=\"\">Kenneth Tynan</a> \u2013 the best-known critic of the day \u2013 who proclaimed a \u201csmouldering young Spencer Tracy ... who will soon disturb the dreams of Messrs Burton and Scofield\u201d.

He played Brutus, Hamlet, Henry V and Macbeth at the Birmingham Rep, and in 1956 made his London debut in the Old Vic\u2019s production of Shaw\u2019s Caesar and Cleopatra.

He also understudied (and went on for, to sensational effect) Olivier as Coriolanus.</p> \n<p>But Finney was a modern actor not really destined for classical eminence. Much more his style was the insolence and daydreaming of Billy Liar by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall at the Cambridge theatre, though the role on film went to Tom Courtenay. At the Royal Court he took the lead roles in a satirical musical, The Lily White Boys, directed by Lindsay Anderson, and in John Osborne\u2019s vitriolic, tumultuous Luther (the latter in the West End, later on Broadway); he made his film debut opposite Olivier in The Entertainer in 1960.</p> \n<p>A pattern of oscillation between theatre and cinema was soon established, as he bookended his first major stint at the National, in the great Olivier company, with screen appearances in Reisz\u2019s 1964 remake of Emlyn Williams\u2019s psychological thriller Night Must Fall and Stanley Donen\u2019s delightful study of a disintegrating relationship, scripted by Frederic Raphael in flash back and fast forward, Two For the Road (1967). Finney\u2019s leading lady in the latter, Audrey Hepburn, was not the first nor last of his amorous work-and-pleasure intrigues.</p> \n<p>His NT appearances in 1965 and 1966 were as a strutting Don Pedro in Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s Sicilian take on Much Ado About Nothing (with Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens), the lead in John Arden\u2019s Armstrong\u2019s Last Goodnight, a great double of the candescent upstart Jean in Strindberg\u2019s Miss Julie and the outrageous Harold Gorringe in Peter Shaffer\u2019s Black Comedy, topped off with the double-dealing, split-personality Chandebise in Jacques Charon\u2019s definitive production of Feydeau\u2019s A Flea in Her Ear.</p> \n<p>Then he was off again, having founded <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/audio/id/956482/index.html\" title=\"\">Memorial films</a> in 1965 with his great friend and fellow actor Michael Medwin, directing and starring in Charlie Bubbles (1968), written by his fellow Salfordian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/21/shelagh-delaney\" title=\"\">Shelagh Delaney</a> (author of A Taste of Honey) and featuring Billie Whitelaw and Liza Minnelli. He co-produced Lindsay Anderson\u2019s savage public school satire If \u2026 (1968), bankrolled Mike Leigh\u2019s first feature film, Bleak Moments (1971), and gave Stephen Frears his movie-directing debut on Gumshoe, a brilliant homage to film noir as well as a good story (written by Neville Smith) about a bingo caller (Finney) in a trenchcoat with delusions of being Humphrey Bogart. He even had time to disguise himself totally as a wispily senile Scrooge in Ronald Neame\u2019s 1970 film, with Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley and Edith Evans as the Ghost of Christmas Past.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"650798e6ac2c26e6a3d2553911d83d13a813e4e5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650798e6ac2c26e6a3d2553911d83d13a813e4e5/0_117_2123_2653/800.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney as Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1970 film based on Dickens\u2019s novel A Christmas Carol.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Finney as Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1970 film based on Dickens\u2019s novel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Waterbury/Cinema Center/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An invitation to return to the Royal Court as an associate director (1972-75) resulted in one of his blistering stage performances, opposite Rachel Roberts, in EA Whitehead\u2019s Alpha Beta. He directed Brian Friel\u2019s The Freedom of the City and a revival of Joe Orton\u2019s Loot, and appeared in David Storey\u2019s Cromwell and Samuel Beckett\u2019s Krapp\u2019s Last Tape.</p> \n<p>The reminiscing Krapp unspooled his old Grundig on a double bill with Billie Whitelaw\u2019s hectic jabbering in Not I, and Finney confided in Whitelaw his lack of rapport with the playwright: \u201cYou know the way I work, I take all the different paints out of the cupboard, I mix the colours together. If they\u2019re not right, I shove them all back and take out a new lot.\u201d Whitelaw advised him to dispose of all the colours and retain the white, black and grey.</p> \n<p>He was much happier unbuttoning in Peter Nichols\u2019s sharp West End comedy Chez Nous and embodying Agatha Christie\u2019s Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet\u2019s star-laden Murder on the Orient Express (1974). But he returned to the National under Peter Hall during the difficult transition period from the Old Vic to the South Bank.</p> \n<p>Over six years from 1974, as striking technicians and unconvinced critics lined up to try to scupper the new building, Finney ploughed on as a bullish, tormented Hamlet, a lascivious Horner in The Country Wife, the perfect arriviste Lopakhin in The Cherry Orchard and a disappointing Macbeth. The centrepiece was his heroic, muscular and glistening Tamburlaine in Peter Hall\u2019s 1976 defiant staging of Marlowe\u2019s two-part mighty epic, twirling an axe to deadly effect.</p> \n<p>This performance marked Finney\u2019s grandest, if not necessarily finest, hour on stage; he appeared briefly at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 1977 to deliver beautifully modulated performances as Uncle Vanya and an ultra-credible woman-slaying Gary Essendine in No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Present Laughter. Another long absence from the theatre ended with a stunning performance as a roguish Chicago hoodlum in Lyle Kessler\u2019s Orphans at the Hampstead theatre in 1986 (and a movie version a year later) and another great turn as a Catholic priest, held hostage and deprived of his faith, in Harwood\u2019s JJ Farr at the Phoenix theatre.</p> \n<p>Finney was now nearly a grand old man, but without the seigneurial distinction of either Olivier or Gielgud. He was delightful and dewy-eyed, eventually, as a bald Daddy Warbucks in John Huston\u2019s film of Annie (1982), but truly magnificent as the alcoholic British consul \u2013 \u201ca drunk act to end all drunk acts\u201d said one critic \u2013 in Huston\u2019s Under the Volcano (1984), adapted from the novel by Malcolm Lowry.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7069100c9e712768de57f47be4adfc48a2be9b27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7069100c9e712768de57f47be4adfc48a2be9b27/0_70_2745_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Finney as the detective Hercule Poirot in the film Murder on the Orient Express (1974), directed by Sidney Lumet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Finney as the detective Hercule Poirot in the film Murder on the Orient Express (1974), directed by Sidney Lumet.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Studiocanal/EMI</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That performance should have won the Oscar, perhaps, but he remained a near-miss nominee, as he had done in The Dresser (1983). On stage, the beautiful, bolshie boy had settled into ruminative, but always interesting, late middle age, notably in Harwood\u2019s ingeniously structured Another Time (1989), in which he played a bankrupt Jewish commercial traveller and, in the second act, his own musician son, 35 years later; another Harwood play, Reflected Glory (1992), allowed him to let rip as a breezy Mancunian restaurateur confronted with a critical family play written by his own playwright brother (though it was slightly unsettling to see Finney, the brave new Turk, siding with Harwood\u2019s contempt for \u201cmodish\u201d contemporary theatre manners).</p> \n<p>His last stage appearance reunited him in 1996 with his old friend Courtenay in Yasmina Reza\u2019s Art, at Wyndham\u2019s, a play about friendship being threatened by the purchase of a white painting for a lot of money. Courtenay was the art-loving dermatologist, Finney hilarious and exasperated as an astronautical engineer appalled by the purchase.</p> \n<p>Harwood scripted a new film version of Terence Rattigan\u2019s The Browning Version (1994), directed by Mike Figgis, but Finney was probably as unwise to assume Michael Redgrave\u2019s mantle as the unloved classics teacher as he was to play the Ralph Richardson role of Henry James\u2019s Dr Austin Sloper in Agnieszka Holland\u2019s Washington Square (1997), a remake of William Wyler\u2019s far superior The Heiress.</p> \n<p>Finney, it seemed, was selecting his movie scripts for their surprise and eclectic qualities, rather than any urgency about fulfilling his destiny as a great actor. But he was much racier on film than on stage. He honed his gangster act as a dodgy politician in the Coen Brothers\u2019 Miller\u2019s Crossing (1990), bumbled irascibly as a retired track official in Matthew Warchus\u2019s Simpatico (1999), an underrated version of a difficult Sam Shepard play, and added a touch of class (and a wayward American accent) as the small-town lawyer in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s crusading Erin Brockovich (2000), opposite a rejuvenated, tremendous Julia Roberts, which brought his fifth and last Oscar nomination.</p> \n<p>His best, and now often elegiac, performances materialised sporadically on television: as Maurice Allington in The Green Man (1991), adapted from a Kingsley Amis novel; as Reggie in A Rather English Marriage (1998), alongside Courtenay; and as Churchill in The Gathering Storm (2002), written by Hugh Whitemore, with Vanessa Redgrave as his wife.</p> \n<p>In Hollywood, he clocked in for Soderbergh\u2019s Ocean\u2019s Twelve (2004) and the third in a superb trilogy adapted from Robert Ludlum\u2019s spy action thrillers, starring Matt Damon, Paul Greengrass\u2019s The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). His last movie credits came in The Bourne Legacy and the Bond film Skyfall (both 2012).</p> \n<p>Finney, always known as Albie, was rumoured to have declined both a CBE and a knighthood. In 1957 he married the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/26/jane-wenham-obituary\" title=\"\">Jane Wenham</a>; they had a son, Simon, and divorced in 1961. His marriage to the French actor Anouk Aim\u00e9e in 1970 ended in divorce eight years later. He then had a long relationship with the actor Diana Quick \u2013 the pair were for a while feared missing up the Amazon. In 2006 he married Pene Delmage, who survives him, along with Simon.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Albert Finney, actor, born 9 May 1936; died 7 February 2019</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2019. Since Glenda Jackson was born in Cheshire, the reference to her and Albert Finney being Lancastrian actors has been changed to \u201cnorthern\u201d. In the 1959 Stratford production, it was Mary Ure rather than Peggy Ashcroft who played Desdemona to Paul Robeson\u2019s Othello, with Finney as Cassio.</p>",

A pattern of oscillation between theatre and cinema was soon established, as he bookended his first major stint at the National, in the great Olivier company, with screen appearances in Reisz\u2019s 1964 remake of Emlyn Williams\u2019s psychological thriller Night Must Fall and Stanley Donen\u2019s delightful study of a disintegrating relationship, scripted by Frederic Raphael in flash back and fast forward, Two For the Road (1967). Finney\u2019s leading lady in the latter, Audrey Hepburn, was not the first nor last of his amorous work-and-pleasure intrigues. His NT appearances in 1965 and 1966 were as a strutting Don Pedro in Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s Sicilian take on Much Ado About Nothing (with Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens), the lead in John Arden\u2019s Armstrong\u2019s Last Goodnight, a great double of the candescent upstart Jean in Strindberg\u2019s Miss Julie and the outrageous Harold Gorringe in Peter Shaffer\u2019s Black Comedy, topped off with the double-dealing, split-personality Chandebise in Jacques Charon\u2019s definitive production of Feydeau\u2019s A Flea in Her Ear. Then he was off again, having founded Memorial films in 1965 with his great friend and fellow actor Michael Medwin, directing and starring in Charlie Bubbles (1968), written by his fellow Salfordian Shelagh Delaney (author of A Taste of Honey) and featuring Billie Whitelaw and Liza Minnelli. He co-produced Lindsay Anderson\u2019s savage public school satire If \u2026 (1968), bankrolled Mike Leigh\u2019s first feature film, Bleak Moments (1971), and gave Stephen Frears his movie-directing debut on Gumshoe, a brilliant homage to film noir as well as a good story (written by Neville Smith) about a bingo caller (Finney) in a trenchcoat with delusions of being Humphrey Bogart. He even had time to disguise himself totally as a wispily senile Scrooge in Ronald Neame\u2019s 1970 film, with Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley and Edith Evans as the Ghost of Christmas Past. An invitation to return to the Royal Court as an associate director (1972-75) resulted in one of his blistering stage performances, opposite Rachel Roberts, in EA Whitehead\u2019s Alpha Beta. He directed Brian Friel\u2019s The Freedom of the City and a revival of Joe Orton\u2019s Loot, and appeared in David Storey\u2019s Cromwell and Samuel Beckett\u2019s Krapp\u2019s Last Tape. The reminiscing Krapp unspooled his old Grundig on a double bill with Billie Whitelaw\u2019s hectic jabbering in Not I, and Finney confided in Whitelaw his lack of rapport with the playwright: \u201cYou know the way I work, I take all the different paints out of the cupboard, I mix the colours together. If they\u2019re not right, I shove them all back and take out a new lot.\u201d Whitelaw advised him to dispose of all the colours and retain the white, black and grey. He was much happier unbuttoning in Peter Nichols\u2019s sharp West End comedy Chez Nous and embodying Agatha Christie\u2019s Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet\u2019s star-laden Murder on the Orient Express (1974). But he returned to the National under Peter Hall during the difficult transition period from the Old Vic to the South Bank. Over six years from 1974, as striking technicians and unconvinced critics lined up to try to scupper the new building, Finney ploughed on as a bullish, tormented Hamlet, a lascivious Horner in The Country Wife, the perfect arriviste Lopakhin in The Cherry Orchard and a disappointing Macbeth. The centrepiece was his heroic, muscular and glistening Tamburlaine in Peter Hall\u2019s 1976 defiant staging of Marlowe\u2019s two-part mighty epic, twirling an axe to deadly effect. This performance marked Finney\u2019s grandest, if not necessarily finest, hour on stage; he appeared briefly at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 1977 to deliver beautifully modulated performances as Uncle Vanya and an ultra-credible woman-slaying Gary Essendine in No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Present Laughter. Another long absence from the theatre ended with a stunning performance as a roguish Chicago hoodlum in Lyle Kessler\u2019s Orphans at the Hampstead theatre in 1986 (and a movie version a year later) and another great turn as a Catholic priest, held hostage and deprived of his faith, in Harwood\u2019s JJ Farr at the Phoenix theatre. Finney was now nearly a grand old man, but without the seigneurial distinction of either Olivier or Gielgud. He was delightful and dewy-eyed, eventually, as a bald Daddy Warbucks in John Huston\u2019s film of Annie (1982), but truly magnificent as the alcoholic British consul \u2013 \u201ca drunk act to end all drunk acts\u201d said one critic \u2013 in Huston\u2019s Under the Volcano (1984), adapted from the novel by Malcolm Lowry. That performance should have won the Oscar, perhaps, but he remained a near-miss nominee, as he had done in The Dresser (1983). On stage, the beautiful, bolshie boy had settled into ruminative, but always interesting, late middle age, notably in Harwood\u2019s ingeniously structured Another Time (1989), in which he played a bankrupt Jewish commercial traveller and, in the second act, his own musician son, 35 years later; another Harwood play, Reflected Glory (1992), allowed him to let rip as a breezy Mancunian restaurateur confronted with a critical family play written by his own playwright brother (though it was slightly unsettling to see Finney, the brave new Turk, siding with Harwood\u2019s contempt for \u201cmodish\u201d contemporary theatre manners). His last stage appearance reunited him in 1996 with his old friend Courtenay in Yasmina Reza\u2019s Art, at Wyndham\u2019s, a play about friendship being threatened by the purchase of a white painting for a lot of money. Courtenay was the art-loving dermatologist, Finney hilarious and exasperated as an astronautical engineer appalled by the purchase. Harwood scripted a new film version of Terence Rattigan\u2019s The Browning Version (1994), directed by Mike Figgis, but Finney was probably as unwise to assume Michael Redgrave\u2019s mantle as the unloved classics teacher as he was to play the Ralph Richardson role of Henry James\u2019s Dr Austin Sloper in Agnieszka Holland\u2019s Washington Square (1997), a remake of William Wyler\u2019s far superior The Heiress. Finney, it seemed, was selecting his movie scripts for their surprise and eclectic qualities, rather than any urgency about fulfilling his destiny as a great actor. But he was much racier on film than on stage. He honed his gangster act as a dodgy politician in the Coen Brothers\u2019 Miller\u2019s Crossing (1990), bumbled irascibly as a retired track official in Matthew Warchus\u2019s Simpatico (1999), an underrated version of a difficult Sam Shepard play, and added a touch of class (and a wayward American accent) as the small-town lawyer in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s crusading Erin Brockovich (2000), opposite a rejuvenated, tremendous Julia Roberts, which brought his fifth and last Oscar nomination. His best, and now often elegiac, performances materialised sporadically on television: as Maurice Allington in The Green Man (1991), adapted from a Kingsley Amis novel; as Reggie in A Rather English Marriage (1998), alongside Courtenay; and as Churchill in The Gathering Storm (2002), written by Hugh Whitemore, with Vanessa Redgrave as his wife. In Hollywood, he clocked in for Soderbergh\u2019s Ocean\u2019s Twelve (2004) and the third in a superb trilogy adapted from Robert Ludlum\u2019s spy action thrillers, starring Matt Damon, Paul Greengrass\u2019s The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). His last movie credits came in The Bourne Legacy and the Bond film Skyfall (both 2012). Finney, always known as Albie, was rumoured to have declined both a CBE and a knighthood. In 1957 he married the actor Jane Wenham; they had a son, Simon, and divorced in 1961. His marriage to the French actor Anouk Aim\u00e9e in 1970 ended in divorce eight years later. He then had a long relationship with the actor Diana Quick \u2013 the pair were for a while feared missing up the Amazon. In 2006 he married Pene Delmage, who survives him, along with Simon. \u2022 Albert Finney, actor, born 9 May 1936; died 7 February 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2019. Since Glenda Jackson was born in Cheshire, the reference to her and Albert Finney being Lancastrian actors has been changed to \u201cnorthern\u201d. In the 1959 Stratford production, it was Mary Ure rather than Peggy Ashcroft who played Desdemona to Paul Robeson\u2019s Othello, with Finney as Cassio.",

Encouraged by <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-and-tv/actor-albert-finney---son-698038\">his headmaster at Salford Grammar school</a>, Finney got a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he found himself in the same class as Peter O\u2019Toole and Alan Bates. Having established himself as a theatre actor, Finney capitalised on the late-50s surge of interest in \u201cnorthern\u201d material, and found himself cast, first, in a small role in the film adaptation of John Osborne\u2019s The Entertainer (set in Morecambe) and then as the lead in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, as rambunctious factory worker Arthur Seaton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba0f86b59385704f97684bc50a6cbbef716b002c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba0f86b59385704f97684bc50a6cbbef716b002c/0_53_697_418/500.jpg\" alt=\"Raw sexuality ...

As described in The Guide to British Cinema, Finney exuded \u201ca mixture of defiance and selfishness overlaid with a raw sexuality\u201d, and allied with his unarguable screen charisma, he became a major star almost overnight.</p> \n<p>Finney then became the face of British cinema\u2019s international explosion after being cast in the title role of Tom Jones, directed by The Entertainer\u2019s Tony Richardson. Tom Jones, with its bawdy humour and rollicking atmosphere, was a hit in the US and won four Oscars (including best picture); Finney received the first of his four best actor nominations, but lost to Sidney Poitier for Lilies of the Field.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0DDuzX2bjM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C0DDuzX2bjM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Roles followed in Karel Reisz\u2019s Night Must Fall and the Stanley Donen-directed Two for the Road, opposite Audrey Hepburn; Finney then turned director, with the 1968 release Charlie Bubbles. Written by Shelagh Delaney, the tale of a successful writer returning to his Manchester hometown was clearly highly personal for Finney, though it would prove to be his only directorial credit. He also used his increased clout \u2013 and money \u2013 to supporting other British new wave figures, backing Lindsay Anderson\u2019s radical If\u2026 and its follow-up O Lucky Man!, as well as Mike Leigh\u2019s 1971 debut feature Bleak Moments.</p> \n<p>In the ensuing decade, Finney\u2019s status as an established star saw him appear in a wide variety of material, including a mainstream musical (Scrooge), a low-budget crime comedy (Gumshoe, Stephen Frears\u2019 directorial debut) and the star-packed Agatha Christie adaptation Murder on the Orient Express, in which he played Hercule Poirot.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/feb/08/king-of-kitchen-sink-albert-finney-a-life-in-pictures\">King of kitchen sink - Albert Finney: a life in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the 1980s, Alan Parker cast him opposite Diane Keaton in Shoot the Moon, the 1982 study of a disintegrating marriage, while he played the ageing \u201cSir\u201d in the Peter Yates-directed The Dresser, for which he received an Oscar nomination.

Finney made regular stage appearances throughout his career, including A Day in the Death of Joe Egg in 1968, Krapp\u2019s Last Tape in 1973, and the 1984 revival of Sergeant Musgrave\u2019s Dance at the Old Vic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkJIcFMN_pc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hkJIcFMN_pc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>After the Coen brothers cast him in Miller\u2019s Crossing, playing Irish-American mobster Leo O\u2019Bannon, Finney began to acquire a cachet among the new generation of American film-makers who revered his work in the 1960s: Soderbergh cast him in Traffic and Erin Brockovich and Tim Burton in Corpse Bride and Big Fish.

Born in Salford in 1936, Finney grew up the son of a bookmaker as part of what he called the \u201clower middle class\u201d. Encouraged by his headmaster at Salford Grammar school, Finney got a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he found himself in the same class as Peter O\u2019Toole and Alan Bates. Having established himself as a theatre actor, Finney capitalised on the late-50s surge of interest in \u201cnorthern\u201d material, and found himself cast, first, in a small role in the film adaptation of John Osborne\u2019s The Entertainer (set in Morecambe) and then as the lead in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, as rambunctious factory worker Arthur Seaton. Directed by Karel Reisz and released in 1960, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning proved to be extremely popular as well as a key film in the \u201cangry\u201d cinema of the period. As described in The Guide to British Cinema, Finney exuded \u201ca mixture of defiance and selfishness overlaid with a raw sexuality\u201d, and allied with his unarguable screen charisma, he became a major star almost overnight. Finney then became the face of British cinema\u2019s international explosion after being cast in the title role of Tom Jones, directed by The Entertainer\u2019s Tony Richardson. Tom Jones, with its bawdy humour and rollicking atmosphere, was a hit in the US and won four Oscars (including best picture); Finney received the first of his four best actor nominations, but lost to Sidney Poitier for Lilies of the Field. Roles followed in Karel Reisz\u2019s Night Must Fall and the Stanley Donen-directed Two for the Road, opposite Audrey Hepburn; Finney then turned director, with the 1968 release Charlie Bubbles. Written by Shelagh Delaney, the tale of a successful writer returning to his Manchester hometown was clearly highly personal for Finney, though it would prove to be his only directorial credit. He also used his increased clout \u2013 and money \u2013 to supporting other British new wave figures, backing Lindsay Anderson\u2019s radical If\u2026 and its follow-up O Lucky Man!, as well as Mike Leigh\u2019s 1971 debut feature Bleak Moments. In the ensuing decade, Finney\u2019s status as an established star saw him appear in a wide variety of material, including a mainstream musical (Scrooge), a low-budget crime comedy (Gumshoe, Stephen Frears\u2019 directorial debut) and the star-packed Agatha Christie adaptation Murder on the Orient Express, in which he played Hercule Poirot. In the 1980s, Alan Parker cast him opposite Diane Keaton in Shoot the Moon, the 1982 study of a disintegrating marriage, while he played the ageing \u201cSir\u201d in the Peter Yates-directed The Dresser, for which he received an Oscar nomination. The adaptation of Malcolm Lowry\u2019s Under the Volcano, in which Finney played alcoholic ex-diplomat Geoffrey Firmin, brought him his final best actor Oscar nomination \u2013 though he would be nominated for best supporting actor in 2001 for the Steven Soderbergh-directed Erin Brockovich. He also appeared in a string of high-profile TV dramas, including Dennis Potter\u2019s final works Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, the Angela Lambert adaptation A Rather English Marriage, and as Winston Churchill in The Gathering Storm in 2002, for which he won Bafta, Golden Globe and Emmy awards. Finney made regular stage appearances throughout his career, including A Day in the Death of Joe Egg in 1968, Krapp\u2019s Last Tape in 1973, and the 1984 revival of Sergeant Musgrave\u2019s Dance at the Old Vic. After the Coen brothers cast him in Miller\u2019s Crossing, playing Irish-American mobster Leo O\u2019Bannon, Finney began to acquire a cachet among the new generation of American film-makers who revered his work in the 1960s: Soderbergh cast him in Traffic and Erin Brockovich and Tim Burton in Corpse Bride and Big Fish. His final substantial role would prove to be as the gamekeeper Kincade in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall. Finney twice turned down official honours \u2013 a CBE in 1980, and a knighthood in 2000 \u2013 and revealed in 2011 he had overcome cancer after successful treatment. He was married three times, to actors Jane Wenham and Anouk Aim\u00e9e from 1957-61 and 1970-78 respectively, and travel agent Pene Delmage in 2006. He is survived by Delmage and his son Simon, from his first marriage.",

      "bodyText": "Dave Cullen, author of the definitive book on the Columbine massacre that occurred 20 years ago, has hailed what he believes are the first signs of hope that America might be finding a way out of the epidemic of gun violence that continues to claim scores of young lives. Writing in the Guardian in an article, Cullen praises the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, for potentially leading America out of the bloody trap in which it has been gripped for the past two decades. The Parkland massacre was the deadliest shooting at a high school in US history. In the article, to be published by the Guardian this weekend, he labels the students\u2019 demands for change a year ago an \u201cuprising\u201d, equivalent in scale to protests against the Vietnam war. \u201cWhen Parkland was attacked last Valentine\u2019s Day, supporting gun safety was considered politically toxic,\u201d he writes. \u201cSuddenly, for the first time in a generation, it is starting to grow politically toxic to oppose it.\u201d ThGuardian article is being published on the eve of a grim double anniversary in what is framed by Cullen as the \u201cschool shooter era\u201d. Thursday will mark one year on from the Parkland shooting that killed 17 pupils and staff, while 20 April is the 20th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine massacre, which Cullen defines as the birth of the epoch. His reflections on the 20 years that divide the two tragedies read partly as a mea culpa. He laments that as one of the first reporters on the Columbine scene he contributed along with the rest of the media to the creation of myths that then provided fertile soil upon which further gun violence could grow. \u201cWe got it wrong. Absurdly wrong \u2026 What I failed to grasp that day was how we were botching the story \u2013 and the staggering ramifications of mislaid good intentions.

      "body": "<p>Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is, it turns out, an even older British tradition than you might think. A tour of the spellbinding <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events/anglo-saxon-kingdoms\" title=\"\">Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms</a> exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year 540, a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas \u2013 surely the Guardian columnist of his day \u2013 was writing \u201con the ruin of Britain\u201d. Even before the country properly existed, there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise.</p> <p>Still, that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than 50 days is of epic significance, breaking a thread that has run through our long history. Even in the age of Mercia, the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in \u201cFrancia\u201d, Rome and Ireland. The 10th-century court of \u00c6thelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent. And need we mention that the Anglo-Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe? The Faragiste tendency, which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe, imagines a past that did not exist. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/08/brexit-no-deal-crisis-command-centre-starts-hiring-civilians\">Brexit crisis command centre starts hiring civilians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there should be no apologies for clanging the church bells and crying havoc at the prospect of Brexit on 29 March. Viewed one way, that date became a tad less scary this week, thanks to Jeremy Corbyn, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/corbyn-lays-out-labours-terms-for-backing-may-on-brexit\" title=\"\">letter to Theresa May</a>, offering Labour approval for an exit path out of the EU via a permanent customs union, makes a no-deal crash-out less likely. For inching us away from that catastrophe, Corbyn deserves credit. On the other hand, for inching us closer to Brexit happening at all, and with Labour\u2019s blessing, he deserves blame.</p> <p>This was May\u2019s game all along: to keep dangling the lunacy of no deal over our heads until an agreed Brexit looked sane by comparison.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not sane. Even the softest, mildest Brexit-with-a-deal represents an act of national folly that would have had Cnut shaking his head in disbelief. Take a look at Labour\u2019s demands \u2013 alignment with the single market and on workers\u2019 rights along with a say over EU trade deals \u2013 and realise that these are the things we already have under our current deal, namely EU membership. The very best that can be said for Labour\u2019s Brexit is that it will only be much worse than the status quo rather than much, much worse. (Don\u2019t hold your breath to see that line in the next manifesto.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66acce1099575713f01db4009c58345f95c9e3b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66acce1099575713f01db4009c58345f95c9e3b7/0_458_4342_2605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May in Brussels after a meeting with Donald Tusk, 7 February 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May in Brussels after a meeting with Donald Tusk on Thursday. \u2018What if the process of elimination falters and May\u2019s deal squeaks through after all, helped over the line by Labour votes?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phanie Lecocq/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one can make a positive case for it, listing the concrete benefits it will bring \u2013 because it won\u2019t bring any, and certainly not \u201cthe exact same benefits\u201d of EU membership that Labour once, delusionally, promised. The government\u2019s own figures show that Brexit in whatever form will make us poorer. (Norway plus would be a less painful Brexit but it would also be a pointless one.) It means pro-Europeans are left banking on May and her party rejecting the Labour offer \u2013 fleeing from the customs union proposal because it won\u2019t allow us to make our own trade deals. (As if, solo, post-Brexit Britain will match the clout that saw the EU strike the <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/eu-japan-trade-deal-comes-into-force-to-create-worlds-biggest-trade-zone-110729\" title=\"\">deal with Japan</a> that came into force this month, creating a massive free trade area that will combine a market of 500 million consumers with the world\u2019s third-biggest economy.)</p> <p>If May does reject the Labour offer of a joint, bipartisan Brexit, pro-Europeans are banking on Corbyn and John McDonnell finally keeping their word and honouring Labour party policy by backing a second referendum. From the start, the people\u2019s vote strategy has been to wait patiently until all other options are exhausted, at which point MPs, out of alternatives and at the very last minute, will realise the train is about to crash and reach for a referendum as the nearest available emergency cord. That strategy has always been high-risk. What if the process of elimination falters and May\u2019s deal squeaks through after all, helped over the line by Labour votes? For the strategy to work, MPs must not only recoil from no deal, but then decide to flee to the safe harbour not of May\u2019s Brexit deal but a public vote. A lot has to go right for all those things to happen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/08/is-the-eu-ready-for-a-no-deal-brexit-podcast\">Will the EU stop a no-deal Brexit?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For that reason, I think pro-Europeans now have to make a different move. They can\u2019t wait for the starting gun of a referendum that may or may not ever sound. Nor is it good enough to devote their energies simply to campaigning for such a vote, or to Commons manoeuvres to get one. They need instead to make the anti-Brexit case to the public right now, as if the referendum campaign had already begun. Don\u2019t wait. Put up the posters, book the halls, spend the money right away. Do it now.</p> <p>The reasoning is simple. So far, pro-Europeans have emphasised the means \u2013 a second referendum \u2013 over the ends: staying in the EU. That\u2019s the wrong way around.

      "bodyText": "Sounding the klaxon and warning of imminent disaster is, it turns out, an even older British tradition than you might think. A tour of the spellbinding Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms exhibition at the British Library confirms that back in the year 540, a scribbling sermoniser by the name of Gildas \u2013 surely the Guardian columnist of his day \u2013 was writing \u201con the ruin of Britain\u201d. Even before the country properly existed, there were Cassandras to prophesy its demise. Still, that same exhibition leaves the visitor in no doubt that what will befall these islands in less than 50 days is of epic significance, breaking a thread that has run through our long history. Even in the age of Mercia, the kingdom strained hard to connect with its neighbours in \u201cFrancia\u201d, Rome and Ireland. The 10th-century court of \u00c6thelstan was a cosmopolitan magnet to scholars from all over the continent. And need we mention that the Anglo-Saxons were themselves migrants from northern Europe? The Faragiste tendency, which imagines a British past pure and unsullied by the taint of Europe, imagines a past that did not exist. So there should be no apologies for clanging the church bells and crying havoc at the prospect of Brexit on 29 March. Viewed one way, that date became a tad less scary this week, thanks to Jeremy Corbyn, whose letter to Theresa May, offering Labour approval for an exit path out of the EU via a permanent customs union, makes a no-deal crash-out less likely. For inching us away from that catastrophe, Corbyn deserves credit. On the other hand, for inching us closer to Brexit happening at all, and with Labour\u2019s blessing, he deserves blame. This was May\u2019s game all along: to keep dangling the lunacy of no deal over our heads until an agreed Brexit looked sane by comparison. But it\u2019s not sane. Even the softest, mildest Brexit-with-a-deal represents an act of national folly that would have had Cnut shaking his head in disbelief. Take a look at Labour\u2019s demands \u2013 alignment with the single market and on workers\u2019 rights along with a say over EU trade deals \u2013 and realise that these are the things we already have under our current deal, namely EU membership. The very best that can be said for Labour\u2019s Brexit is that it will only be much worse than the status quo rather than much, much worse. (Don\u2019t hold your breath to see that line in the next manifesto.) No one can make a positive case for it, listing the concrete benefits it will bring \u2013 because it won\u2019t bring any, and certainly not \u201cthe exact same benefits\u201d of EU membership that Labour once, delusionally, promised. The government\u2019s own figures show that Brexit in whatever form will make us poorer. (Norway plus would be a less painful Brexit but it would also be a pointless one.) It means pro-Europeans are left banking on May and her party rejecting the Labour offer \u2013 fleeing from the customs union proposal because it won\u2019t allow us to make our own trade deals. (As if, solo, post-Brexit Britain will match the clout that saw the EU strike the deal with Japan that came into force this month, creating a massive free trade area that will combine a market of 500 million consumers with the world\u2019s third-biggest economy.) If May does reject the Labour offer of a joint, bipartisan Brexit, pro-Europeans are banking on Corbyn and John McDonnell finally keeping their word and honouring Labour party policy by backing a second referendum. From the start, the people\u2019s vote strategy has been to wait patiently until all other options are exhausted, at which point MPs, out of alternatives and at the very last minute, will realise the train is about to crash and reach for a referendum as the nearest available emergency cord. That strategy has always been high-risk. What if the process of elimination falters and May\u2019s deal squeaks through after all, helped over the line by Labour votes? For the strategy to work, MPs must not only recoil from no deal, but then decide to flee to the safe harbour not of May\u2019s Brexit deal but a public vote. A lot has to go right for all those things to happen. For that reason, I think pro-Europeans now have to make a different move. They can\u2019t wait for the starting gun of a referendum that may or may not ever sound. Nor is it good enough to devote their energies simply to campaigning for such a vote, or to Commons manoeuvres to get one. They need instead to make the anti-Brexit case to the public right now, as if the referendum campaign had already begun. Don\u2019t wait. Put up the posters, book the halls, spend the money right away. Do it now. The reasoning is simple. So far, pro-Europeans have emphasised the means \u2013 a second referendum \u2013 over the ends: staying in the EU. That\u2019s the wrong way around. The first task is to persuade the public that Brexit has to be stopped: that leaving the EU will bring ruin, while staying in and making it better is the confident, open, patriotic choice. Only when voters feel that stopping Brexit on 29 March is an urgent priority will they then demand that their MPs find a way to do it, turning to a second referendum as the obvious democratic means. There is a way, but first there must be the will. The signs are more encouraging than you might expect.

Both those groups need the push of a spirited, all-out campaign, rather than 49 more days spent listening to arcane procedural wrangling in the Commons while pro-Europeans politely wait either for Corbyn \u2013 a lifelong Eurosceptic who not long ago was calling the EU a \u201cmilitary Frankenstein\u201d that actively desired unemployment \u2013 to come onside, or for May to tell them campaigning can begin. \u201cWe\u2019ve been far too up our parliamentary arses,\u201d admits one people\u2019s vote strategist, promising that the battle will now move to street level, with another mass demonstration on the way.

Find the right word, put it down.</p> <p>3 Finish what you're writing. Whatever you have to do to finish it, finish it.</p> <p>4 Put it aside. Read it pretending you've never read it before. Show it to friends whose opinion you respect and who like the kind of thing that this is.</p> <p>5 Remember: when people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.</p> <p>6 Fix it. Remember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go and move on and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.</p> <p>7 Laugh at your own jokes.</p> <p>8 The main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you're allowed to do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it's definitely true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it \u00adhonestly, and tell it as best you can. I'm not sure that there are any other rules.

Except, it\u2019s fun to introduce him anyway because he\u2019s done so much fantastic work. Starting his writing career as a journalist in the 1980s, his first published book was about the band Duran Duran. (<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/11638724/Neil-Gaiman-The-book-I-wish-Id-never-written.html\">Sadly, it is now out of print</a>, in accord with his wishes.) He also wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Panic:_The_Official_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the%20_Galaxy_Companion\">Don\u2019t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy Companion</a>, and Ghastly Beyond Belief, a book of quotations co-authored with horror buff and critic Kim Newman. By the end of the decade, he began writing comics, including the hugely influential Sandman series, and made friends with one Terry Pratchett, with whom he wrote his first novel in 1991 \u2013 the beloved classic Good Omens.</p> <p>Since then, he has written <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman_bibliography\">more than a dozen books for adults and children</a>, many of them genre-defining bestsellers such as Neverwhere, Stardust, American Gods and Coraline. He was the first (and only) author to win both the Newbery and the Carnegie medals for the same work, The Graveyard Book, and last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/30/neil-gaiman-haruki-murakami-alternative-nobel-literature-prize\">he was shortlisted for the alternative Nobel prize for literature.</a></p> <p>Many of his books have been adapted for film, radio and TV, and he has written screenplays for Doctor Who, Babylon 5 and the English version of Studio Ghibli\u2019s Princess Mononoke. He\u2019s even appeared on The Simpsons.</p> <p>As if that isn\u2019t already more than enough fuel for conversation, you might also like to know that a TV adaptation of Good Omens is on the way later in 2019, starring David Tennant and Michael Sheen. He has also recently written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2018/sep/06/neil-gaiman-and-chris-riddell-on-why-we-need-libraries-an-essay-in-pictures\">Art Matters</a>, \u201ca call to arms\u201d in defence of imagination and creativity illustrated by Chris Riddell.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure he has additional projects in the pipeline, but I\u2019ll get out of the way so you can ask <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilhimself?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ea%20uthor\">Neil himself</a>.

      "bodyText": "Thank you so much to Neil for giving us his time today - and thank you all for your questions! And yes, he has an answer for the very popular baboon versus badger question: jonty101 says: You seemed to have been heavily involved in the Good Omens adaptation, what was your role exactly and how did that differ to your role on the American Gods adaptation? magoway says: Your Nordic Myths book is fantastic. I grew up reading these stories, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read them so alive and powerfully told, except in their original versions, but those can be terse and difficult, being written in Nordic 1000 years ago. I\u2019m curious what books you relied upon when you wrote these stories, and what methodology you used to retell these myths in such a strong, simple and human way? And furthermore, did you enjoy writing this book? What did it do for you? Leftfielding says: I loved the work you did on Sandman and Mr Punch in particular. Does knowing which artists you will be collaborating with on an issue ever inform the way you write the story e.g. would you craft the tale differently if Sam Keith was illustrating than you would if say Dave McKean was? StumblingHome has a question about Neil\u2019s episode of Doctor Who, The Doctor\u2019s Wife: Have there been any talks about doing another episode? My daughter (10) is just discovering both Doctor Who and the Graveyard book, so combining the two again would blow her mind. MimHaworth asks: I\u2019m taking your Masterclass right now, generously gifted by a nice person on Twitter who raised more than she needed to to take it herself. What was it like recording something like this? How did you plan out your lessons? And what\u2019s the most important piece of advice you\u2019d want to pass on for people who simply can\u2019t afford it? MissLupescu has a question on behalf of their 10-year-old son: Have you any plans to write any more children\u2019s books? He loves that you narrate your audio books and his pronunciation of Norse words far surpasses mine now, thanks to your storytelling skills. LLCoolJ says: I\u2019m currently reading Born to Be Posthumous: The Eccentric Life and Mysterious Genius of Edward Gorey by Mark Dery and was delighted to find you and Amanda Palmer mentioned in the introduction. Did you ever collaborate with Gorey? Have you read the book? Peter Macqueen asks: Have you read Lincoln in the Bardo? If so, how does it feel to see another story using concepts that seem so original to your work in a story? DeRichleau says: I\u2019ve often heard you say that the famous \u2018dragons\u2019 quote isn\u2019t actually Chesterton\u2026 Were you paraphrasing, or did you make it up entirely? I quote it often and would like to know who to attribute it to. Thanks! (The quote is: \u201cFairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\u201d) megisacruddywriter asks: Would you ever consider touring for high schools in America, and teaching students about writing, or creating stories? A little preview of Neil\u2019s MasterClass: Direleafehall says: Hi! I can\u2019t make it to the webchat as it will be 3AM, Tassie time, but I\u2019d love to ask Neil for his favourite book recommendations by children\u2019s authors, women authors and people of colour, and if he\u2019d like to share any little-known authors he adores - ones who haven\u2019t made the big time, but who he considers worthy of great things. Thank you for taking the time, Neil! KatyaB, who is writing their dissertation on Gaiman\u2019s books, asks: Do you think fantasy is important for helping people understand themselves? FirebirdMolloy says: A friend asked my opinion of their manuscript. It isn\u2019t great. I\u2019m too nervous of upsetting them to be completely honest with my feedback. How do you deal with providing criticism, especially if it\u2019s somebody you know? Kevin Chiat has a Sandman question: Why did you decide to have Lucifer end Seasons of Mists on a beach in Perth? Yii-Jen Deng says: When you write a story with someone, how does it change your perception of them? Are people very different once you write together? franhunny asks: Have seen Coraline in our local theatre, have read the Graveyard book and have read Good Omens (even if not along with the Reading Group but decades ago) - all very different in style. The difference to Good Omens is easy to explain, as that is a book you wrote in collaboration (you do not even know by half how much I envy you for having not only met Sir Terry but also to have been able to work with him). But how come your other stuff is varying so much? When I write stories (no, they are not worth publishing - I just write for my own fun), the tone is mainly the same. How do you develop so many different voices? Is it part of the writing process? Do you sometimes start out in a different style and then rewrite parts later on? Lynden71 says: There\u2019s always talk about a Sandman series or movie and I have learned to take it with a pinch of salt unless it comes from you yourself. So, is there anything productive happening on that front? Oleg Mihailik asks: What\u2019s going on your family? Your wife Amanda [Palmer] is so cool (as are you), can you tell us a bit about your family life, do you go on holidays, do you do much events together? What\u2019s the personal dynamic between two such opinionated people? OlivesNightie says: Duncan Jones recently tweeted that he would grant permission for his dad\u2019s music to be used in a film project based on Bowie\u2019s characters if it were created by yourself and Peter Ramsey. What were your initial thoughts? Is this something you would want to do or not? WillC95 has a question about the upcoming adaptation of Good Omens: Do you think the humour of the show is different in any way to the books? I imagine it would be difficult to adapt the funny notes at the bottoms of pages to the screen. noirnoirnoir asks: Is it true that when you sit down to write you like to trash the space you are writing in first? If so do you do any structural damage or just damage the furnishings? ID8068668 says: I\u2019m interested on your thoughts of failure, the process of it and how to do it magnificently. ID586642 says: I\u2019d like to ask, if he had to pick, who would he like to meet him upon his death, his Death or Terry\u2019s? charliesdad writes: Hello Neil - hope you are well. It\u2019s been a while since you gave us a big, fat, engrossing novel for us to dive into... any plans? An American Gods or Neverwhere sequel would be super; thanks. We need taking away from this bloody horrible real-life we are all going through at the moment. GrowlyProff starts us off: My favorite question for anyone I adore and respect: what are you reading right now? Post your question now, or simply lurk for the next hour if you want to read his answers. I\u2019m overjoyed to tell you that Neil Gaiman will be joining us for a webchat on 8 February at 4pm GMT. Gaiman needs no introduction. Except, it\u2019s fun to introduce him anyway because he\u2019s done so much fantastic work. Starting his writing career as a journalist in the 1980s, his first published book was about the band Duran Duran. (Sadly, it is now out of print, in accord with his wishes.) He also wrote Don\u2019t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy Companion, and Ghastly Beyond Belief, a book of quotations co-authored with horror buff and critic Kim Newman. By the end of the decade, he began writing comics, including the hugely influential Sandman series, and made friends with one Terry Pratchett, with whom he wrote his first novel in 1991 \u2013 the beloved classic Good Omens. Since then, he has written more than a dozen books for adults and children, many of them genre-defining bestsellers such as Neverwhere, Stardust, American Gods and Coraline. He was the first (and only) author to win both the Newbery and the Carnegie medals for the same work, The Graveyard Book, and last year he was shortlisted for the alternative Nobel prize for literature. Many of his books have been adapted for film, radio and TV, and he has written screenplays for Doctor Who, Babylon 5 and the English version of Studio Ghibli\u2019s Princess Mononoke. He\u2019s even appeared on The Simpsons. As if that isn\u2019t already more than enough fuel for conversation, you might also like to know that a TV adaptation of Good Omens is on the way later in 2019, starring David Tennant and Michael Sheen. He has also recently written Art Matters, \u201ca call to arms\u201d in defence of imagination and creativity illustrated by Chris Riddell. I\u2019m sure he has additional projects in the pipeline, but I\u2019ll get out of the way so you can ask Neil himself. He will be answering questions from 4pm GMT on 8 February \u2013 but do feel free to get yours in early in the comments below.",

      "bodyText": "Bruce McArthur, the Canadian serial killer who preyed on the Toronto gay community for nearly a decade, has been given eight concurrent life sentences. He will not be eligible for parole until he is 91. Passing sentence on Friday, Judge John McMahon described McArthur\u2019s behaviour as \u201cpure evil\u201d and said he would have kept killing if he had not been apprehended by the police. McMahon recognized McArthur\u2019s guilty plea, but said it was highly unlikely he would ever be released on parole. \u201cAlthough Mr McArthur has taken responsibility of his actions, there has been no evidence of remorse,\u201d he said. McArthur, 67, pleaded guilty last week to the first-degree murders of Andrew Kinsman, Selim Esen, Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Mahmudi, Dean Lisowick, Skandaraj (Skanda) Navaratnam, Abdulbasir Faizi and Kirushnakumar Kanagaratnam. McArthur targeted men living on the margins of Canadian society, and their disappearances initially attracted little attention. \u201cAll of the victims were vulnerable individuals \u2026 the accused exploited their vulnerabilities, whether immigration concerns, mental health challenges, or leading secret double lives,\u201d said McMahon. The judge acknowledged the devastating loss suffered by families and friends. \u201cThis court cannot give them what they want most: to have their loved one back,\u201d he said. McArthur, a well-known figure in Toronto\u2019s gay bars, strangled and dismembered his victims. During a sentencing hearing last week, the court heard that he also staged photos of some of his victims after they died, posing their corpses in a fur coat and hat and placing cigars in their mouths. In submissions to the judge, assistant crown attorney Craig Harper said the term \u201cserial killer\u201d was \u201cwoefully inadequate to describe his moral blameworthiness \u2026 and heinousness of the offences\u201d. The crown also successfully requested that McArthur\u2019s previous conviction for assault in 2003 be included in sentencing consideration. \u201cThe certainty that Mr McArthur will never leave prison is a fit result,\u201d said Harper. McArthur\u2019s attorney, James Miglin, agreed that his crimes warranted the most serious consequences, but argued that the lack of even a \u201cfaint hope\u201d of parole for half a century was unnecessarily harsh, given McArthur\u2019s age and prior guilty plea. McArthur, a married father of two, left his wife in the 1990s and moved from Oshawa in Ontario to Toronto. His victims disappeared between 2010 and 2017. Most were of Middle Eastern or south Asian descent; several had struggled with addiction and homelessness. Most had frequented Toronto\u2019s Gay Village, but several of them were not openly gay. McArthur was arrested in January 2018. He was initially accused of killing six men and burying their remains in large flower planters at the home of a client where he stored tools for his landscaping business. More remains were later found in a ravine behind the house. McArthur declined to make any statement before the court. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with my counsel and I don\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d he said. McArthur\u2019s sentencing was also tempered by revelations in court that police had missed a signifiant opportunity to detain McArthur in 2016, after he was accused of attempting to strangle a man in his van, but released without charge.

One member said Kenneth Campbell, a local critic who wrote on Facebook that Berger should be \u201cexposed for the disruptive Zionist she is\u201d, was a member of the \u201cold guard\u201d.</p> <p>Another source said the constituencies in Liverpool had recently become dominated by the hard left and there had been a \u201cconcerted effort to root out those that were anti-Corbyn\u201d.</p> <p>Others insisted the moves against Berger were not motivated by antisemitism and accused the MP of consistently failing to represent the views of its members and to support the Labour party.</p> <p>The motion of no confidence in Berger, proposed and seconded by members Howard Sharp and Peter Cain, asked the local party to agree that \u201cWavertree CLP has no confidence in Luciana Berger as our representative in parliament\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cInstead of fighting for a Labour government, our MP is continually using the media to criticise the man we all want to be prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell, 80, who jointly tabled a second motion to oust Berger with his wife, Agnes, 75, has also previously shared a Facebook post that called the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is Jewish, \u201cutterly shameless\u201d and has written posts that allude to the media being controlled by \u201cZionist masters\u201d.</p> <p>Berger, often a critic of Corbyn, has faced persistent antisemitic abuse over the last decade, some of it from within her local party. She has been the target of online abuse and had a police escort at last year\u2019s Labour party conference after receiving death threats.</p> <p>On Friday the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was criticised for seeking a \u201cloyalty pledge\u201d from Berger.

      "bodyText": "A no-confidence motion in the Labour MP Luciana Berger has been withdrawn and a meeting to discuss her future has been cancelled after it emerged that one of her key opponents within the local party called her a \u201cdisruptive Zionist\u201d. The decision follows a heated row over the Wavertree MP\u2019s status in the party, with critics claiming she has been disloyal to Jeremy Corbyn and her defenders pointing to persistent antisemitic abuse. A source close to the Labour leadership said: \u201cIt was the right decision.\u201d It is understood that the decision was made by the Liverpool Wavertree party after considerable pressure from the central party and Corbyn\u2019s office. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, wrote to the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to ask her to suspend the Liverpool Wavertree party. He wrote: \u201cIt is clear to me that Luciana Berger is being bullied. This behaviour by her local party is intolerable. The actions of her constituency are not only threatening towards Luciana personally but are bringing our party into disrepute. \u201cI am therefore requesting that you take the necessary steps to suspend Liverpool Wavertree constituency Labour party (CLP).\u201d Earlier on Friday he defended Berger in the Commons, saying she had \u201cour solidarity, our support, as she battles the bullying and hatred from members of her own local party.\u201d He added: \u201cThey bring disgrace to the party I love.\u201d Members of the local party told the Guardian that evidence of antisemitism had undermined what some viewed as legitimate criticism of Berger. One member said Kenneth Campbell, a local critic who wrote on Facebook that Berger should be \u201cexposed for the disruptive Zionist she is\u201d, was a member of the \u201cold guard\u201d. Another source said the constituencies in Liverpool had recently become dominated by the hard left and there had been a \u201cconcerted effort to root out those that were anti-Corbyn\u201d. Others insisted the moves against Berger were not motivated by antisemitism and accused the MP of consistently failing to represent the views of its members and to support the Labour party. The motion of no confidence in Berger, proposed and seconded by members Howard Sharp and Peter Cain, asked the local party to agree that \u201cWavertree CLP has no confidence in Luciana Berger as our representative in parliament\u201d. It added: \u201cInstead of fighting for a Labour government, our MP is continually using the media to criticise the man we all want to be prime minister.\u201d Campbell, 80, who jointly tabled a second motion to oust Berger with his wife, Agnes, 75, has also previously shared a Facebook post that called the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is Jewish, \u201cutterly shameless\u201d and has written posts that allude to the media being controlled by \u201cZionist masters\u201d. Berger, often a critic of Corbyn, has faced persistent antisemitic abuse over the last decade, some of it from within her local party. She has been the target of online abuse and had a police escort at last year\u2019s Labour party conference after receiving death threats. On Friday the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was criticised for seeking a \u201cloyalty pledge\u201d from Berger. McDonnell said she should reject claims she supported a \u201cbreakaway party\u201d to show members she was \u201csticking with Labour\u201d. Chris Leslie, the MP for Nottingham East, who is another critic of Corbyn, said McDonnell\u2019s intervention was a mistake. \u201cI, like I think most Labour party members, am watching on with horror at what is happening,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cJohn McDonnell was on the radio this morning basically demanding an oath of loyalty from her to those who are attacking her. I\u2019ve never heard of such a ridiculous situation. He should never have allowed his allies to have gone after Luciana like that in the first place.\u201d Asked if he was thinking about quitting Labour, Leslie \u2013 who strongly objects to Corbyn\u2019s position on Brexit \u2013 replied: \u201cI\u2019ve said to you, my patience is wearing thin, like a lot of people.\u201d Votes of no confidence carry no official force within the Labour arty, but local activists could hold a \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d \u2013 a mechanism by which sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comersprior to a general election. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, called for calm, asking party members to show unity. He said: \u201cThis is just fodder for the rightwing press and to the Tories and we should not be having open public spats. If you disagree with each other there is no need for public confrontations. It is a broad church and we should seek to work in a comradely way.\u201d Berger responded to the motions of no confidence in her by saying she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Corbyn\u2019s \u201clack of response\u201d over the issue. In an appearance on ITV\u2019s Peston politics programme on Wednesday, she refused to rule out leaving the party, responding to repeated questions by saying: \u201cI\u2019m focused on Brexit, that\u2019s my responsibility as a constituency MP.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pep Guardiola was moved to use an expletive on live television when he suddenly became unsure of Benjamin Mendy\u2019s whereabouts on Friday afternoon. The Manchester City left-back posted his location on Instagram as being at Hong Kong international airport and, when this was put to Guardiola, whose press conference was being broadcast on Sky Sports, the manager signalled his confusion by swearing. \u201cHong Kong? Fuck \u2013 is he? He said he was going to Paris but Hong Kong \u2013 I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Guardiola in reference to where the Frenchman had gone after treatment in Spain. \u201cI have to understand Instagram. Really, I don\u2019t know. Yesterday he was in Barcelona.\u201d Asked if it would be OK if Mendy was in Hong Kong, Guardiola said: \u201cHong Kong, definitely not.\u201d Mendy responded by saying it was not true. \u201cI was just joking with my Uber driver, I don\u2019t want no problems Pep,\u201d he tweeted. This was in reference to the Instagram post, which was a video in which he included the driver. City confirmed Mendy was indeed in Spain but Guardiola may still be displeased given he has previously warned Mendy about his use of social media. Guardiola also responded to Aleksander Ceferin after Uefa\u2019s president claimed City lacked class for failing to attend a meeting this week regarding VAR. \u201cI respect what he says but I don\u2019t agree with him. Brian Kidd [Guardiola\u2019s assistant manager] was there \u2013 he was there in the meeting. On the Wednesday we had a game [at Everton] and that was more important plus the training sessions before. \u201cI had tickets to go but the Premier League decided to put the game at Everton then. So Mr Ceferin \u2013 we were not in that position [regarding what he claimed].\u201d Guardiola suggested Kevin De Bruyne may no longer be an automatic starter for City. The Belgian was a replacement at Everton, coming on to create Gabriel Jesus\u2019s late goal. Guardiola said this was because De Bruyne is still being eased back following injury: \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible [he might not start]. There are times when teammates are in better condition. In football what you have done in the past \u2013 you have to do in future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today and for all your comments. Have a good weekend. Here\u2019s a summary of the afternoon\u2019s main events: The no-confidence motion against Luciana Berger by her constituency party has been withdraw. Labour party deputy leader had branded the motion against Berger, who has been critical of Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism and been linked with leaving the party, \u201ca disgrace\u201d. A new Brexit party, supported by Nigel Farage, has been officially recognised by the Electoral Commission, the Telegraph reports. It says \u201cthe Brexit party\u201d claims it is set to win over thousands of Tory defectors. A Tory MP, Chris Chope, has condemned for blocking a bill which would have have allowed courts to issue protection orders if they thought a child was at risk of FGM. Among those who criticised Chope, who last year blocked a bill on upskirting, were the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and health secretary, Matt Hancock. Labour called for him to have the Tory whip withdrawn. The Irish premier, Leo Varadkar, has said he will not be negotiating Brexit when he meets Theresa May for dinner in Dublin this evening. He said they could \u201cshare perspectives\u201d but negotiations had to be conducted between the UK and EU. The former shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, has hinted he could Labour over dissatisfaction with its Brexit policy. Amid reports that \u201cat least\u201d six Labour MPs are preparing to resign the whip and form a centre group, Leslie said his \u201cpatience is wearing pretty thin\u201d. The controversial vote of no confidence against Luciana Berger, who has criticised Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism and been linked with leaving the party has been dropped my colleague Jessica Elgot says. In an interview with Talk Radio last month, Catherine Blaiklock, the leader of the new Brexit party said it wanted a no-deal Brexit although she rejected that expression, describing it as just being \u201ca normal country, just an independent nation\u201d. She said she\u2019d been called racist \u201ceven though I\u2019ve got a Jamaican husband, and two half, half, you know mixed race children\u201d. A new Brexit party, supported by Nigel Farage has been officially recognised by the Electoral Commission and is likely to win over thousands of Tory defectors, the Telegraph reports. The party is called ...The Brexit Party. It says it will field candidates in England, Wales, Scotland and Europe. The party leader is former Ukip candidate, Catherine Blaiklock, who the New European profiled her last month (it\u2019s worth reading in full): She is best-known for failing to win Great Yarmouth for UKIP in the 2017 general election despite an innovative campaign which saw her brandish a large photograph of her Jamaican husband at one hustings in an attempt to demonstrate that \u2019Kippers were not racist, later telling Vice \u201cI sleep with somebody who is black.\u201d Her recent return to the limelight has provided equally startling quotes, with Blaiklock telling the Sun that \u201cpeople feel treason has been committed\u201d in the fight against Brexit ... Blaiklock advised those on low income to heed the example of Sherpas in the Himalayas, who eat \u201cpractically nothing but boiled potatoes with a bit of salt and chilli on the side\u201d. The Telegraph says: Farage, the former Ukip leader who is supporting the party, said \u201cthe engine is running\u201d and he stood \u201cready for battle\u201d to fight the Tories and Labour of the European Parliament elections are held. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has joined the criticism of Tory MP Chris Chope for blocking the FGM bill (see 3.18pm). Labour has called for him to have the Tory whip withdrawn: Japan and South Korea, like the US - see 11.22am post - are hoping to extract better trade terms from the UK post-Brexit according to the FT and its chief political correspondent. A Tory MP who blocked a bill on upskirting has now done the same for one which would have allowed courts to issue protection orders if they thought a child was at risk of FGM. Chope has form for delaying bills by shouting \u201cobject\u201d during their second reading in the Commons, meaning they can not be put through to the next stage without debate and a vote. After the upskirting bill controversy, he claimed he backed the intent of the bill but objected to it because he does not support the principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading. It is an explanation Zac Goldsmith, who sponsored the FGM bill, is scornful of. The former shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, has hinted he could quit the party over dissatisfaction with its Brexit policy. Amid reports that \u201cat least\u201d six Labour MPs are preparing to resign the whip and form a centre group, Leslie said it was \u201cabsolutely understandable\u201d that some of his colleagues may feel they have been driven to the edge. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One programme: I have to be honest, my patience is wearing pretty thin with the Labour Party policy on Brexit. This is the big issue of the moment and it\u2019s going to affect not just trading relationships but percolate right through to the revenues that we have for our public services. If I want to avoid another decade of austerity I can\u2019t help but focus on what is happening on Brexit and what is the Labour Party\u2019s policy on Brexit and that is why... I\u2019ve got some serious worries about where the leadership are going having basically dropped all of that Labour Party conference policy commitment from September and apparently trying to airbrush the concept of a public vote, letting the public have the final say on this, from where we stand. Asked how close he is to leaving the party, Leslie said: Like a lot of people, party members who are resigning or thinking of giving up, do I understand that they are being driven to the edge? I do understand that, I think that is absolutely understandable. And I think the Labour leadership have absolutely got to address this right now. The former taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has suggested that a border poll on a united Ireland could happen as a result of Brexit. He told the BBC: I wouldn\u2019t say inevitable, but I do think you will see a border poll. I do think if the UK, which seems almost positive now, pull out of the EU, the issue then will not just be about whether there should be a united Ireland, people will also be reflecting do Northern Ireland want to be in the European Union or not? Now, Scotland might have a similar position in years to come. But I do see that being a factor that people who want to be in Europe will say a united Ireland is more attractive. Speaking in the Commons, Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson has condemned the no-confidence motion proposed by Luciana Berger\u2019s constituency party against the MP as disgraceful. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has insisted his dinner with the prime minister will not involve any negotiation on the terms of the Brexit deal. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to meet again to share perspectives on Brexit but, of course, not to engage in negotiations, as they can only be between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Varadkar, speaking in Belfast ahead of meetings with the five Stormont parties, before travelling back to Dublin to host Theresa May at Farmleigh House, said: I think everybody wants to avoid no deal, everybody wants to avoid a hard border and everybody wants to continue to have a very close political and economic relationship between Britain and Ireland no matter want happens. There is much more that unites us than divides us and time is running short and we need to get to an agreement really as soon as possible, and I\u2019ll be working very hard and redoubling my efforts, along with government, to do that. The EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has offered niceties but no real grounds for hope to the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, ahead of their meeting on Monday. The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is meeting his Irish counterpart, S\u00e9amus Woulfe, for talks this afternoon before a meeting between Theresa May and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to discuss the Brexit impasse on the Irish border. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said the only way Theresa May will pass her Brexit deal is if she agrees to Labour\u2019s five demands, otherwise a second referendum will be necessary. Labour\u2019s official position is that the option of a public vote is on the table but it has not outlined the events which would make it necessary. McDonnell also said that the no confidence vote Luciana Berger faces from the constituency party is because of concerns about disloyalty rather than her criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism. The shadow chancellor said it was because she had been associated with a breakaway party and urged her to state that she was not jumping ship. He added that if the no confidence was because of her antisemitism campaigning it would be \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. The government must rule out a no-deal Brexit to end the uncertainty that is gripping business and local government services, Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service has said. Kerslake also called for a second referendum. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership ratings have crashed to their worst level yet as a result of Brexit, according to a poll for the London Evening Standard. It found that his net Ipsos-MORI satisfaction ratings has dropped from a net minus 32% to 55% and just 17% of the public are satisfied with his performance. The Conservative MP, Ross Thomson, has said allegations that he groped men in the Commons bar on Tuesday night are \u201ccompletely false\u201d. On Wednesday, Scotland Yard confirmed that officers had been called to the Strangers\u2019 Bar after claims of \u201csexual touching\u201d but added that no formal complaint had been made. A cross-party group of 13 MEPs and 11MPs has complained to the BBC director-general, Tony Hall, claiming that Fiona Bruce misled viewers on Question Time on 25 January by saying there were \u201cquestions on both sides\u201d of the Brexit campaign in relation to their probity. Molly Scott Cato, Green party MEP for the south west, who coordinated the letter, said the broadcaster had fallen prey to \u201c false propaganda narratives\u201d. She said: To have suggested there is an equivalence in wrong doing between the Leave and Remain campaigns was totally inaccurate and misled millions of viewers. This false assertion came after both Leave campaigns were found to have acted illegally and just days before the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office slapped fines totalling \u00a3135,000 on Leave.EU and Brexiteer Arron Banks. The Remain campaign have never been accused of breaching electoral rules in this way. *This post was amended as it originally had the wrong date of the relevant edition of Question Time The Conservative MP, Ross Thomson, has said allegations that he groped men in the Commons bar on Tuesday night are \u201ccompletely false\u201d. On Wednesday, Scotland Yard confirmed that officers had been called to the Strangers\u2019 Bar after claims of \u201csexual touching\u201d but added that no formal complaint had been made. Here is the statement put out by Thomson on Twitter today: With the usual caveat about the unreliability of polls, the London Evening Standard reports that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership ratings have crashed to their worst level yet as a result of Brexit. The poll also found that: The proportion of the public satisfied with Corbyn\u2019s performance has dropped to 17% per cent \u2014 the lowest figure recorded by any Labour leader apart from Michael Foot. The proportion dissatisfied with the Labour leader has risen to 72%. Under half of Labour voters (44%) are happy with him. Conservative MEPs are under fire for hosting a controversial leader of the Swedish far-right, Business Insider reports. It obtained a picture of Conservative MEP for London, Syed Kamall, who chairs the parliament\u2019s European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, on a panel alongside Mattias Karlsson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats far-right political party. It says: The Sweden Democrats are a hugely controversial party which has its roots in neo-nazi movements of the 20th century and joined the ECR group alongside the UK Conservative Party in July last year. Karlsson is a Swedish MP and the Sweden Democrats leader in the Ricksdag having served as its overall leader from 2014 to 2015. In 2017 he penned an article titled Trump Is Right: Sweden\u2019s Embrace of Refugees Isn\u2019t Working, which argued that Muslim immigrants were chiefly to blame for a rise in crime in Sweden. Labour and the Lib Dems both criticised Conservative MEPs for their association with the Sweden Democrats but a spokesperson for the Conservative MEPs described the meeting as \u201croutine\u201d. Donald Trump is being urged to play hardball with the UK when it negotiates a trade deal with the US after leaving the EU, Huffington Post reports. It says the US Department of Trade asked industry what the president should extract from post-Brexit Britain and the answers from lobbyists for big firms included: Changing how NHS chiefs buy drugs to suit big US pharmaceutical companies. Britain scrapping its safety-first approach to safety and food standards. Law changes that would allow foreign companies to sue the British state. Removing protections for traditional British products. If you\u2019re still eating your breakfast, the idea of Jacob Rees-Mogg naked may not be one you want in your mind but the arch-Brexiteer has been challenged to take off his clothes to debate leaving the EU with a Cambridge academic. Dr Victoria Bateman, an economics fellow at the university, proffers the benefits of the European Union in the nude. She had the words \u201cBrexit leaves Britain naked\u201d written across her body as she was interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. She said: I invite Jacob Rees-Mogg to do a naked debate with me and we will get to the roots of this issue. Britain faces many, many problems right now from housing to the NHS, and the European Union is not the cause of those problems. She said she decided to talk about Brexit with nothing on to demonstrate that leaving the EU is the \u201cemperor\u2019s new clothes\u201d. Bateman said: For thousands of years men have controlled what women can do with their bodies, and women\u2019s bodies have been seen as something purely existing for sex and for babies. \u201cSo what is wrong with a modern day woman taking control of her body and using it to give voice to what is the most depressing political subject in Britain right now? The government must rule out a no-deal Brexit to end the uncertainty that is gripping business and local government services, a former head of the civil service has said. Bob Kerslake also called for a fresh referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, denying it would itself prolong the uncertainty even though it might take as long as a year to organise Lord Kerslake told BBC Radio 4 parliament had no alternative on the basis that MPs did not support leaving the EU without a deal and there was no majority in the House of Commons for any single form of Brexit. He said Where else do we go? A huge amount of quite unnecessary fear is being created among the public \u2026 The government can stop this now. In a foreword to a People\u2019s Vote campaign paper, the crossbench* peer also claimed diplomats would take years to negotiate Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, and accused Theresa May of preparing for a \u201cblindfold Brexit\u201d in which the substantive issues about the UK\u2019s future had not been confronted. He writes: On the central question of Brexit \u2013 how closely the UK will align with the EU on customs and rules \u2013 the political declaration merely says that there are \u2018a spectrum of different outcomes\u2019. That the country is being asked to embrace this uncertainty, or risk the disaster of a no-deal outcome, is extraordinary. *This was amended, as it originally incorrectly said Labour The shadow chancellor has been busy this morning. He was also on Sky News, where he claimed that the decision by Liverpool Wavertree constituency Labour party to subject MP Luciana Berger to a no confidence vote was unrelated to her criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism. McDonnell said: If people are saying \u2018look, we are expressing a vote of no confidence because Luciana has stood up and exposed anti-Semitism in our party\u2019, that would be completely wrong and, of course, we would say that is not right. But it looks as though there\u2019s other issues. It seems on social media, from what I\u2019ve seen, what\u2019s happened is Luciana has been associated in the media with a breakaway party. Some local party members, the media, have asked her to deny that. She hasn\u2019t been clear in that. So my advice really, on all of this, is for Luciana to just put this issue to bed. Say very clearly \u2018no, I\u2019m not supporting another party, I\u2019m not jumping ship\u2019. And for local party members to sit down with Luciana and actually say \u2018how can we support you? How can we work together in the future?\u2019 And then overcome the present difficulties. Berger, who is Jewish, has been highly critical of antisemitism within Labour and has faced a torrent of abuse from online trolls . She required a police escort at last year\u2019s Labour party conference after receiving death threats. There is some scepticism about McDonnell\u2019s take on reasons for the no confidence vote. Good morning, Andrew is off today and on Monday so I\u2019m stepping into his sizeable shoes for both days. Regulars will know that this blog attracts a lot of comments so if you want to get my attention it might be easiest to Tweet me. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said this morning that Theresa May must accept Labour\u2019s five demands to get her Brexit deal through or else a second referendum will be necessary Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: If Theresa May said \u2018I\u2019ll sign up to Labour\u2019s deal\u2019 and we went to parliament, I think we would have a secure parliamentary majority. But we\u2019re at that stage now where we\u2019re saying very clearly to everybody that people have looked over the edge of a no-deal Brexit and it could be catastrophic for our economy ...In the national interest we have got to come together to secure a compromise, and then if we can\u2019t do that, well yes, we have to go back to the people. Only yesterday, Labour sources confirmed that the party\u2019s official position continues to be that the option of a public vote is on the table but denied it would automatically move to back a second referendum if May rejected Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s offer of support for a revised Brexit deal,",

At the time I just said it made you think wether you want to carry on in football. I went in the local paper and put that to bed. It\u2019s a challenge for me with all the things that have happened in the last few weeks. You can see in the last few games, it\u2019s a challenge. But we\u2019re all up for that. It\u2019s a challenge we have to face head on. My mind has been back on football, as it\u2019s got to be. I steer the ship, but I have to say the boys and the staff have been great to me. That does matter when you\u2019re a team off the field as well as on it. You could see the response at Arsenal from the players, probably the best away performance. And the Bournemouth game was very good from our point of view, football wise.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Can Cardiff move on?</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to. You never forget things like this \u2013 you can\u2019t always put it out of your mind \u2013 but fortunately for me the players have grasped that in their performances. And now we have 13 Cup finals in a row. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Warnock also said that he has been impressed by the way Cardiff fans and the wider football community has responded to the distressing news concerning Sala. </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I think I\u2019ve seen it all in football, our fans keep surprising me every week now. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that would surprise me with them. And the Arsenal fans, Bournemouth fans, fans from clubs all over.

I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to Ken (Choo, chief executive) and Mehmet (Dalman, chairman), they are keeping everything away from me.

We have prepared videos for every player about his positive things and his negative things and to show them what we are demanding more and to show them what was good until now. A little bit of feedback is very important for them, and therefore we need a lot of time, but I think they appreciate that and they need that to make their next step and therefore it is perfect to go there and have time together. It is also partly about the better weather conditions when you want to train tactical things on the pitch, because then you can rest for two or three minutes and you can explain more without catching a cold, and you can work in a good atmosphere. I hope that we take a good result on the weekend and then we can go there with a very good atmosphere and that helps us a lot to be critical and also positive in looking forward for the next exercises.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not overly convinced it\u2019s a good thing to take players outside of their normal training/playing conditions but I\u2019m no expert.

I\u2019ve supported and followed United for many years and I did have a clear view on what I thought my opinion would be. You get a different view on players but we\u2019re not too far away from when I came.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>One player who has committed his future to the club is Phil Jones. The defender has signed a new deal until at least 2023.</strong> Jones has featured in every match since Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s arrival and the caretaker manager sees the defender as a key force within the group. Solskj\u00e6r said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Phil knows what it takes to be a Manchester United player, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League and is now one of the senior players within the team. He is coming up to his 27th birthday and entering into his prime years as a centre half. We are delighted Phil has committed his future to the club.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Last week Anthony Martial signed a new contract until at least 2024, while Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay all agreed new deals earlier this season. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/08/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-manchester-united-vision\">Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r says he has long-term \u2018vision\u2019 for Manchester United</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-08T10:31:19.740Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c5d544ee4b00ef6acc69d87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-08T10:09:40.394Z\">10.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Premier League title race has heated up in the past fortnight, with Liverpool\u2019s 1-1 draws against Leicester and West Ham giving Manchester City the chance to knock them off top spot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/06/everton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">with their 2-0 midweek victory</a> over Everton. </strong>But J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side can leapfrog City again if they beat Bournemouth at home tomorrow, meaning Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, who have played a game more than Liverpool, will have to beat Chelsea at the Etihad to snatch top spot away again on Sunday. It\u2019s a huge game \u2013 let\u2019s not forget that Chelsea were the first team to beat City in the league this season. Meanwhile, Spurs, who have slowly crept up to within five points of City, play Leicester at Wembley. The Foxes are a dangerous opponent for teams at the top, having beaten City at home and drawn with Liverpool away. They generally raise their game against the top six.

      "bodyText": "Right, I\u2019m going to wrap things up now. And given that it is 5pm, I\u2019ll leave you with The Fiver, featuring a psychedelic England kit. Have a good weekend: The Football League has released a statement on its investigation into the Leeds v Derby spying incident. It says that it needs to gather more evidence before arriving at a judgment on the matter. At its meeting on Friday afternoon, the EFL Board (*excluding representatives of the Championship) considered the matter of the incident in the vicinity of Derby County\u2019s training ground on Thursday, January 10. Following a comprehensive review of all available evidence, it was determined that there remain a number of areas that require further exploration and clarification and these investigations will take place at the earliest opportunity. An update on this matter will be provided following receipt and analysis of those subsequent enquiries and until this point no further comment will be made. *Championship Directors were not involved in this discussion as a result of potential conflicts of interest. It\u2019s incredible how Kevin De Bruyne has been reduced to a squad-player role at Manchester City since returning in mid-December. I know he has suffered with injury but it says much about the wealth of options available to Pep Guardiola that the Belgian has been able to be brought back into the action so slowly. Here\u2019s Pep talking about De Bruyne\u2019s role: It\u2019s quite possible [he does not play]. Every player knows it\u2019s quite possible to play and quite possible not to. It is what it is. At the end we judge the players for who they are but they are to perform. There are moments when they are not in better condition, when teammates are in better condition than them. In football what you have done is in the past. You have to do it again. We try to control the players. He played the last two games. I preferred (he played) for a few minutes at Everton. He went out for five mins, plus extra time, and he was incredible - giving the assist, the behaviour, the attitude, everything. I want him to sustain that for a long time. Sometimes when you\u2019re out a long time injured you need [to be careful] a bit there. I don\u2019t want him playing game, game, game. Some fun and games from the Scottish Premiership now. The Rangers defender Connor Goldson has told Aberdeen they should have expected celebrations from the away dressing room after plastering photographs of their recent Hampden win along the Pittodrie corridors. Goldson claims the Rangers players were fired up by seeing about 20 photographs from the Dons\u2019 Scottish League Cup semi-final win. Rangers had not beaten Aberdeen in three previous meetings this season before winning 4-2 on Wednesday. Witnesses in the tunnel claimed Dons boss Derek McInnes banged on the dressing room door to ask the visiting players to tone down their celebrations before exchanging words with Rangers manager Steven Gerrard. Goldson said: I didn\u2019t see him pop his head in, I don\u2019t think he came into our changing room. But they celebrated massively when they got a point against us earlier in the season. Walking into their stadium the other day, they put pictures from the semi-final on the wall. So why can\u2019t we celebrate when we win a game of football? We are obviously going to. You would do it against any team that we play against, any team would do it to us if they win. It\u2019s just what happens. We all noticed it walking in. You couldn\u2019t not notice it. They put them up in about 20 picture frames walking down the corridor. It was noticed, it was spoken about and it just gave us more motivation going into the game. Neil Warnock has paid tribute to Emiliano Sala at his Cardiff press conference after a body recovered from the Channel was identified as that of the Argentinian footballer. Warnock felt the news would bring peace to the family, whilst leading tributes to what he called \u2018a scruffy type of player that for me would score 10 to 15 goals every year at the top level and work hard as a team player. Here\u2019s the video: J\u00fcrgen Klopp has appealed for a big atmosphere at Anfield for the Bournemouth match. He wants Liverpool fans to get into the ground early \u201cand shout their souls on to the pitch\u201d as his side aim to grab top spot back off Manchester City. We have to show on the pitch we are ready to fight, and the people on the stand have to show they are ready to fight as well. I\u2019ve never left in doubt how much I appreciate the support and believe in the help. We have to fight but then our crowd is always there. I\u2019m not sure if I experienced yet that the supporters are there early \u2013 it\u2019s completely different to Germany, a lot of them are one and a half hours there before. I\u2019m long enough here to be used to it, but of course it would be nice. The good thing is all of us know what to do - the players on the pitch and the people in the stand. I don\u2019t know if I have to ask for it but whoever wants us to succeed in this game and wants to help \u2026 don\u2019t have the English impression for it but it\u2019s like shouting your soul on to the pitch, that\u2019s how we say it in German. And here\u2019s the team news for Saturday\u2019s game at Anfield: Paul Scholes is closing in on becoming Oldham Athletic manager after his candidacy was approved by the English Football League. The 44-year-old is now expected to take up his first management role at the Greater Manchester club, it is understood. Scholes required clearance due to his 10% ownership of Salford City, where Scholes is part of the Class of 92 who have a collective 60% stake in the club, the other members being Gary and Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. As Salford currently play in the fifth tier of domestic football the EFL had to confirm Scholes\u2019s appointment as manager of League Two Oldham would not be a potential conflict of interest. The Latics have been without a permanent manager since Frankie Bunn was sacked on 28 January. Pete Wild is the current caretaker manager. John Barnes has written an opinion piece on Liam Neeson. This is what he thinks: Newcastle travel to Molineux on Monday evening with record-signing Miguel Alm\u00edron available for selection. Rafael Ben\u00edtez has been impressed by the attitude of the young striker but isn\u2019t sure how he will cope when faced with reducers from strapping lads such as Conor Coady, Ryan Bennett and Willy Boly. He is fine, he is training okay, he is fit, he has good stamina and pace. He is quite mobile, quite dynamic. Now the question mark is what will happen with the physicality of the Premier League? What\u2019s the difference between the MLS and the Premier League? All these things we know but we will see how he copes with that but at the moment he is okay with the training sessions. Miguel is a nice lad, he\u2019s a worker and he\u2019s training well. He\u2019s talked with the nutritionist already so he\u2019s professional. He can talk English and Spanish so in terms of what we want from him on the pitch it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a question of putting him on the pitch and seeing how he copes with the tackles. Arsenal haven\u2019t won away in the league since November and will need to beat the Premier League\u2019s bottom club Huddersfield if they are to stay in contention for a top-four finish. Unai Emery may have a selection headache in defence, though, having suffered a spate of injuries recently. Flamengo have tweeted a message that simply says the club is in mourning after 10 people were killed and at least three injured in a fire at the training centre of the Rio de Janeiro football club. Here is the full report on the tragic events that unfolded overnight in Brazil: Leicester manager Claude Puel has dismissed suggestions of a rift with Jamie Vardy. The striker was filmed apparently upset that Puel was speaking to Paul Pogba on the pitch after the 1-0 defeat by Manchester United last weekend but Puel insists everythins hunky-dory: He said: I have a good relationship with him. We know Jamie \u2013 after he lost he is angry, it\u2019s normal for a player. If I thought one of my players was disrespectful to me or the club there would be a sanction but that was not the case. Mauricio Pochettino is not expecting Spurs to play in the new White Hart Lane before the season ends. My gut feeling [is that] it will be tough but I hope and I wish to be in the new stadium. Saturday will be another difficult day for Cardiff and their supporters after Thursday\u2019s confirmation that Emiliano Sala was killed in a plane crash, writes Niall McVeigh. Cardiff have, to their immense credit, maintained their on-field focus as the tragedy has unfolded around them. Victory over Southampton would see Cardiff climb above their hosts and out of the bottom three, even if the result may still feel secondary to Neil Warnock and his players. Claude Puel seems to go into every match as Leicester manager under pressure. He was booed by fans during the 1-0 home defeat by Manchester United, which prompted Ben Chilwell to call for patience from Foxes fans. They would probably be more patient if their team stopped conceding goals early in games. In the five matches since Leicester last won (1-0 at Everton on 1 January), his team have conceded in the 9th, 3rd, 4th, 11th, and 10th minutes. We know we need more consistency in our game, especially at the beginning. We have conceded too many early goals. Too many times we are chasing the game. If we look at our game against Manchester United, there was little between the two teams. Puel may be tempted to start Youri Tielemans in Marc Albrighton\u2019s absence: We will see [if he can start against Spurs]. I haven\u2019t made my decision yet. He has worked hard in training.\u201d\u201cWe have a difficult schedule at the moment but it\u2019s a good challenge for my players. Sky Sport\u2019s Yellow Ticker of Doom suggests \u201cPAUL SCHOLES EXPECTED TO TAKE CHARGE OF OLDHAM IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS \u2026\u201d which would be an interesting first step into league management for the former England midfielder. Marco Silva takes his out-of-sorts Everton side to his old club Watford this weekend. He says he\u2019s not too fussed about the welcome he\u2019ll receive from Hornets fans \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m ready for everything and my job is to make my players also ready\u201d \u2013 but could clearly do with a victory to put a listing season back on something approaching an even keel. There has been plenty of reason for cheer at Old Trafford today, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r named manager of the month, Marcus Rashford named player of the month and Phil Jones signing a new long-term contract. Both Rashford and Jones seem likely to start against struggling Fulham on Saturday. Some bad news for Leicester City: Marc Albrighton will require surgery on his troublesome hamstring and could miss the rest of the season. \u201cHe will perhaps not be available before the end of the season,\u201d is manager Claude Puel\u2019s assessment. Middlesbrough manager Tony Pulis has been fulsome in his praise of Leeds\u2019s Marcelo Bielsa ahead of their 5th v 2nd Championship meeting on Saturday: I think he\u2019s been a breath of fresh air, the way they play and the way they go about things. He\u2019s interesting, he\u2019s different. And Bielsa returned the favour towards Pulis\u2019s side: If I had to choose which was the hardest game we\u2019ve played so far, with frictions and the one that presented the most physical challenges - I would say it was the game against Middlesbrough. Here\u2019s a little more on the curious case of Benjamin Mendy, who may or may not be somewhere other than Paris, where Guardiola believed his injured left-back to be. Earlier, Guardiola was bemused by suggestions Mendy might be in Hong Kong. Mendy tagged himself at Hong Kong International Airport on his Instagram story on Friday morning. Guardiola said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know it. What? Fuck! I\u2019ll have to install Instagram. He said he was going to Paris but Hong Kong is far away. Yesterday he was in Barcelona. It will definitely not be OK if he is in Hong Kong.\u201d Mendy has since been on Twitter to say that tagging himself in Hong Kong was all just a big laugh. It was just joking with my uber driver I dont want no problems Pep. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has emerged at Melwood for his Liverpool press conference. I haven\u2019t seen pictorial evidence of this yet so I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s wearing a flamboyant sweater or not in an attempt at sartorial oneupmanship on Pep. Our man on Merseyside, Andy Hunter, was there for the press conference. Here\u2019s what Klopp had to say: All I want to be able to say at the end of the season is that we gave everything. You can not do more. The boys did outstandingly well so far.\u201d Klopp also had positive news about Joe Gomes and Trent Alexander-Arnold: Joe will be four to six weeks before he can play. Trent trained yesterday for the first time and didn\u2019t mention any issues. We need to see.\u201d Klopp confirmed that Henderson trained yesterday too. Wijnaldum is in training and Lovren is out. Pep Guardiola is showing no signs of title-race nerves given his bold choice of attire for his press conference. He\u2019s turned up wearing an outrageous multicoloured striped jumper that looks like it\u2019s been plucked from the year 1976. It the busiest sweater you\u2019ll see this year. He\u2019s also just dropped the F-bomb when asked if he knew Benjamin Mendy was in Hong Kong and not Paris, recovering from a knee injury. He says he shouldn\u2019t be there. I didn\u2019t know it. What? Fuck! I\u2019ll have to install Instagram. On the subject of Chelsea, he\u2019s asked why he thinks they will be such difficult opponents when they haven\u2019t been playing well of late: I have to figure out what the manager wants to do. I see Chelsea and I can understand what they want to do. When you see the team and the players they have and the midfield players they have and the striker, the best players in the world \u2026 I have a lot of respect [for them]. The game on Sunday is a final for us. I want to feel like it\u2019s a final for us. On Higu\u00e1in: He has incredible moments \u2026 he doesn\u2019t need much to score a goal. He has incredible experience. He\u2019s an exceptional striker. And let\u2019s zoom over to south-west London now, where Maurizio Sarri has been talking about how his Chelsea side are now only in the running for a top-four place \u2013 he sounds a bit negative and says his team is quite some distance behind Manchester City and need money or \u201chard work\u201d to bridge the gap. At the moment in my opinion Manchester City are the best team in Europe. We have to work. Guardiola is in his third season. We need to work or we need to be more competitive in the market. We have to try to reduce the gap. On Hazard\u2019s future: I speak every day with Eden but I speak about hi position on the pitch. I will be really very happy with him if he wants to stay. Because you now very well that in my opinion he is the best in Europe. But it\u2019s up to him, I think. I want to see him happy. And so he has to decide. Mauricio Pochettino has been talking about being spotted at a posh London restaurant with David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane. He\u2019s asked if he had a nice night out? Yes, very good. Very good company. I was with Jesus [Perez, his assistant] and another person. We met by coincidence with you know [David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane]. And that is history. Only we say hello. We met by coincidence there. They came to say hello and we spoke for two minutes. He denies having exited via the kitchen and says it has been made into something bigger than what it really is by sections of the media. He doesn\u2019t look all that comfortable talking about it, mind. On the subject of whether Spurs are back in the title race he says: The competition is so tough. I think [Liverpool] are doing a great job and are building to win [the Premier League]. And are Liverpool showing signs of nerves? No, the Premier League is tough. They are suffering similar to us with injuries and it\u2019s not easy to stay at the same level. It is tough for every single club. No doubt Liverpool will be there until the end. And I hope we will be too. We are there third in the table. It will be tough on Sunday against Leicester, \u2013 they have good players. We have to win on Sunday to be involved till the end. We should hear from Mauricio Pochettino shortly, who will no doubt be asked about his Tottenham team suddenly popping up in the title race again having previously fallen away. Expect questions about his future at the club too after pictures emerged of him having a meal with Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham, who used to play for Real Madrid you know. While we wait for Poch, here\u2019s an injury update from Spurs. It appears that Dele Alli and Harry Kane are stepping up their recoveries while Eric Dier is out with a virus and Vincent Janssen is out with a knee injury. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r just can\u2019t stop winning. He\u2019s been named Premier League manager of the month for January. Solskj\u00e6r has won nine of his first 10 matches in charge in all competitions, with United securing 10 of the 12 Premier League points available last month. Solskj\u00e6r won the award ahead of Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl and Burnley\u2019s Sean Dyche. It\u2019s the first time a Manchester United manager has been named manager of the month since Alex Ferguson way back in October 2012. Who wants a miracle? Who needs a drink? Who ran the world? It\u2019s lunch time, so get quizzical with Paul Campbell: The first of our Premier League match previews has just gone live. Get your fill of Fulham v Manchester United team news here: There\u2019s a huge game in the Championship this weekend too, when fifth-placed Middlesbrough take on second-placed Leeds. The gap between the two clubs stands at seven points but with Boro having a game in hand, there\u2019s a great opportunity for Middlesbrough to put the defeat by Newport County behind them and close in on an automatic promotion place. Leeds\u2019 form has not been great of late, either. Boro manager Tony Pulis says he has taken his players to task since the FA Cup defeat. One imagines it was an interesting chat he had with them. I\u2019ve told the players the fans have the right to criticise you. They have the right to say what they want so long as it is done in the right manner. They have travelled 12 hours and stood in the rain for two hours on an open terrace watching their team get beat. I\u2019ve had a chat with the players yesterday and we\u2019ve sorted one or two things out. As I said, we\u2019ve sorted one or two things out. Huddersfield Town are 13 points off safety with 13 games to play but Terriers goalkeeper Jonas Lossl is still dreaming of staying up: I laugh a little bit because I still believe. Don\u2019t write us off yet, we still have a chance and we will go 100% for that. The new manager has come in with a big bunch of energy, which has affected the team somehow. I think there\u2019s a good spirit, definitely. Everybody\u2019s together in this project of keeping us up right now. I haven\u2019t experienced before fans being this loyal. They have shown immense character all the way through. My feeling is the fans feel the same as I do. We cherish the games in the Premier League. We\u2019re going to play a fantastic game now and everybody I think is going to enjoy that, playing against Arsenal as Huddersfield.\u201d Some lunchtime reading for you now. The Guardian\u2019s in-house tactics guru, Jonathan Wilson, has been pondering how best Chelsea should approach the game against Manchester City on Sunday. Here\u2019s a taster: Perhaps most telling is the fact that Chelsea do not have to press high to win games. Sarri is notably intransigent, insisting on trying to play his way whatever the circumstances but this, surely, is an occasion for compromise. Certainly he cannot risk allowing City the sort of freedom they had in the first 20 minutes of the meeting at Stamford Bridge when Fernandinho overwhelmed Jorginho \u2013 and may also recall that when his Napoli lost 2-1 at the Etihad in 2017, it was City\u2019s opening blitz that did for them. You can read the full piece here: Neil Warnock has been speaking to the press before Cardiff\u2019s match against Southampton and his focus was understandably on Emiliano Sala, whose body was recovered from the Channel on Thursday evening. He confirmed that Cardiff will hold a minute\u2019s silence against Southampton. It brings the family peace, offers them comfort. I think we\u2019ve got to pay our respects with the situation now coming to an end, regarding Emiliano. We\u2019ll wear black armbands and have a minute\u2019s silence. I\u2019m sure the Southampton fans will want that as well. Warnock is asked again if Sala\u2019s death has made him consider his position at Cardiff. I think that was a little bit over the top. At the time I just said it made you think wether you want to carry on in football. I went in the local paper and put that to bed. It\u2019s a challenge for me with all the things that have happened in the last few weeks. You can see in the last few games, it\u2019s a challenge. But we\u2019re all up for that. It\u2019s a challenge we have to face head on. My mind has been back on football, as it\u2019s got to be. I steer the ship, but I have to say the boys and the staff have been great to me. That does matter when you\u2019re a team off the field as well as on it. You could see the response at Arsenal from the players, probably the best away performance. And the Bournemouth game was very good from our point of view, football wise. Can Cardiff move on? We have to. You never forget things like this \u2013 you can\u2019t always put it out of your mind \u2013 but fortunately for me the players have grasped that in their performances. And now we have 13 Cup finals in a row. Warnock also said that he has been impressed by the way Cardiff fans and the wider football community has responded to the distressing news concerning Sala. When I think I\u2019ve seen it all in football, our fans keep surprising me every week now. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that would surprise me with them. And the Arsenal fans, Bournemouth fans, fans from clubs all over. When something like this happens it brings all the football family together. It shows that everybody is thinking on the same wavelength and it\u2019s a loss to everyone in football. Warnock was also asked about the dispute between Nantes and Cardiff over the first instalment of the fee for Sala. The least of my worries is the record signing, finance does not come into it from my point of view. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to Ken (Choo, chief executive) and Mehmet (Dalman, chairman), they are keeping everything away from me. Off the field they are dealing with all that, and that\u2019s the way to move forward. I\u2019ve got enough on my plate dealing with the football on the field. Are warm-weather training camps a good or a bad thing? Southampton manager Ralph Hassenhutl is a big fan and plans to take his team on one after the relegation battle with Cardiff this weekend. What we now try to do is to use this time for hard work and to get perfectly prepared for the last two or three months that we have to go. We have prepared videos for every player about his positive things and his negative things and to show them what we are demanding more and to show them what was good until now. A little bit of feedback is very important for them, and therefore we need a lot of time, but I think they appreciate that and they need that to make their next step and therefore it is perfect to go there and have time together. It is also partly about the better weather conditions when you want to train tactical things on the pitch, because then you can rest for two or three minutes and you can explain more without catching a cold, and you can work in a good atmosphere. I hope that we take a good result on the weekend and then we can go there with a very good atmosphere and that helps us a lot to be critical and also positive in looking forward for the next exercises. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not overly convinced it\u2019s a good thing to take players outside of their normal training/playing conditions but I\u2019m no expert. I also think if a team is readying itself for a relegation battle or title challenge it\u2019s good to stay local and get a sense of the feeling among supporters to help forge a bond. Mind you, a bit of sun does do wonders for one\u2019s mood. The weather\u2019s slate-grey bleak in most of Britain today. Jefferson Lerma is an injury doubt for Bournemouth\u2019s match against Liverpool. The midfielder, who has been nursing an ankle problem in recent weeks, will undergo a late fitness test ahead of the trip to Anfield. Eddie Howe\u2019s side have never won at Anfield but the Cherries manager says he is not going to let that record affect his side. These things have always faced us before. In the Premier League every game when we first came into the league was a case of rewriting history and proving we could do things for the first time. I think we tend to look at these things as a nice thing to do, to try and write new history for the club all the time. Winning at Anfield is something we would love to do. No team has done it for a long period of time in the Premier League which goes to show how consistent Liverpool have been. Tim Woods writes: \u201cLiverpool \u2018good at football\u2019? Haven\u2019t you heard the latest news? Having drawn two games, we are now officially bottlers with nerves of cotton wool, Van Dijk is a fraud and City have basically won the league due to the new rule about going back on top by goal difference. It\u2019s all over basically and Klopp (who has never won anything) has been found out again. Please correct your blog accordingly.\u201d Careful now Tim, such emotionally-charged missives are evidence of title-race nerves these days, so it seems. Koppites are supposed to be sat in the lotus position doing Om mantra chants to bring the title home aren\u2019t they? Brighton manager Chris Hughton has been full of praise for Peter Crouch before his side take on Burnley at the Amex Stadium on Saturday. The 38-year-old was at Spurs when Hughton was a coach there quite some time ago now. He\u2019s a player I knew very well in my years as a coach at Tottenham and him being a young player coming through my group. On a personal note I\u2019m delighted to see him playing at the top level for as long as possible. He\u2019s a good lad and you can\u2019t play until that age unless you are dedicated to what you do. I think he\u2019s very good for our game, I think he\u2019s a brilliant ambassador for our game. It will be nice to see him, hopefully he doesn\u2019t play too well against us. Nantes have announced that they will retire the No9 shirt in memory of Emiliano Sala. The club wrote on Twitter: \u201cBecause Emiliano Sala will forever be part of the legends that have written the great story of FC Nantes, the number 9 he has worn has been retired.\u201d Here is the story on the dreadful news that 10 people have been killed after a fire broke out at Flamengo\u2019s training ground. There is some deeply distressing news coming out of Brazil, where Reuters report that a fire at the training centre of Flamengo, in Rio, has killed 10 people and injured at least three. The Brazilian club\u2019s training ground was redeveloped only two months ago. Liverpool aren\u2019t just good at football you know, they\u2019re also record-breakers at making a pre-tax profit: Liverpool broke the world record for the biggest pre-tax profit made by a football club during the 2017-18 financial year, the club\u2019s latest accounts have revealed. Champions League qualification, progress to the final in Kiev and the \u00a3142m sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona were instrumental in producing a pre-tax profit of \u00a3125m, eclipsing the \u00a392.5m made by Leicester City in 2016-17. You can read more on that story here: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s transformative powers at Manchester United can, incredibly, lift the club back into the top four on Saturday. With Chelsea playing on Sunday, if United beat Fulham at Craven Cottage in Saturday\u2019s early kick-off, they will move a point above Chelsea. Solskj\u00e6r has been speaking this morning about his good work and the future of the club. A little nudge, perhaps, in Ed Woodward\u2019s ribs to remind him that he would be prepared to stick around for a while longer: Every day I feel that I do help the club and put my stamp on it. But decisions sometimes on the future of players are not down to me. It\u2019s the players, do they want to stay or move on but we have a vision and picture of how we want to look in a few years. We have to think long term and also short term and I\u2019ve got a picture of what this Manchester United team should look like in a couple of years. I put my views to Ed and the club. I\u2019ve supported and followed United for many years and I did have a clear view on what I thought my opinion would be. You get a different view on players but we\u2019re not too far away from when I came. One player who has committed his future to the club is Phil Jones. The defender has signed a new deal until at least 2023. Jones has featured in every match since Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s arrival and the caretaker manager sees the defender as a key force within the group. Solskj\u00e6r said: Phil knows what it takes to be a Manchester United player, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League and is now one of the senior players within the team. He is coming up to his 27th birthday and entering into his prime years as a centre half. We are delighted Phil has committed his future to the club. Last week Anthony Martial signed a new contract until at least 2024, while Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay all agreed new deals earlier this season. The Premier League title race has heated up in the past fortnight, with Liverpool\u2019s 1-1 draws against Leicester and West Ham giving Manchester City the chance to knock them off top spot with their 2-0 midweek victory over Everton. But J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side can leapfrog City again if they beat Bournemouth at home tomorrow, meaning Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, who have played a game more than Liverpool, will have to beat Chelsea at the Etihad to snatch top spot away again on Sunday. It\u2019s a huge game \u2013 let\u2019s not forget that Chelsea were the first team to beat City in the league this season. Meanwhile, Spurs, who have slowly crept up to within five points of City, play Leicester at Wembley. The Foxes are a dangerous opponent for teams at the top, having beaten City at home and drawn with Liverpool away. They generally raise their game against the top six. For a full rundown of what to look out for in the Premier League this season, have a read of this: Welcome to the Friday football blog. First to the desperately sad news that Emiliano Sala\u2019s body has been recovered from the plane that came down in the Channel on 21 January that was taking the player from Nantes to his new club Cardiff City. \u201cThe body brought to Portland port has been formally identified by HM coroner for Dorset as that of professional footballer Emiliano Sala,\u201d Dorset police said. \u201cThe families of Mr Sala and the pilot David Ibbotson have been updated with this news and will continue to be supported by specially trained family liaison officers.\u201d Around the world tributes have been paid to Sala and in France, where the striker made a name for himself with Nantes, all Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 games will be marked with a minute\u2019s applause for the player. The Ligue de Football Professionnel said: \u201cEmiliano Sala has left the memory of an endearing man and a hard-working forward in all the clubs where he has evolved.\u201d Cardiff City said: \u201cWe offer our most heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the family of Emiliano. He and David will forever remain in our thoughts.\u201d In Argentina, Sala\u2019s home nation, president Mauricio Macri, who had joined calls for the search for the pair to be resumed after it was called off, sent his condolences to Sala\u2019s family on Twitter, saying: \u201cWe are with you,\u201d while Diego Maradona said: \u201cI am very sorry about this sad news. Many of us kept a glimmer of hope for you, Emiliano.\u201d Gabriel Batistuta tweeted: \u201c\u201cWhat sadness, this is the worst news. Rest in peace warrior.\u201d David Mearns, the shipwreck expert who led a private search for the plane, tweeted: \u201cRest in peace Emiliano. I was glad to provide some small comfort to \u2026 the whole Sala family during the past two weeks, but my heart goes out to the family and friends of David Ibbotson, whose loss is the same.\u201d Fifa said in a statement: \u201cFifa and the whole football community are deeply saddened about the death of Emiliano Sala. Fifa and its president Gianni Infantino would like to extend their sincerest condolences to his friends and family. Our thoughts are also with the family of pilot David Ibbotson.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>We are disappointed but sadly unsurprised by the findings of the Campaign to Protect Rural England\u2019s research (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/england-national-parks-out-of-reach-for-poorer-people-study\" title=\"\">National parks are out of bounds for England\u2019s poorest people, study finds</a>, 4 February). As a charity we have long dedicated ourselves to overcoming the obstacles the most marginalised in society face in getting into the great outdoors.</p> <p>The fact is, it is those from marginalised communities who stand to gain so much from the national parks. The benefits of the national parks to personal health and wellbeing are well evidenced in our conversations with those communities. But for too many they remain out of reach.</p> <p>In 2018 we released <a href=\"https://www.cnp.org.uk/transport-research-fullreport\" title=\"\">National Parks For All: Making Car-Free Travel Easier</a>, calling for urgent improvements to ensure that everyone can access and enjoy the parks. We want to see national park authorities play a much stronger role in improving transport provision in the parks. We are also calling for \u201csmarter travel\u201d pilots to test joined-up sustainable transport options and new types of on-demand, app-based transport services in the parks. Such services are becoming increasingly common in urban areas but too little is being done to support their roll-out to rural areas.</p> <p>As well as allowing people who do not have access to a car to visit more easily, improving the options for car-free travel will help to reduce the high volumes of traffic that currently damage the beauty and tranquillity of too many parts of the parks.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the working class protested for their right of access to the countryside, culminating in the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/97\" title=\"\">National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949</a>. What better way of honouring the legacy of those pioneers than taking action to ensure that national parks really are there for everyone to enjoy.<br><strong>Janette Ward</strong><br><em>Chair of Campaign for National Parks</em></p> <p>\u2022 The answer to access to green space is to bring it to where people live. The government\u2019s national capital committee\u2019s recommendation that there should be 250,000 hectares of new community woodlands around our towns and cities is estimated to generate economic benefit of \u00a3500m per annum.</p> <p>We know it works thanks to the success of new green space close to people pioneered by the Forestry Commission, England\u2019s Community Forests, National Forest and Woodland Trust, among many others.</p> <p>As a prime example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/apr/22/dream-jaume-plensa-st-helens\" title=\"\">Jaume Plensa\u2019s monumental statue Dream</a> crowns the restoration to open access woodland of the Sutton Manor Colliery spoil heap in the north-west. Overlooking the M62 and passed by thousands of motorists daily, it is located in St Helens, one of the deprived communities cited in the study.<br><strong>Roderick Leslie</strong><br><em>Former chief executive</em><em>, Forest Enterprise England</em></p> <p>\u2022 Our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty are wonderful assets that should be accessible to everyone, not least for the health and wellbeing benefits they bring. But with the majority of us now living in towns and cities, we also desperately need to bring these benefits to people in their everyday lives.</p> <p>People living close to green spaces are more likely to meet recommended daily activity levels, and recent <a href=\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-with-us/paving-the-way/new-parks-and-green-spaces-report.aspx\" title=\"\">Ramblers research</a> found that 98% of us think walking in green spaces improves our mental health. If we can make it easier and more appealing for people to go about their everyday lives on foot, we not only help them to live healthier lives, but also help tackle some of society\u2019s biggest challenges, from rising levels of inactivity and obesity to social isolation and air pollution.</p> <p>Our Britain\u2019s Best Walking Neighbourhood <a href=\"https://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-with-us/britains-best-walking-neighbourhood-award.aspx\" title=\"\">award</a> celebrates the places doing the most to give their communities access to quality green space and green routes. We hope it will also prompt councils and developers across Britain to make green, walkable neighbourhoods a priority.</p> <p>Enabling everyone to get close to nature where they live could also be the first step for many urban dwellers to explore more of our beautiful landscapes.<br><strong>Gemma Cantelo</strong><br><em>Head of policy </em><em>and advocacy, Ramblers</em></p> <p>\u2022 For families the high cost of public transport will remain an obstacle to accessing our wonderful national parks.</p> <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/planning/local-plan-review\" title=\"\">local plan</a> for the Lake District national park is unlikely to improve matters. Proposals include a gondola ride into Whinlatter Forest that is no more than a tourist attraction masquerading as a sustainable transport solution, targeted at high-spending overseas visitors and to benefit the commercial interests of the authority\u2019s business partners. The money could be better spent elsewhere on useful transport solutions. We need regular, reliable and affordable transport to allow everybody to explore the natural beauty on their doorstep, not expensive attractions only available to a lucky few.<br><strong>Kim Purvis</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.nogogondola.org\" title=\"\"><em>NoGoGondola</em></a><em>; Thornthwaite, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 I recently enjoyed a walk at Ferry Meadows, part of Nene Park in Peterborough. The lakes and other features were created by the city\u2019s far-sighted development corporation in the 1970s. All ages were enjoying the winter sun and I heard the chatter of a wide variety of languages.</p> <p>Immediately to the west of the city is an area that is largely rural, full of woodland, walks and wildlife yet is unsung and largely unexplored \u2013 Northamptonshire. Perhaps, instead of trying to encourage people to travel large distances, we should be valuing what is on our doorsteps.</p> <p>My nearest national parks are the Broads and the Peak District, both over 100 miles way, difficult to access for a day out by car and impossible via public transport. Perhaps greater emphasis should be placed on celebrating, promoting and recognising the local rather than the national.<br><strong>Toby Wood</strong><br><em>Peterborough, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Many years ago I was accompanying a group of young schoolchildren on a walking expedition in the Derbyshire Peak District when a bright-eyed girl of an Asian background quizzically looked at me and said: \u201cAre we allowed out here, Sir?\u201d She wasn\u2019t out of bounds physically but she sure was psychologically.<br><strong>Colin Martin</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have often asked why the two largest towns in the Lake District national park \u2013 Keswick and Windermere \u2013 have neither a Lidl or an Aldi, and the nearest are over 10 miles away in any direction.

      "bodyText": "We are disappointed but sadly unsurprised by the findings of the Campaign to Protect Rural England\u2019s research (National parks are out of bounds for England\u2019s poorest people, study finds, 4 February). As a charity we have long dedicated ourselves to overcoming the obstacles the most marginalised in society face in getting into the great outdoors. The fact is, it is those from marginalised communities who stand to gain so much from the national parks. The benefits of the national parks to personal health and wellbeing are well evidenced in our conversations with those communities. But for too many they remain out of reach. In 2018 we released National Parks For All: Making Car-Free Travel Easier, calling for urgent improvements to ensure that everyone can access and enjoy the parks. We want to see national park authorities play a much stronger role in improving transport provision in the parks. We are also calling for \u201csmarter travel\u201d pilots to test joined-up sustainable transport options and new types of on-demand, app-based transport services in the parks. Such services are becoming increasingly common in urban areas but too little is being done to support their roll-out to rural areas. As well as allowing people who do not have access to a car to visit more easily, improving the options for car-free travel will help to reduce the high volumes of traffic that currently damage the beauty and tranquillity of too many parts of the parks. In the 1930s, the working class protested for their right of access to the countryside, culminating in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. What better way of honouring the legacy of those pioneers than taking action to ensure that national parks really are there for everyone to enjoy. Janette Ward Chair of Campaign for National Parks \u2022 The answer to access to green space is to bring it to where people live. The government\u2019s national capital committee\u2019s recommendation that there should be 250,000 hectares of new community woodlands around our towns and cities is estimated to generate economic benefit of \u00a3500m per annum. We know it works thanks to the success of new green space close to people pioneered by the Forestry Commission, England\u2019s Community Forests, National Forest and Woodland Trust, among many others. As a prime example, Jaume Plensa\u2019s monumental statue Dream crowns the restoration to open access woodland of the Sutton Manor Colliery spoil heap in the north-west. Overlooking the M62 and passed by thousands of motorists daily, it is located in St Helens, one of the deprived communities cited in the study. Roderick Leslie Former chief executive, Forest Enterprise England \u2022 Our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty are wonderful assets that should be accessible to everyone, not least for the health and wellbeing benefits they bring. But with the majority of us now living in towns and cities, we also desperately need to bring these benefits to people in their everyday lives. People living close to green spaces are more likely to meet recommended daily activity levels, and recent Ramblers research found that 98% of us think walking in green spaces improves our mental health. If we can make it easier and more appealing for people to go about their everyday lives on foot, we not only help them to live healthier lives, but also help tackle some of society\u2019s biggest challenges, from rising levels of inactivity and obesity to social isolation and air pollution. Our Britain\u2019s Best Walking Neighbourhood award celebrates the places doing the most to give their communities access to quality green space and green routes. We hope it will also prompt councils and developers across Britain to make green, walkable neighbourhoods a priority. Enabling everyone to get close to nature where they live could also be the first step for many urban dwellers to explore more of our beautiful landscapes. Gemma Cantelo Head of policy and advocacy, Ramblers \u2022 For families the high cost of public transport will remain an obstacle to accessing our wonderful national parks. The new local plan for the Lake District national park is unlikely to improve matters. Proposals include a gondola ride into Whinlatter Forest that is no more than a tourist attraction masquerading as a sustainable transport solution, targeted at high-spending overseas visitors and to benefit the commercial interests of the authority\u2019s business partners. The money could be better spent elsewhere on useful transport solutions. We need regular, reliable and affordable transport to allow everybody to explore the natural beauty on their doorstep, not expensive attractions only available to a lucky few. Kim Purvis NoGoGondola; Thornthwaite, Cumbria \u2022 I recently enjoyed a walk at Ferry Meadows, part of Nene Park in Peterborough. The lakes and other features were created by the city\u2019s far-sighted development corporation in the 1970s. All ages were enjoying the winter sun and I heard the chatter of a wide variety of languages. Immediately to the west of the city is an area that is largely rural, full of woodland, walks and wildlife yet is unsung and largely unexplored \u2013 Northamptonshire. Perhaps, instead of trying to encourage people to travel large distances, we should be valuing what is on our doorsteps. My nearest national parks are the Broads and the Peak District, both over 100 miles way, difficult to access for a day out by car and impossible via public transport. Perhaps greater emphasis should be placed on celebrating, promoting and recognising the local rather than the national. Toby Wood Peterborough, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Many years ago I was accompanying a group of young schoolchildren on a walking expedition in the Derbyshire Peak District when a bright-eyed girl of an Asian background quizzically looked at me and said: \u201cAre we allowed out here, Sir?\u201d She wasn\u2019t out of bounds physically but she sure was psychologically. Colin Martin Sheffield \u2022 I have often asked why the two largest towns in the Lake District national park \u2013 Keswick and Windermere \u2013 have neither a Lidl or an Aldi, and the nearest are over 10 miles away in any direction. Is this a deliberate policy to maintain the chocolate box beauty of the park, thus not upsetting the visitors? Janet Mansfield Aspatria, Cumbria \u2022 Your map of national parks has an empty grey patch on the west. From Liverpool, Birkenhead and Southport, on a clear day you can see Wales. Welsh national parks welcome everyone.

Emily Marsden Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 That the British Library is to digitise \u201cextraordinary insights into many facets of human sexuality over three centuries\u201d by making texts such as Merrylands and its topographic sexual metaphors available online is to undervalue the contribution of Eric Partridge to this academic field.

It reminded me that some friends who had watched a recent episode of Luther that I missed told me there was a reference in it to a Wolcott Road. As there is no Wolcott Road in London, I took this to be a backhanded homage to the 1981 ITV miniseries Wolcott, which also had as its titular protagonist a black Metropolitan police CID detective. One reason I recall that particular show is that, with my late and lamented friend Barry Wasserman, I co-wrote it. Patrick Carroll Helston, Cornwall \u2022 Referring to Steve Rose\u2019s article, it\u2019s interesting to note that the British film industry was years ahead of both the BBC and the US. In 1951 the British film Pool of London was released in which the parts played by the black actor Earl Cameron and the white actor Susan Shaw developed a relationship that featured kissing; racial prejudice was also featured in the story. It\u2019s also interesting to note that the film ran into censorship problems in the US at the time because of their interracial relationship. In the light of this, for anyone to assume that US cinema and TV \u201cblazed the trail when it came to representation of black people on screen\u201d is demonstrably wrong.

I come for those (who doesn\u2019t like a pie?) but also the valley\u2019s no-nonsense towns, carved from gruff stone, and My Perfect Countryside, pinched between Pendle Hill and the Forest of Bowland, splicing lush green river banks of fat cows and the more savage kind of moorland. All those plus a splodge of nostalgia. This neck of the woods is where my mum was from. Clitheroe, the capital, is a jolly place of bunting and butchers, a neat little Norman castle and stone terraces with thick black or white lintels and architraves as if drawn on by a mammoth marker pen. And did we mention the food? Sausages, folks, and lots of them. An inevitable food festival, of course, and a market so magnificent it\u2019s a national treasure.

Trump, meanwhile, told religious leaders: \u201cAmerica\u2019s potential is unlimited because our extraordinary people are just something that is \u2026 Nimber 1.\u201d \u201cSoaring words, soaring words,\u201d Meyers reviewed. \u201cHe\u2019s like a guy on a date getting lines fed to him through an earpiece and the line cut out.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative MP Christopher Chope, who gained notoriety after he blocked a bill to make upskirting a criminal offence, has used the same parliamentary tactic to halt a planned law making it easier to protect girls from female genital mutilation (FGM). The Tory backbencher shouted \u201cobject!\u201d when the bill was presented to the Commons for its second reading. Under Commons procedure, a series of such bills are read out at the end of business without debate, and pass to the next stage only if no MP present verbally objects. If they do, the bill has to be presented again for second reading, in this case on 15 March. The amendment, co-drafted by the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and crossbench peer Michael Berkeley, does not have government support, meaning it will struggle to find parliamentary time. Chope has obstructed a series of bills in this way, including a bill to allow a women\u2019s conference to be held in the Commons. The Christchurch MP argues that even if he backs the intent of such bills he objects to them because he does not support the procedural principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading. As Commons officials read out a series of bills on Friday afternoon, Chope and fellow backbencher Peter Bone objected to a series of them, including another proposed by Goldsmith, to help the finances of Kew Gardens. Chope did not object to two private members\u2019 bills proposed by Bone, although other MPs did. The FGM proposal, called the Children Act 1989 (amendment \u2013 female genital mutilation) bill, is intended to improve the 2003 law that prohibited the practice by allowing family courts to make interim care orders about children deemed at risk, simplifying the process. Goldsmith called Chope\u2019s decision to object \u201cappalling\u201d. In another tweet, he said: \u201cIn case anyone is tempted to believe he has a principled objection to private members\u2019 bills, please note that once again he did NOT object to those put forward by his friends.\u201d The home secretary, Sajid Javid, tweeted that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the outcome. Chope\u2019s actions had been expected. Earlier on Friday the Huffington Post printed a text message exchange between the MP and Nimco Ali, the founder of the anti-FGM charity Daughters of Eve, in which she said she begged him to not do it. Chope told her he believed the bill should be fully debated at second reading. Amid a furore following his objection to ban a law to make upskirting a specific criminal offence, Chope told his local newspaper he was \u201ca bit sore about being scapegoated over this\u201d.

It\u2019s defamatory of my character, and it\u2019s very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours.\u201d Both the upskirting bill and the women\u2019s conference were later given government support, and passed the Commons. Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s shadow equalities minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that this dinosaur of a Tory MP consistently gets away with blocking new laws to protect the safety and rights of women. \u201cChristopher Chope is causing shame and embarrassment for the Tories but also for the country and it\u2019s time for the Tories to show they really care about these issues by stripping him of the whip.\u201d",

Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, has committed to tightening up a number of policies relating to self-harm and suicide on the photo-sharing platform after weeks of pressure spearheaded by the father of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old who took her life in 2017. Ian Russell believes Instagram was partly to blame. All graphic images of self-harm will be banned on Instagram and algorithmic boosts given to non-graphic related content heavily stifled, Mosseri said. He also promised to do more to actively help to users with mental health problems, saying the app was \u201cfocused on getting more resources to people posting and searching for self-harm related content and directing them to organisations that can help\u201d. He also promised to consult experts about other possibilities, such as \u201cblurring any non-graphic self-harm related content with a sensitivity screen, so that images are not immediately visible\u201d. For a sense of the panic inside its parent company Facebook this week, consider the fact that the last promise directly overrules Mosseri\u2019s attempts to control the crisis just a few days earlier. On Monday, he said: \u201cStarting this week we will be applying sensitivity screens to all content we review that contains cutting.\u201d By Thursday, that had become a total block on the content, and a suggestion to roll out the sensitivity screens even to material \u201csuch as healed scars\u201d. Thursday\u2019s announcement led to confusion among many people who may have wondered why Instagram had allowed graphic images of self-harm on the platform in the first place. Mosseri had provided just such an explanation on Monday: \u201cWe still allow people to share that they are struggling,\u201d he said, explaining why the content would be allowed to stay, albeit blurred. The last-minute tightening of company\u2019s policies will increase the burden on Instagram\u2019s moderation staff. Some of the work would have been done anyway, since flagging an image as \u201cgraphic self-harm\u201d is the same amount of work whether it is then blurred or simply taken down.

Not only is that likely to be far more common than graphic content, it was previously unmoderated. Harder still, Instagram will now need to define what exactly that phrase means \u2013 and do so in a way simple enough that its moderators can decide whether or not to act on images with just a few seconds to think about each one. If \u201chealed scars\u201d are to be removed from search, hashtags and the explore tab, for instance, does that mean someone with scarred arms will never be able to post a selfie of themselves wearing a T-shirt? The company will be helped by Facebook\u2019s own investment in image recognition technology, said Jake Moore of the cybersecurity firm ESET. \u201cAs image recognition software becomes more finely tuned, the process of removing becomes more slick.

If you value our journalism, please support us. In return we can hopefully arm you with the kind of knowledge that makes you sound slightly less uninformed during those hot reactive gegenpress chats you so enjoy. And if you think what we do is enjoyable [again, etc and so on \u2013 Fiver Ed], please help us keep coming back here to give you more of the same. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). I guess that applies to me as I read The Fiver each day, expecting that there\u2019ll finally be something funny in that day\u2019s missive. However, it\u2019s always the same letdown\u201d \u2013 Nigel Assam (and 1,056 others). \u201cI don\u2019t know about your modern fancy xG but if Big Website is talking about games in which nothing whatsoever happens, the reason I eventually gave up going to Hillsborough was the shambles of Sheffield Wednesday Reserves v Tranmere Rovers reserves in the winter of 1997 when, if I remember rightly, my ankles were freezing and there were only three shots (not on target) in the entire game. Beat that readers\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Nigel Assam, who wins a copy of \u2018It\u2019s Only Banter\u2019: The Autobiography of Leroy Rosenior. Plenty more prizes to come.

Scotland\u2019s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, has said there will be \u201cdynamic and fast moving challenges from Brexit\u201d which could involve police officers being sent to ports and airports if flights and ferry services are disrupted. He has cancelled plans to reduce frontline police numbers by 300 this year, previously agreed as a cost saving measure, and launched a new recruitment campaign to hire another 100 officers to bolster the force by around 400 constables to help cope with potential Brexit pressures.

Livingstone has also offered to send Scottish officers to help police the Irish border or deal with civil unrest and ferry disruption in ports and cities in Northern Ireland, England and Wales. Scotland has close cultural and historical ties with Northern Ireland, and is the closest UK jurisdiction geographically. Police also fear there could be significant disruption to intelligence and data sharing with EU criminal justice agencies and police forces if there were a disorderly Brexit, potentially their investigations into cross-border crime. Some officers are being deployed to the Brexit emergency centre in Bilston Glen in Midlothian, where the force will stage planning exercises with other emergency services, councils and government agencies to test their readiness for any disruption or disturbances. Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority, the civilian body that oversees the force, in late January that it had also drafted a Scottish impact assessment for a no-deal Brexit as part of a UK-wide police strategy. \u201cThe type of planning being undertaken relates to a great variety of potential scenarios, ranging from disruption in law enforcement data, which may threaten the administration of justice, potential disruption around Scottish sea and airports, potentially leading to the delay in the movement of people and goods, to wider challenges across the United Kingdom including the potential for public disorder which would inevitably result in mutual aid requests,\u201d he said.

He also starred in the film, giving one of his most captivating and revealing performances as Charlie, a hugely successful writer who returns in triumph to his hometown of Salford in a Rolls Royce, looking warily discontented with what he finds in memory lane \u2013 and with himself. There is an extraordinary, dreamlike scene in which, with an American photographer (an early role for Liza Minnelli), he drives around the vast, demolished gloaming where the old Victorian back-to-backs had been pulled down, and a brass marching band turn up out of nowhere. Other scenes show Charlie in a restaurant where an old waiter poignantly remembers his father, and also show him going to Old Trafford for a Manchester United match.</p> \n<p>Charlie Bubbles depicts how Britain was changing and what sudden, dizzying 60s-style success really felt like for Finney (and Delaney). And the scenes showing Charlie rowing with his ex-wife (Billie Whitelaw) are weirdly like in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. In the old days, a bloke might be off gallivanting down the pub; now he\u2019s off gallivanting in London with his fancy showbusiness friends. The sexual politics are the same. There is incidentally a bizarre scene in which Charlie and an old pal (Colin Blakely) amiably slosh food over each other in a posh London restaurant. It is far more interesting than the (overrated) sexy-eating scene in Tom Jones.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2845b572a9d7814d1b177d1f256472801e910cc6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2845b572a9d7814d1b177d1f256472801e910cc6/0_54_2745_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finney as Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express (Sidney Lumet, 1974).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gimlet-eyed \u2026 Finney as Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/EMI/Sportsphoto</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Finney\u2019s screen career continued into the 70s, though without the zeitgeist thrill of the earlier decade. His most successful role of this decade was probably Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet\u2019s all-star hit version of the Agatha Christie mystery Murder on the Orient Express (1975), which taught the film and television worlds what a very reliable moneyspinner Agatha Christie could be. Finney made Poirot a gimlet-eyed, severe, martinet figure, rather different from the more musing and cerebral Poirots of David Suchet and Kenneth Branagh.</p> \n<p>One of my favourite Finney performances comes from the beginning of the next decade: the once raved-over but now underappreciated Shoot the Moon (1982), directed by Alan Parker and scripted by veteran dramatist and screenwriter Bo Goldman. It is a post-Bergman marital-anguish drama of the sort that hasn\u2019t been fashionable for many a day. Finney plays George, a colossally successful writer, semi-openly having an affair, a fact that causes torment to his wife, Faith (Diane Keaton), and their four children. Emotional meltdown ensues. It has such a virile and vehement turn from Finney: his face is creased with agony, self-loathing and an awful kind of self-control that presages a yet larger explosion, which is to come with the film\u2019s famous firework-display of destructive rage over a new tennis court.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f665a51e05ed792a65626507ecf0b9ca82713b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f665a51e05ed792a65626507ecf0b9ca82713b/0_16_2197_1553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finney with Tom Courtenay in The Dresser (Ronald Harwood, 1983) .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slightly mad \u2026 Finney as \u2018Sir\u2019, with Tom Courtenay, in The Dresser.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of Finney\u2019s great later performances is his glorious leading turn \u2013 and distinctively comic one, in a career not noted for comedy \u2013 in The Dresser (1983). This was adapted by Ronald Harwood from his stage play, which was based on his own experiences as a long-suffering personal assistant, or \u201cdresser\u201d, to the renowned Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit. Finney plays the imperious, mercurial and slightly mad \u201cSir\u201d, as he leads a threadbare rep company around wartime Britain, and Tom Courtenay plays the camp dresser, the only man who can chivvy, bully and wheedle Sir into his costume, and out of whatever crazy or despondent mood he is in, in time for curtain up. Finney and Courtenay might easily have swapped roles for the film, though I think it was well cast this way around.</p> \n<p>The outrageously funny and hammy performances by Sir as Othello or Lear \u2013 all booming, screeching and whooping vowels \u2013 are supposed to show us what an old-fashioned and obsolete acting style that is. But perhaps it was not so far from the continuing Shakespearean tradition in which Finney appeared, night after night, because his stage career carried on alongside his screen work. Unlike Olivier, Finney never committed Shakespearean roles to the screen. Yet The Dresser, however cartoonish, gives us an interesting insight into Finney\u2019s own classical acting persona. Perhaps the off-stage Sir in his dressing room \u2013 florid, verbose, panicky but often witty and relaxed \u2013 is a hint of the onstage Finney of that time. And maybe Sir is someone whom Finney did not himself despise. This quixotic old-stager performance is not far from his excellent interpretation of Winston Churchill in the 2002 TV movie The Gathering Storm.</p> \n<p>An awful lot of flavour and texture has left British acting with the departure of Albert Finney.</p>",

There is an extraordinary, dreamlike scene in which, with an American photographer (an early role for Liza Minnelli), he drives around the vast, demolished gloaming where the old Victorian back-to-backs had been pulled down, and a brass marching band turn up out of nowhere. Other scenes show Charlie in a restaurant where an old waiter poignantly remembers his father, and also show him going to Old Trafford for a Manchester United match. Charlie Bubbles depicts how Britain was changing and what sudden, dizzying 60s-style success really felt like for Finney (and Delaney). And the scenes showing Charlie rowing with his ex-wife (Billie Whitelaw) are weirdly like in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. In the old days, a bloke might be off gallivanting down the pub; now he\u2019s off gallivanting in London with his fancy showbusiness friends. The sexual politics are the same. There is incidentally a bizarre scene in which Charlie and an old pal (Colin Blakely) amiably slosh food over each other in a posh London restaurant. It is far more interesting than the (overrated) sexy-eating scene in Tom Jones. Finney\u2019s screen career continued into the 70s, though without the zeitgeist thrill of the earlier decade. His most successful role of this decade was probably Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet\u2019s all-star hit version of the Agatha Christie mystery Murder on the Orient Express (1975), which taught the film and television worlds what a very reliable moneyspinner Agatha Christie could be. Finney made Poirot a gimlet-eyed, severe, martinet figure, rather different from the more musing and cerebral Poirots of David Suchet and Kenneth Branagh. One of my favourite Finney performances comes from the beginning of the next decade: the once raved-over but now underappreciated Shoot the Moon (1982), directed by Alan Parker and scripted by veteran dramatist and screenwriter Bo Goldman. It is a post-Bergman marital-anguish drama of the sort that hasn\u2019t been fashionable for many a day. Finney plays George, a colossally successful writer, semi-openly having an affair, a fact that causes torment to his wife, Faith (Diane Keaton), and their four children. Emotional meltdown ensues. It has such a virile and vehement turn from Finney: his face is creased with agony, self-loathing and an awful kind of self-control that presages a yet larger explosion, which is to come with the film\u2019s famous firework-display of destructive rage over a new tennis court. One of Finney\u2019s great later performances is his glorious leading turn \u2013 and distinctively comic one, in a career not noted for comedy \u2013 in The Dresser (1983). This was adapted by Ronald Harwood from his stage play, which was based on his own experiences as a long-suffering personal assistant, or \u201cdresser\u201d, to the renowned Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit. Finney plays the imperious, mercurial and slightly mad \u201cSir\u201d, as he leads a threadbare rep company around wartime Britain, and Tom Courtenay plays the camp dresser, the only man who can chivvy, bully and wheedle Sir into his costume, and out of whatever crazy or despondent mood he is in, in time for curtain up. Finney and Courtenay might easily have swapped roles for the film, though I think it was well cast this way around. The outrageously funny and hammy performances by Sir as Othello or Lear \u2013 all booming, screeching and whooping vowels \u2013 are supposed to show us what an old-fashioned and obsolete acting style that is. But perhaps it was not so far from the continuing Shakespearean tradition in which Finney appeared, night after night, because his stage career carried on alongside his screen work. Unlike Olivier, Finney never committed Shakespearean roles to the screen. Yet The Dresser, however cartoonish, gives us an interesting insight into Finney\u2019s own classical acting persona. Perhaps the off-stage Sir in his dressing room \u2013 florid, verbose, panicky but often witty and relaxed \u2013 is a hint of the onstage Finney of that time. And maybe Sir is someone whom Finney did not himself despise. This quixotic old-stager performance is not far from his excellent interpretation of Winston Churchill in the 2002 TV movie The Gathering Storm. An awful lot of flavour and texture has left British acting with the departure of Albert Finney.",

No limit had been placed, to begin with, on the number to be admitted but the Guardian reported that the \u201ccommittee hopes to bring over at least 5,000\u201d. The events of Kristallnacht just three weeks earlier accelerated the immigration process \u2013 an estimated 91 Jewish people were killed, hundreds of synagogues were burned, and tens of thousands were imprisoned in concentration camps.

      "bodyText": "The abbot of Ealing Abbey has resigned over a failure to investigate child sexual abuse allegations at a London school amid an escalating diplomatic row prompted by the papal nuncio\u2019s reluctance to cooperate with a public inquiry. The independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) was informed on Friday that Dom Martin Shipperlee, who had been abbot since 2000 and taught at St Benedict\u2019s School in west London, had given up his responsibilities. His abrupt departure comes immediately after he appeared before the inquiry, answering questions about how he handled allegations of sexual abuse against monks and teachers at the school dating back decades. Two senior monks and teachers, Andrew Soper and David Pearce, were jailed for a series of offences against pupils at the school. Soper, who was found guilty of 19 rapes and sexual offences at St Benedict\u2019s, fled to Kosovo at one stage in an attempt to escape justice. The public inquiry has written to the pope\u2019s representative in Britain, the archbishop Edward Adams, asking him to disclose details of his handling of complaints about Catholic schools in England and Wales and specifically relating to investigations at Ealing Abbey and St Benedict\u2019s school. The papal nuncio has so far failed to comply and declined to comment about the requests. David Enright, a solicitor at the law firm Howe and Co who represents 18 victims of abuse by Catholic priests and monks, who are taking part in IICSA, has written to Theresa May asking her to expel Adams if he does not comply.

      "bodyText": "The school climate strikes that have led to tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets around the world over recent months are poised to arrive in the UK next Friday. Thousands of pupils are expected to walk out of lessons at schools and colleges across the country amid growing concern about the escalating climate crisis. The movement started in August when the 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg held a solo protest outside Sweden\u2019s parliament. Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities worldwide. Individual protests have been held in the UK, but next week a coordinated day of action is expected to result in walkouts in more than 30 towns and cities \u2013 from Lancaster to Truro, and Ullapool to Leeds. Jake Woodier, of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping to coordinate the strikes, said Greta\u2019s message about the need for radical, urgent change had struck a chord with hundreds of thousand of young people in the UK. \u201cThe images of what Greta did and then the huge strikes by schoolchildren in other countries have been widely shared by young people on social media and have really inspired people.\u201d He said young people were becoming increasingly radicalised by the environmental crisis and understood the need for urgent political action. \u201cYoung people see what is happening \u2013 especially since the IPCC report last year, which spelled out that we only have 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change \u2026 they realise that politicians are nowhere near where they need to be on this and want to do something to change that.\u201d There has been some pushback against the strikes by climate deniers and politicians. Last week, Belgian\u2019s environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country\u2019s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers. So far those planning to protest in the UK say they have had broad support. Zoe Bonnett, 14, is organising a strike in Bristol next week. \u201cPeople seem to think this is an issue that can be solved another time, but there is no other time,\u201d she said. \u201cI know this is a drastic action, this is quite a big step that I am taking, but I do feel strongly that we have to solve it now \u2026 I have to do something. \u201d Bonnett, who heard about the movement after seeing a video of Greta online, said young people had a special stake in the unfolding crisis. \u201cAt the moment I am having to make my choices for GCSEs, and I realised that if there is going to be a bad future ahead those sort of choices are not really that important unless we do something urgent now.\u201d Bonnett\u2019s mother, Joanna, said she supported her daughter\u2019s decision to walk out of school. \u201cI was a bit reticent at first because I am more of a rule-keeper than a rule-breaker but as she became more enthusiastic and learned more about it and decided to set up her own strike we became very supportive.\u201d Bonnett said she was planning to write to the headteacher of her school to outline her plan and offer to discuss the strike. The UK walkouts are being billed as a chance to build towards a global day of school strikes on 15 March. Greta has already confronted world leaders with the movement\u2019s demand for radical climate action, first at a climate meeting in Poland in December where she accused them of acting like irresponsible children; then in Davos for the World Economic Forum when she told the gathered global elite that the climate crisis was real, adding: \u201cI want you to panic.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Each country had an extended break in the Five Nations, the odd number of teams in the tournament meaning someone sat out a round, which were then every two weeks. It is almost like that now with six as sides tend to use the fixture against Italy as an opportunity to rest players. For all the effervescent enthusiasm of their head coach, Conor O\u2019Shea, Italy\u2019s results \u2013 18 straight defeats, all bar two by a double-figure margin \u2013 raise questions about the value they bring. Italy have improved under O\u2019Shea yet they are falling further behind. Wales have made 11 changes, one positional, from the side that won in Paris in the opening round despite having an eight-day turnaround and two weeks to prepare for their third-round match against England in Cardiff. Their head coach, Warren Gatland, is not quite treating the game as if it is an autumn match against a tier two nation, taking out a few insurance policies, such as Alun Wyn Jones on the bench and Jonathan Davies in the midfield, but he is using it to gauge his strength in depth. Gatland takes his leave of Wales after the World Cup in Japan and in the past 18 months he has focused on developing strength in depth following his side\u2019s exit from the 2015 tournament when they were undermined by a series of injuries.

Matches between Wales, who are looking to equal their record of 11 consecutive victories, and Italy have settled into a pattern in recent years: a close first half, the Azzurri led at the interval in Rome two years ago, followed by a blow-out in the second, an average score in the opening period of the past four championship matches between the sides of 15-7 compared with 33-9 after it. Staying power has been one of Italy\u2019s problems, lacking on the bench compared to their rivals, and although they finished strongly against Scotland last Saturday, they had a man advantage. Under the current management they have shown more energy and ideas but they remain vulnerable when confronted with the unexpected and prone to defensive lapses. They have more heart than quality.

      "bodyText": "The gloomy mood is prevailing on both sides of the Atlantic, with investors finding very little to cheer. A major factor weighing on sentiment is the lack of progress on a trade between the US and China, which is looking increasing unlikely ahead of the 2 March deadline, at which point 25% tariffs will be imposed on Chinese goods imported into America. US markets have opened lower: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 25,050 Nasdaq: -0.7% at 7,235 S&amp;P 500: -0.5% at 2,693 This is how it\u2019s looking in Europe: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,079 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% at 10,938 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 4,972 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 19,390 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.9% at 8,862 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 359 That\u2019s it for today. Thank you for all the comments and have a good weekend. AM Over in Greece, the country has taken another step forward as it rebuilds its finances. Helena Smith reports: Almost four years after they were first imposed, capital controls in Greece are finally on their way to being abolished. Greece\u2019s central bank governor Yiannis Stournaras, held talks today with the heads of the country\u2019s five major banks to discuss ending restrictions on business transactions abroad - the last capital control still in place. The curb - brought into force at the height of the country\u2019s debt crisis in the summer of 2015 as capital flight sparked fears of a run on banks - is now widely viewed as an impediment to commerce. Banking sources told the Guardian that lifting the restriction would be a key signal of Greece\u2019s return to economic normality. One source said: It would be very important for the business community. It\u2019s the last one [control] in place. Today\u2019s talks will be followed by others before the government announces the decision. In a year when it faces elections, Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist administration is expected to lift the measure imminently. US futures are down as worries linger about the lack of progress on a trade deal between America and China. This is how it\u2019s shaping up: Dow Jones: -0.6% S&amp;P 500: -0.6% Nasdaq: -0.8% Connor Campbell, analyst at the spread betting firm Spread Ex, is not expecting much optimism when Wall Street opens later, as trade fears weigh on sentiment. The European indices couldn\u2019t shake that sinking feeling on Friday, falling further into the red as the day went on. Facing a half a percent decline, the Dow Jones is all set to open Friday\u2019s session at 25,050, basically back to where it started the week having hit a fresh 2 month high of 25,400 on Wednesday. That potential slide comes after Donald Trump admitted any meeting between him and China\u2019s Xi Jinping won\u2019t happen under the trade war ceasefire ceases in early March, casting doubt on the chances of reaching a tariff hike-avoiding deal in time. As the mood across global markets becomes distinctly subdued, Bloomberg considers whether Fed chair Jerome Powell will do them any favours: A blogpost written by Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man and founder and chief executive of Amazon, is topping all the headlines today. Bezos accuses the publisher of the National Enquirer of \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d in a post alleging it threatened to publish revealing personal photos unless the Amazon chief executive publicly affirmed the paper\u2019s reporting was not politically motivated. Here\u2019s a handy profile of the man who started Amazon in his garage: The pound is under pressure again this morning, weighed on by Brexit stalemate and a downbeat assessment of the UK\u2019s economic prospects from the Bank of England. It is currently down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2930, and down 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1324. Sterling is down more than 1% against both currencies this week, the worst performance since October. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, gives his take on the mood among investors: After the big declines seen yesterday it\u2019s been a subdued start for markets in Europe this morning as investors take stock with respect to the next moves in the US, China trade talks. The news that President Trump and Xi won\u2019t be meeting before the March 1st deadline for an increase in tariffs, has raised concerns, in the absence of another extension to the trade truce, that the global economy will struggle to absorb further costs on goods and services. In a rare dose of good news this week, this morning\u2019s latest German trade numbers showed an improvement in both imports and exports for December, while industrial production in France also rebounded after a poor November. Sadly there was no December rebound for Italy which saw industrial production sink 0.8%, with work day adjusted output falling at its fastest rate since December 2012. In other developments this morning, the takeover tussle for control of cross-border payments firm Earthport has ramped up a notch after credit card giant Visa submitted an improved \u00a3247m bid, prompting rival Mastercard to say it was considering whether to improve on the offer. Visa said early on Friday that it was willing to increase its offer for London-based Earthport, submitting a bid 23% higher than the surprise \u00a3198m offer it made over the Christmas period and 12% above a subsequent counter-offer from Mastercard. Within half an hour of Visa announcing the sweetened terms to the stock market, Mastercard said it was \u201cconsidering its options\u201d and urged Earthport shareholders to take no further action in response to Visa\u2019s bid for the time being. Earthport\u2019s shares have risen sixfold since Visa\u2019s initial bid on 27 December and the company was valued at \u00a3240m before the market opened on Friday. Shares are currently up 13.6% at 44.1p. Earthport\u2019s management had previously backed Mastercard\u2019s offer but are now recommending Visa\u2019s bid, the credit card firm\u2019s stock market statement said. We\u2019ve had some positive trade news this morning, courtesy of Germany. Exports from Europe\u2019s biggest economy jumped 1.5% in December, easily beating expectations of a 0.2% increase. Imports increased 1.2%, resulting in a trade surplus of \u20ac19.4 billion, up from \u20ac18.9bn in November. It provides welcome respite after fears have been mounting in recent weeks that Germany went into recession in the fourth quarter. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING in Germany: Today\u2019s trade data is a welcome sign of life, confirming our view that the assessment of the German economy currently needs less black-and-white thinking and is more nuanced. Some might consider it whistling in the dark, but we remain modestly optimistic for the German growth outlook this year. The labour market is strong and if investment accelerates and there is some fiscal stimulus, the one-off factors which caused the slowdown in the second half of 2018 should also gradually reverse. The subdued mood among investors in the US and Asia has spread to Europe. Trump\u2019s comments have dealt a blow to hopes that a US/China trade deal might be struck before tariff hikes are imposed on 2 March. Here are the early scores in markets across Europe: FTSE 100: flat at 7,093 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 10,988 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 4,982 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 19,449 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.4% at 8,902 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 359 Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, says the latest blow to trade talks doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all over: Two big China trade items knocked back markets yesterday and are likely to weigh on the European session on Friday. First we won\u2019t get a Trump-Xi meeting before tariffs are set to increase on March 2nd. Whilst this is a bit of a blow, it\u2019s not in itself a reason to think trade talks are not going anywhere. The key trigger for the selling was when White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow sounded a cautious note on trade talks, saying that there is a \u2018pretty sizeable distance to go\u2019. Meanwhile Trump has been named in another spat which is leading the headlines this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hopes that the US and China can strike a trade deal before a hike in tariffs is imposed on Chinese goods imported into America were dealt a blow on Thursday. President Trump said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that he would meet President Xi Jinping before a 2 March deadline - after which US tariffs on Chinese goods are to increase to 25% from 10%. Asked on Thursday whether he would meet the Chinese leader, Trump said: \u201cNot yet.\u201d Pressed on whether the two would meet before 2 March, he said \u201cno\u201d. The remarks have done nothing to cheer investors, with Asian shares falling after the remarks, following Wall Street lower. Recent downgrades to global growth forecasts are also weighing on sentiment. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: Up to now the markets have been optimistic about a trade deal being reached, despite little solid evidence. Trump\u2019s stance is now rattling investor nerves just weeks before the deadline. Chinese markets are still closed for Chinese New Year, re-opening on Monday. However, traders in Hong Kong are returning to their desks and we are starting to see volumes ramp up. The reaction we are seeing is to the deteriorating economic outlook as well as increased concerns over the fragile US \u2013 China trade relationship. We\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments.",

US intelligence understood that Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s 33-year-old de facto ruler, was ready to kill the journalist, although he may not have literally meant he planned to shoot him, according to the New York Times ($). After initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, the kingdom has acknowledged that a team killed him inside the diplomatic mission but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince. The Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, on Friday said Prince Mohammed did not order Khashoggi\u2019s murder but could not comment on the New York Times\u2019 report. The conversation between the prince and his aides was intercepted by US intelligence agencies, as part of routine efforts by the National Security Agency and other security services to capture and store the communications of global leaders, including allied ones, the newspaper reported. It was only recently transcribed, however, because of mounting efforts by US intelligence to find conclusive proof linking the prince to the killing. The conversation took place between the crown prince and an aide, Turki Aldakhil, in September 2017 \u2013 about 13 months before the killing, the paper said. The prince said that if Khashoggi could not be enticed to return to Saudi Arabia, then he should be brought back by force.

The report came after a UN human rights expert looking into the case said the Saudi regime \u201cseriously curtailed and undermined\u201d the Turkish investigation into the murder of Khashoggi. Agn\u00e8s Callamard, a UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, said the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist was the victim of a \u201cbrutal, premeditated killing planned and perpetrated by officials of the state of Saudi Arabia\u201d. Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the promise of being given documents that would help him remarry. Inside he was suffocated and then his body was dismembered, according to a Turkish investigation. In a preliminary report, Callamard said she had heard \u201cparts of the chilling and gruesome audio material obtained and retained by the Turkish intelligence agency\u201d. She said: \u201cWoefully inadequate time and access was granted to Turkish investigators to conduct a professional and effective crime-scene examination and search required by international standards for investigation.\u201d Callamard, a French human rights expert, is due to deliver a final report to the UN human rights council in June. On Thursday she provided an assessment of her visit to Turkey to pursue the investigation, from 28 January and 3 February. She said Saudi killers had exploited diplomatic immunity to carry out the murder. \u201cGuarantees of immunity were never intended to facilitate the commission of a crime and exonerate its authors of their criminal responsibility or to conceal a violation of the right to life,\u201d Callamard said. \u201cThe circumstances of the killing and the response by state representatives in its aftermath may be described as \u2018immunity for impunity\u2019.\u201d Callamard also criticised the kingdom for carrying out a secretive second trial on 31 January of 11 men indicted by the Saudi authorities over Khashoggi\u2019s murder. There are major concerns about the fairness of the Saudi proceedings, she said, adding that her team had not yet received permission to visit Riyadh. \u201cGiven the importance of the case, we should be expecting a greater presence of representatives of the media, of civil society, of a range of other governments, not just those hand-picked by the Saudi authorities,\u201d the special rapporteur said. US intelligence chiefs have told Congress that Prince Mohammed almost certainly ordered the killing or was aware of it, even though Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have insisted the evidence is incomplete and investigations would continue. Pompeo met al-Jubeir in Washington on Thursday. Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said on Friday that she would welcome a change in Trump\u2019s approach to the killing, and may visit the US in March, having previously rejected an invitation from the president. \u201cThe [US] congress is renewed, the members are changed. I am hopeful. There is still hope. I believe the new congress would follow this issue closer,\u201d Cengiz said. Riyadh has denied the prince was involved. The Saudi public prosecutor has charged 11 men with the murder, saying last month that he would seek the death penalty for five of them. The defendants\u2019 names and those of their lawyers have not been revealed, and it is also unclear if the suspects are being detained between hearings or where they are being held. Turkey has repeatedly asked for the extradition of the Saudi suspects for trial in Istanbul, requests denied by Riyadh, which says they will face justice within the Saudi court system. Fahrettin Altun, communications director for the Turkish president, said: \u201cThe world is watching.\u201d",

It\u2019s not exactly as if troops are about to march across the Alps \u2013 as Mussolini\u2019s did in 1940. Still, when France recalled its ambassador from Rome this week after Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, had met a group of gilets jaunes protesters in central France, it felt as if European politics had taken a dangerous turn.

The film scooped four Oscars and established the actor as an international star.</p> <h2>Scrooge</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiNMz_745vQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uiNMz_745vQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The bullish, brooding 33-year-old actor may not have been the obvious choice to play Dickens\u2019s querulous old miser in a musical re-telling of A Christmas Carol.

Tom Jones Directed with gusto by Tony Richardson, Tom Jones is a bawdy, free-wheeling farce buttressed by irreverent asides and acid social satire as Finney\u2019s foundling hero tumbles from bed to ball-room to duck-pond in an 18th-century England by way of Swinging 60s London. The film scooped four Oscars and established the actor as an international star. Scrooge The bullish, brooding 33-year-old actor may not have been the obvious choice to play Dickens\u2019s querulous old miser in a musical re-telling of A Christmas Carol. Still, Finney brought an exuberant glee to a role that was to signal a curious sea-change in his career throughout the 1970s. Murder on the Orient Express Finney stars as Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet\u2019s first-class adaptation of the Agatha Christie whodunnit, navigating a list of suspects that includes Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery and John Gielgud. Christie herself approved of the film with one caveat. Finney\u2019s moustache, she felt, was far too skimpy. Annie Even billionaire Daddy Warbucks might have blanched at the cash that director John Huston threw at this all-singing, all-dancing version of the Broadway musical. A chrome-domed Finney plays the growling old tycoon who adopts a squawking orphan girl during the darkest days of the Great Depression. One setpiece street scene cost an estimated $1m to shoot, only for Huston to junk it and shoot the whole thing over again in a different location. The Dresser Finney reunited with his erstwhile kitchen-sink rival Tom Courtenay for this measured, quietly mesmerising portrait of the relationship between an ageing actor and his long-suffering personal assistant. Both men emerged from the dressing room with Oscar nominations. Miller\u2019s Crossing The actor saw in the 90s in barnstorming style, playing a cigar-chomping Irish crime boss in the Coen brothers\u2019 acclaimed tale of windblown fedoras and blazing machine-guns. Old Leo O\u2019Bannon may look a soft touch, with his smoking jacket and monogrammed slippers - but break into his house and you pay the highest of prices. Erin Brockovich Finney bagged his fifth and final Oscar nomination in Stephen Soderbergh\u2019s fact-based tale of triumph against the odds. He plays Ed Masry, the hardbitten lawyer who grooms Julia Roberts\u2019s wronged single mum. In the event, however, it was Roberts who went home with the Oscar. Before the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead The actor gave his last great performance in Before the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead, the devastating swansong from director Sidney Lumet. This supple, muscular crime drama spins and pivots around a jewel heist gone horribly wrong. Finney\u2019s tour-de-force as the devastated dad turned angel of vengeance showed that he had lost none of his edge as he eased into his eighth decade. Albert Finney 1960 TV interview Every young actor needs a stroke of luck and here\u2019s Finney admitting his own in an early television interview. Would Finney have gone on to greatness if he hadn\u2019t been dragged from the dressing room to replace Laurence Olivier in Coriolanus? Of course he would ... but it didn\u2019t do him any harm.",

In fact, Singer left the film before the end of the shoot and was replaced by the uncredited Dexter Fletcher. But it shows that the debate about abusive sexual politics in film production is far from over. There are more worries, incidentally, about an all-male director lineup in the Bafta nominations, which overlooks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/lynne-ramsay\">Lynne Ramsay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/17/director-debra-granik-winters-bone-leave-no-trace-obsessive-search-for-americas-dispossessed\">Debra Granik</a>.</p> <p>That said, there are plenty of films to feel enthusiastic about. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n</a>\u2019s glorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/29/roma-review-alfonso-cuaron\">Roma</a> \u2013 his intensely personal and beautiful film about a troubled upbringing in 70s Mexico City \u2013 is likely to clean up, and its landslide is so overwhelmingly probable that my predictions below include some counter-balancing tips for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/pawel-pawlikowski\">Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski</a>\u2019s sublime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/11/cold-war-review-wounded-love-and-state-sponsored-fear-in-1940s-poland\">Cold War</a>, which could just as easily be dominating the awards-season conversation.

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Bafta film ceremony arrives with the organisers doing their best to confront the elephant in the living room and grab it by the tusks. In response to claims of abusive behaviour by director Bryan Singer, the contractually-credited director of the Bafta-nominated Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, Singer\u2019s name has been removed from the awards citation. In fact, Singer left the film before the end of the shoot and was replaced by the uncredited Dexter Fletcher. But it shows that the debate about abusive sexual politics in film production is far from over. There are more worries, incidentally, about an all-male director lineup in the Bafta nominations, which overlooks Lynne Ramsay and Debra Granik. That said, there are plenty of films to feel enthusiastic about. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s glorious Roma \u2013 his intensely personal and beautiful film about a troubled upbringing in 70s Mexico City \u2013 is likely to clean up, and its landslide is so overwhelmingly probable that my predictions below include some counter-balancing tips for Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s sublime Cold War, which could just as easily be dominating the awards-season conversation. Yet much of the talk has been about Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Favourite, the absurdist post-Restoration romp about dysfunctional sexual politics at the court of Queen Anne. It is sure to pick up some silverware, including something for Olivia Colman for best actress: her Bafta coronation is regarded by one and all as a sure thing. (Yet what I can only call a prominent member of the media/show business community has pointed out to me how extraordinary it is that online bookies are still accepting bets on Colman, though at the shortest of odds. Do they know something we don\u2019t?) There could still be a rush of prizes for Peter Farrelly\u2019s Green Book, the feelgood true-life bromance between a 1960s Italian-American nightclub bouncer (Viggo Mortensen) and the distinguished black musician (Mahershala Ali) that he had to chauffeur on a pioneering tour of the Jim Crow south. My feeling is that Mortensen and Ali are excellent actors outclassing their material here. But there is a lot of love out there for this warm, good-natured film, and at both the Baftas and Oscars, Green Book could yet defy the tipsters (including me). Bradley Cooper\u2019s extravagantly emotional new version of A Star Is Born, which many assumed would be an awards frontrunner when it came out last year, could be almost completely shut out. But it may get the music Bafta and B-Coop himself might beat Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Rami Malek to the best actor prize. I am hoping to see Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty take the stage to accept a Bafta for their superlative comedy Can You Ever Forgive Me? (whose outstanding star Melissa McCarthy can\u2019t be ruled out of a best actress prize). The race for best supporting actor mask is between Mahershala Ali and Richard E Grant, the latter for his deeply enjoyable turn in CYEFM? as McCarthy\u2019s drinking buddy who makes things much worse with his cheerful selfishness. The documentary prize will probably (and understandably) go to the gobsmacking Free Solo about Alex Honnold and his mind-blowingly dangerous habit of climbing without a rope, although I think the more deserving contender is Peter Jackson\u2019s amazing first world war western front documentary They Shall Not Grow Old \u2013 and I am dismayed to see some commenters, through misguided purism, attacking his colourisation of newsreel footage. Meanwhile, the animation Bafta must surely go to the brilliant, delirium-inducing Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

      "bodyText": "Despite the years that have since passed, many of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s former students at Harvard Law School share the same distinct memory: it was their very first day at the prestigious institution, and for many, their very first class. Not knowing what to expect, they took their seats for an introductory course on contracts law. At the exact minute that the clock struck the top of the hour, Warren bounded into the room and rested her casebook on the podium. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. This is contracts,\u201d she said. But whereas other professors had prepared a welcome speech, Warren\u2019s pleasantries ended there. Glancing down at her seating chart, she proceeded to cold-call on the students with queries stemming from their reading material, making her way through at least half the room by the time the class was over. Years later, when clips of Warren grilling corporate CEOs and cabinet officials from the US Senate went viral, her former students would fire off emails and texts to one another joking about what it was like to be at the receiving end. \u201cWe could all empathize with the witness in the hot seat,\u201d said Andrew Crespo, a former student of Warren\u2019s who is an associate professor at Harvard. \u201cShe was rigorous, thoughtful, careful, precise \u2026 She had a big profile on campus.\u201d Warren\u2019s tough teaching style was notorious across Harvard \u2013 always come prepared, her students recalled. It is that same rigorous and methodical approach that Warren\u2019s former colleagues expect her to bring to her bid for the Democratic party\u2019s nomination for president in 2020. On Saturday, Warren, 69, will return to Massachusetts to formally launch her campaign for president after forming an exploratory committee in December. It will be an event long in the making for the closely watched senator, whose meteoric rise from academia to politics brought with it relentless speculation over possible presidential ambitions. In interviews throughout the Boston area, Warren\u2019s former students and colleagues described her as a \u201cpragmatic idealist\u201d whose life\u2019s work has centered on understanding and rooting out income inequality. \u201cShe\u2019s had a very consistent, coherent, intellectual ideological position,\u201d said Barney Frank, a retired Massachusetts congressman who worked closely with Warren on financial reform. \u201cShe can claim to have been there when this critique of economic inequality, and the systematic problems that exacerbate it, wasn\u2019t fashionable.\u201d But Warren\u2019s official entry into the race has differed sharply from when she captured widespread liberal enthusiasm in her unlikely bid for the Senate seven years ago. The two-term senator will join a crowded Democratic primary field with no clear frontrunner \u2013 and several contenders jockeying to claim the progressive mantle that she aspires to grasp. She has also found herself contending with a lingering controversy for previously identifying as Native American over the course of nearly two decades. The question now is whether Warren, who moved early to build an expansive field operation in anticipation of her presidential run, can overcome early setbacks and reclaim her role as the Democratic party\u2019s top foil to Donald Trump. Born to middle-class parents in Norman, Oklahoma, Warren has spoken candidly about how her family\u2019s livelihood was upended when her father\u2019s heart attack forced him out of work. Addressing crowds across the country, Warren often recalls how her late mother \u2013 determined not to lose the family\u2019s home \u2013 \u201cpulled on her best dress\u201d and got her first paying job at the department store Sears. The job paid minimum wage and exposed Warren firsthand to the topics that would later define her career: the power of corporations and the effects of bankruptcy on the American consumer. Her research in bankruptcy law \u2013 and the impact on the average person\u2019s medical bills, mortgage payments and other installments \u2013 led Warren to become a leading expert on the subject and rise in the academia world. \u201cThese are the issues she still cares about,\u201d said Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School who helped recruit Warren to its faculty. \u201cI think she is extraordinary for this reason, that she got into politics because she cared about some issues. She didn\u2019t get into politics because she wanted to be in office and then tried to figure out what issues she cared about.\u201d Warren cultivated a profile as a populist firebrand against the backdrop of the Great Recession, earning the ire of Wall Street by spearheading the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2013 an agency established under the Obama administration as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill of 2010. Upon being passed over to head the agency she helped create, Warren decided to continue the fight from within the government, embarking on a campaign to win back the late senator and liberal icon Ted Kennedy\u2019s seat from the Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, in the high-profile 2012 Massachusetts Senate race. Roughly $70m was spent on the bitterly waged contest, which catapulted Warren to the national stage. The race also saw Warren cement herself as a leader of the burgeoning progressive movement within the Democratic party; branding the choice before voters as \u201cWall Street versus you\u201d, Warren viewed the election as an opportunity to hand a major defeat to what she once dubbed as \u201cthe largest lobbying force ever assembled on the face of the earth\u201d. Following her victory, Warren\u2019s profile grew so rapidly that speculation swiftly emerged over a potential White House run in 2016, despite the inevitability of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. A group of progressives even mounted a #DraftWarren campaign. Warren, who had been sharply critical of Clinton in part over her ties to Wall Street, ultimately chose not to challenge her for the Democratic party\u2019s nomination and endorsed the former secretary of state\u2019s campaign. It was also during this time that Warren proved among the few capable of getting under then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s skin. After Trump derided Clinton as a \u201cnasty woman\u201d, Warren famously riffed: \u201cGet this, Donald. Nasty women are tough, nasty women are smart and nasty women vote, and on November 8, we nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever.\u201d The 2016 presidential election did not, however, produce the groundswell of unified opposition to Trump that Democrats had hoped for.

In the early days of the Trump administration, Warren quickly emerged as the face of the Democratic opposition, matching the president\u2019s tweets with sharp ripostes of her own and holding his cabinet nominees to account when they appeared for consideration before congressional committees. During the confirmation process for the former attorney general Jeff Sessions, Warren famously read a letter written 30 years prior by Coretta Scott King, in which the widow of Dr Martin Luther King Jr warned of Sessions\u2019 civil rights record from the time of his nomination for a federal judgeship. Silenced by Republicans mid-speech on the Senate floor, Warren read the letter on Facebook Live. The hashtag #LetLizSpeak trended on Twitter and the phrase \u201cNevertheless, she persisted\u201d was coined. At the same time, Warren became a top target of conservatives and Trump himself. The president has repeatedly mocked Warren with the derisive nickname \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 including at an event intended to honor Native Americans. Although Warren long ignored the president\u2019s taunts, she took the unusual step of addressing the issue head on in October by making public the results of a DNA test revealing that she did, in fact, have some Native American ancestry. Rather than putting the topic to rest, Warren\u2019s move was rebuked by some tribal leaders, who felt it politicized their identity, and reignited the story. Republicans first tried to push the notion that Warren used her Native American ancestry to further her career in the 2012 Senate race, homing in on a single questionnaire in which she claimed mixed ancestry. An exhaustive investigation by the Boston Globe found no evidence that Warren benefited from doing so, and nearly every living Harvard law professor involved in her hiring has said it was not a factor in their votes to offer her a tenured position. \u201cWhen we brought her to Harvard, no one had a clue that she thought of herself as Native American,\u201d said Laurence Tribe, the school\u2019s professor of constitutional law. \u201cI think she\u2019s had an unfair rap,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case that she ever exploited her family\u2019s background or ancestry in a way that some people seem to think she did.\u201d The Cherokee nation, one of the groups that was critical of Warren, said she privately apologized to to tribal leaders. But the matter did not end there. The Washington Post published a story revealing Warren listed her race as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d while seeking a Texas bar registration card in 1986. Warren apologized once more, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019m not a tribal citizen. \u201cMy apology is an apology for not having been more sensitive about tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty. I really want to underline the point, tribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship.\u201d Warren remains a popular figure in the Democratic party and was easily re-elected to a second Senate term in the 2018 midterm elections.

In her email, Warren also recounted to her old colleague how not very long ago they sat together on a flight discussing the prospects of a Clinton presidency. That day never came to fruition, Warren noted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what lies ahead,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I know what I\u2019m fighting for.\u201d",

If you fail to extend solidarity to a victim of antisemitism because you do not agree with their politics, then you do not truly oppose antisemitism at all. Neither Labour\u2019s leadership nor the vast majority of Labour members are antisemitic; but antisemitism does exist on fringes of the left, and there has to be far more seriousness in rooting it out.

      "bodyText": "Liz Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, architects who have gone from being outsider provocateurs who rarely built anything to a practice regarded as an international powerhouse, have won the 2019 Royal Academy architecture prize. The pair have been responsible for some of the most important cultural projects of recent years, including the High Line in New York and the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In the UK, they are designing the V&amp;A\u2019s huge east London store and a proposed \u00a3288m London concert hall. Alan Stanton, the British architect who chaired the RA prize jury, said the award was recognition of a practice at the height of its powers. He pointed to Diller and Scofidio\u2019s early years of conceptual practice, when they worked on art projects with visual and performance artists and musicians to produce \u201ca creative mulch\u201d. \u201cThey then applied this to architecture. They set aside a lot of the normal, accepted rules of the architectural game in order to reinvent architecture\u2019s first principles,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are building at scale here and around the world, we can begin to see how this early work has manifested itself in significant and distinguished projects.\u201d He said their work was an inspiration to younger architects and produced \u201ca deep sense of envy\u201d in more established architects including himself. Diller and Scofidio are the founding partners of the New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which started in 1981. One of their most important projects was the Blur Building, a pavilion for the 2002 Swiss Expo that featured a cloud of fog. In New York, they created the High Line, a 1.5-mile public park, and helped transform the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts. The practice is working on a major expansion of MoMA. Diller is the more public face of the practice and was the only architect included on Time magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most influential people of 2018. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Diller said they had never stopped being rebellious. \u201cBut now we are operating in a stealthier way. Rather than trying to kick the establishment walls down, we\u2019re walking in through the front door.\u201d The pair will talk about their practice when they come to the RA in May for events in connection to another of the RA\u2019s architecture awards, the Royal Academy Dorfman award, which champions rising talent. Four finalists were named on Friday: Fernanda Canales (Mexico); Alice Casey and Cian Deegan, TAKA (Ireland); Mariam Kamara, Atelier Masomi (Niger); and Boonserm Premthada, Bangkok Project Studio (Thailand). The RA\u2019s architecture awards are in their second year and part of a wider initiative by the RA to raise the profile of architects and architecture. An exhibition on Renzo Piano last year was visited by 76,000 people, and another on \u201ceco-visionaries\u201d is planned for November this year.",

      "body": "<p>The music industry has endured its share of crises in the digital era \u2013 from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/03/christmas-from-hell-caps-bad-year-for-high-street-dvd-sellers\">slow death of the CD</a> to the rise of online piracy. Now it is the turn of radio broadcasters, who face a worrying exodus among young listeners because of streaming.</p> <p>At first glance, radio listening in the UK appears robust, holding steady at around 48 million adults \u2013 88% of Britain\u2019s adult population \u2013 listening to just over 1bn hours each week. Those figures, however, belie the fact that radio is facing a crisis over youth audiences.</p> <p>Since 2010, around 840,000 15 to 24-year-olds have switched off for good, according to research from Enders Analysis. And among the 6.5 million or so who do still tune in, the amount of time they spend listening has plummeted 29% between 2010 and 2018. The problem is even more acute at the BBC, with total listening hours among 15 to 24-year-olds falling 40% over the same time period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-08T13:34:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Radio listeners\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-08T13:34:56/embed.html\">Radio listeners</a> </figure>  <p>Radio broadcasters are ringing the changes to try to keep hold of young audiences.

Among 15 to 24-year-olds, music streaming has grown rapidly to account for about a third of their listening time from about 10%. So is streaming killing the radio star?</p> <p>\u201cPeople are going to music streaming services and we are seeing younger people turning off the radio,\u201d says Gill Hind, an analyst at Enders. \u201cBut a lot of streaming is taking the place of listening to collections and CDs, not necessarily directly substituting live radio listening. Young people are still tuning in but they are listening for shorter periods each week. There are so many alternative options out there, from YouTube and gaming to Netflix and streaming music.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/spotify-buys-podcast-firms-gimlet-and-anchor-streaming-profits-music\">Spotify buys podcast firms Gimlet and Anchor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spotify\u2019s move earlier this week to spend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/spotify-buys-podcast-firms-gimlet-and-anchor-streaming-profits-music\">hundreds of millions on two podcasting companies</a> \u2013 and earmark up to $500m (\u00a3387m) for more acquisitions in the field this year \u2013 is a clear indicator that the rise and rise of podcasts looks set to be the next looming challenge for traditional radio. Spotify quantified the scale of the threat, saying it expects that over time <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-02-06/audio-first/\">20% of all listening on its service</a> will be non-music content. It currently has 207 million monthly active users.</p> <p>The digital disruption in radio is part of the same phenomenon that has already affected other market sectors \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/31/uk-broadcasters-face-advertising-tipping-point-new-study-finds\">most notably TV</a>, where viewing hours among 15 to 24-year-olds is down 45% in the UK since 2010. Siobhan Kenny, the chief executive of the industry body Radiocentre, says radio broadcasters are handling it better though.</p> <p>\u201cEvery medium has challenges with younger audiences, but radio is riding it out better than others,\u201d she said. As the radio industry has moved into the internet era, broadcasters have seized on the opportunity to launch new local and national digital-only stations, which are doing better at attracting listeners. There were 453 digital stations at the end of 2018, up from 192 in 2010.</p> <p>The industry argues that the rise of products such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/17/amazon-echo-helps-push-digital-radio-audience-past-fm\">Amazon\u2019s smart speaker Alexa will encourage people to try new stations</a> rather than bypass them by directly requesting songs, playlists and recommendations. Nonetheless, the latest figures this week from Rajar, the radio industry measurement body, showed a slight decrease in listening via online and apps in the fourth quarter, accounting for 9.4% of total weekly listening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-08T09:24:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Spotify subscribers\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2019-02-08T09:24:59/embed.html\">Spotify subscribers</a> </figure>  <p>Scott Taunton, the chief executive of Wireless, which owns stations including TalkSport and Virgin Radio, says that radio, similar to TV, has strengths that continue to make it a must-listen experience that cannot be replicated by streaming. Live sport and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/31/itv-love-island-lands-record-sponsorship-deal-with-uber-eats\">must-watch TV shows such as Love Island</a> \u2013 or in radio\u2019s case, star presenters such as Evans, keep audiences coming back.</p> <p>\u201cThe move of Chris, his first week on air, the station as a whole had digital listening hours 18 times better than in 2018,\u201d Taunton said. \u201cAnd people are definitely saying: \u2018Alexa, play TalkSport.\u2019 Smart speakers is the fastest growing piece of our audience. There is still a demand for a live radio station if you can make it relevant and something the consumer wants to listen to here and now.\u201d</p> <p>Last year proved to be the most successful in commercial radio history, where ad revenue hit a record \u00a3713m, while the BBC launched its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/20/bbc-sounds-app-angry-listeners-complaints\">new BBC Sounds app</a>, the new home for its music and radio efforts, in a bid to future-proof its radio business. There are those, however, who believe that the traditional radio industry is on borrowed time.</p> <p>\u201cThere is absolutely a generational divide,\u201d MIDiA Research\u2019s Mark Mulligan said. \u201cThe industry believes as these young people get older they will come back to traditional radio, like a life stage thing.

      "bodyText": "The music industry has endured its share of crises in the digital era \u2013 from the slow death of the CD to the rise of online piracy. Now it is the turn of radio broadcasters, who face a worrying exodus among young listeners because of streaming. At first glance, radio listening in the UK appears robust, holding steady at around 48 million adults \u2013 88% of Britain\u2019s adult population \u2013 listening to just over 1bn hours each week. Those figures, however, belie the fact that radio is facing a crisis over youth audiences. Since 2010, around 840,000 15 to 24-year-olds have switched off for good, according to research from Enders Analysis. And among the 6.5 million or so who do still tune in, the amount of time they spend listening has plummeted 29% between 2010 and 2018. The problem is even more acute at the BBC, with total listening hours among 15 to 24-year-olds falling 40% over the same time period. Radio broadcasters are ringing the changes to try to keep hold of young audiences. BBC Radio 1, the station that attracts the biggest youth audience in UK radio, has replaced Nick Grimshaw with Greg James to spice up its flagship breakfast show. Zoe Ball has taken the helm of the Radio 2 breakfast show, the biggest show on radio, after Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wireless Radio signed up her predecessor, Chris Evans, in a bid to attract new listeners to its digital-only Virgin Radio. The BBC admitted last year that it had found for the first time that 15 to 34-year-olds spent more time listening to streaming music services \u2013 such as Spotify, Apple and Amazon Music, and YouTube \u2013 than all of the BBC\u2019s radio services. Among 15 to 24-year-olds, music streaming has grown rapidly to account for about a third of their listening time from about 10%. So is streaming killing the radio star? \u201cPeople are going to music streaming services and we are seeing younger people turning off the radio,\u201d says Gill Hind, an analyst at Enders. \u201cBut a lot of streaming is taking the place of listening to collections and CDs, not necessarily directly substituting live radio listening. Young people are still tuning in but they are listening for shorter periods each week. There are so many alternative options out there, from YouTube and gaming to Netflix and streaming music.\u201d Spotify\u2019s move earlier this week to spend hundreds of millions on two podcasting companies \u2013 and earmark up to $500m (\u00a3387m) for more acquisitions in the field this year \u2013 is a clear indicator that the rise and rise of podcasts looks set to be the next looming challenge for traditional radio. Spotify quantified the scale of the threat, saying it expects that over time 20% of all listening on its service will be non-music content. It currently has 207 million monthly active users. The digital disruption in radio is part of the same phenomenon that has already affected other market sectors \u2013 most notably TV, where viewing hours among 15 to 24-year-olds is down 45% in the UK since 2010. Siobhan Kenny, the chief executive of the industry body Radiocentre, says radio broadcasters are handling it better though. \u201cEvery medium has challenges with younger audiences, but radio is riding it out better than others,\u201d she said. As the radio industry has moved into the internet era, broadcasters have seized on the opportunity to launch new local and national digital-only stations, which are doing better at attracting listeners. There were 453 digital stations at the end of 2018, up from 192 in 2010. The industry argues that the rise of products such as Amazon\u2019s smart speaker Alexa will encourage people to try new stations rather than bypass them by directly requesting songs, playlists and recommendations. Nonetheless, the latest figures this week from Rajar, the radio industry measurement body, showed a slight decrease in listening via online and apps in the fourth quarter, accounting for 9.4% of total weekly listening. Scott Taunton, the chief executive of Wireless, which owns stations including TalkSport and Virgin Radio, says that radio, similar to TV, has strengths that continue to make it a must-listen experience that cannot be replicated by streaming. Live sport and must-watch TV shows such as Love Island \u2013 or in radio\u2019s case, star presenters such as Evans, keep audiences coming back. \u201cThe move of Chris, his first week on air, the station as a whole had digital listening hours 18 times better than in 2018,\u201d Taunton said. \u201cAnd people are definitely saying: \u2018Alexa, play TalkSport.\u2019 Smart speakers is the fastest growing piece of our audience. There is still a demand for a live radio station if you can make it relevant and something the consumer wants to listen to here and now.\u201d Last year proved to be the most successful in commercial radio history, where ad revenue hit a record \u00a3713m, while the BBC launched its new BBC Sounds app, the new home for its music and radio efforts, in a bid to future-proof its radio business. There are those, however, who believe that the traditional radio industry is on borrowed time. \u201cThere is absolutely a generational divide,\u201d MIDiA Research\u2019s Mark Mulligan said. \u201cThe industry believes as these young people get older they will come back to traditional radio, like a life stage thing. But the evidence says they won\u2019t, that these are established behaviours. And the generations after them will follow suit. The audience tipping point is happening and the commercial tipping point will follow. Every shift driven by the internet ad revenues have been slow to follow audiences. When advertising on streaming services gets its house in order there will be a cliff drop for commercial radio.\u201d",

When Killer Mike meets the Bloods to tell them about Crip-a-Cola, one of the scary dudes asks: \u201cIs it vegan?\u201d<br><br>In its eccentric way, Trigger Warning is an antidote to the gloomy powerlessness many of us have lived with, waiting for Brexit to be resolved: the feeling of everything else in politics being on hold while that one big issue that renders all others insignificant rolls on. That\u2019s an instinct that needs to be fought, and here is a reminder both that broad, fundamental issues remain live, and that nothing can nullify the political significance of how we think, what we buy and how we interact with our fellow citizens every day.

It\u2019s not obvious what is achieved by showing jobseekers specially made pornography that incorporates carpentry and plumbing tuition \u2013 ie classic porn, except the repair guy really does fix the washing machine \u2013 but the guinea pigs\u2019 reaction to the finished video is a riot, and the contention that schooling ought to be more vocational is worthy of further thought. And in the episode where Killer Mike holds X Factor-style auditions to create a rap crew made up of minority campaigners, the decision to include a Trump supporter who refers to himself as a \u201cwhite N-word\u201d is a bad mistake, but the ensuing farce brings with it several huge, guilty laughs. Killer Mike\u2019s comic timing enhances even the most contrived scenes, such as when he takes a gang of Crips to see a bank manager, hoping for a loan to help them monetise their brand via the sale of Crip-a-Cola fizzy pop. That episode also contains the starkest example of the show\u2019s most pleasing theme, which is that people are much more woke than you might think. When Killer Mike meets the Bloods to tell them about Crip-a-Cola, one of the scary dudes asks: \u201cIs it vegan?\u201d In its eccentric way, Trigger Warning is an antidote to the gloomy powerlessness many of us have lived with, waiting for Brexit to be resolved: the feeling of everything else in politics being on hold while that one big issue that renders all others insignificant rolls on. That\u2019s an instinct that needs to be fought, and here is a reminder both that broad, fundamental issues remain live, and that nothing can nullify the political significance of how we think, what we buy and how we interact with our fellow citizens every day. Dope-hazy and rough-edged as it is, Trigger Warning is a wake-up call.",

While here the production is shared between the likes of Martin, Tommy Brown and Happy Perez, there\u2019s a through line sonically \u2013 a kind of off-kilter, metallic eeriness \u2013 that ties it together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/26/ariana-grande-resilience\">Ariana Grande: a beacon of resilience in her worst and biggest year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crucially, at the centre of it all, perhaps for the first time, is Grande.

The themes of self-confession and self-care run throughout the album but there are playful moments, too. The springy, joyous NASA, which harks back to her debut, 2013\u2019s Yours Truly, takes the theme of planetary exploration and turns it into a plea for space (geddit?), while the dancehall-tinged Bloodline, which opens with a quote from her grandma, posits the idea that maybe it\u2019s best to just see how things go relationship-wise and getting engaged after a few months isn\u2019t essential. The closing Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored, meanwhile, marries a subterranean click beat and an \u2019N Sync sample with a cheeky lyric about, well, impatiently waiting to hook up with someone who isn\u2019t single. Arriving less than six months after Sweetener, Thank U, Next could have felt hurried, a dashed-off cash-in to secure Grande\u2019s status as the world\u2019s biggest pop star. Instead, the braggadocious, ice-cold low point 7 Rings aside, it feels more cohesive, the result of a burst of creativity and a prevailing mood as opposed to Sweetener\u2019s crude split down the middle between Pharrell\u2019s trademark sinewy sound and the more pop leanings of Max Martin and his team. While here the production is shared between the likes of Martin, Tommy Brown and Happy Perez, there\u2019s a through line sonically \u2013 a kind of off-kilter, metallic eeriness \u2013 that ties it together. Crucially, at the centre of it all, perhaps for the first time, is Grande. As with Rihanna\u2019s Anti, this feels like the work of a pop star previously happy to act as conduit for other people, finally working out who they are and what they want to say. Here, Grande finds her voice.",

It ought to be an ideal match \u2013 a pianist of impeccable Mozartean credentials and an orchestra of acute sensitivity and musical awareness; the buoyancy of the string textures, defined in the taut springy rhythms of the opening tutti of the F major work, combined with the tangy individualism of the woodwind, suggested the perfect canvas for Uchida\u2019s artistry. There was much about the performances to admire and enjoy, but though everything was immaculate, it seemed to be uninvolving \u2013 high-class routine rather than fresh-minted creative music-making. Uchida was nominally conducting the concertos from the keyboard, though in fact her direction was more generalised than specific, and her liberal use of the soft pedal on her Steinway, even for the piano\u2019s very first entry in the F major concerto, cast a veil over too much of the solo playing, robbing it of immediacy. Of course there were beautiful moments \u2013 the unaccompanied opening of the slow movement of the D minor concerto was a reminder of the expressive simplicity that Uchida can conjure at her best \u2013 but not enough of them, and not enough either of the cross-fertilisation of ideas you would expect from a pianist and an orchestra of this pedigree.",

      "body": "<p>In 1946, Lee Miller visited Dorothea Tanning and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ernst\" title=\"\">Max Ernst</a> in Sedona, Arizona, and took 400 photographs of the desert and her hosts. Her most famous image enlarges Ernst into a giant, striding forwards out of the picture towards us, his expression part inspired, part demonic. Tanning gazes up at him from just behind, caught in profile with her white skirt billowing, shrunk into a compact Alice in Wonderland. Is the photograph observing the power dynamics of the men and women of surrealism, with which Miller was all too familiar? Or is it more concerned with offering us a surrealist desert fairytale?</p> <p>It was appropriate to depict Tanning as Alice. There is an Alice-like quality to her self-portrait in <em>Birthday</em>, the picture that established her as a painter and brought about the relationship with Ernst when he arrived at her New York studio in 1942, dispatched by his then wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/26/big-picture-peggy-guggenheim-venice-stefan-moses\" title=\"\">Peggy Guggenheim</a> to prospect for work to include in an exhibition of female artists. Tanning showed him her painting and asked what she should call it; Ernst named it <em>Birthday</em> and moved in with her a week later. The painting depicts a bare-breasted young woman gazing blankly out with a kind of all\u2011knowing innocence. Wearing an open Elizabethan-style dress with seaweed hanging from her skirt, Tanning resembles Alice but also resembles the Gryphon, the upright winged griffin Alice encounters on her travels. In the background are the endlessly opening doors that would populate Tanning\u2019s paintings over the next decades.</p> <p>Ernst was another artist fascinated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lewiscarroll\" title=\"\">Lewis Carroll</a>\u2019s story. In 1941 he portrayed her as a naked grown-up woman hidden within a giant rocky growth. Tanning\u2019s and Ernst\u2019s paintings speak easily to each other, though Ernst\u2019s Alice is modelled on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/25/my-wild-child-cousin-the-surrealist-painter-leonora-carrington\" title=\"\">Leonora Carrington</a>, his lover before Guggenheim. He liked younger women he could see as Alice-like figures \u2013 Tanning was born 19 years after Ernst, in 1910, and Carrington in 1917. But though younger, these were grown-up women. What of the more dangerously pubescent incarnation of Alice? It was left to Tanning herself to bring her into being in paint.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a41553e40cd0ac4bd4a4c064ad8f866b7903032b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a41553e40cd0ac4bd4a4c064ad8f866b7903032b/0_0_2200_2360/932.jpg\" alt=\"Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning, Oak Creek Canyon (1946).\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning, Oak Creek Canyon (1946).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Miller/Lee Miller Archives, England 2013. All rights reserved</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Tanning, the move to Arizona in 1946 seems to have enabled a return to the erotic fantasies of her own adolescence, trapped among Lutherans in Galesburg, Illinois. During the decade after the war, she amassed an extraordinary body of paintings depicting girlhood as a time of dangerous appetites and uncanny erotic power. Now these paintings have been collected for a major retrospective of Tanning\u2019s work, which is about to open at Tate Modern. They are pictures that Miller would have seen in Tanning\u2019s Arizona studio, so perhaps what Miller was doing in her photograph was to imagine Tanning as the subject of one of her own paintings. Most famous is the 1943 <em>Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</em>, which portrays two girls in the door-lined corridor of a hotel. One leans back, eyes shut, in a dreamy reverie, her blond hair lining her back and her bare stomach pushed forward, suggesting the body of an older woman. The other stands upright, her hair flying above her head with a determined energy that gives the picture its charge. On the floor there is a giant sunflower, blown in from Arizona, its petals lining the staircase. At the edge of the picture, one of the doors opens into what could be a sunlit desert or a burning inferno. If we are witnessing the girls at the point of becoming, then it\u2019s the moment before an explosion and there are violent, unseen forces at play.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Was Tanning complicit in the aspects of surrealism that nowadays might be seen as morally questionable, even paedophilic?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his 1945 meditation <em>Arcanum 17 </em>Andr\u00e9 Breton celebrated the <em>femme-enfant</em>, the pubescent girl who \u201csends fissures through the best organised systems because nothing has been able to subdue or encompass her\u201d. He might have been thinking of the determined figures in Tanning\u2019s 1942 <em>Children\u2019s Games</em>, ripping off the wallpaper in a shadowy corridor to reveal fleshy protrusions beneath. In her autobiography, Tanning wrote later that during her adolescence in Galesburg \u201cnothing happened but the wallpaper\u201d. Reimagined 20 years later, the wallpaper itself becomes a potent, living force.</p> <p>It\u2019s this feeling, that the fantasies of girlhood are strewn before us on the canvas, that gives these paintings their power, and the feeling is not without its ethical complications. Was Tanning complicit in the aspects of surrealism that nowadays might be seen as morally questionable, even paedophilic? Yes, she probably was. Certainly <em>The Guest Room </em>(1950-2) makes difficult viewing when we know that the model for the naked pubescent girl who scowls at us from the open door was reluctant to pose nude for the picture, and that it was only after the sittings that Tanning painted her naked breasts, imagining them into being. But then this is hardly meant to be a morally straightforward piece. Behind the door the girl is shadowed by a blindfolded doppelganger; at the back of the room the figure of death approaches; in the bed another girl clasps a sinister amputated doll. The painting is undoubtedly erotic. It\u2019s swathed in the shimmering fabric that drapes its way across a lot of Tanning\u2019s pictures at this time, suggesting a kind of tactile ease at odds with the subject matter. But this is a dangerous eros, where a young girl\u2019s fantasies can easily render her vulnerable, at the will of a more malevolent desire.</p> <p>Tanning made this desire explicit in a story she wrote at this time called \u201cAbyss\u201d, published in 1949 and included in manuscript in the show. Here Albert, a house guest at a mansion in the desert, encounters his host\u2019s seven-year-old daughter in her rooms at the top of the house. The rooms have the sumptuous, treasure-trove feel of a Tanning painting, filled to bursting with \u201coutlandish furniture and bricabrac\u201d, strewn with heaps of dusty birds\u2019 wings and at once \u201cscalded\u201d and \u201cpurified\u201d by the light of a gigantic chandelier. Summoned by the child, \u201cher bearing calm and imperious\u201d, he is invited to sit down. When he refuses, she instructs him calmly to eat her dinner. In return, she will show him her memory box. Caught in a kind of trance, Albert sits at her little table and eats her food. At the end he looks at her: \u201cHis gaze devoured the little red mouth, the throat, the hair, the white dress, as his mouth had devoured the plateful of food.\u201d Then he looks through her treasures, which turn out to be real eyes given to her by a friendly lion. Albert declares loyalty and love to the girl, scalded and purified in his turn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95d7e8ea42aa89db9c41b6776db88ce8e5abf640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d7e8ea42aa89db9c41b6776db88ce8e5abf640/0_0_3720_2488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ho\u0302tel du Pavot, Chambre 202 (1970-1973).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ho\u0302tel du Pavot, Chambre 202 (1970-1973).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DACS, 2018</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an enthralling story, and its strengths illuminate the strengths of the paintings: the way that curiosity about the inner life combines with confidence that the visual can be enough. The two-dimensional world of painterly surface, the visual depiction of a glittering eyeball in a messily sumptuous room surrounded by a frightening desert, are a story in themselves and don\u2019t require psychological explanation. Yet the people who inhabit them are living figures, more so than in the work of most other surrealists. Tanning\u2019s literary characters are more alive than those of Breton\u2019s <em>Nadja</em> (his 1928 novel about following a young woman around Paris); the girls in her paintings have a greater feeling of bodily life than those in Ernst\u2019s or Carrington\u2019s. </p> <p>The Tate show\u2019s curator Alyce Mahon makes a compelling case for late surrealism in the catalogue, reminding us that it was a movement that continued to flourish and to mutate after the second world war. Tanning herself had experienced the beginning of the war first hand: she was holidaying in France when it broke out and made her way across Europe. For Tanning and Ernst, the war provided a backdrop for the realisation that surrealism had been right in its diagnosis of the blastedness of contemporary culture, and the death-dealing nature of conventional morality and institutional life. Tanning emerges convincingly here as a late surrealist who saw how much further surrealism could still be taken, finding in the desert landscape of Arizona a rich setting to juxtapose desire and violence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tanning found in the desert landscape of Arizona a rich setting to juxtapose desire and violence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then in 1955, her style changed, becoming more gestural and abstract. In 1949, Tanning and Ernst started to spend more time in Paris, eventually moving there in the 50s. In Paris it was hard to ignore abstract expressionism and away from the desert she had greater freedom to reinvent her style and palette. In her autobiography she wrote that \u201cmy canvases literally splintered\u201d. The pictures grew, and the brush strokes became larger and messier. These are more nebulous images but they are still populated by human bodies, whose limbs and torsos stretch across the canvas. In the 1980s some of the girls of the earlier paintings seem to reappear in new guises. There are the winding figures in her <em>Daughters </em>(1983), their muscles caught mid-motion in the violence of becoming. Her yellow <em>Door 84</em> from 1984 feels like a De Kooning with two of Tanning\u2019s girls thrown on to it. One splays her legs suggestively, the other traverses the picture as though mid-flight. Both are bounded by the wooden door that she attached to the canvas, giving the doors of her earlier work a kind of stubborn actuality that takes its language, playfully, from the idiom of her new contemporaries, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01adc6b6509fbda7ac2ea89dfc5922968f5791e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01adc6b6509fbda7ac2ea89dfc5922968f5791e9/0_297_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nue Couche\u0301e (1969-70).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nue Couche\u0301e (1969-70).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DACS, 2018</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the 1970s and 80s Tanning was travelling artistically in two directions at once. At the same time as she was making these abstract paintings, she was returning to surrealism in the soft sculptures she started to sew in 1969. Listening to a performance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/may/07/contemporary-music-guide-karlheinz-stockhausen\" title=\"\">Stockhausen</a>\u2019s <em>Hymnen</em> at the Maison de la Radio in Paris, she found that spinning among the unearthly sounds \u201cwere the earthy, even organic shapes that I would make, had to make, out of cloth and wool\u201d, blending the abstract and the everyday as in Stockhausen\u2019s sound world (his piece includes cheering crowds and quacking ducks). She visited flea markets and went through her own wardrobe and found a lot of tweed and stuffing. Using table tennis balls for the bones on the spine, she created a series of human figures. Her <em>Nue Couch\u00e9e </em>(1969) is like a more intimate version of a Henry Moore sculpture, with an exaggeratedly curved back wrapping around lengthily twined limbs.</p> <p>The high point of this work is <em>Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot</em>, an installation of sculpted figures made in 1970-3 and included as its own room in the Tate exhibition. Here is once again the wallpaper of Tanning\u2019s childhood, ripped open as in <em>Children\u2019s Games</em>. Two bulging decapitated nudes clamber out of it, one with a foot just poised to emerge. On the floor there are a series of tweedy bodies caught in embraces with items of furniture. One lies back on a table, stretched in sensual languor. Another burrows into a chair with an intentness that easily evokes the feeling of a body homed by touch. Tanning\u2019s joy in making these is evident. She admitted to finding \u201cthe brutal slashing of fabrics an incomparable pleasure in itself\u201d. There\u2019s such certainty in the shapes and their relation to each other, and yet also a literal throwaway quality: she made these objects knowing that they\u2019d decay. They are now extremely fragile and this may be the last time they can all be shown.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/02/dorothea-tanning-obituary\" title=\"\">Tanning died in 2012</a> aged 101. Her final decade was remarkably productive. She published two volumes of poetry and a novel, <em>Chasm</em>, which reworked the material from \u201cAbyss\u201d (and which Virago is now reissuing). Her late flower paintings are represented in the Tate by the delicately lovely <em>Crepuscula glacialis </em>(1997), which shows an ethereal female body floating behind a series of unfolding petals. This has something in common with Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work, but the eroticism here is more diffuse, evoking less the physicality of sex than a more dreamy sensuousness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8cdb3b745e610c0b259e263fcd822ee2c952e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8cdb3b745e610c0b259e263fcd822ee2c952e88/0_876_1902_2376/801.jpg\" alt=\"A detail from Children\u2019s Games (1942).\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail from Children\u2019s Games (1942).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DACS, 2018</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Tanning\u2019s <em>Chasm</em> the original story becomes the centre of a remarkably suspenseful tale of sex and violence in the desert.

      "bodyText": "In 1946, Lee Miller visited Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst in Sedona, Arizona, and took 400 photographs of the desert and her hosts. Her most famous image enlarges Ernst into a giant, striding forwards out of the picture towards us, his expression part inspired, part demonic. Tanning gazes up at him from just behind, caught in profile with her white skirt billowing, shrunk into a compact Alice in Wonderland. Is the photograph observing the power dynamics of the men and women of surrealism, with which Miller was all too familiar? Or is it more concerned with offering us a surrealist desert fairytale? It was appropriate to depict Tanning as Alice. There is an Alice-like quality to her self-portrait in Birthday, the picture that established her as a painter and brought about the relationship with Ernst when he arrived at her New York studio in 1942, dispatched by his then wife Peggy Guggenheim to prospect for work to include in an exhibition of female artists. Tanning showed him her painting and asked what she should call it; Ernst named it Birthday and moved in with her a week later. The painting depicts a bare-breasted young woman gazing blankly out with a kind of all\u2011knowing innocence. Wearing an open Elizabethan-style dress with seaweed hanging from her skirt, Tanning resembles Alice but also resembles the Gryphon, the upright winged griffin Alice encounters on her travels. In the background are the endlessly opening doors that would populate Tanning\u2019s paintings over the next decades. Ernst was another artist fascinated by Lewis Carroll\u2019s story. In 1941 he portrayed her as a naked grown-up woman hidden within a giant rocky growth. Tanning\u2019s and Ernst\u2019s paintings speak easily to each other, though Ernst\u2019s Alice is modelled on Leonora Carrington, his lover before Guggenheim. He liked younger women he could see as Alice-like figures \u2013 Tanning was born 19 years after Ernst, in 1910, and Carrington in 1917. But though younger, these were grown-up women. What of the more dangerously pubescent incarnation of Alice? It was left to Tanning herself to bring her into being in paint. For Tanning, the move to Arizona in 1946 seems to have enabled a return to the erotic fantasies of her own adolescence, trapped among Lutherans in Galesburg, Illinois. During the decade after the war, she amassed an extraordinary body of paintings depicting girlhood as a time of dangerous appetites and uncanny erotic power. Now these paintings have been collected for a major retrospective of Tanning\u2019s work, which is about to open at Tate Modern. They are pictures that Miller would have seen in Tanning\u2019s Arizona studio, so perhaps what Miller was doing in her photograph was to imagine Tanning as the subject of one of her own paintings. Most famous is the 1943 Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, which portrays two girls in the door-lined corridor of a hotel. One leans back, eyes shut, in a dreamy reverie, her blond hair lining her back and her bare stomach pushed forward, suggesting the body of an older woman. The other stands upright, her hair flying above her head with a determined energy that gives the picture its charge. On the floor there is a giant sunflower, blown in from Arizona, its petals lining the staircase. At the edge of the picture, one of the doors opens into what could be a sunlit desert or a burning inferno. If we are witnessing the girls at the point of becoming, then it\u2019s the moment before an explosion and there are violent, unseen forces at play. In his 1945 meditation Arcanum 17 Andr\u00e9 Breton celebrated the femme-enfant, the pubescent girl who \u201csends fissures through the best organised systems because nothing has been able to subdue or encompass her\u201d. He might have been thinking of the determined figures in Tanning\u2019s 1942 Children\u2019s Games, ripping off the wallpaper in a shadowy corridor to reveal fleshy protrusions beneath. In her autobiography, Tanning wrote later that during her adolescence in Galesburg \u201cnothing happened but the wallpaper\u201d. Reimagined 20 years later, the wallpaper itself becomes a potent, living force. It\u2019s this feeling, that the fantasies of girlhood are strewn before us on the canvas, that gives these paintings their power, and the feeling is not without its ethical complications. Was Tanning complicit in the aspects of surrealism that nowadays might be seen as morally questionable, even paedophilic? Yes, she probably was. Certainly The Guest Room (1950-2) makes difficult viewing when we know that the model for the naked pubescent girl who scowls at us from the open door was reluctant to pose nude for the picture, and that it was only after the sittings that Tanning painted her naked breasts, imagining them into being. But then this is hardly meant to be a morally straightforward piece. Behind the door the girl is shadowed by a blindfolded doppelganger; at the back of the room the figure of death approaches; in the bed another girl clasps a sinister amputated doll. The painting is undoubtedly erotic. It\u2019s swathed in the shimmering fabric that drapes its way across a lot of Tanning\u2019s pictures at this time, suggesting a kind of tactile ease at odds with the subject matter. But this is a dangerous eros, where a young girl\u2019s fantasies can easily render her vulnerable, at the will of a more malevolent desire. Tanning made this desire explicit in a story she wrote at this time called \u201cAbyss\u201d, published in 1949 and included in manuscript in the show. Here Albert, a house guest at a mansion in the desert, encounters his host\u2019s seven-year-old daughter in her rooms at the top of the house. The rooms have the sumptuous, treasure-trove feel of a Tanning painting, filled to bursting with \u201coutlandish furniture and bricabrac\u201d, strewn with heaps of dusty birds\u2019 wings and at once \u201cscalded\u201d and \u201cpurified\u201d by the light of a gigantic chandelier. Summoned by the child, \u201cher bearing calm and imperious\u201d, he is invited to sit down. When he refuses, she instructs him calmly to eat her dinner. In return, she will show him her memory box. Caught in a kind of trance, Albert sits at her little table and eats her food. At the end he looks at her: \u201cHis gaze devoured the little red mouth, the throat, the hair, the white dress, as his mouth had devoured the plateful of food.\u201d Then he looks through her treasures, which turn out to be real eyes given to her by a friendly lion. Albert declares loyalty and love to the girl, scalded and purified in his turn. It\u2019s an enthralling story, and its strengths illuminate the strengths of the paintings: the way that curiosity about the inner life combines with confidence that the visual can be enough. The two-dimensional world of painterly surface, the visual depiction of a glittering eyeball in a messily sumptuous room surrounded by a frightening desert, are a story in themselves and don\u2019t require psychological explanation. Yet the people who inhabit them are living figures, more so than in the work of most other surrealists. Tanning\u2019s literary characters are more alive than those of Breton\u2019s Nadja (his 1928 novel about following a young woman around Paris); the girls in her paintings have a greater feeling of bodily life than those in Ernst\u2019s or Carrington\u2019s. The Tate show\u2019s curator Alyce Mahon makes a compelling case for late surrealism in the catalogue, reminding us that it was a movement that continued to flourish and to mutate after the second world war. Tanning herself had experienced the beginning of the war first hand: she was holidaying in France when it broke out and made her way across Europe. For Tanning and Ernst, the war provided a backdrop for the realisation that surrealism had been right in its diagnosis of the blastedness of contemporary culture, and the death-dealing nature of conventional morality and institutional life. Tanning emerges convincingly here as a late surrealist who saw how much further surrealism could still be taken, finding in the desert landscape of Arizona a rich setting to juxtapose desire and violence. Then in 1955, her style changed, becoming more gestural and abstract. In 1949, Tanning and Ernst started to spend more time in Paris, eventually moving there in the 50s. In Paris it was hard to ignore abstract expressionism and away from the desert she had greater freedom to reinvent her style and palette. In her autobiography she wrote that \u201cmy canvases literally splintered\u201d. The pictures grew, and the brush strokes became larger and messier. These are more nebulous images but they are still populated by human bodies, whose limbs and torsos stretch across the canvas. In the 1980s some of the girls of the earlier paintings seem to reappear in new guises. There are the winding figures in her Daughters (1983), their muscles caught mid-motion in the violence of becoming. Her yellow Door 84 from 1984 feels like a De Kooning with two of Tanning\u2019s girls thrown on to it. One splays her legs suggestively, the other traverses the picture as though mid-flight. Both are bounded by the wooden door that she attached to the canvas, giving the doors of her earlier work a kind of stubborn actuality that takes its language, playfully, from the idiom of her new contemporaries, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. During the 1970s and 80s Tanning was travelling artistically in two directions at once. At the same time as she was making these abstract paintings, she was returning to surrealism in the soft sculptures she started to sew in 1969. Listening to a performance of Stockhausen\u2019s Hymnen at the Maison de la Radio in Paris, she found that spinning among the unearthly sounds \u201cwere the earthy, even organic shapes that I would make, had to make, out of cloth and wool\u201d, blending the abstract and the everyday as in Stockhausen\u2019s sound world (his piece includes cheering crowds and quacking ducks). She visited flea markets and went through her own wardrobe and found a lot of tweed and stuffing. Using table tennis balls for the bones on the spine, she created a series of human figures. Her Nue Couch\u00e9e (1969) is like a more intimate version of a Henry Moore sculpture, with an exaggeratedly curved back wrapping around lengthily twined limbs. The high point of this work is Chambre 202, H\u00f4tel du Pavot, an installation of sculpted figures made in 1970-3 and included as its own room in the Tate exhibition. Here is once again the wallpaper of Tanning\u2019s childhood, ripped open as in Children\u2019s Games. Two bulging decapitated nudes clamber out of it, one with a foot just poised to emerge. On the floor there are a series of tweedy bodies caught in embraces with items of furniture. One lies back on a table, stretched in sensual languor. Another burrows into a chair with an intentness that easily evokes the feeling of a body homed by touch. Tanning\u2019s joy in making these is evident. She admitted to finding \u201cthe brutal slashing of fabrics an incomparable pleasure in itself\u201d. There\u2019s such certainty in the shapes and their relation to each other, and yet also a literal throwaway quality: she made these objects knowing that they\u2019d decay. They are now extremely fragile and this may be the last time they can all be shown. Tanning died in 2012 aged 101. Her final decade was remarkably productive. She published two volumes of poetry and a novel, Chasm, which reworked the material from \u201cAbyss\u201d (and which Virago is now reissuing). Her late flower paintings are represented in the Tate by the delicately lovely Crepuscula glacialis (1997), which shows an ethereal female body floating behind a series of unfolding petals. This has something in common with Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work, but the eroticism here is more diffuse, evoking less the physicality of sex than a more dreamy sensuousness. In Tanning\u2019s Chasm the original story becomes the centre of a remarkably suspenseful tale of sex and violence in the desert. Looking back on the landscape half a century later, Tanning expanded the descriptions in loving detail. \u201cThe desert is full to bursting,\u201d the heroine Destina\u2019s great-grandmother says, \u201cthe sand talks to you, but its words don\u2019t rhyme.\u201d The climax of the story comes when Albert and his fiancee Nadine confront Destina\u2019s friend the lion, who comes to symbolise nature in its raw power: \u201ca cruel, laughing force extravagantly beyond her notions and, above all, indifferent to her existence\u201d. This results in a series of deaths, inside and outside the house, which bring the feeling that Tanning has written away surrealism, destroyed it in a bloodbath and then called in the police to clear away the remains. At the end, Destina is left with only her ordinary girlhood, brutally removed from the fantasy world of her past. Now when she visits the desert she finds \u201ca piece of dream broken off the rock of herself\u201d. The nonagenarian Tanning seems here to be confronting her earlier paintings. That late surrealism still needs rescuing by curators and critics is perhaps not a sign of its defeat but of the breadth and pervasiveness of its triumph. Could we have Pablo Picasso or Jackson Pollock without surrealism? What about David Lynch, JG Ballard or Angela Carter? As an influence, it\u2019s easy to give her a crucial place in the canon of feminist art. Louise Bourgeois was born just a year later than Tanning but only started to sew after Tanning had exhibited her first sculptures; think too of the role of sewing in the work of Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas, whose Nud Cycladic (2010) presents a series of twisted forms made using stuffed tights.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes things in football just happen. The most extraordinary victories can be achieved by teams whose tactical schemes have slipped, forgotten, from practicality within a few minutes of kick-off. Everybody has a plan until Raheem Sterling runs in behind.</p> \n<p>As Manchester City prepare for the arrival of Chelsea on Sunday, the temptation is to go back to that Saturday evening in December when Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/08/chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">became the first to beat Pep Guardiola\u2019s</a> in the league this season. What did he do then to unsettle the league champions?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/07/manchester-city-liverpool-bernardo-silva\">Liverpool slips have given Manchester City mental lift, says Bernardo Silva</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To which the answer is: not much. Sarri himself was honest about that after the game. He had meant to press City, to rattle them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/17/manchester-city-napoli-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">as his Napoli side twice had</a> in the Champions League in 2017-18. City ended up winning home and away, but both matches had been thrilling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/01/napoli-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in neither had they looked comfortable</a>. This is the gamblers\u2019 approach, the one favoured (most of the time) by J\u00fcrgen Klopp: try to impose yourself, press them high up the pitch, make City\u2019s defenders work at stopping you. The strategy risks being caught on the counter but it also has the best chance of exposing City\u2019s one real vulnerability: defending.</p> \n<p>But Chelsea did not do that. City pressed remarkably well. Fernandinho, playing higher than usual, stifled Jorginho and, as City kept winning the ball back high up the pitch, they kept generating five-on-four breaks. The front three of Sterling, operating as a false nine, flanked by Riyad Mahrez and Leroy San\u00e9, had the pace and movement to create chances, but the absence of a calculating finisher of the quality of Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who was injured, perhaps prevented them taking full advantage.</p> \n<p>Having little option, Chelsea dropped deeper. Without space to attack behind the defensive line, City found it harder to create opportunities. Mahrez drifted off the left to a more central role, presumably in part so he could sit on Jorginho so Fernandinho was not sucked too far from his position protecting the heart of City\u2019s defence. That, in turn, denied David Luiz a simple short pass to his playmaker in midfield, and so he was forced to look long.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec415144-8a01-4474-89ef-b2c4da369a72\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Manchester City (86 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>24 Apr </b>Man Utd (a)<br><b>28 Apr&nbsp;</b>Burnley (a)<br><b>4 May&nbsp;</b>Leicester (h)<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Brighton (a)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Liverpool (85 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>21 Apr&nbsp;</b>Cardiff (a)&nbsp;<br><b>26 Apr&nbsp;</b>Huddersfield (h)<br><b>5 May&nbsp;</b>Newcastle (a)&nbsp;<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Wolves (h)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There are legitimate doubts about David Luiz\u2019s defensive capacities, particularly in a back four, but his long-range passing is exceptional. One such ball out to Pedro just before half-time hit City at their weakest point. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/oct/06/liverpool-manchester-city-jurgen-klopp-pep-guardiiola-full-backs\" title=\"\">Louis van Gaal pointed out</a>, the greatest vulnerability of Guardiola teams is (or at least was; there has since been evidence of a change of approach) their habit of pushing both full-backs forward simultaneously. That created the opening, as Pedro laid in Willian who had got behind Kyle Walker, and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, having found space between the attacking and defensive bands of City\u2019s side, seized the opportunity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd35b27a542d3b0ac9bf0549c87e79981cfa8a3d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd35b27a542d3b0ac9bf0549c87e79981cfa8a3d/0_172_5146_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A long pass from David Luiz helped Chelsea beat Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A long pass from David Luiz helped Chelsea beat Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Atkins/Offside/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The second half took a very different pattern. City seemed weirdly flat \u2013 the first indication of a problem that would recur when they came under pressure against Crystal Palace, Leicester and Newcastle \u2013 and Chelsea seemed more consciously to look to use long passes in behind Fabian Delph, Kant\u00e9 linking up repeatedly with Pedro on the right.</p> \n<p>Which tells us what for Sunday? Perhaps most telling is the fact that Chelsea do not have to press high to win games. Sarri is notably intransigent, insisting on trying to play his way whatever the circumstances but this, surely, is an occasion for compromise. Certainly he cannot risk allowing City the sort of freedom they had in the first 20 minutes of the meeting at Stamford Bridge when Fernandinho overwhelmed Jorginho \u2013 and may also recall that when his Napoli lost 2-1 at the Etihad in 2017, it was City\u2019s opening blitz that did for them.</p> \n<p>There will be obvious differences from the game at Stamford Bridge. Both then played with a false nine; with Ag\u00fcero fit and in form for City and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn arrived at Chelsea from Milan, neither is likely to on Sunday. But the issue of City\u2019s full-backs remains an intriguing one \u2013 particularly because that is an area where Guardiola, who in his public pronouncements at least can seem at times just as inflexible as Sarri, has begun to reconsider.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Aymeric Laporte can get forward \u2013 as he did to set up City\u2019s first-minute goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/03/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Arsenal last Sunday</a>, \u2013 but he is a natural centre-back and so far more defensively reliable than Benjamin Mendy, who is injured anyway, or Delph. He can tuck in at left-back, becoming a third central defender in effect when City have the ball, which in turn gives Walker licence to get forward on the right. Given how adept David Luiz is at that long sweeping diagonal from left to right, it seems reasonable to expect Laporte to operate as a relatively defensive left-back to caution against the sort of move that brought Chelsea such joy in that game in December.</p> \n<p>There are lessons from that first meeting, of course, but the idea Sarri had a masterplan for City that brought success is misleading. Rather his side were fortunate early on and then had the wit to adapt to circumstances \u2013 which does not sound much like Sarriball at all. But then it does not sound much like City either.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes things in football just happen. The most extraordinary victories can be achieved by teams whose tactical schemes have slipped, forgotten, from practicality within a few minutes of kick-off. Everybody has a plan until Raheem Sterling runs in behind. As Manchester City prepare for the arrival of Chelsea on Sunday, the temptation is to go back to that Saturday evening in December when Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side became the first to beat Pep Guardiola\u2019s in the league this season. What did he do then to unsettle the league champions? To which the answer is: not much. Sarri himself was honest about that after the game. He had meant to press City, to rattle them as his Napoli side twice had in the Champions League in 2017-18. City ended up winning home and away, but both matches had been thrilling and in neither had they looked comfortable. This is the gamblers\u2019 approach, the one favoured (most of the time) by J\u00fcrgen Klopp: try to impose yourself, press them high up the pitch, make City\u2019s defenders work at stopping you. The strategy risks being caught on the counter but it also has the best chance of exposing City\u2019s one real vulnerability: defending. But Chelsea did not do that. City pressed remarkably well. Fernandinho, playing higher than usual, stifled Jorginho and, as City kept winning the ball back high up the pitch, they kept generating five-on-four breaks. The front three of Sterling, operating as a false nine, flanked by Riyad Mahrez and Leroy San\u00e9, had the pace and movement to create chances, but the absence of a calculating finisher of the quality of Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who was injured, perhaps prevented them taking full advantage. Having little option, Chelsea dropped deeper. Without space to attack behind the defensive line, City found it harder to create opportunities. Mahrez drifted off the left to a more central role, presumably in part so he could sit on Jorginho so Fernandinho was not sucked too far from his position protecting the heart of City\u2019s defence. That, in turn, denied David Luiz a simple short pass to his playmaker in midfield, and so he was forced to look long. There are legitimate doubts about David Luiz\u2019s defensive capacities, particularly in a back four, but his long-range passing is exceptional. One such ball out to Pedro just before half-time hit City at their weakest point. As Louis van Gaal pointed out, the greatest vulnerability of Guardiola teams is (or at least was; there has since been evidence of a change of approach) their habit of pushing both full-backs forward simultaneously. That created the opening, as Pedro laid in Willian who had got behind Kyle Walker, and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, having found space between the attacking and defensive bands of City\u2019s side, seized the opportunity. The second half took a very different pattern. City seemed weirdly flat \u2013 the first indication of a problem that would recur when they came under pressure against Crystal Palace, Leicester and Newcastle \u2013 and Chelsea seemed more consciously to look to use long passes in behind Fabian Delph, Kant\u00e9 linking up repeatedly with Pedro on the right. Which tells us what for Sunday? Perhaps most telling is the fact that Chelsea do not have to press high to win games. Sarri is notably intransigent, insisting on trying to play his way whatever the circumstances but this, surely, is an occasion for compromise. Certainly he cannot risk allowing City the sort of freedom they had in the first 20 minutes of the meeting at Stamford Bridge when Fernandinho overwhelmed Jorginho \u2013 and may also recall that when his Napoli lost 2-1 at the Etihad in 2017, it was City\u2019s opening blitz that did for them. There will be obvious differences from the game at Stamford Bridge. Both then played with a false nine; with Ag\u00fcero fit and in form for City and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn arrived at Chelsea from Milan, neither is likely to on Sunday. But the issue of City\u2019s full-backs remains an intriguing one \u2013 particularly because that is an area where Guardiola, who in his public pronouncements at least can seem at times just as inflexible as Sarri, has begun to reconsider. Aymeric Laporte can get forward \u2013 as he did to set up City\u2019s first-minute goal against Arsenal last Sunday, \u2013 but he is a natural centre-back and so far more defensively reliable than Benjamin Mendy, who is injured anyway, or Delph. He can tuck in at left-back, becoming a third central defender in effect when City have the ball, which in turn gives Walker licence to get forward on the right. Given how adept David Luiz is at that long sweeping diagonal from left to right, it seems reasonable to expect Laporte to operate as a relatively defensive left-back to caution against the sort of move that brought Chelsea such joy in that game in December. There are lessons from that first meeting, of course, but the idea Sarri had a masterplan for City that brought success is misleading. Rather his side were fortunate early on and then had the wit to adapt to circumstances \u2013 which does not sound much like Sarriball at all. But then it does not sound much like City either.",

Three empires have conflicting beliefs and rituals, and the destiny of the world is in the hands of three women: Queen Sabran, whose existence some believe is paramount in keeping the Nameless One and its spawn from ravaging the world; Ead, her lady-in-waiting, who is charged with protecting her queen from assassins; and Tan\u00e9, a sparky dragon-rider from the east.

      "bodyText": "In Golden State (Century, \u00a314.99), Ben H Winters posits a dystopian future California where the notion of truth is all important; anyone caught lying faces a lengthy jail sentence or exile. Citizens document their daily lives, state surveillance is ever present and recreational fictions have ceased to exist: instead people watch documentary TV. Laszlo Ratesic is a jaded fiftysomething with a talent for sniffing out lies in his role as a law enforcement agent with the Speculative Service. When he is called on to investigate after a worker falls from a roof, it looks like a simple case of accidental death \u2013 but Laszlo soon finds himself involved in a complex plot where the truth proves to be a slippery concept. He\u2019s compelled to question everything he\u2019s taken for granted, including the very idea of objective reality. In Golden State, Winters has fashioned a wry commentary on our current era of fake news. Iain Reid\u2019s follow-up to his well received I\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things is the short, shocking psychological three-hander Foe (Scribner, \u00a314.99). Junior and Henrietta live on a remote farmstead in a near-future North America (the location is never revealed). Their lives are catastrophically disrupted by the arrival of Terrance, a representative of the OuterMore organisation, who informs Junior that he has been selected to take part in a lottery: if successful, he will be initiated into a space programme \u2013 and Junior has no say in the matter. What follows is the detailed exploration of Junior and Henrietta\u2019s relationship in light of this harrowing news, with recriminations and insecurities threatening to blight their marriage. The narrative is so eerie and disturbing because so much about the future world is left unexplained, fuelling the reader\u2019s unease; and Reid pulls off a wonderful twist in the tail. Samantha Shannon, author of the bestselling Bone Season series, turns her considerable storytelling ability to epic fantasy with added dragons in the 800-page blockbuster The Priory of the Orange Tree (Bloomsbury Circus, \u00a316.99). We enter a world founded on the legend of the Nameless One, an evil dragon that was consigned to the Abyss 1,000 years ago but threatens to escape, with terrible consequences for humankind. Three empires have conflicting beliefs and rituals, and the destiny of the world is in the hands of three women: Queen Sabran, whose existence some believe is paramount in keeping the Nameless One and its spawn from ravaging the world; Ead, her lady-in-waiting, who is charged with protecting her queen from assassins; and Tan\u00e9, a sparky dragon-rider from the east. Shannon\u2019s strengths are her graphic world-building and the presentation of the queendoms, their different traditions and beliefs; her control of a large cast of characters; and the skill with which she brings the intersecting storylines to a satisfying climax. Edinburgh-based Shoreline of Infinity won a 2018 British Fantasy Society award for best SF magazine, and in celebration Noel Chidwick has edited a selection of stories from the first 10 issues. Shoreline of Infinity: The Chosen from the First Age (Shoreline of Infinity, \u00a34.95) collects a dozen tales taking in virtual reality, alien superheroes, robots and apocalyptic nightmares \u2026 as well as a Shaker side table time-machine, and much more. It\u2019s a strong collection from an international lineup of authors, and standouts include two stories exploring the theme of virtual reality. M Luke McDonell\u2019s \u201cSee You Later\u201d is a poignant account of how personalised VR can be used and misused in a failing marriage, while in \u201cThe Pink Life (La Vie En Rose)\u201d by Nathan Susnik, the protagonist gradually becomes aware of the lie promulgated by his hi-tech reality overlay.

Even aside from his signature performance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/withnail-and-i-review\">Withnail &amp; I</a> (which we\u2019ll return to), Grant has been one of the most dependable character actors around for decades, and his supporting performances often show him at his best.</p> <p>In Steve Martin\u2019s magical 1991 film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102250/\">LA Story</a>, Grant took what should have been a thankless role, the twittish English ex-husband of Martin\u2019s prospective girlfriend (Victoria Tennant), and turned him into a hilariously camp creation, so fully rounded you wished there could be a sequel just about him. The following year, in Altman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105151/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">The Player</a>, he was in many ways the heart of the movie, the idealistic writer who sells out to Hollywood, and more than held his own alongside the film\u2019s star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tim-robbins\">Tim Robbins</a>, and the slew of A-list cameos. More recently, he has made pleasing appearances in some of the most popular TV shows, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\">Downton Abbey</a>.</p> <p>It has always seemed as if Grant emerged from an earlier, more proper age, an impression mined by, among others, Scorsese who cast him in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-age-of-innocence\">The Age of Innocence</a>, as well as by Downton Abbey. His almost caricature Englishness may stem from his upbringing in Swaziland during the last days of empire, which he chronicled in his 2005 film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419256/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Wah-Wah</a>. He made what remains one of the greatest film debuts of all time, when he was cast as Withnail in his first film role, but the movie was infamously something of a bust when it was released.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJIaNsf_bY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UvJIaNsf_bY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Grant then hacked his way through the British film industry, including a splashy starring performance in How to Get Ahead in Advertising (in which he uttered the timeless line: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ad_qk6r_eU\">\u201cI\u2019m an expert in tits, tits and peanut butter!\u201d</a>). He then crossed over to Hollywood to appear in supporting roles in movies such as the unjustly forgotten <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099762/\">Henry &amp; June</a> and the justly derided <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/\">Hudson Hawk</a>. He briefly tried to capitalise on the mid-90s vogue for romcoms featuring British men with charming accents in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113448/\">Jack &amp; Sarah</a> (1995), but he is always at his best playing characters with more spice than sugar. Which is why, 30-odd years on, he has still not escaped from Withnail\u2019s shadow and never will.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m honestly so grateful to be attached to a movie that has an ongoing cult status</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As many reviewers have pointed out, his character in Can You Ever Forgive Me? feels a lot like the evolution of Withnail \u2013 after all, dealing drugs and conning middle-aged ladies in New York seems a fairly plausible career for a sixtysomething Withnail. Is there a part of Grant that hopes that all the attention he\u2019s received for this performance will bloody well stop people from asking him about Withnail every day of his life?</p> <p>\u201cOh no, not at all, because that implies it\u2019s a burden, and it really isn\u2019t. I\u2019m honestly so grateful to be attached to a movie that has an ongoing cult status,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So, given how much energy he\u2019s put into celebrating his nomination, has he thought about how he\u2019ll celebrate if he wins? Surely the finest wines available to humanity are in order. (Alas, despite being so good at playing drunks, Grant is teetotal.)</p> <p>\u201cGosh, no,\u201d he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. \u201cI really haven\u2019t considered that because it\u2019s so clear who the frontrunner is. I\u2019m just enjoying the spectacle.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;Can You Ever Forgive Me? is on release; the Baftas are on Sunday 10 February</p>",

Last month he tweeted a photo of himself outside Barbra Streisand\u2019s home, alongside a letter he\u2019d sent to her when he was 14. Streisand tweeted back congratulations for his nomination adding, as if he were 21 rather than 61: \u201cLook at u now!\u201d \u201cI crumpled up when that happened. That seed of approval from her was the highest affirmation you could wish for as a fan, even if it came 47 years after I wrote the letter,\u201d he says. He adds, a little superfluously: \u201cI never matured into the age when you\u2019re able to hide your adulatory feelings as a fan.\u201d He also excitedly tweeted selfies of himself with Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga and other nominees at the traditional Oscars luncheon. The day before we speak, he described himself as \u201ca temporary A-lister\u201d. And the media have been eating it up, with headlines such as: \u201cRichard E Grant\u2019s Unbridled Joy Is the Best Thing About Awards Season.\u201d It has all been rather charming to watch, no question, if somewhat bewildering for longtime Grant fans. Er, Richard, haven\u2019t you been on the A-list for a while? \u201cNo no, not at all! I understand that how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you don\u2019t always match, but no, no, no,\u201d he insists. But in your memoir, With Nails, you describe being directed by Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. Are you really overcome with excitement about meeting, say, Lady Gaga? \u201cOh God, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cIt genuinely feels like Madame Tussauds surreal. People I\u2019ve always admired and newly admired all in one place \u2013 I really don\u2019t know how other people are so cool about it.\u201d Whether Grant really is as thrilled by the razzle-dazzle as he seems on social media, or if he and his producers are playing a clever game in their Oscars campaign to out-manoeuvre the current frontrunner in his category, Mahershala Ali for Green Book, his nomination is both deserved and overdue. Even aside from his signature performance in Withnail &amp; I (which we\u2019ll return to), Grant has been one of the most dependable character actors around for decades, and his supporting performances often show him at his best. In Steve Martin\u2019s magical 1991 film LA Story, Grant took what should have been a thankless role, the twittish English ex-husband of Martin\u2019s prospective girlfriend (Victoria Tennant), and turned him into a hilariously camp creation, so fully rounded you wished there could be a sequel just about him. The following year, in Altman\u2019s The Player, he was in many ways the heart of the movie, the idealistic writer who sells out to Hollywood, and more than held his own alongside the film\u2019s star, Tim Robbins, and the slew of A-list cameos. More recently, he has made pleasing appearances in some of the most popular TV shows, including Game of Thrones, and Downton Abbey. It has always seemed as if Grant emerged from an earlier, more proper age, an impression mined by, among others, Scorsese who cast him in The Age of Innocence, as well as by Downton Abbey. His almost caricature Englishness may stem from his upbringing in Swaziland during the last days of empire, which he chronicled in his 2005 film, Wah-Wah. He made what remains one of the greatest film debuts of all time, when he was cast as Withnail in his first film role, but the movie was infamously something of a bust when it was released. Grant then hacked his way through the British film industry, including a splashy starring performance in How to Get Ahead in Advertising (in which he uttered the timeless line: \u201cI\u2019m an expert in tits, tits and peanut butter!\u201d). He then crossed over to Hollywood to appear in supporting roles in movies such as the unjustly forgotten Henry &amp; June and the justly derided Hudson Hawk. He briefly tried to capitalise on the mid-90s vogue for romcoms featuring British men with charming accents in Jack &amp; Sarah (1995), but he is always at his best playing characters with more spice than sugar. Which is why, 30-odd years on, he has still not escaped from Withnail\u2019s shadow and never will. As many reviewers have pointed out, his character in Can You Ever Forgive Me? feels a lot like the evolution of Withnail \u2013 after all, dealing drugs and conning middle-aged ladies in New York seems a fairly plausible career for a sixtysomething Withnail. Is there a part of Grant that hopes that all the attention he\u2019s received for this performance will bloody well stop people from asking him about Withnail every day of his life? \u201cOh no, not at all, because that implies it\u2019s a burden, and it really isn\u2019t. I\u2019m honestly so grateful to be attached to a movie that has an ongoing cult status,\u201d he says. So, given how much energy he\u2019s put into celebrating his nomination, has he thought about how he\u2019ll celebrate if he wins? Surely the finest wines available to humanity are in order. (Alas, despite being so good at playing drunks, Grant is teetotal.) \u201cGosh, no,\u201d he says, sounding genuinely flummoxed. \u201cI really haven\u2019t considered that because it\u2019s so clear who the frontrunner is. I\u2019m just enjoying the spectacle.\u201d \u2022 Can You Ever Forgive Me? is on release; the Baftas are on Sunday 10 February",

On the other hand, the report hailed the success of animator Domee Shi, who is the first woman to direct a short for Pixar, for her film Bao. It observed that Pixar\u2019s owner, Disney, has \u201ctaken dramatic steps to break up the boys\u2019 club\u201d at the animation studio. Julie Burton, president of the WMC, said: \u201cSince the Women\u2019s Media Center started counting the number of women nominated for non-acting Academy Awards as of 2006, the overall percentage of women nominees has increased from 18 to 25%. By that calculation, it will take another 50 years for women to be equally represented by the Academy. We need industry leaders to get on board and hire more women, especially women of colour, in front of and behind the camera.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Ancestral sleep</h2> <p>We evolved on a rotating planet, with regular patterns of light and dark exposure, and our biology is set up to work with this cycle. Our kidneys produce less urine, our body temperature is lower and our immune systems are less capable of fighting off foreign invaders at night. During the day, blood pressure rises, hunger hormones kick in and our brains shift into a higher gear. These daily fluctuations in our biology are called circadian rhythms, and they dictate when we feel sleepy.</p> <p>For most of human history, we slept at night and were more active during the day. Some historic accounts (Roger Ekirch) suggest that our ancestors split the night into two sleep shifts, with a period of restful wakefulness in between. However, this may not have been a universal human trait: studies of traditional societies, such as tribes in Africa and South America, and the <a href=\"http://amishamerica.com/whats-the-difference-between-new-order-and-old-order-amish/\" title=\"\">Old Order Amish</a> in North America (who live without electricity) suggest that many of these societies sleep in a single chunk \u2013 like most people in the modern world.</p> <p>These same studies have found that, on average, people from traditional societies go to bed and wake up several hours earlier than we do in developed countries. Not only do they sleep earlier than us, they also seem to sleep better. Between 10 and 30% of people in developed countries experience chronic insomnia, whereas just 1.5% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2018/oct/22/hadza-the-last-hunter-gatherer-tribe-in-tanzania-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Hadza people</a> (Tanzania), and 2.5% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/18/kalahari-bushmen-hunting-ban-prince-charles\" title=\"\">San people</a> (Namibia) say they regularly have problems falling or staying asleep. Neither group has a word for \u201cinsomnia\u201d in their language.</p> <h2>Lightbulb moment</h2> <p>In 1879, Thomas Edison flicked a light switch, and our relationship with night and day changed for ever. His incandescent lightbulbs brought cheap electric lighting to the masses, enabling us to extend the day. But this also changed the way we sleep. Exposure to light at night makes us more owlish, so we feel sleepy later. Light also has a direct alerting effect on the brain, meaning we find it harder to sleep.</p> <h2>Shift work</h2> <p>The transition to gas and then electric lighting also made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/jun/22/shift-work-how-to-stay-healthy-while-working-round-the-clock\" title=\"\">shift work</a> easier: no longer did factory workers have to toil under weak candlelight. Working at night means being awake, active and eating during the biological night \u2013 and then trying to sleep when the body is in day-mode. People who work night shifts are estimated to lose between one and four hours of sleep per day, which has short-term effects on emotional stability, memory, reasoning, reaction speeds and hand\u2013eye coordination. Chronic sleep deprivation also precedes the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer and various psychiatric illnesses, and is also associated with heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Similar links have been made to disrupted circadian rhythms, another consequence of shift work. If you are eating and active during the biological night, the circadian clocks in your various organs and tissues become desynchronised, meaning they no longer work as efficiently.</p> <h2>Daylight saving time</h2> <p>British Summer Time was introduced in 1916. The hope was that the extended evening light would encourage participation in outdoor recreation, facilitate military training and reduce industrial energy consumption. There is a significant downside, however: by moving the clocks forwards each spring, and backwards each autumn, we force a change in the timing of our body clocks. In the US, which also seasonally adjusts its time-keeping, a study of high school students \u2013 a population that\u2019s already sleep-deprived \u2013 suggested their sleep was curtailed by 32 minutes per night in the week following the spring clock change; their reaction speeds and vigilance also temporarily reduced. In adults, the transition to summer time has been associated with a 6% increase in \u201ccyberloafing\u201d \u2013 spending one\u2019s work time on non-work-related websites \u2013 on the Monday after the clock change. From a health perspective, the clock changes are tied to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, suicide attempts and psychiatric admissions.</p> <h2>Jet lag</h2> <p>American travel writer Horace Sutton is credited with the first reference to jet lag, in the Los Angeles Times in 1966. The most obvious symptom of the condition is feeling tired at the wrong time of day, but jet lag can also trigger mood changes and constipation. This is because besides the circadian clock that governs sleep timing, there are also clocks in our brain cells and digestive organs, which must also adjust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/03/how-to-conquer-jet-lag\">How to conquer jet lag</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To overcome jet lag, we\u2019re often told to start living on the time zone of our destination as soon as we arrive, but this can be detrimental. Say you\u2019re travelling from New York to London \u2013 which requires your body clock to advance by five hours. If you take an overnight flight and arrive at Heathrow at 8am, it will be 3am according to your body clock \u2013 and exposure to daylight at this time is the opposite of what you want to achieve. In this situation, it would be advisable to wear sunglasses until about 11am (6am, according to your body clock).</p> <h2>More than meets the eye</h2> <p>It is only in the past two decades that the biological mechanism by which light affects the timing of our internal clocks has been explained. We now know that at the back of the eye there is a subset of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/13/neuroscience-biology\" title=\"\">light-sensitive cells</a>, which connect to a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). They also link to areas of the brain that regulate mood and alertness. The SCN is the biological equivalent of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/20/greenwich-mean-time-brief-history\" title=\"\">Greenwich meridian</a>: it is the reference point used by the billions of other cellular clocks in your body to remain accurate. When light penetrates the eye, it acts like the reset button on a stopwatch: it tweaks the precise timing of the SCN, ensuring it remains aligned with the rising and setting of the sun.</p> <h2>Digital revolution</h2> <p>The spread of tablets and smartphones has undermined our relationship with the night still further. Light-sensitive cells in the back of the eye are particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/28/blue-light-led-screens-cancer-insomnia-health-issues\" title=\"\">sensitive to blue wavelengths</a> of light, which predominate in electronic screens. Standard LED bulbs also emit large amounts of blue light, even though they appear bright white. Recognising the impact that this light might be having on our sleep, the American Medical Association recently issued guidance on <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-guidance-reduce-harm-high-intensity-street-lights\" title=\"\">LED streetlights</a>. They are being rolled out because they are more energy efficient than older lights \u2013 but their effect on people\u2019s circadian system is also five times greater. The AMA advises communities to avoid standard blue-white LED streetlights and opt for warmer coloured ones \u2013 these should also be dimmable.

      "bodyText": "Ancestral sleep We evolved on a rotating planet, with regular patterns of light and dark exposure, and our biology is set up to work with this cycle. Our kidneys produce less urine, our body temperature is lower and our immune systems are less capable of fighting off foreign invaders at night. During the day, blood pressure rises, hunger hormones kick in and our brains shift into a higher gear. These daily fluctuations in our biology are called circadian rhythms, and they dictate when we feel sleepy. For most of human history, we slept at night and were more active during the day. Some historic accounts (Roger Ekirch) suggest that our ancestors split the night into two sleep shifts, with a period of restful wakefulness in between. However, this may not have been a universal human trait: studies of traditional societies, such as tribes in Africa and South America, and the Old Order Amish in North America (who live without electricity) suggest that many of these societies sleep in a single chunk \u2013 like most people in the modern world. These same studies have found that, on average, people from traditional societies go to bed and wake up several hours earlier than we do in developed countries. Not only do they sleep earlier than us, they also seem to sleep better. Between 10 and 30% of people in developed countries experience chronic insomnia, whereas just 1.5% of Hadza people (Tanzania), and 2.5% of San people (Namibia) say they regularly have problems falling or staying asleep. Neither group has a word for \u201cinsomnia\u201d in their language. Lightbulb moment In 1879, Thomas Edison flicked a light switch, and our relationship with night and day changed for ever. His incandescent lightbulbs brought cheap electric lighting to the masses, enabling us to extend the day. But this also changed the way we sleep. Exposure to light at night makes us more owlish, so we feel sleepy later. Light also has a direct alerting effect on the brain, meaning we find it harder to sleep. Shift work The transition to gas and then electric lighting also made shift work easier: no longer did factory workers have to toil under weak candlelight. Working at night means being awake, active and eating during the biological night \u2013 and then trying to sleep when the body is in day-mode. People who work night shifts are estimated to lose between one and four hours of sleep per day, which has short-term effects on emotional stability, memory, reasoning, reaction speeds and hand\u2013eye coordination. Chronic sleep deprivation also precedes the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer and various psychiatric illnesses, and is also associated with heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Similar links have been made to disrupted circadian rhythms, another consequence of shift work. If you are eating and active during the biological night, the circadian clocks in your various organs and tissues become desynchronised, meaning they no longer work as efficiently. Daylight saving time British Summer Time was introduced in 1916. The hope was that the extended evening light would encourage participation in outdoor recreation, facilitate military training and reduce industrial energy consumption. There is a significant downside, however: by moving the clocks forwards each spring, and backwards each autumn, we force a change in the timing of our body clocks. In the US, which also seasonally adjusts its time-keeping, a study of high school students \u2013 a population that\u2019s already sleep-deprived \u2013 suggested their sleep was curtailed by 32 minutes per night in the week following the spring clock change; their reaction speeds and vigilance also temporarily reduced. In adults, the transition to summer time has been associated with a 6% increase in \u201ccyberloafing\u201d \u2013 spending one\u2019s work time on non-work-related websites \u2013 on the Monday after the clock change. From a health perspective, the clock changes are tied to an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, suicide attempts and psychiatric admissions. Jet lag American travel writer Horace Sutton is credited with the first reference to jet lag, in the Los Angeles Times in 1966. The most obvious symptom of the condition is feeling tired at the wrong time of day, but jet lag can also trigger mood changes and constipation. This is because besides the circadian clock that governs sleep timing, there are also clocks in our brain cells and digestive organs, which must also adjust. To overcome jet lag, we\u2019re often told to start living on the time zone of our destination as soon as we arrive, but this can be detrimental. Say you\u2019re travelling from New York to London \u2013 which requires your body clock to advance by five hours. If you take an overnight flight and arrive at Heathrow at 8am, it will be 3am according to your body clock \u2013 and exposure to daylight at this time is the opposite of what you want to achieve. In this situation, it would be advisable to wear sunglasses until about 11am (6am, according to your body clock). More than meets the eye It is only in the past two decades that the biological mechanism by which light affects the timing of our internal clocks has been explained. We now know that at the back of the eye there is a subset of light-sensitive cells, which connect to a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). They also link to areas of the brain that regulate mood and alertness. The SCN is the biological equivalent of the Greenwich meridian: it is the reference point used by the billions of other cellular clocks in your body to remain accurate. When light penetrates the eye, it acts like the reset button on a stopwatch: it tweaks the precise timing of the SCN, ensuring it remains aligned with the rising and setting of the sun. Digital revolution The spread of tablets and smartphones has undermined our relationship with the night still further. Light-sensitive cells in the back of the eye are particularly sensitive to blue wavelengths of light, which predominate in electronic screens. Standard LED bulbs also emit large amounts of blue light, even though they appear bright white. Recognising the impact that this light might be having on our sleep, the American Medical Association recently issued guidance on LED streetlights. They are being rolled out because they are more energy efficient than older lights \u2013 but their effect on people\u2019s circadian system is also five times greater. The AMA advises communities to avoid standard blue-white LED streetlights and opt for warmer coloured ones \u2013 these should also be dimmable. It\u2019s advice we should also adopt in our homes if we want to improve our sleep: once the sun sets, keep lighting warm and dim. You should also install an app or alter the settings on smartphones and computer screens to dim and filter out blue light after dusk. Lighting the future Many different-coloured LEDs can be joined together to vary the shade of the light they produce, enabling the colour and intensity of a lighting system to be adjusted according to the time of day. Already, some workplaces, hospitals, and care homes are installing such \u201ccircadian\u201d or \u201chuman-centric\u201d lighting systems, to try to boost daytime productivity and improve people\u2019s sleep, with promising results.

It emerged on Thursday that Norment edited the 1968 Virginia Military Institute yearbook, which contained racist slurs and, yes, photos of people wearing blackface. Assault allegations. Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, another Democrat, has meanwhile denied an accusation of sexual assault, claiming he is the victim of a strategically timed political smear. Toronto serial killer to face sentencing for eight murders The families and friends of serial killer Bruce McArthur\u2019s victims have been recalling their loved ones in court in Toronto this week, with the 67-year-old former landscape gardener facing sentencing on Friday after pleading guilty to the murders of eight men. Most of the victims were from south Asian and Middle Eastern communities, but police have denied accusations that racial bias hindered the case. Police interviewed McArthur in 2013 and in 2016 amid rumours of a potential serial killer targeting Toronto\u2019s Gay Village, but failed to identify him as a suspect. He was finally arrested in January 2018. Crib sheet The Thai king\u2019s sister, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, has put herself forward as a shock prime ministerial candidate in the country\u2019s upcoming elections, running against the head of Thailand\u2019s military junta. Relations between France and Italy are at an historic low after Paris recalled its ambassador to Rome in response to criticism of Emmanuel Macron by Italy\u2019s far-right deputy prime ministers, who have also courted leaders of the French gilets jaunes movement. The US supreme court chief justice John Roberts has sided with the court\u2019s four liberals in a 5-4 vote to prevent Louisiana enforcing new restrictions on abortion clinics. After extensive research under carefully controlled lab conditions, British and German scientists have concluded that beer combined with wine will give drinkers just as bad a hangover, regardless of the order in which they are consumed. Must-reads The enduring appeal of The Warriors Even in the bad old days of 1979, the vision of a New York riven by gang conflict in The Warriors was an overblown fantasy. But four decades after its original release, writes Charles Bramesco, Walter Hill\u2019s crime classic remains \u201cthe all-encompassing Big Apple movie\u201d. \u2018I climbed 61 mountains in a year\u2019 Two years ago, on a long-haul flight, Emma Svensson watched the film Everest, the true story of a fatal blizzard on the world\u2019s highest mountain. For some reason, it inspired her to start climbing herself, so she scaled the highest peak in every country in Europe. The battle for the future of Stonehenge Stonehenge, perhaps the most recognisable ancient site in England, sits at the congested crossroads of two major trunk roads. As Charlotte Higgins reports, the monument is part of a decades-long planning battle over traffic management. The fate of Confederate monuments after Charlottesville In the wake of the fatal far-right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, there was extensive coverage of the removal of Confederate statues and memorials across the south. The media may have moved on, says Jason Wilson, but the grassroots activists have not. Opinion The US is preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan after 18 years of conflict, having achieved precisely none of the objectives laid out by George W Bush in 2001. This is not an honourable retreat, writes Simon Tisdall, it is a capitulation. The implications, once the Americans have gone, are ominous. A rapid descent into civil war, involving government forces, jihadist groups and rival warlords, in a rerun of not-forgotten 1990s anarchy, is a strong possibility. Sport The body recovered from a plane that crashed in the English Channel on 21 January has been formally identified as that of the Argentinian footballer Emiliano Sala, who had been en route to Wales from Nantes after signing with Cardiff City FC. Kevin Durant told reporters to \u201cgrow up\u201d at a contentious post-game press conference following the Golden State Warriors\u2019 win over San Antonio on Thursday. Durant appeared tired of speculation that he might be moving to the New York Knicks as the NBA free agency deadline approaches.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>No one seems quite sure whether Raphael Samuel, the anti-natalist from Mumbai who plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/feb/05/consent-being-born-man-suing-parents-for-giving-birth-to-him\">sue his parents for having been born without his consent</a>, is for real or not. My natural cynicism inclines me to believe Raph is a bit of a wind-up merchant, but there are still plenty of people who are taking him seriously. The logic certainly appears somewhat fragile. Unless Raph believes that everyone but him managed, before they existed in any form, to send secret messages giving persons unknown permission to have unprotected sex, he must be baffled that no one else has got round to suing their parents. And indeed bewildered that his own parents haven\u2019t sued their parents for being born against their will. Nor is it entirely clear what Raph hopes to get out of this. Does he want his parents to kill him? Does he want the right to officially be considered not to exist for tax purposes? Or can he just not wait to collect on his inheritance and is looking for an early financial payoff? Whichever it is, I would be encouraging his parents to get their retaliation in early by counter-suing Raph for being an ungrateful miserabilist and not the son for which they had hoped. Though that could be a dangerous precedent. There must have been plenty of times when my parents felt like suing me for damages. Not that I had any money to give them back then. As for me, I\u2019m just looking for someone to sue for the fact that one day I am going to die.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>In the absence of anyone in government having been able to find a Brexit deal to which parliament can agree, Lee Rotherham, a prominent Eurosceptic backed by Theresa Villiers, Norman Lamont and John Redwood, has now developed Brexit: The Board Game. Just like the real negotiations, it is strictly for masochists only because the rules are almost entirely incomprehensible. The brief summary describes the game as being about making Brexit happen, with four players taking the part of one of six factions \u2013 from no deal to rejoining the EU. Various cards are then dealt and anyone called Theresa gets to start. If no one called Theresa is playing, then the person who lives closest to Downing Street goes first. The game officially ends when a deal has been fixed, either when all empty deals cards have been filled and left unaltered for a full turn or a referendum on the deal has been won, but what happens in between is literally anyone\u2019s guess because there is no record of anyone having ever finished the game. Not least because, as Danny Finkelstein observed, there\u2019s no deal to which the European Research Group can ever say yes. The member of the lobby who passed it on to me never got as far as opening the lid of the box and I gave up after having a quick look through the rules. In other words, it\u2019s as close to real life as you\u2019re likely to get.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>The Duchess of Cornwall has taken a bit of flak for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2019/feb/06/rum-cigars-and-old-clothes-dont-worry-camilla-cuban-cuisine-is-great\">hinting that the food may not be up to much</a> when she and the Prince of Wales go to Cuba later this year. From my experience, she was merely telling it as it is. If you\u2019re going to Cuba for a foodie experience, then you\u2019ve rather missed the point. My wife and I went four years ago and we only managed a couple of good meals in the entire 10 days we were there. Even in the posher restaurants, we mostly just ate rather bland variations of rice, beans and chicken. The excitement was to be found elsewhere in the sense of dislocation. In the 1950s cars running on fumes. In the crumbling grandeur of Spanish colonial Havana. In the uneasy truce between Castro\u2019s socialism and US capitalism. In the revolutionary memorabilia on sale in the streets. But quite the weirdest place we went to was a beach resort four hours from Havana, designated entirely for tourists. The main entertainment was an Italian C-list pop star from the 1970s with dyed black hair and too-tight trousers who did twice-nightly shows of his three greatest hits to a backing tape while his much younger wife danced out of time next to him. I\u2019ve never been so relieved to get out of a place while on holiday. Then again, we never made it to Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>With just 50 days to go until 29 March and Theresa May still insisting the UK will leave the EU on time, you\u2019d have thought the House of Commons would be rushed off its feet trying to get all the necessary legislation passed. As well as the withdrawal agreement, there are six major bills and hundreds of statutory instruments that need to get through parliament to prevent the country from grinding to a standstill. While many MPs are inherently conscientious and are anxious to sort out the situation, the government is intensely relaxed. This week, even though the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, found time for several general debates, including one on sport \u2013 A good thing or a bad thing? Discuss \u2013 parliament still closed for business in mid-afternoon on both Wednesday and Thursday as there was nothing scheduled for it to do. Madness. In the absence of anything better to do, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, along with the prime minister\u2019s disaster-prone former joint head of staff, Nick Timothy, turned up at an event on \u201chow to make the Tories electable\u201d. The irony that it would be hard to find two people who had done more to make the Conservatives unelectable escaped no one but them, turning the occasion into something of a comedy show. Neither seemed to think that Brexit was a particularly big deal \u2013 certainly nothing worth more than a passing mention \u2013 while Truss was quite open about the need to have no policies whatsoever. Weirdly, she may be on to something. In a recent opinion poll on who would make the best prime minister, Theresa May came top with 40%, closely followed by Don\u2019t Know on 39%. Jeremy Corbyn trailed in third on 19%. The prime minister is clearly doing something right.

      "bodyText": "No-fault divorces that could replace the protracted courtroom battles couples often face when separating are to be introduced into law. The justice secretary, David Gauke, confirmed he will bring in legislation enacting the reform in the next session of parliament, removing the need for separating couples to wait for years or allocate blame for the collapse of their relationship. Under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales, anyone seeking a divorce must either prove their partner is at fault through adultery, desertion or unreasonable behaviour, or if both sides agree, they can part after two years of separation. In the absence of consent or evidence of fault, applicants must wait until they have been living apart for five years. Gauke launched a consultation last autumn on reforming the law. Responses received by the Ministry of Justice showed widespread support for the initiative. The justice secretary told the Times the responses to the consultation were \u201coverwhelmingly in support, which is why I remain as convinced as I have been for the need to reform this particular area\u201d. Demands for change mounted after the Tini Owens case. The supreme court ruled in July last year that she could not divorce her husband until a period of five years had elapsed. Owens and her husband, Hugh Owens, had been living separate lives since 2015. Labour also supported changing the law, which has remained unaltered for nearly 50 years. No-fault divorce was first introduced by the Family Law Act 1996, but its provisions were later deemed unworkable and it was repealed. It has been widely supported by prominent members of the judiciary, lawyers and relationship charities. Nigel Shepherd, a former chairman of the family law organisation Resolution, said it was clear the responses to the consultation had shown overwhelming support for the reform \u201cand we\u2019re pleased the government are so firmly behind it\u201d. He added: \u201cOur members, and the families they work with, will be delighted that after years of campaigning, we are now so close to ending the \u2018blame game\u2019 that many divorcing couples are currently forced to play.\u201d He said that while much of the detail had yet to be agreed, Resolution would provide ministers and officials with all the support it could to help bring in the legislation as quickly as possible.

      "body": "<p>In a typical week, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) fields more than 10,500 emails and phone calls from people who are deciding whether their problem at work is actually employment discrimination.</p> <p>The agency receives about 1,500 new charges of discrimination weekly and resolves an additional 2,000, said EEOC Commissioner Charlotte A Burrows.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/shutdown_plan.cfm\">for five weeks </a>during the government shutdown, those phone calls and emails went unanswered. The agency\u2019s attorneys requested continuances from federal courts for litigation, and all mediations were canceled. The EEOC\u2019s online public portal \u2013 where US workers can submit inquiries, schedule appointments and file charges \u2013 was unavailable.</p> <p>\u201cThose are real people who did not get a resolution and have to keep waiting, and so that\u2019s really painful to me,\u201d Burrows said.</p> <p>Now, even though the agency has reopened, officials say that the impact of the shutdown is still apparent \u2013 especially as the threat of another one is already looming next week. That could seriously disrupt the ongoing work of a body whose sensitive mission had taken on extra urgency in the era of #MeToo and which many believed was on the cusp of achieving a vital breakthrough in fighting workplace harassment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/28/google-sexual-harassment-pay-gap-lawsuits-proceed\">Google sees major claims of harassment and discrimination as lawsuits proceed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a fear among EEOC leadership and advocates that trust in the agency will now erode. In 2013, during a 16-day government shutdown, former EEOC chair Jenny Yang remembered women in Florida who came forward with a sexual assault case. Because the agency could not respond right away, the women became worried, frustrated and angry.</p> <p>Similarly, when people tried to contact the EEOC during this year\u2019s shutdown, \u201cwe weren\u2019t really there to take their calls\u201d, Burrows said.</p> <p>Already, the decision to move forward with a charge carries a lot of weight. To then add delays and office closures could lead to fewer filings and less civil rights enforcement, said Sunu P Chandy, the legal director of the National Women\u2019s Law Center who served as an EEOC federal attorney from 1999 to 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the lives and stories of trusting people who are believing that the law can bring a positive change in society and that they can get some justice for themselves,\u201d said Chandy.</p> <p>Much like other federal agencies, the EEOC saw the vast majority of its employees furloughed during the longest partial government shutdown in history. A skeleton staff accepted charges. Everything else they were working on \u2013 mediations, investigations, trainings \u2013 ground to a halt.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was impacted,\u201d said the EEOC acting chair Victoria Lipnic. And especially for administrative tasks, \u201cthat time just cannot be made up.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/wysk/impact_of_lapse.cfm\">The setback</a> comes after a landmark year for the agency, when the American public suddenly woke to a major problem in the workplace and the EEOC rose to meet a demand for information and justice.</p> <p>As the US government\u2019s agency for civil rights enforcement at work, the EEOC is inextricably linked to the #MeToo movement. And when The New York Times released a report on movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, the commission\u2019s leaders were already years ahead of the news cycle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/20/harvey-weinstein-court-sexual-assault-case-new-york\">Harvey Weinstein: judge rejects bid to dismiss sexual assault charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Lipnic was named acting chair of the commission in January 2017, she had already doubled down on efforts to focus on the issue.</p> <p>This background perfectly positioned the EEOC to respond to #MeToo . <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/wysk/preventing-workplace-harassment.cfm\">During fiscal year 2018</a>, the agency saw a 13.6% increase in filed sexual harassment charges compared to the year before, pursued upward of 50% more lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and recovered almost $70m for sexual harassment survivors.</p> <p>These developments were despite the fact that EEOC staff are frequently overstretched. In 2018, Congress enacted a much-needed <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/plan/budgetandstaffing.cfm\">$15m increase in the agency\u2019s budget</a>. Before then, funding had mostly flatlined or decreased over seven years.</p> <p>For decades, the commission has lost staff; plummeting from 3,390 in 1980 to just 1,968 at the end of the 2018 fiscal year.</p> <p> In an environment where most of its employees are already juggling a heavy workload, losing five weeks to a government shutdown was unhelpful to say the least. \u201cTo basically have most of the day-to-day work not happen is not good for civil rights enforcement,\u201d said Chandy.</p> <p>After weeks away from the office and in the midst of yet another possible shutdown, EEOC staff are tasked with sorting through a backlog of emails, rescheduling appointments and restarting cases. It may take a while to get back to where they were before December, but they say the stakes are too high to not keep moving forward.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to fall down,\u201d said Lipnic. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fail in this moment.\u201d</p>",

The agency receives about 1,500 new charges of discrimination weekly and resolves an additional 2,000, said EEOC Commissioner Charlotte A Burrows. But for five weeks during the government shutdown, those phone calls and emails went unanswered. The agency\u2019s attorneys requested continuances from federal courts for litigation, and all mediations were canceled. The EEOC\u2019s online public portal \u2013 where US workers can submit inquiries, schedule appointments and file charges \u2013 was unavailable. \u201cThose are real people who did not get a resolution and have to keep waiting, and so that\u2019s really painful to me,\u201d Burrows said. Now, even though the agency has reopened, officials say that the impact of the shutdown is still apparent \u2013 especially as the threat of another one is already looming next week. That could seriously disrupt the ongoing work of a body whose sensitive mission had taken on extra urgency in the era of #MeToo and which many believed was on the cusp of achieving a vital breakthrough in fighting workplace harassment. There is a fear among EEOC leadership and advocates that trust in the agency will now erode. In 2013, during a 16-day government shutdown, former EEOC chair Jenny Yang remembered women in Florida who came forward with a sexual assault case. Because the agency could not respond right away, the women became worried, frustrated and angry. Similarly, when people tried to contact the EEOC during this year\u2019s shutdown, \u201cwe weren\u2019t really there to take their calls\u201d, Burrows said. Already, the decision to move forward with a charge carries a lot of weight. To then add delays and office closures could lead to fewer filings and less civil rights enforcement, said Sunu P Chandy, the legal director of the National Women\u2019s Law Center who served as an EEOC federal attorney from 1999 to 2014. \u201cThese are the lives and stories of trusting people who are believing that the law can bring a positive change in society and that they can get some justice for themselves,\u201d said Chandy. Much like other federal agencies, the EEOC saw the vast majority of its employees furloughed during the longest partial government shutdown in history. A skeleton staff accepted charges. Everything else they were working on \u2013 mediations, investigations, trainings \u2013 ground to a halt. \u201cEverything was impacted,\u201d said the EEOC acting chair Victoria Lipnic. And especially for administrative tasks, \u201cthat time just cannot be made up.\u201d The setback comes after a landmark year for the agency, when the American public suddenly woke to a major problem in the workplace and the EEOC rose to meet a demand for information and justice. As the US government\u2019s agency for civil rights enforcement at work, the EEOC is inextricably linked to the #MeToo movement. And when The New York Times released a report on movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, the commission\u2019s leaders were already years ahead of the news cycle. When Lipnic was named acting chair of the commission in January 2017, she had already doubled down on efforts to focus on the issue. This background perfectly positioned the EEOC to respond to #MeToo . During fiscal year 2018, the agency saw a 13.6% increase in filed sexual harassment charges compared to the year before, pursued upward of 50% more lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and recovered almost $70m for sexual harassment survivors. These developments were despite the fact that EEOC staff are frequently overstretched. In 2018, Congress enacted a much-needed $15m increase in the agency\u2019s budget. Before then, funding had mostly flatlined or decreased over seven years. For decades, the commission has lost staff; plummeting from 3,390 in 1980 to just 1,968 at the end of the 2018 fiscal year. In an environment where most of its employees are already juggling a heavy workload, losing five weeks to a government shutdown was unhelpful to say the least. \u201cTo basically have most of the day-to-day work not happen is not good for civil rights enforcement,\u201d said Chandy. After weeks away from the office and in the midst of yet another possible shutdown, EEOC staff are tasked with sorting through a backlog of emails, rescheduling appointments and restarting cases. It may take a while to get back to where they were before December, but they say the stakes are too high to not keep moving forward. \u201cWe are not going to fall down,\u201d said Lipnic. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fail in this moment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration is making it easier for tech companies to discriminate against workers, with a policy that impedes efforts to close the gender pay gap in Silicon Valley, current and former US labor officials said. A new US Department of Labor (DoL) \u201ctransparency\u201d directive is forcing DoL officials to disclose preliminary details about anti-discrimination investigations to the targets of the inquiries, which, current and former DoL employees say, enables those companies to evade enforcement efforts and conceal potential violations while cases are ongoing. It\u2019s as if the FBI or the Internal Revenue Service had to give an advanced heads-up to entities they were investigating, the DoL employees say. A longtime DoL employee not authorized to speak publicly described the policy as a \u201cgiveaway to government contractors\u201d, adding that \u201ctransparency\u201d was a misnomer: \u201cThe objective of this directive is to try to weaken [DoL] enforcement.\u201d The policy was announced in September 2018 by DoL\u2019s contract compliance director, Craig Leen, and the acting assistant secretary for policy, Jonathan Berry \u2013 both Trump appointees \u2013 but prompted opposition from some in the agency. It is one of many examples of the DoL\u2019s new leadership eroding existing regulations meant to support workers\u2019 rights, said Laura Padin, senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. The Trump administration suspended an equal pay initiative, moved to roll back a child labor rule, and has dismantled anti-discrimination protections for LGBT workers. \u201cYou have an agency that\u2019s supposed to be the watchdog, and they are not doing their job,\u201d said Patricia Shiu, who served as the DoL\u2019s director of federal contract compliance under Obama. \u201cThis is what federal contractors want.\u201d Industry groups have long pushed for these kinds of changes that would make it harder for the government to scrutinize their labor practices, said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center. The changes could be particularly beneficial for Silicon Valley firms, which make hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars each yearby providing a range of software products and other services to federal agencies. The new directive effectively helps those tech corporations avoid scrutiny, labor experts warn, despite growing recognition that white men in tech make higher salaries than women and minorities doing equivalent work \u2013 in violation of equal pay laws. Under the Obama administration, the DoL repeatedly reported findings of pay gaps and other forms of systemic discrimination in Silicon Valley. A number of Silicon Valley companies have faced DoL investigations. In the department\u2019s long-running case against Google, the DoL announced this week that in line with the \u201ctransparency\u201d directive, it was dropping an appeal that could have forced Google to hand over specific employee salary data. The DoL in 2017 accused Google of \u201cextreme\u201d discrimination against women across the company. Google denies the allegations. Leen, the DoL compliance director , defended the decision to dismiss the appeal in the Google case, saying it was \u201cthe most effective means of reaching final resolution with Google\u201d. Because the DoL had already obtained a trove of records, the case continues and it is unclear how the directive will affect the outcome. But DoL insiders and former agency leaders say they fearthe \u201ctransparency\u201d directive will be most detrimental to new investigations. The directive is \u201climiting the tools available to the agency to fulfill its mission\u201d, said Janette Wipper, former regional director of the DoL contract compliance division. \u201cThis directive doesn\u2019t address the interest of employees who work for federal contractors. It\u2019s transparency in one direction.\u201d Under federal law, companies that do business with the US government agree to meet specific non-discrimination standards, enact proactive affirmative action plans, and allow the DoL to access salary records. The DoL\u2019s compliance investigations are a significant opportunity for regulators to push for pay equality on a large scale. An estimated 25% of US employees work for federal contractors. The directive is ostensibly aimed at helping government contractors comply with the DoL\u2019s anti-discrimination audits by directing investigators to work more \u201ccollaboratively\u201d with companies. But it in effect limits the scope of information the DoL can request during an investigation and creates new time constraints for those investigations. Most notably, when the DoL wants to access additional data during its inquiry, the directive stipulates that labor investigators must provide a \u201csummary of any preliminary indicators of discrimination\u201d to the company under investigation. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can perform a competent investigation about whether there are problems with the pay gap if you don\u2019t have the data,\u201d said Wendy Musell, a civil rights lawyer and chair of the California Employment Lawyers Association. \u201cThis is one of the only mechanisms where we can ensure that our federal taxpayer dollars are not funding discriminatory employment practices.\u201d \u201cThe overall message is, \u2018We know that you\u2019re discriminating, and we are content to prevent regulators from catching you,\u2019\u201d said one longtime DoL employee, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the directive. \u201cIt would tell the target of the investigation very early on the theory of the case,\u201d said the DoL employee added. \u201cThey will be able to game the system.\u201d A national DoL spokesperson said the agency remained \u201ccommitted to increasing compliance with the law\u201d for contractors, adding: \u201cThe transparency directive ensures that contractors are made aware of [DoL]\u2019s indicators of discrimination promptly in order to ensure that such discrimination is remedied sooner \u2026 so that America\u2019s workers receive relief as quickly as possible when there are violations.\u201d Since 2017, the DoL\u2019s contract compliance program recovered more than $44m from contractors with back pay and other awards for victims of discrimination, the spokesperson added.

      "body": "<p>Given that Bram Stoker researched his 1897 gothic novel <a href=\"https://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/dracula\">in this very building</a> there is a certain logic to Dracula becoming the first stage show to be presented here in the London Library\u2019s 178-year history. The production is the work of the site-specific Oxford-based <a href=\"https://www.creationtheatre.co.uk/\">Creation Theatre</a> and turns the normally sedate reading room into a place of ghoulish horror but, not for the first time, I found myself thinking that the English vice is adaptation.</p> <p>Since Kate Kerrow\u2019s brief was to provide a script for two actors, she faced an obvious problem in condensing a novel that uses multiple narrators. Her solution is to focus on the relationship between the sexually dysfunctional solicitor Jonathan Harker and his more adventurous wife, Mina, who seeks to understand the mysterious death of her friend Lucy. This means the two actors have to play a host of other characters \u2013 including Dr Seward, Professor Van Helsing and Renfield \u2013 and that Harker\u2019s fatal visit to Dracula\u2019s castle now comes near the story\u2019s end rather than as its starting point.</p> <p>There are two big difficulties with this. The story would be virtually incomprehensible unless you had read the book and is hard to follow even if you have.

      "bodyText": "Given that Bram Stoker researched his 1897 gothic novel in this very building there is a certain logic to Dracula becoming the first stage show to be presented here in the London Library\u2019s 178-year history. The production is the work of the site-specific Oxford-based Creation Theatre and turns the normally sedate reading room into a place of ghoulish horror but, not for the first time, I found myself thinking that the English vice is adaptation. Since Kate Kerrow\u2019s brief was to provide a script for two actors, she faced an obvious problem in condensing a novel that uses multiple narrators. Her solution is to focus on the relationship between the sexually dysfunctional solicitor Jonathan Harker and his more adventurous wife, Mina, who seeks to understand the mysterious death of her friend Lucy. This means the two actors have to play a host of other characters \u2013 including Dr Seward, Professor Van Helsing and Renfield \u2013 and that Harker\u2019s fatal visit to Dracula\u2019s castle now comes near the story\u2019s end rather than as its starting point. There are two big difficulties with this. The story would be virtually incomprehensible unless you had read the book and is hard to follow even if you have. Kerrow also seems unsure about the significance of the blood-sucking Dracula, whom we never actually see. His vampirism is presented as both a noxious virus that infects future generations and a symbol of a demonic sexual force to which the repressed Harkers finally surrender. I\u2019ve heard of the Library of Congress but never before witnessed congress in the library. Faced with a muddled narrative, Helen Tennison\u2019s production throws at it the works: ominous music, vulpine howls, coffin lids rising from the upper balcony and even a pair of glowing, disembodied eyes that suggest a sequel to Cats called Bats. The two actors, Sophie Greenham and Bart Lambert, do a sterling job in steering us through the story. I was left thinking, however, that I\u2019d far rather have a play about Stoker\u2019s complex psyche, including his obsession with Henry Irving, than yet another attempt to boil down his baggy book. At the London Library until 3 March.",

      "bodyText": "The government has started to recruit civilians to work in an emergency command and control centre being set up to try to make sure Britain runs smoothly in the aftermath of a potential no-deal Brexit. Briefing notes issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to recruitment agencies state the EU Exit Emergencies Centre (EUXE) could stay open \u201cpotentially for two years\u201d. The chief executive of the civil service, John Manzoni, has already said it is looking to second 5,000 civil servants, with volunteers sought in non-Brexit departments including the Department for Education and the Department for International Development. But with 50 days to go to Brexit, the civil service is widening the net to recruit external contractors to help with what appears to be a military-style \u201cGold command\u201d, which will operate out of offices close to Westminster. According to briefing notes seen by the Guardian, the government is looking for \u201cunflappable\u201d individuals to help brief ministers and the Cabinet Office on any unfolding emergencies in a no-deal scenario. Candidates are being offered between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400 a day and must be prepared to start by the end of this month. They have been told the emergency centre could be based at Marsham Street, where several government offices, including the Home Office, are based, and which is a short walk from the Palace of Westminster. The other potential site is Nobel House in Smith Square, also close to Westminster. Defra is recruiting for at least three different roles: briefing emergency centre officers, liaison emergency centre officers and situation emergency centre officers. The emergency control centre will have a team of officers producing briefing notes for ministers \u201cat pace\u201d and checking the \u201cbattle rhythm\u201d for emerging urgent policy changes. Whitehall departments were told in December to ramp up their no-deal planning and since then, leaks have emerged from Defra of plans to deal with \u201cputrefying stockpiles\u201d of uncollected waste and of issues in relation to livestock caught in potential gridlock in Kent. The department will also have to deal with water quality issues that may emerge if there is a shortage of purification chemicals and will have to liaise with local resilience groups on any civil reaction to shortages in the shops. The recruits for EUXE must be able to \u201csee the emergency trends with little or no information and act appropriately at pace\u201d. They must also be \u201ca horizon scanner \u2013 someone who is looking up and out into the working environment to spot early indications of approaching issues or emergencies\u201d. The situation officers \u201cmust be unflappable\u201d with the \u201cability to work in an area of high public and media interest\u201d and have the \u201cability to make sound, logical judgments based on possibly incomplete or imperfect information\u201d. Applicants are being recruited on a six-month contract with an option for three-month extensions up to two years. \u201cThe EUXE centre is designed to be a temporary measure and the authority expects its lifetime to last about six months, with a potential for further extensions in three-month periods, should an ongoing need arise, potentially up to two years,\u201d said the job description. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cAs you\u2019d expect, Defra and departments across government continue to work hard preparing for the UK\u2019s exit from the EU.

However, across Scotland, and in Glasgow in particular, bowling clubs are undergoing a quiet revolution as these beloved green spaces, once the beating hearts of the community, reinvigorate themselves for the 21st century. \u201cHow do you compete with everything else that people want to do?\u201d Brown asks. \u201cYou have to become a community hub, become part of the social fabric again. It\u2019s crazy that we\u2019re only open on Friday nights, seven months of the year.\u201d The 38-year-old, who joined four years ago when the grounds were threatened with being sold off, has an infectious enthusiasm and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the club\u2019s history, including the fact that it is built on the site of the first Hampden Park. \u201cBowls is accessible to everyone from five to 95 but it hasn\u2019t kept up with the times, with old rules and regulations and out of date views on uniforms. When I first joined you had to wear a shirt, tie and blazer.\u201d Brown suggested a switch to polo shirts bearing the club logo: \u201cIt took me eight months to get it through the committee but after that everyone bought one. It might sound small but from a club point of view it was massive because they started thinking: \u2018Maybe we can change\u2019.\u201d He also kickstarted the club\u2019s web presence \u2013 \u201cWhen I first joined they didn\u2019t even have an email address!\u201d \u2013 and held Give Bowls a Go taster nights last summer. The membership, which had slumped to 40, has since bounced back to 70. Kelly Settle, 33, joined with her partner, Pete Cavani, 46, after seeing the open night advertised on Facebook. \u201cI grew up in Glasgow and my gran used to play, so I understood it was a big part of people\u2019s life. There are so many clubs in the area where we live but we\u2019d always walked past before. It was nice to be outside on a beautiful sunny evening.\u201d Over winter, the pair have been to other events at the club, including the regular quiz night. Cavani says: \u201cThere are very few events now where young, middle-aged and old folk get together like that. They\u2019re all good folk with good stories.\u201d Across the city, it\u2019s becoming increasingly common to hear about a gig, or a 40th birthday ceilidh, or a yoga session being held at a bowls club. Bowls Scotland\u2019s development team has been working with clubs, encouraging them to be \u201cmore than a bowling club\u201d in order to thrive. North across the Clyde, Partickhill bowling and community club has hosted an influx of events since refurbishing the clubhouse last year, with creative writing classes, parent and baby pilates, and even an artist in residence. The broadcaster and DJ David Belcher runs Thank Funk its Friday at Partickhill, which he says is the perfect venue: \u201cThe whole point is you\u2019re going for a more mature audience, perhaps ex-clubbers who have moved to the suburbs, had children and can\u2019t possibly consider going into the city centre to fight with teenagers at the weekend.\u201d John Clutterbuck has been the Partickhill secretary for 11 years. While he is pleased with a recent bump in membership numbers to more than 100, and praises the efforts of younger committee colleagues, he is blunt about the challenge. \u201cThere is a problem with age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be an old man\u2019s sport but it\u2019s difficult persuading people it\u2019s not just for codgers!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What would prompt an academic from Germany to come up with a plan to try to end the current stalemate on the backstop \u2013 the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit? The answer has three parts: experience in negotiations gained during my time with a multinational company, an academic interest in Brexit since 2016 including a study in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/24/brexit-more-complex-than-first-moon-landing-says-academic-study\" title=\"\">I compared it</a> for complexity with the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328291589_Brexit_and_the_moon_landing_from_a_project_complexity_perspective_A_comparative_case_study\" title=\"\">first moon landing</a> and the third is that I\u2019m a father of two who can vividly imagine the consequences for families on both sides of the UK/EU divide if these negotiations fail.</p> <p>My experience of business negotiations in China and Russia convinced me of how crucial trust is. Without it, any negotiation is doomed to failure. You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and, tough as that may be, accept that you are not always right. When we look at the deadlock between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland backstop what we can observe after nearly two years of negotiations is the total breakdown of trust. Once you hear from both sides the words \u201cthis is a matter of principle \u2026\u201d you know you are very close to a showdown. </p> <p>London\u2019s position on the backstop is that it has to go, and Brussels\u2019s position is that it\u2019s vital it stays. Consequently, what we have is a game of chicken. With one big difference: it is not a game but a real disaster waiting to happen on 29 March. The major roadblock for avoiding a no-deal Brexit is obviously the backstop. A <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2019/02/our-survey-a-majority-of-party-members-back-mays-deal-if-changes-can-be-made-to-the-backstop.html\" title=\"\">recent poll</a> published by Paul Goodman at Conservative Home underlines this: \u201cA majority of party members back May\u2019s deal \u2013 if changes can be made to the backstop.\u201d </p> <p>At the same time, the EU communicates exactly the opposite: No agreement without a backstop. Or as the European commissioner Frans Timmermans stated: \u201cLet me be extremely clear: there is no way I could live in a situation where we throw Ireland under the bus \u2026 As far as the European commission is concerned, the backstop is an essential element for showing to Ireland and to the rest of Europe that we are in this together.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of the backstop has now become the emblem of \u201cwe win or you win\u201d; the victory a goal in itself. To restore lost trust would take a long time \u2013 time that we don\u2019t have. So we should instead focus on the objectives that led to the backstop because right now it is like a car stuck in quicksand that is going to drown all its passengers. Let\u2019s step back from the stalemate, putting our minds in reverse gear, and start from the objectives of all the parties. I will then suggest a concept that I call the (modified) shamrock proposal, since the symbolic plant has only three leaves but <a href=\"https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/20252014/shamrock-proposal_r-alter_2019-02-06-pdf.pdf\" title=\"\">my plan</a> tries to take the interests of four parties into account: the UK, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the EU.</p> <p>These are the main objectives and views of the parties with respect to the backstop, as one can perceive them:</p> <p><strong>UK</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The backstop has to go. A backstop where the EU has the final say with respect to the customs/border situation in Northern Ireland is unacceptable since it would undermine the sovereignty of the UK</p> <p>\u2022 Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement</p> <p>\u2022 Freedom to negotiate free trade agreements after leaving the EU, which is not possible under a customs union</p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement</p> <p>\u2022 No negative economic impact</p> <p><strong>Republic of Ireland</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement</p> <p><strong>European Union</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement</p> <p>\u2022 Loyalty to the Republic of Ireland</p> <p>\u2022 Protect the integrity of the single market</p> <p>Issues of national sovereignty are among the most sensitive political subjects anywhere. Thus, we have to appreciate that the UK can\u2019t really live with the EU having the final decision-making power over a backstop. This goes to the very core of national sovereignty, which is one of the British government\u2019s real red lines. At the same time, the UK needs to appreciate that Brussels and Dublin need a mechanism that protects the border-free situation and the EU single market. The tragic aspect is that they may in any case come to a joint solution within the next two years that would not require a hard border. However, since neither side trusts the other all thinking seems to lead to paralysis. My proposal tries to take the uniqueness of the Good Friday agreement into account. The agreement gives the citizens of Northern Ireland a unique right of self-determination, allowing them, whenever the majority decides it, to join the Republic of Ireland. My proposal consists of two core elements:</p> <p>1) The current backstop clause is dropped</p> <p>2) Between now and 2020 two outcomes emerge: in the first, both parties, the UK and EU, have clarified their future economic and trading relationship in a way that both accept would not require a hard border. Alternatively, there is an agreement for a trade deal that requires a hard border. In this case a referendum takes place in Northern Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dca1083966d6ea33b1b6eccd7d61bfe2522989f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dca1083966d6ea33b1b6eccd7d61bfe2522989f/0_224_6655_3995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign in Derry, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The issue of the backstop has now become the emblem of \u201cwe win or you win\u201d; becoming the victory a goal in itself.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To avoid any misunderstanding: this would not be a vote about nationality or the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but a vote on whether Northern Ireland wants to remain within the EU customs area for trade purposes (thus avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland) or whether it prefers to exit along with the rest of the UK, with a customs arrangement that requires a border. Is it feasible that a territory which is constitutionally part of one country be a member of the customs territory of another? Yes, it is and it has worked in the past. If you look up the history of the Kleinwalsertal of Austria you will find that for many years it was part of the customs territory of Germany, while never questioning the Austrian nationality of its inhabitants. The reason was quite simple; because of the Alps, the valley could only be accessed from the German side.

There would certainly be arguments against involving the citizens of Northern Ireland (eg, that such a vote could let the genie of nationality or Irish unity out of the bottle).

      "bodyText": "As Jeff Bezos is fond of reminding people, the world\u2019s richest man started Amazon in his garage, personally driving packages of books to the post office for delivery. Nearly a quarter of a century later, he sits atop a globe-straddling online retail colossus employing 600,000 people, which last year became only the second company to be valued at $1tn by Wall Street. His personal net worth, largely because of his holdings in Amazon, is $137bn (\u00a3106bn). Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to a teenage single mother, he was adopted by her Cuban husband, Mike Bezos, and only learned he was not his biological son at the age of 10. Bezos\u2019s work ethic was forged, legend has it, between the ages of four and 16 during summers on his grandfather\u2019s ranch in Texas. There, in the southern heat, he toiled away at everything from castrating bulls to repairing windmills. At the age of 16 he took a summer job in McDonald\u2019s but later, with his girlfriend, set up a business called the Dream Institute, a 10-day creative thinking summer camp for young students. After graduating from Princeton, where he studied computer science, Bezos turned down offers from major technology players such as Intel to join a start-up called Fitel. He later joined a hedge fund, where he met MacKenzie Tuttle, whom he would go on to marry. The couple announced in January they were to divorce. Before meeting Tuttle, Bezos had deployed his financial analytic skills in the dating arena, applying the Wall Street venture capitalists\u2019 term \u201cdeal flow\u201d to his love life in order to boost his \u201cwomen flow\u201d. The size of the Bezos fortune is largely thanks to his early recognition of the huge growth potential of the internet. Seeing an opportunity to build a retail operation on a vast scale, he settled on books as a product that could be easily sold to the soaring number of web users. He left the hedge fund DE Shaw and moved with his wife to Seattle to start the business. Amazon\u2019s growth has been one of the stellar corporate success stories of the past 100 years. Bezos still owns 16% of Amazon, together with his space exploration company Blue Origin, the Washington Post and a large property portfolio. However, while his wealth has brought him great power, it has also put him on a collision course with one of the few people who is even more powerful, Donald Trump. Bezos bought the Washington Post for $250m in 2013 and the newspaper has become a bete noire for the US president because of its investigations into whether Russia helped the billionaire win the US election. Trump has a close relationship with the National Enquirer, with the tabloid admitting it ran a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation to help buy a story about a sexual affair Trump had with a former Playboy model and bury it. Bezos\u2019s explosive blogpost on Thursday, in which he accuses the National Enquirer of attempting to blackmail him over intimate photographs shared with Lauren S\u00e1nchez, a former TV anchor, makes several references to his clashes with Trump within in the context of his claims against the tabloid.",

But Cardi B\u2019s debut album is one that many will get behind \u2013 it has just as wide an emotional range, plus irrepressible star power. Drake\u2019s Scorpion will amass votes too for its dazzling high points and pop cultural footprint, but it\u2019s too patchy to win.</p> <p><strong>Will win</strong>: Cardi B \u2013 Invasion of Privacy<br><strong>Should win</strong>: Kacey Musgraves \u2013 Golden Hour</p> <h2>Song of the year</h2> <p><strong>Kendrick Lamar &amp; SZA \u2013 All the Stars<br>Ella Mai \u2013 Boo\u2019d Up<br>Drake \u2013 God\u2019s Plan<br>Shawn Mendes \u2013 In My Blood<br>Brandi Carlile \u2013 The Joke<br>Zedd, Maren Morris &amp; Grey \u2013 The Middle<br>Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper \u2013 Shallow<br>Childish Gambino \u2013 This</strong><strong> Is America</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_efYhYU2A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bo_efYhYU2A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A very tough category to call. This Is America may win record of the year, but is less likely to prevail in the rather more stately songwriting category. Nothing else quite gets out in front here, though. The Joke\u2019s sisterly sympathy towards homophobic bullying and female struggle is a message voters will want to champion, but it never charted. The Middle is a triumph of major-label collaborative shit-at-a-wall songwriting, but it might be seen as trash by more august voters. All the Stars has two much-loved luminaries, but it is not their very best work. It could well be Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper\u2019s Shallow, the emotional heart of A Star Is Born and a celebration of the power of improvisatory songwriting, that will sneak ahead. Ella Mai\u2019s Boo\u2019d Up could come up on the inside: a huge US radio hit with a brilliant, innovative chorus for the ages.</p> <p><strong>Will win</strong>: Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper \u2013 Shallow<br><strong>Should win</strong>: Ella Mai \u2013 Boo\u2019d Up</p> <h2>New artist</h2> <p><strong>Chloe x Halle<br>Luke Combs<br>Greta Van Fleet<br>HER<br>Dua Lipa<br>Margo Price<br>Bebe Rexha<br>Jorja Smith</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hYCmPBlmwc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4hYCmPBlmwc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The two Brits in the category, Dua Lipa and Jorja Smith, both absolutely deserve to be there but haven\u2019t truly broken America yet; others, like Chloe x Halle, aren\u2019t quite big enough; Greta Van Fleet and Bebe Rexha don\u2019t even deserve to be here. Margo Price has been knocking around for a few years (though that wasn\u2019t a problem for last year\u2019s winner Alessia Cara) and her bluff, matter-of-fact country is hugely likable \u2013 but Luke Combs has had the bigger country breakthrough and so the country vote will be split.

But otherwise, this is a good crop. Halestorm\u2019s Lzzy Hale, hopping between rapid-fire chatter and sky-opening holler on Uncomfortable, remains a great asset to mainstream rawk; Fever 333 are the natural successors to Rage Against the Machine and are stacking up the big choruses; and Arctic Monkeys\u2019 lounge lizard incarnation is a work of genius. But with none of them truly defining the year in rock, there could be a big swell of voting for Chris Cornell, following his apparent suicide in 2017, to help anoint him as one of the American greats.</p> <p><strong>Will win</strong>: Chris Cornell<br><strong>Should win</strong>: Arctic Monkeys</p> <h2>Rap performance</h2> <p><strong>Cardi B \u2013 Be Careful<br>Drake \u2013 Nice For What<br>Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, Future &amp; James Blake \u2013 King\u2019s Dead<br>Anderson .Paak \u2013 Bubblin<br>Travis Scott, Drake, Big Hawk &amp; Swae Lee \u2013 Sicko Mode</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ONRf7h3Mdk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ONRf7h3Mdk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Cardi B has another good shot in this category \u2013 the hoarse, hurt Be Careful was the track that announced her as more than just a mouthy drama diviner ready to trample on you in some Louboutins. But there is heavyweight competition. Drake\u2019s Nice for What is arguably his masterpiece, matching his melodious flow to the minor-key shifts of Lauryn Hill\u2019s Ex-Factor in an utterly joyous, champagne-spraying celebration of female confidence. King\u2019s Dead is a series of excellent episodic ideas that don\u2019t quite hang together \u2013 an accusation you could perhaps also level at Sicko Mode, though Travis Scott should still win for his outrageously brilliant opening two verses.

Maren Morris won\u2019t win for an Elton John cover, but any of the others have a chance. Keith Urban\u2019s ballad is cheesy but gorgeously sturdy; 86-year-old Loretta Lynn is the very definition of \u201cstill got it\u201d and will earn votes from those wanting to bestow a lifetime achievement award on her. But Kacey Musgraves has simply written the year\u2019s best country songs, and Butterflies, replicating the fluttering feeling of new love in its very melody, is no exception.</p> <p><strong>Will win</strong>: Kacey Musgraves<br><strong>Should win</strong>: Kacey Musgraves<br></p>",

Will win: Childish Gambino \u2013 This Is America Should win: Cardi B \u2013 I Like It Album of the year Cardi B \u2013 Invasion of Privacy Brandi Carlile \u2013 By the Way, I Forgive You Drake \u2013 Scorpion HER \u2013 HER Post Malone \u2013 Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys Janelle Mon\u00e1e \u2013 Dirty Computer Kacey Musgraves \u2013 Golden Hour Various Artists \u2013 Black Panther: The Album, Music From and Inspired By This will be the most interesting category in terms of charting how much those 900-odd new diverse voters could make an impact. Kacey Musgraves\u2019 Golden Hour is the kind of album that old-school Academy members drool over: diamond-solid, emotive songwriting that remains contemporary without being scarily fashionable; it is already the winner of the same award at the Country Music Association awards. But Cardi B\u2019s debut album is one that many will get behind \u2013 it has just as wide an emotional range, plus irrepressible star power. Drake\u2019s Scorpion will amass votes too for its dazzling high points and pop cultural footprint, but it\u2019s too patchy to win. Will win: Cardi B \u2013 Invasion of Privacy Should win: Kacey Musgraves \u2013 Golden Hour Song of the year Kendrick Lamar &amp; SZA \u2013 All the Stars Ella Mai \u2013 Boo\u2019d Up Drake \u2013 God\u2019s Plan Shawn Mendes \u2013 In My Blood Brandi Carlile \u2013 The Joke Zedd, Maren Morris &amp; Grey \u2013 The Middle Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper \u2013 Shallow Childish Gambino \u2013 This Is America A very tough category to call. This Is America may win record of the year, but is less likely to prevail in the rather more stately songwriting category. Nothing else quite gets out in front here, though. The Joke\u2019s sisterly sympathy towards homophobic bullying and female struggle is a message voters will want to champion, but it never charted. The Middle is a triumph of major-label collaborative shit-at-a-wall songwriting, but it might be seen as trash by more august voters. All the Stars has two much-loved luminaries, but it is not their very best work. It could well be Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper\u2019s Shallow, the emotional heart of A Star Is Born and a celebration of the power of improvisatory songwriting, that will sneak ahead. Ella Mai\u2019s Boo\u2019d Up could come up on the inside: a huge US radio hit with a brilliant, innovative chorus for the ages. Will win: Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper \u2013 Shallow Should win: Ella Mai \u2013 Boo\u2019d Up New artist Chloe x Halle Luke Combs Greta Van Fleet HER Dua Lipa Margo Price Bebe Rexha Jorja Smith The two Brits in the category, Dua Lipa and Jorja Smith, both absolutely deserve to be there but haven\u2019t truly broken America yet; others, like Chloe x Halle, aren\u2019t quite big enough; Greta Van Fleet and Bebe Rexha don\u2019t even deserve to be here. Margo Price has been knocking around for a few years (though that wasn\u2019t a problem for last year\u2019s winner Alessia Cara) and her bluff, matter-of-fact country is hugely likable \u2013 but Luke Combs has had the bigger country breakthrough and so the country vote will be split. That leaves the arresting R&amp;B singer HER, the only one with an album of the year nomination \u2013 she will surely secure the win. Will win: HER Should win: HER Pop solo performance Beck \u2013 Colors Camila Cabello \u2013 Havana (live) Ariana Grande \u2013 God Is a Woman Lady Gaga \u2013 Joanne (Where Do You Think You\u2019re Goin\u2019?) Post Malone \u2013 Better Now Beck is here surely as part of a care in the community programme, Lady Gaga is here with a song that everyone has forgotten about, and Camila Cabello is here because the Grammys didn\u2019t notice how much of a bop the studio version of Havana was last year. That leaves Post Malone, whose Better Now is an excellent showcase of his gift for nagging melody \u2026 but the Academy will reward Ariana Grande after a tough emotional year in which she nevertheless entered her imperial phase. Will win: Ariana Grande Should win: Ariana Grande Rock performance Arctic Monkeys \u2013 Four Out of Five Chris Cornell \u2013 When Bad Does Good Fever 333 \u2013 Made an America Greta Van Fleet \u2013 Highway Tune Halestorm \u2013 Uncomfortable Greta Van Fleet\u2019s nomination is a handy illustration of how low rock music\u2019s ebb currently is: a staggeringly boring Led Zeppelin redux that suggests a genre completely out of ideas, especially when juxtaposed with the vibrancy of Cardi B, Drake or Travis Scott. But otherwise, this is a good crop. Halestorm\u2019s Lzzy Hale, hopping between rapid-fire chatter and sky-opening holler on Uncomfortable, remains a great asset to mainstream rawk; Fever 333 are the natural successors to Rage Against the Machine and are stacking up the big choruses; and Arctic Monkeys\u2019 lounge lizard incarnation is a work of genius. But with none of them truly defining the year in rock, there could be a big swell of voting for Chris Cornell, following his apparent suicide in 2017, to help anoint him as one of the American greats. Will win: Chris Cornell Should win: Arctic Monkeys Rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Be Careful Drake \u2013 Nice For What Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, Future &amp; James Blake \u2013 King\u2019s Dead Anderson .Paak \u2013 Bubblin Travis Scott, Drake, Big Hawk &amp; Swae Lee \u2013 Sicko Mode Cardi B has another good shot in this category \u2013 the hoarse, hurt Be Careful was the track that announced her as more than just a mouthy drama diviner ready to trample on you in some Louboutins. But there is heavyweight competition. Drake\u2019s Nice for What is arguably his masterpiece, matching his melodious flow to the minor-key shifts of Lauryn Hill\u2019s Ex-Factor in an utterly joyous, champagne-spraying celebration of female confidence. King\u2019s Dead is a series of excellent episodic ideas that don\u2019t quite hang together \u2013 an accusation you could perhaps also level at Sicko Mode, though Travis Scott should still win for his outrageously brilliant opening two verses. He very likely will too, given the superstar was overlooked in the album, record and song categories. Will win: Travis Scott Should win: Travis Scott Country solo performance Loretta Lynn \u2013 Wouldn\u2019t It Be Great? Maren Morris \u2013 Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters Kacey Musgraves \u2013 Butterflies Chris Stapleton \u2013 Millionaire Keith Urban \u2013 Parallel Line Chris Stapleton could win this category for the third time in four years, but given that Millionaire is as generic as its \u201clove is more precious than gold\u201d chorus, someone else will probably get a go. Maren Morris won\u2019t win for an Elton John cover, but any of the others have a chance. Keith Urban\u2019s ballad is cheesy but gorgeously sturdy; 86-year-old Loretta Lynn is the very definition of \u201cstill got it\u201d and will earn votes from those wanting to bestow a lifetime achievement award on her. But Kacey Musgraves has simply written the year\u2019s best country songs, and Butterflies, replicating the fluttering feeling of new love in its very melody, is no exception. Will win: Kacey Musgraves Should win: Kacey Musgraves",

But right now she is having a break from it all and reflecting on the fact that her sixth album, By The Way, I Forgive You, has gleaned six nominations, including in the three biggest categories of song, album and record of the year. Last year, the Grammys\u2019 dearth of female winners came under scrutiny, and former president Neil Portnow declared that it was the women who needed to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/04/grammy-most-patronising-comment-neil-portnow\" title=\"\">step up</a>\u201d.

I would have got stressed out, not slept, got sick, drunk too much. I would have gone wrong, you know? I know what it feels like to not have recognition. It doesn\u2019t feel bad.

She had spent years writing introspectively as a lesbian with a nuanced outlook on love and struggle, a gay woman who was illegally married in 2012 before the abolition of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2015. Following Trump\u2019s election, she understood that this was a revolutionary act. \u201cI realised I was waking up every day political, as a gay mother with two daughters,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing political doesn\u2019t come from outside me any more.

The second verse was written about Syria (\u201cThey come to kick dirt in your face, to call you weak and then displace you after carrying your baby on your back across the desert\u201d), and yet, less than a year later, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s about our own southern border.

After moving house every year, her dad was laid off and relocated the family to a white trailer \u201cup half a mile of dirt road\u201d. Her mother\u2019s father died of motor neurone disease, and her mother, aged 30, and with a newfound <em>carpe diem</em> vigour, bought a PA system to start a band with the money he had left. If Carlile and her two siblings did their chores, they could sing at band rehearsals. \u201cI was addicted,\u201d says Carlile of music. \u201cI\u2019d write down lyrics and obsess about the people that sang them.\u201d</p> <p>She studied Tanya Tucker and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/06/honky-tonk-female-artists-country-music\" title=\"\">Patsy Cline</a> and started performing onstage by the age of eight. \u201cMost of the time I ran around the woods. The rest of the time I practised country music and flunked out of school. Even elementary.\u201d</p> <p>Her entire family dropped out of high school. As school punishment for troublemaking, Carlile and her brother washed buses. One day the church got hold of them and Carlile began studying with a pastor. Around the same time, she decided to come out \u2013 Ellen DeGeneres had just done so and the 14-year-old Carlile followed suit. \u201cI was out of the closet in school. Totally content to be out,\u201d she says. The pastor wasn\u2019t as relaxed, and refused to baptise her. \u201cI had my swimsuit on under my clothes, they\u2019d invited my family and friends \u2013 everyone,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s when they decided to make an example of me. I\u2019d been on a lot of stages in my life, but that was an irreversibly damaging public humiliation.\u201d</p> <p>When writing her album, she realised it was a moment she hadn\u2019t processed, hence the title: By The Way, I Forgive You. Carlile reckons the US could use some forgiveness. \u201cWe have to move beyond our resentment so that we can be productive.\u201d</p> <p>Her songwriting is brazenly honest: take the single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll_QeA-1LZM\" title=\"\">Party of One</a>, which documents Carlile\u2019s marital woes after her firstborn\u2019s birth. Evangeline is biologically related to Carlile but was carried by her wife. \u201cIt was a strange setting-in of conflicting instincts: the birth mother having to win, me having to understand that I\u2019m also a mother and not a father, but there not being a template. I was wondering if I was worthy of motherhood, whether maybe we aren\u2019t supposed to do these things.\u201d Not only did she confront her own \u201cinternalised homophobia\u201d in songwriting, she wrote from a \u201csuper queer perspective\u201d and wound up with something universally resonating. Straight couples tell her how much that song means to them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r6A2NexF88\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5r6A2NexF88?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>She now has a collaborator in Sam Smith, a longstanding fan in Barack Obama, and a confidant in Elton John. With increased notoriety, she appreciates it might be harder to be outspoken, particularly in the country markets, but she sees no choice. I mention a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/12/pistol-annies-the-country-girl-group-confronting-divorce-and-darkness-miranda-lambert\" title=\"\">recent interview</a> I conducted for this paper with the singer Miranda Lambert \u2013 a \u201cdear friend\u201d of Carlile\u2019s and a National Rifle Association supporter \u2013 who dodged political questions. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for country music not to address sensible gun reform,\u201d says Carlile, having just written a yet-to-be-released song titled Cowgirls with the lyric: \u201cThe NRA can kiss my country ass.\u201d \u201cBecause they can!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that. I\u2019m not afraid of who it alienates.</p> <p>\u201c[After the election] it was like somebody turned on the black light and we were surrounded by the filth of our own ideology and our own complacency,\u201d Carlile says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realised I was part of the problem. To not squander the opportunity I\u2019ve been given is an evolution. If somebody believes I\u2019m wrong, I want them to say it so we can engage. Big inclusive sentiments are a salve. They\u2019re not appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>The idea for the Canc\u00fan festival she has organised stemmed from a wakeup call she had five years ago. \u201cI never saw progress going backwards,\u201d says Carlile, who grew up attending Lilith Fair \u2013 the groundbreaking women-centric 90s festival. Carlile played a winter cruise ship \u2013 Cayamo \u2013 and a group of attendees complained about the number of women and gay people. \u201cThey called it <em>Gay</em>amo,\u201d she cackles. \u201cGotta hand it to them, that\u2019s pretty funny, but it was the first time I realised that people categorise entertainment according to gender and sexual orientation. Man, that ain\u2019t cool.\u201d</p> <p>Carlile decided to make a virtue of the exclusion of women from festival lineups. \u201cThere\u2019s an Instagram called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bookmorewomen/?hl=en\" title=\"\">bookmorewomen</a>,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you seen it?\u201d The account copies festival posters, but deletes all male names to highlight what\u2019s left. Some are 100% blank. \u201cI spend a lot of time arguing with promoters in the comments,\u201d she says. Bookers claim that there aren\u2019t enough women artists to book. \u201cThe argument is that women have to be viable in the market, but how can we do the numbers when we\u2019re not getting signed, we\u2019re not getting on the radio? This merit-based ideology is so flawed. It\u2019s gotta start somewhere. Could it be with you?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe7e640d2174e562128b7d84928eaf86c243f6ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe7e640d2174e562128b7d84928eaf86c243f6ea/0_125_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile (right) and Mavis Staples (left) at Girls Just Wanna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brandi Carlile (right) and Mavis Staples (left) at Girls Just Wanna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Stowell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She\u2019s grateful that she came of age amid the pastoral care of Lilith Fair, where she was told to reapply sunscreen by strangers and to go and get some sleep. Recent US studies have shown up to 90% of female concertgoers experience sexual harassment at gigs and festivals. \u201cThat\u2019s not because of men, it\u2019s because of toxic masculinity,\u201d says Carlile. \u201cIf there were more women onstage, there\u2019d be more women in the audience.\u201d She realises her daughters are going to want to go to the likes of Coachella and Bonaroo when they come of age. \u201cYou know how terrifying it is to raise daughters knowing that?\u201d she asks. Would she let them go? \u201cOn principle I\u2019d ask to see the poster. If it wasn\u2019t 50% [equal representation] I\u2019d say no, for any festival, which would mean probably almost all of them now.\u201dThe Grammys stage on Sunday, at least, will set a thrilling example for her kids. She has already revealed that she plans to perform The Joke at the ceremony: a chance to subvert a typically politically light event. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to action,\u201d she says of the song. \u201cIt\u2019s me saying: we still have a chance to turn it around. I don\u2019t have a Messiah complex, but I do want people to hear that message.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/01/ariana-grande-justin-bieber-pharrell-grammys-women\">Grammys' female producers scheme backed by Pharrell and Ariana Grande</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Does she want to win? \u201cOh my God!\u201d she says, as though the thought actually hasn\u2019t crossed her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s about wanting to win.

The second verse was written about Syria (\u201cThey come to kick dirt in your face, to call you weak and then displace you after carrying your baby on your back across the desert\u201d), and yet, less than a year later, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s about our own southern border. When I sing it, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of.\u201d Carlile was born \u201cvery poor\u201d in a little town outside Seattle to parents who married young. After moving house every year, her dad was laid off and relocated the family to a white trailer \u201cup half a mile of dirt road\u201d. Her mother\u2019s father died of motor neurone disease, and her mother, aged 30, and with a newfound carpe diem vigour, bought a PA system to start a band with the money he had left. If Carlile and her two siblings did their chores, they could sing at band rehearsals. \u201cI was addicted,\u201d says Carlile of music. \u201cI\u2019d write down lyrics and obsess about the people that sang them.\u201d She studied Tanya Tucker and Patsy Cline and started performing onstage by the age of eight. \u201cMost of the time I ran around the woods. The rest of the time I practised country music and flunked out of school. Even elementary.\u201d Her entire family dropped out of high school. As school punishment for troublemaking, Carlile and her brother washed buses. One day the church got hold of them and Carlile began studying with a pastor. Around the same time, she decided to come out \u2013 Ellen DeGeneres had just done so and the 14-year-old Carlile followed suit. \u201cI was out of the closet in school. Totally content to be out,\u201d she says. The pastor wasn\u2019t as relaxed, and refused to baptise her. \u201cI had my swimsuit on under my clothes, they\u2019d invited my family and friends \u2013 everyone,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s when they decided to make an example of me. I\u2019d been on a lot of stages in my life, but that was an irreversibly damaging public humiliation.\u201d When writing her album, she realised it was a moment she hadn\u2019t processed, hence the title: By The Way, I Forgive You. Carlile reckons the US could use some forgiveness. \u201cWe have to move beyond our resentment so that we can be productive.\u201d Her songwriting is brazenly honest: take the single, Party of One, which documents Carlile\u2019s marital woes after her firstborn\u2019s birth. Evangeline is biologically related to Carlile but was carried by her wife. \u201cIt was a strange setting-in of conflicting instincts: the birth mother having to win, me having to understand that I\u2019m also a mother and not a father, but there not being a template. I was wondering if I was worthy of motherhood, whether maybe we aren\u2019t supposed to do these things.\u201d Not only did she confront her own \u201cinternalised homophobia\u201d in songwriting, she wrote from a \u201csuper queer perspective\u201d and wound up with something universally resonating. Straight couples tell her how much that song means to them. She now has a collaborator in Sam Smith, a longstanding fan in Barack Obama, and a confidant in Elton John. With increased notoriety, she appreciates it might be harder to be outspoken, particularly in the country markets, but she sees no choice. I mention a recent interview I conducted for this paper with the singer Miranda Lambert \u2013 a \u201cdear friend\u201d of Carlile\u2019s and a National Rifle Association supporter \u2013 who dodged political questions. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible for country music not to address sensible gun reform,\u201d says Carlile, having just written a yet-to-be-released song titled Cowgirls with the lyric: \u201cThe NRA can kiss my country ass.\u201d \u201cBecause they can!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that. I\u2019m not afraid of who it alienates. \u201c[After the election] it was like somebody turned on the black light and we were surrounded by the filth of our own ideology and our own complacency,\u201d Carlile says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realised I was part of the problem. To not squander the opportunity I\u2019ve been given is an evolution. If somebody believes I\u2019m wrong, I want them to say it so we can engage. Big inclusive sentiments are a salve. They\u2019re not appropriate.\u201d The idea for the Canc\u00fan festival she has organised stemmed from a wakeup call she had five years ago. \u201cI never saw progress going backwards,\u201d says Carlile, who grew up attending Lilith Fair \u2013 the groundbreaking women-centric 90s festival. Carlile played a winter cruise ship \u2013 Cayamo \u2013 and a group of attendees complained about the number of women and gay people. \u201cThey called it Gayamo,\u201d she cackles. \u201cGotta hand it to them, that\u2019s pretty funny, but it was the first time I realised that people categorise entertainment according to gender and sexual orientation. Man, that ain\u2019t cool.\u201d Carlile decided to make a virtue of the exclusion of women from festival lineups. \u201cThere\u2019s an Instagram called bookmorewomen,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you seen it?\u201d The account copies festival posters, but deletes all male names to highlight what\u2019s left. Some are 100% blank. \u201cI spend a lot of time arguing with promoters in the comments,\u201d she says. Bookers claim that there aren\u2019t enough women artists to book. \u201cThe argument is that women have to be viable in the market, but how can we do the numbers when we\u2019re not getting signed, we\u2019re not getting on the radio? This merit-based ideology is so flawed. It\u2019s gotta start somewhere. Could it be with you?\u201d She\u2019s grateful that she came of age amid the pastoral care of Lilith Fair, where she was told to reapply sunscreen by strangers and to go and get some sleep. Recent US studies have shown up to 90% of female concertgoers experience sexual harassment at gigs and festivals. \u201cThat\u2019s not because of men, it\u2019s because of toxic masculinity,\u201d says Carlile. \u201cIf there were more women onstage, there\u2019d be more women in the audience.\u201d She realises her daughters are going to want to go to the likes of Coachella and Bonaroo when they come of age. \u201cYou know how terrifying it is to raise daughters knowing that?\u201d she asks. Would she let them go? \u201cOn principle I\u2019d ask to see the poster. If it wasn\u2019t 50% [equal representation] I\u2019d say no, for any festival, which would mean probably almost all of them now.\u201dThe Grammys stage on Sunday, at least, will set a thrilling example for her kids. She has already revealed that she plans to perform The Joke at the ceremony: a chance to subvert a typically politically light event. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to action,\u201d she says of the song. \u201cIt\u2019s me saying: we still have a chance to turn it around. I don\u2019t have a Messiah complex, but I do want people to hear that message.\u201d Does she want to win? \u201cOh my God!\u201d she says, as though the thought actually hasn\u2019t crossed her mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s about wanting to win. I fucking care so much about the nominations. I\u2019m never going to be one of those people who plays it off. I wanna wear the right clothes, I wanna have a great time, I wanna drink champagne. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna win. I don\u2019t know if I wanna win. But I know that I don\u2019t wanna let anyone down.\u201d Her smile starts to look a little pained, a smidgen sad. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna feel embarrassed,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate feeling embarrassed.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 8 February to correct an error \u2013 it was Carlile\u2019s grandfather who died of Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, not her father.",

      "bodyText": "Five years ago, my wife and I moved to the suburbs. I didn\u2019t want to, but I said yes to keep her happy, to get it over with. That plan didn\u2019t work \u2013 I missed the city, and I missed her old self, the adventurous woman I\u2019d first fallen for. Eventually I betrayed her, having an affair with a business contact. When the truth came out, my wife demanded answers and I wrote her an email detailing the history of our relationship from my perspective. In it, I admitted that in order to reach orgasm during sex, I\u2019d often imagine her with other men. In return, she revealed that she\u2019d had revenge sex with a colleague after learning of my affair. I found her account very erotic, and soon we were sharing stories of other flings, kisses and flirtations that had occurred during our 12-year relationship. We had sex often during this time. With my encouragement, she installed a dating app and began seeing other men. Now we sleep with other people, both alone and together. We tell each other everything about these encounters, and enjoy hearing about the other\u2019s adventures. There\u2019s still pain, still fights about the past \u2013 who hurt whom \u2013 but now there\u2019s something else: fun and excitement. We\u2019ve decided to be more trusting and open than we have ever been. We know we are taking a risk, and that it might mean we fail as a couple, but we had already failed. Our marriage isn\u2019t perfect, but we like it, the tension and relaxation. It\u2019s based on who we really are, not who we were pretending to be.

And experts predicted Janus v AFSCME could strip public sectors of a third of their revenues as millions stopped paying union dues for collective bargaining and other activities.

To prepare for Janus, many unions ran massive educational programs to reinvigorate a culture of organizing; not just averting disaster but putting many unions in a position to make gains in membership as public support grows for striking teachers and other public employees. Illinois was supposed to be ground zero for the attack on organized labor following the Janus case. The anti-union Illinois Policy Institute even hired Mark Janus, the lead plaintiff in Janus v AFSCME case, to work full-time as a union-buster trying to persuade his former fellow state employees to drop their union membership.

Chuka Umunna, the MP for Streatham, said: \u201cSo a victim of outrageous racism in Labour must promise she will not walk because of that racism and then this can all go away. How about demanding her CLP treats her with the respect she deserves. How about the party deals with that racism? Words fail me. Totally unacceptable.\u201d Berger has called an extraordinary meeting of her local party after motions of no confidence were tabled against her. Agendas have been issued to 1,700 members of the Liverpool Wavertree constituency Labour party with two motions that both call for votes of no confidence in Berger. The motion says that instead of fighting for a Labour government, Berger \u201cis continually using the media to criticise the man we all want to be prime minister\u201d. McDonnell said the vote had nothing to do with antisemitism. \u201cIf people are doing it [the no-confidence vote] because Luciana stood up to antisemitism then that is wrong. But Luciana has been in the media associated with a breakaway party and has not been clear in stating she rejects that,\u201d he said. \u201cAny elements of antisemitism in the Labour party, we will deal with them. Full stop.\u201d The move against Berger came after she joined other MPs at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday in calling for details of the party\u2019s efforts to tackle antisemitism to be released. Berger\u2019s stance on antisemitism has led to her facing a torrent of abuse from online trolls, and she required a police escort at last year\u2019s Labour party conference after receiving death threats. On Saturday night, three MPs widely rumoured to be involved in a breakaway movement in the Labour party \u2013 Angela Smith, Chris Leslie and Berger \u2013 refused to be drawn into talk of a split, and insisted they were focused on opposing Brexit. But they did not deny that moves could be made by the spring or early summer.",

      "bodyText": "Silvio Berlusconi has returned to the campaign trail alongside Matteo Salvini as his rightwing coalition is revived ahead of elections in the central Italian region of Abruzzo on Sunday. The former prime minister\u2019s appearance at a press conference on Thursday was his first major campaign outing since March last year when the same alliance, made up of his Forza Italia and the two far-right parties, Salvini\u2019s League and Brothers of Italy, took 38% of the vote in general elections. The 82-year-old met Salvini, interior minister in the Italian government, and Georgia Meloni, who heads Brothers of Italy, in the regional capital of Pescara on Thursday to give a show of unity in a region that would be a strategic win for the group. The alliance has put forward Marco Marsilio, a politician with Brothers of Italy, to compete in the regional vote, which is likely to lead to the ousting of the centre-left Democratic party. Recent polls put the centre-right in the lead, with about 39%, followed by the anti-establishment populists of the Five Star Movement (M5S) at 32.2% and a centre-left coalition at 28.2%. Should Marsilio win, Berlusconi \u2013 who said he has always \u201cbeen in love with Abruzzo\u201d \u2013 has pledged to return to Pescara once a month for the first six months to assist him with a programme that includes investment in infrastructure and hospitals, and creating jobs to stop young people from leaving. Berlusconi\u2019s campaigning has included a return visit to L\u2019Aquila, almost 10 years after over 300 people were killed and thousands left homeless by an earthquake. Berlusconi was prime minister at the time and kept a promise to build new homes for the displaced. \u201cIt was very emotional to go back there and to meet the people living in those homes,\u201d he said. If the coalition wins in Abruzzo, it would be a blow for M5S, which is governing nationally alongside the League. M5S won almost 40% of the vote in Abruzzo at the general election. There had been speculation that Salvini, whose popularity has surged since becoming deputy prime minister and interior minister last June, might be tempted to ditch Forza Italia. But Berlusconi, who has led Italy three times, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera on Wednesday that the League \u201chas no vocation for suicide\u201d. \u201cRelations with Salvini are always good, inspired by a mutual loyalty even when we disagree,\u201d he added. Berlusconi, who has made comebacks from a tax-fraud conviction, sex scandals and health woes, also announced in January that he would run as a candidate in the European elections. Forza Italia belongs to the European People\u2019s party (EPP). He said on Thursday that Europe must return to being a continent \u201cthat counts\u201d and not one of \u201cdivided states\u201d.",

It is, however, extremely contagious and explains why the Australian outbreak of 2007 lasted many months.</p>\n    <p><b>How long is the shutdown?</b></p>\n    <p>All race meetings have been cancelled until at least next Wednesday (13 February).

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not going to be a disaster, but the only question is how much disruption it\u2019s going to cause. If there\u2019s any other positives, we\u2019ll have to take it step by step. It\u2019s a significant, important disease that needs to be taken seriously and the BHA are doing that and I\u2019m sure it will be fine.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Tate admits, though, the situation is of less immediate concern for a Flat trainer in Newmarket than it will be for a jumps stable with major contenders for the Cheltenham and Aintree festivals over the next two months.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt appears that the vaccination has not been as effective as we would like it to be, and as effective as it has been in recent years,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019m assuming this strain has mutated a little bit. The vaccine probably provides less protection if it was done a year ago versus if it was done three to six months ago, hence the BHA\u2019s advice that if your horses haven\u2019t been vaccinated in the last six months, give them a booster.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"962a8023bc5d4998f2516d7d2889129943e32843\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/962a8023bc5d4998f2516d7d2889129943e32843/0_0_3500_2253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign at the the gallops in Newmarket on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign at the the gallops in Newmarket on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs a Flat trainer, I\u2019m probably less nervous than some of my jumping colleagues. We are all trying to make sure they\u2019ve had a booster in the last six months but that\u2019s particularly troublesome for the jumps trainers, because you don\u2019t really want to be giving horses vaccinations when you\u2019re preparing them for a big race. You can\u2019t run for seven days after a booster and some people think they affect them more than others. Some horses don\u2019t seem to blink and some horses do. It\u2019s the same when people go for a flu vaccine at the doctor\u2019s, so it\u2019s not ideal to be doing it to horses with targets coming up.\u201d</p> \n<p>Angels Breath, ante-post favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham, was the first big name to miss an intended prep for the Festival when the Sidney Banks Novice Hurdle at Huntingdon was abandoned on Thursday. Several more will join the list over the next few days, including Native River, last year\u2019s Gold Cup winner, and Clan Des Obeaux, who took the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, both of whom were among the entries for the Denman Chase at Newbury on Saturday.</p> \n<p>If, as currently seems likely, the BHA\u2019s testing shows that the flu outbreak has been contained, it will then do what it can to repair the damage to the programme. Some horses may get the pre-Festival run their trainers were looking for, others may not and the form book will be just a little thinner than usual as the runners go to post on 12 March.</p> \n<p>If the outbreak has not been contained, of course, it could all prove to be academic in any case. But, after that initial sense of one minute to midnight, the BHA\u2019s swift action will hopefully ensure that racing will soon edge slowly back from the precipice and start looking forward to the spring.</p>",

It\u2019s a significant, important disease that needs to be taken seriously and the BHA are doing that and I\u2019m sure it will be fine.\u201d As Tate admits, though, the situation is of less immediate concern for a Flat trainer in Newmarket than it will be for a jumps stable with major contenders for the Cheltenham and Aintree festivals over the next two months. \u201cIt appears that the vaccination has not been as effective as we would like it to be, and as effective as it has been in recent years,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I\u2019m assuming this strain has mutated a little bit. The vaccine probably provides less protection if it was done a year ago versus if it was done three to six months ago, hence the BHA\u2019s advice that if your horses haven\u2019t been vaccinated in the last six months, give them a booster. \u201cAs a Flat trainer, I\u2019m probably less nervous than some of my jumping colleagues. We are all trying to make sure they\u2019ve had a booster in the last six months but that\u2019s particularly troublesome for the jumps trainers, because you don\u2019t really want to be giving horses vaccinations when you\u2019re preparing them for a big race. You can\u2019t run for seven days after a booster and some people think they affect them more than others. Some horses don\u2019t seem to blink and some horses do. It\u2019s the same when people go for a flu vaccine at the doctor\u2019s, so it\u2019s not ideal to be doing it to horses with targets coming up.\u201d Angels Breath, ante-post favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham, was the first big name to miss an intended prep for the Festival when the Sidney Banks Novice Hurdle at Huntingdon was abandoned on Thursday. Several more will join the list over the next few days, including Native River, last year\u2019s Gold Cup winner, and Clan Des Obeaux, who took the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, both of whom were among the entries for the Denman Chase at Newbury on Saturday. If, as currently seems likely, the BHA\u2019s testing shows that the flu outbreak has been contained, it will then do what it can to repair the damage to the programme. Some horses may get the pre-Festival run their trainers were looking for, others may not and the form book will be just a little thinner than usual as the runners go to post on 12 March. If the outbreak has not been contained, of course, it could all prove to be academic in any case. But, after that initial sense of one minute to midnight, the BHA\u2019s swift action will hopefully ensure that racing will soon edge slowly back from the precipice and start looking forward to the spring.",

      "body": "<p>When I was a child, around the corner from my home in east London lived a man named William Lyttle. For decades Lyttle had been digging a series of tunnels underneath his house. His activities had made him something of a local celebrity, nicknamed \u201cthe Mole Man of Hackney\u201d, but when one of his tunnels collapsed, causing a huge crater to form in the street outside his house, the council evicted him and filled in his excavations with concrete. He lived out the last few years of his life far above the ground in a high-rise block.</p> <p>The Mole Man of Hackney, Will Hunt argues in his winningly obsessive history of our relationship with underground places, might best be understood as an evolutionary throwback. As a species, he says, humankind has always been fascinated with what lies beneath the surface of the world. This obsession had practical origins \u2013 we descended underground to mine precious minerals, or to seek protection from enemies and predators \u2013 but it also served more spiritual purposes. The ancient Greeks went into caves in search of visions and wisdom. At Lascaux and Chauvet the Magdalenians, sophisticated pre-modern peoples who lived in western Europe during the Palaeolithic era, drew extraordinary pictures on their walls.</p> <p>Hunt first became interested in such places when, as a teenager, a teacher told him about an abandoned railway tunnel that ran near his home in Providence, Rhode Island. He broke in with some friends and was entranced by the strangeness of the subterranean world he had uncovered, and the sense of transgression exploring it provided. He has been going underground ever since. \u201cFor more than a decade,\u201d he writes, \u201cI climbed down into stony catacombs and derelict subway stations, sacred caves, and nuclear bunkers. It began as a quest to understand my own preoccupation; but with each descent \u2026 a more universal story emerged. I saw that we \u2013 all of us, the human species \u2013 have always felt a quiet pull from the underground, that we are as connected to this realm as we are to our own shadows.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The book captures a series of descents: into the ground, but also into literature, the visual arts and the psyche, too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Underground</em> is an account of a series of descents: into the ground, but also into literature and the visual arts, and into the psyche, too. One of the attractions of subterranean places, Hunt observes, is that their meanings are hard to exhaust, partly because we still know so little about them, making them ripe for spiritual association and speculation. The furthest humans have been below the surface, down the Kola Borehole in Russia, is 12.2km: a measly 0.5% of the distance to the Earth\u2019s core. It is an environment that can never be properly seen, or, at least, never be seen all at once. \u201cIn its obscurity,\u201d Hunt says, \u201cthe underground is our planet\u2019s most abstract landscape, always more metaphor than space.\u201d</p> <p>Much contemporary place writing can tend to the ponderous, taking us on lyrical safaris through depopulated natural landscapes, but the great virtue of this book is that many of Hunt\u2019s excursions have the narrative drive of adventure stories. Much of what he describes is genuinely exciting. In one chapter he traverses the whole of Paris underground, travelling with an international band of \u201curban explorers\u201d in a single uninterrupted journey \u2013 a Jules Verne-ish romp in which the group camp by sewer outflows on hammocks strung up on the tunnel walls. He visits the underground cities of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/30/ancient-underground-city-cappadocia-fruit-produce-warehouse\" title=\"\">Cappadocia</a> in central Turkey, and caves in South America in which human sacrifice was once practised. He descends a mile beneath the surface of the Earth into an old gold mine in South Dakota, now used by biologists working with Nasa to study the strange life forms that dwell there. (There is some evidence, Hunt reports, that life on earth first emerged not in the primordial soup but deep underground, in places like this.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edffe98a0c1ea6e0471fb6bf0614b6a50b92e068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edffe98a0c1ea6e0471fb6bf0614b6a50b92e068/0_184_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Paris catacombs, with their \u2018earthy, almost pastoral aroma, like rain-soaked chalk\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Paris catacombs, with their \u2018earthy, almost pastoral aroma, like rain-soaked chalk\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Hockenhull/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another strength is Hunt\u2019s personableness, and his sensitivity to different ways of relating to the places he is so fascinated by. He seems able to talk himself into anywhere. In Australia he seeks out an Indigenous Australian elder who knows the secret songlines of the ochre mines; later he talks to a Native American scholar to try to understand their cave-based origin myths. In one of the best chapters he links the work of the New York graffiti artist Revs \u2013 who spent a decade spray-painting entries from a long, interconnected diary in out-of-the-way spots under Manhattan \u2013 with the work of a group of anonymous Palaeolithic people who, 14,000 years ago, in a cave in southwest France named Le Tuc d\u2019Audoubert, made a pair of astonishingly beautiful sculptures of bison. In a chamber in the cave next to the sculptures you can still make out their footprints, trodden into the clay while they worked.</p> <p><em>Underground</em> is also beautifully written. Hunt is attuned to the smells and textures of subterranean places (in the dark, visual comparisons don\u2019t get you very far), to the \u201cearthy, almost pastoral aroma, like rain-soaked chalk\u201d of the Paris catacombs, and the \u201cold farm shed full of fertiliser\u201d he smells in the New York sewer system. Below Manhattan on summer nights, he says, \u201cyou can almost smell the city\u2019s granite bedrock\u201d.</p> <p>Hunt\u2019s instincts are journalistic rather than scholarly, however, and if I have one frustration with this book it is that it contains no notes or bibliography. When Hunt tells us that \u201cOne 17th-century writer\u201d described entering a cave in Somerset saying \u201cWe began to be afraid to visit it, for although we entered in frolicksome and merry, yet we might return out of it sad and pensive and never more to be seen to laugh whilst we lived in the world\u201d, I wanted to know who this was (Google has not helped). The lack of citations makes me wonder how accurate some his quotations are, too. I find it difficult to believe that the splenetic William Lyttle ever said \u201cI guess I\u2019m a man who enjoys digging\u201d.</p> <p>I also wonder whether I agree with his central premise: that we are all as obsessed with the underground as he is. He believes we are drawn to the subterranean world because we are neurologically primed to descend. \u201cEvolutionary psychologists,\u201d he writes, \u201chave suggested that even our most archaic ancestral relationships to landscapes never quite fade, that they become wired in our nervous system, manifest in unconscious instincts that continue to govern our behaviour.\u201d We go underground, he suggests, because our brains contain some trace memories of the places from which we first emerged, or because we enjoy the experience of sensory dislocation we experience when we get there (in one chapter he camps out in a cave for 24 hours in search of visions, but isn\u2019t very successful). Can this really be true? After all, we\u2019ve lived above ground far longer than we lived below it (if we ever did), and it\u2019s surely only very few of us who actually like going underground, anyway. The rest are quite happy to stay in the light, hearing about what lies beneath at one remove, through the stories and visions of our shamans and seers, and of adventurers like Hunt.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Underground is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a316.99).

The lack of citations makes me wonder how accurate some his quotations are, too. I find it difficult to believe that the splenetic William Lyttle ever said \u201cI guess I\u2019m a man who enjoys digging\u201d. I also wonder whether I agree with his central premise: that we are all as obsessed with the underground as he is. He believes we are drawn to the subterranean world because we are neurologically primed to descend. \u201cEvolutionary psychologists,\u201d he writes, \u201chave suggested that even our most archaic ancestral relationships to landscapes never quite fade, that they become wired in our nervous system, manifest in unconscious instincts that continue to govern our behaviour.\u201d We go underground, he suggests, because our brains contain some trace memories of the places from which we first emerged, or because we enjoy the experience of sensory dislocation we experience when we get there (in one chapter he camps out in a cave for 24 hours in search of visions, but isn\u2019t very successful). Can this really be true? After all, we\u2019ve lived above ground far longer than we lived below it (if we ever did), and it\u2019s surely only very few of us who actually like going underground, anyway. The rest are quite happy to stay in the light, hearing about what lies beneath at one remove, through the stories and visions of our shamans and seers, and of adventurers like Hunt. \u2022 Underground is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a316.99).

The second part of his trilogy is one of Verdi\u2019s most intriguingly ambiguous scores, in a work based on the assassination of Gustav III of Sweden at a masked ball in 1792. The cast is headed by Gwyn Hughes Jones as Riccardo and Mary Elizabeth Williams as Amelia; Carlo Rizzi conducts.<br><em><a href=\"https://wno.org.uk/whats-on/un-ballo-in-maschera-verdi\">Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, Saturday 9 to 23 February; touring to 24 April</a></em></p> <h2>Berlioz</h2> <p>Hector Berlioz died 150 years ago next month, and the anniversary is being widely marked throughout the year. Manchester gets in early with performances of two of his most ambitious dramatic works: Mark Elder conducts the Hall\u00e9 performance of the dramatic legend The Damnation of Faust (Sun), before the BBC Philharmonic under Ludovic Morlot tackle the Shakespearean comedy B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict (16 Feb).<br><em><a href=\"https://www.bridgewater-hall.co.uk/whats-on/bbc-philharmonic-261018/\">Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Sunday 10 &amp; 16 February</a></em><br></p> <h2>Steve Reich</h2> <p>The London Sinfonietta goes on the road this week with a programme devoted to one of the most influential living composers. Although there are no brand-new works in this programme, it ranges across Reich\u2019s career from the early Clapping Music to the 2016 ballet score Runner. His 1976 masterpiece, Music for 18 Musicians, provides the climax.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.stevereich.com/\">Royal Festival Hall, SE1,</a></em><a href=\"https://www.stevereich.com/\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.stevereich.com/\">Tuesday 12; Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Wednesday 13; St David\u2019s Hall, Cardiff, Thursday 14; Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, Friday 15; touring to 16 February</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea3214708836d19b2df576b34f0400faf25d4fca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea3214708836d19b2df576b34f0400faf25d4fca/0_24_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcMorag Keil, Sheep, 2014.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morag Keil, Sheep, 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Project Native Informant, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Morag Keil</h2> <p>Video games, tube trains and a sex machine are among the materials in this Scottish artist\u2019s first big solo show in Britain. She explores the commercialisation of the internet in installations that parody advertising and cannibalise digital tech. The smooth consumerism of our age becomes a post-apocalyptic scrapyard of found stuff.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.ica.art/exhibitions/morag-keil-moarg-kiel\">ICA, SW1, to 14 April</a></em></p> <h2>Diane Arbus</h2> <p>The art of Diane Arbus looks like a surreal invented carnival of American eccentrics, until you notice how raw her people are. Her pictures capture the faces of a society going through a revolution that has not ended yet. This exhibition explores her early work, revealing how the great New York photographer found her uneasy style.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/hayward-gallery-art/diane-arbus-beginning\">Southbank Centre: Hayward Gallery, SE1 Wednesday 13 February to 6 May</a></em></p> <h2>Harald Sohlberg</h2> <p>The Norwegian painter who had the misfortune not to be Edvard Munch gets a rare international outing. Sohlberg was Munch\u2019s near contemporary, dying in 1935, nine years before The Scream man. He is very much an artist of place. Where his compatriot created universal symbols of the human condition, Sohlberg\u2019s poetic landscapes muse on mountains, forests and fjords, on summer light and evening shadows.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/2019/february/harald-sohlberg-painting-norway/\">Dulwich Picture Gallery, SE21, Wednesday 13 February to 2 June</a></em></p> <h2>Is This Tomorrow?</h2> <p>In 1956 the Whitechapel Gallery hosted a revolutionary exhibition about art, technology and commercialism called This Is Tomorrow. The exhibition poster by Richard Hamilton has become a classic of pop art. This show revisits that seminal moment of futurist speculation to look at the sci-fi reality we live in. Participants include Rachel Armstrong, Tatiana Bilbao Estudio and Rana Begum.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/is-this-tomorrow/\">Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Thursday 14 February to 12 May</a></em></p> <h2>Robots</h2> <p>You can meet the latest robots, and even talk to them, in this survey of the human fascination with living machines. How close are we to creating truly autonomous robots? Cutting-edge androids are shown alongside historic artefacts that range from Renaissance automata to film robots. Yet our obsession with creating a new us in metal and plastic goes beyond rational design.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/robots/\">National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, to 15 May</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3bc229271cc5c5a52ca4281d1e492771f0a41f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bc229271cc5c5a52ca4281d1e492771f0a41f11/231_8_816_816/500.jpg\" alt=\"You Stupid Darkness.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You Stupid Darkness!.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Appleton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>You Stupid Darkness!</h2> <p>Sam Steiner\u2019s 2015 debut play Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons announced a playwright with guts and wit. Communication was at the heart of that drama and is a key theme of You Stupid Darkness!, which is set at a volunteer helpline centre. The show will be directed by Paines Plough\u2019s James Grieve, who is a pro at identifying and showcasing talented young writers.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.com/whats-on/2019/you-stupid-darkness/\">Theatre Royal: The Drum, Plymouth, to 23 February</a></em></p> <h2>Waitress</h2> <p>Pie, anyone? Sara Bareilles and Jessie Nelson\u2019s new musical is about a small-town waitress who bakes her way to happiness. It is escapist fun, which started out as an indie film and morphed into a popular Broadway show, where it\u2019s been running since 2016. An all-female creative team, including director Diane Paulus and lead actor Katharine McPhee, head up the West End premiere.<br><em><a href=\"https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/adelphi/waitress/\">Adelphi Theatre, WC2 to 25 May</a></em></p> <h2>Shipwreck</h2> <p>Anne Washburn wrote the brilliantly bizarre Simpsons-referencing play Mr Burns, and returns to the Almeida with a world premiere, directed by Rupert Goold. Shipwreck is set in a rural American farmhouse, where a group of guests are gathering for dinner with President Trump. Goold promises a nightmarish, Kubrick-like comedy. With lots of Trump.<br><em><a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/shipwreck/11-feb-2019-30-mar-2019\">Almeida Theatre, N1, Monday 11 February to 30 March</a></em></p> <h2>Tartuffe</h2> <p>Let\u2019s face it, Moli\u00e8re can sometimes feel a bit trying. But there is a genuinely exciting team behind this contemporary adaptation. Playwright John Donnelly (The Pass) and director Blanche McIntyre both have a healthy sense of theatrical mischief: this one won\u2019t be dull. It is a classic comedy about a charming charlatan, Tartuffe, who causes all sorts of trouble when he is invited into a rich but restless household. Denis \u201cTrue Blood\u201d O\u2019Hare stars.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/tartuffe\">National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, Saturday 9 February to 30 April</a></em></p> <h2>Edward II</h2> <p>A king goes out of his way to protect his favourite follower and invites chaos into his court. It all sounds weirdly similar to Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s film The Favourite but don\u2019t be fooled; Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play is infinitely more vicious, with some haunting poetry and one particularly gruesome murder. It stars Tom Stuart, who has also written an accompanying play, After Edward, which opens 21 Mar.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on-2018/edward-ii\">Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 20 April</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b57343764d29888d212ba2aa9eba8246e454d00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b57343764d29888d212ba2aa9eba8246e454d00/183_331_5197_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: Since she.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: Since She.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Mommert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: Since She</h2> <p>Dance-theatre great Pina Bausch died in 2009, and for a decade her dancers have continued to perform only her works.

Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Monday 11; Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Tuesday 12; Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Friday 15; touring to 17 February MC Ari Hoenig Trio One of the most musical drummer-composers in jazz, Hoenig gives group chemistry and the fast-moving twists in his pieces primacy over spotlight-hogging soloing. Hoenig has partnered stars from Joshua Redman to Herbie Hancock, but locals Tom Ollendorff (guitar) and Conor Chaplin (bass) should be on his inimitable wavelength. Seven Arts, Leeds, Saturday 9; Manchester, Monday 11; The Vortex, N16, Wednesday 13; Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, Thursday 14; RWCMD, Cardiff, Friday 15 February JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Un Ballo in Maschera David Pountney steps down as Welsh National Opera\u2019s artistic director at the end of this season, and so his three-production Verdi project, which began last year with La Forza del Destino, is very much his extended farewell to the company. The second part of his trilogy is one of Verdi\u2019s most intriguingly ambiguous scores, in a work based on the assassination of Gustav III of Sweden at a masked ball in 1792. The cast is headed by Gwyn Hughes Jones as Riccardo and Mary Elizabeth Williams as Amelia; Carlo Rizzi conducts. Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, Saturday 9 to 23 February; touring to 24 April Berlioz Hector Berlioz died 150 years ago next month, and the anniversary is being widely marked throughout the year. Manchester gets in early with performances of two of his most ambitious dramatic works: Mark Elder conducts the Hall\u00e9 performance of the dramatic legend The Damnation of Faust (Sun), before the BBC Philharmonic under Ludovic Morlot tackle the Shakespearean comedy B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict (16 Feb). Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Sunday 10 &amp; 16 February Steve Reich The London Sinfonietta goes on the road this week with a programme devoted to one of the most influential living composers. Although there are no brand-new works in this programme, it ranges across Reich\u2019s career from the early Clapping Music to the 2016 ballet score Runner. His 1976 masterpiece, Music for 18 Musicians, provides the climax. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Tuesday 12; Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Wednesday 13; St David\u2019s Hall, Cardiff, Thursday 14; Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, Friday 15; touring to 16 February AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Morag Keil Video games, tube trains and a sex machine are among the materials in this Scottish artist\u2019s first big solo show in Britain. She explores the commercialisation of the internet in installations that parody advertising and cannibalise digital tech. The smooth consumerism of our age becomes a post-apocalyptic scrapyard of found stuff. ICA, SW1, to 14 April Diane Arbus The art of Diane Arbus looks like a surreal invented carnival of American eccentrics, until you notice how raw her people are. Her pictures capture the faces of a society going through a revolution that has not ended yet. This exhibition explores her early work, revealing how the great New York photographer found her uneasy style. Southbank Centre: Hayward Gallery, SE1 Wednesday 13 February to 6 May Harald Sohlberg The Norwegian painter who had the misfortune not to be Edvard Munch gets a rare international outing. Sohlberg was Munch\u2019s near contemporary, dying in 1935, nine years before The Scream man. He is very much an artist of place. Where his compatriot created universal symbols of the human condition, Sohlberg\u2019s poetic landscapes muse on mountains, forests and fjords, on summer light and evening shadows. Dulwich Picture Gallery, SE21, Wednesday 13 February to 2 June Is This Tomorrow? In 1956 the Whitechapel Gallery hosted a revolutionary exhibition about art, technology and commercialism called This Is Tomorrow. The exhibition poster by Richard Hamilton has become a classic of pop art. This show revisits that seminal moment of futurist speculation to look at the sci-fi reality we live in. Participants include Rachel Armstrong, Tatiana Bilbao Estudio and Rana Begum. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, Thursday 14 February to 12 May Robots You can meet the latest robots, and even talk to them, in this survey of the human fascination with living machines. How close are we to creating truly autonomous robots? Cutting-edge androids are shown alongside historic artefacts that range from Renaissance automata to film robots. Yet our obsession with creating a new us in metal and plastic goes beyond rational design. National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, to 15 May JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows You Stupid Darkness! Sam Steiner\u2019s 2015 debut play Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons announced a playwright with guts and wit. Communication was at the heart of that drama and is a key theme of You Stupid Darkness!, which is set at a volunteer helpline centre. The show will be directed by Paines Plough\u2019s James Grieve, who is a pro at identifying and showcasing talented young writers. Theatre Royal: The Drum, Plymouth, to 23 February Waitress Pie, anyone? Sara Bareilles and Jessie Nelson\u2019s new musical is about a small-town waitress who bakes her way to happiness. It is escapist fun, which started out as an indie film and morphed into a popular Broadway show, where it\u2019s been running since 2016. An all-female creative team, including director Diane Paulus and lead actor Katharine McPhee, head up the West End premiere. Adelphi Theatre, WC2 to 25 May Shipwreck Anne Washburn wrote the brilliantly bizarre Simpsons-referencing play Mr Burns, and returns to the Almeida with a world premiere, directed by Rupert Goold. Shipwreck is set in a rural American farmhouse, where a group of guests are gathering for dinner with President Trump. Goold promises a nightmarish, Kubrick-like comedy. With lots of Trump. Almeida Theatre, N1, Monday 11 February to 30 March Tartuffe Let\u2019s face it, Moli\u00e8re can sometimes feel a bit trying. But there is a genuinely exciting team behind this contemporary adaptation. Playwright John Donnelly (The Pass) and director Blanche McIntyre both have a healthy sense of theatrical mischief: this one won\u2019t be dull. It is a classic comedy about a charming charlatan, Tartuffe, who causes all sorts of trouble when he is invited into a rich but restless household. Denis \u201cTrue Blood\u201d O\u2019Hare stars. National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, Saturday 9 February to 30 April Edward II A king goes out of his way to protect his favourite follower and invites chaos into his court. It all sounds weirdly similar to Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s film The Favourite but don\u2019t be fooled; Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play is infinitely more vicious, with some haunting poetry and one particularly gruesome murder. It stars Tom Stuart, who has also written an accompanying play, After Edward, which opens 21 Mar. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 20 April MG Three of the best ... dance shows Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch: Since She Dance-theatre great Pina Bausch died in 2009, and for a decade her dancers have continued to perform only her works. Now, for the first time, they have invited another choreographer to create for them, Dimitris Papaioannou, whose grasp of the absurdity of the human condition should suit them well. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1 Thursday 14 to 17 February Rambert: Life Is a Dream Don\u2019t expect to keep up with the plot in Kim Brandstrup\u2019s take on a 17th-century play by Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, but do enjoy the blurring of character, fantasy and reality, the Quay Brothers\u2019 atmospheric video design and Rambert\u2019s ever-brilliant dancers. Theatre Royal, Glasgow, Thursday 14 to 16 February; touring to 2 March House of Suarez: Elements of Vogue Manchester\u2019s Queer Contact festival climaxes with a riotous vogue ball directed by Darren Suarez, featuring vogue houses from the north-west competing to be the fiercest on the catwalk. The flavour of New York club culture with a British accent. Manchester Academy 2, Saturday 9 February LW",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/joe-cornish\">Joe Cornish</a>, sitting in front of a pair of silver gauntlets, is ready for war. He almost brought more weaponry, he says. \u201cBut I was worried about being at large in Brixton with a huge sword.\u201d</p> <p>We are at Cornish\u2019s local cafe, a place in Brixton, south London, that serves towers of pancakes, and whose owner knows him by name. Cornish is here to promote his film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6811018/\" title=\"\">The Kid Who Would Be King</a>, an epic adventure about a boy who finds King Arthur\u2019s legendary sword, Excalibur. \u201cIt\u2019s got an army of kids in armour fighting giant winged demons and stuff,\u201d he says, with wide-eyed enthusiasm.</p> <p>Now 50, Cornish has been a legitimate film-maker since 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/attack-the-block-review\" title=\"\">alien invasion comedy Attack the Block</a>, which brought him \u2013 and star John Boyega \u2013 to the attention of Hollywood. But for many, his image is frozen in time: mid-20s, baggy T-shirt, face like a Quentin Blake scribble and perched on the edge of a bed next to his best friend and comedy partner, Adam Buxton. Today, he\u2019s a reassuring mix of both personas \u2013 prone to silly giggles, yet dressed in a director-type padded jacket, trim and sober (he doesn\u2019t drink or smoke any more, coffee is probably off the menu, too).</p> <p>We meet a week after the film\u2019s release in the US, and a day or two after an article in Variety discusses its disappointing debut and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/the-kid-who-would-be-king-box-office-flop-1203119724/\" title=\"\">calls</a> it \u201cone of the year\u2019s first big-budget flops\u201d. A possible $50m (\u00a339m) loss is mentioned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I guess superhero movies have started to work for both children and adults in a slightly troubling way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cornish is braced \u2013 and optimistic. \u201cI think it\u2019s a miracle that it got made. And I feel really grateful and proud that it got made. And that people are seeing it and that reactions, critically and from audiences, are good. I can\u2019t complain about anything. It\u2019s a real anomaly.\u201d</p> <p>The film\u2019s demographic is unique. Created primarily for children and starring young actors, many of whom are unknown, it has very little of the multi-generational wit and few of the cultural references of other, savvier film-makers.</p> <p>\u201cI guess superhero movies have started to work for both children and adults in a slightly troubling way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something a bit healthy about having something just for children. It\u2019s not the same period in your life and in your mind. It shouldn\u2019t be, should it?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwVD1xdAX4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OWwVD1xdAX4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A Kid Who Would be King trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Cornish and his partner don\u2019t have children. \u201cI suppose both movies are a sort of way to have children for a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cTo borrow them and then give them back.\u201d The films also hark back to his formative years going solo to the cinema in Streatham, south London, during a time when \u201cthere were fantastic movies made for children, starring children\u201d.</p> <p>As well as being filled with classic fantasy scenes \u2013 a witchy woman who lives in a tree, demons on horseback \u2013 the film invites more sober parallels to contemporary Britain. The stakes are high: if its child protagonists can fight off evil, they will unite \u201ca nation divided\u201d and thwart men inflicted by \u201cgreed, entitlement and vengefulness\u201d.</p> <p>But Brexit analogies were unintentional. The central idea of the film came to Cornish decades ago, when he was obsessed with both ET and the thought of having a sacred fantasy object that he had to preserve. If anything, the subtext concerns growing up and accepting life\u2019s hardships. Its cherubic lead \u2013 played by Andy Serkis\u2019s son, Louis \u2013 uncovers dark truths about his family and must confront school bullies. Given this focus \u2013 plus the fact a 12-year-old Cornish carried a cardboard cutout of ET with him everywhere he went \u2013 I wonder if he had a rough time at school?</p> <p>He nods wryly. \u201cI was a day boy in my boarding school and I used to keep all my books in a little padlocked cupboard, but quite early on I got pushed into it by a kid called Conrad, and he padlocked me in. It made me late for class and I got very anxious because I knew it meant I\u2019d have to kick my way out and destroy school property. Plus, my legs were very weak.\u201d He smiles. In his looming adult form, at least, Cornish could confidently destroy a book cupboard from within using only his pins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/15/adam-buxton-and-joe-cornish-how-we-made-the-adam-and-joe-show\">Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish: how we made The Adam and Joe Show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being an underdog was always a key part of Cornish\u2019s appeal with Buxton. The DIY charm of the Adam and Joe Show and their XFM and BBC 6 Music radio programmes made them heroes of counter-culture. On late-night Channel 4 in the mid 90s, they were the antithesis of the hyper-energised lads found on shows such as The Word and The Big Breakfast. They also picked up something of a slacker reputation, once dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s foremost couch potatoes\u201d by Dermot O\u2019Leary.</p> <p>Did this go down well with Cornish\u2019s parents, I wonder?

I\u2019d think, well that\u2019s just aimed at me, isn\u2019t it? He may well have been talking to the cat, who did not have a job and was still living at home, as was I.\u201d</p> <p>Cornish\u2019s first job was as a runner on Blue Juice \u2013 a British surfing movie starring Ewan McGregor and Catherine Zeta-Jones \u2013 but his first break he credits \u201calmost entirely\u201d to Buxton, who brought Cornish onboard as co-host on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgFEi9aNUb05gKtqOiKVaR2D3hbJUAsJ\" title=\"\">home video clip show Takeover TV</a>. The pair then had their own baby commissioned: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/15/adam-buxton-and-joe-cornish-how-we-made-the-adam-and-joe-show\" title=\"\">The Adam and Joe Show</a>, which ran from 1996 to 2001. After that they went on to host a show on XFM, then 6 Music, before pursuing separate ventures.</p> <p>Fans would have reason to question the relationship between the two over recent years. Cornish headed to Hollywood, cameoed in Star Wars and schmoozed with Tom Cruise. Buxton built a lower-key but devoted homegrown following with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/15/the-adam-buxton-podcast-louis-theroux-as-youve-never-heard-him-before\" title=\"\">his excellent solo podcast</a>, on which Cornish has appeared as a guest, regaling the clenched-jawed host with tales of Tinseltown. Yet the dynamic seems to have mellowed of late, as their profiles have achieved some sort of parity. </p> <p>Also in their year at Westminster, it turns out, was Louis Theroux (two years their junior, but moved up because he was so clever). Were they always competitive, I wonder? </p> <p>He nods. \u201cIt was very competitive between Adam and me for a bit in a quite an unhealthy way, but we managed to grow beyond that. I always remember being with Adam and Louis on a holiday and around the time of the Waco Siege and David Koresh.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[My dad] used to walk past me and say: \u2018Oh, get a job.\u2019 To the cat. I\u2019d think, well that\u2019s just aimed at me, isn\u2019t it?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cLouis looked very much like Koresh and Adam and I wanted to film a spoof interview with him, and Louis did it in the end, but he was very resistant. I always think he knew that someday it might be bad to have video footage of him pretending to be David Koresh. And also when we put on Bugsy Malone at school, Adam was Fat Sam. He didn\u2019t want to be called Fat Sam, it was Slightly Overweight Sam, and Louis was very stubborn about being in it. He eventually took a small part.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ffb87933fc1f63580e2b6de017495f75180c079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ffb87933fc1f63580e2b6de017495f75180c079/0_948_5385_6726/801.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Cornish\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Cornish</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His brow furrows as he sips his apple juice. \u201cWe were competitive, in a good way.\u201d</p> <p>As for the future, Cornish plans to make more films, saying that the eight-year gap between debut and followup was a case of a lack of confidence, rather than an absence of opportunity. He was recruited as a writer for tentpole productions such as Ant-Man and Spielberg\u2019s Tintin film, but links to other blockbusters such as Star Trek 3 and Die Hard 4 were just loose ends.</p> <p>\u201cI did get offered or approached about those movies and it was very flattering and I would often take a meeting or two. But then I\u2019d think: Nah, this is too much, too fast and I need a bit more experience at making bigger films before I do something like this because the history of cinema is littered with independent movie-makers who made one indie film, then take a massive film that maybe makes loads of money but it\u2019s not really their film.</p> <p>\u201cOr something terrible happens and they get fired or a different director takes over or something. I admired very much how Edgar [Wright] did it in terms of increasing his budgets little by little.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s even up for going back in front of the camera, he says \u2013 on the small screen, at least. In 2001, he co-hosted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAzliuX-i5w\" title=\"\">shortlived topical series, This Week Only</a>, with Nick Frost and Lauren Laverne. \u201cAfter Adam and Joe got cancelled, various people from Channel 4 said: OK, you\u2019ve had your fun \u2013 you\u2019ve done your silly late-night thing. Now it\u2019s time to get serious. Let\u2019s do a proper format \u2013 something that looks like normal television. I think [Adam and I] both felt: Oh, you\u2019re probably right.

      "bodyText": "Joe Cornish, sitting in front of a pair of silver gauntlets, is ready for war. He almost brought more weaponry, he says. \u201cBut I was worried about being at large in Brixton with a huge sword.\u201d We are at Cornish\u2019s local cafe, a place in Brixton, south London, that serves towers of pancakes, and whose owner knows him by name. Cornish is here to promote his film The Kid Who Would Be King, an epic adventure about a boy who finds King Arthur\u2019s legendary sword, Excalibur. \u201cIt\u2019s got an army of kids in armour fighting giant winged demons and stuff,\u201d he says, with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Now 50, Cornish has been a legitimate film-maker since 2011\u2019s alien invasion comedy Attack the Block, which brought him \u2013 and star John Boyega \u2013 to the attention of Hollywood. But for many, his image is frozen in time: mid-20s, baggy T-shirt, face like a Quentin Blake scribble and perched on the edge of a bed next to his best friend and comedy partner, Adam Buxton. Today, he\u2019s a reassuring mix of both personas \u2013 prone to silly giggles, yet dressed in a director-type padded jacket, trim and sober (he doesn\u2019t drink or smoke any more, coffee is probably off the menu, too). We meet a week after the film\u2019s release in the US, and a day or two after an article in Variety discusses its disappointing debut and calls it \u201cone of the year\u2019s first big-budget flops\u201d. A possible $50m (\u00a339m) loss is mentioned. Cornish is braced \u2013 and optimistic. \u201cI think it\u2019s a miracle that it got made. And I feel really grateful and proud that it got made. And that people are seeing it and that reactions, critically and from audiences, are good. I can\u2019t complain about anything. It\u2019s a real anomaly.\u201d The film\u2019s demographic is unique. Created primarily for children and starring young actors, many of whom are unknown, it has very little of the multi-generational wit and few of the cultural references of other, savvier film-makers. \u201cI guess superhero movies have started to work for both children and adults in a slightly troubling way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something a bit healthy about having something just for children. It\u2019s not the same period in your life and in your mind. It shouldn\u2019t be, should it?\u201d Cornish and his partner don\u2019t have children. \u201cI suppose both movies are a sort of way to have children for a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cTo borrow them and then give them back.\u201d The films also hark back to his formative years going solo to the cinema in Streatham, south London, during a time when \u201cthere were fantastic movies made for children, starring children\u201d. As well as being filled with classic fantasy scenes \u2013 a witchy woman who lives in a tree, demons on horseback \u2013 the film invites more sober parallels to contemporary Britain. The stakes are high: if its child protagonists can fight off evil, they will unite \u201ca nation divided\u201d and thwart men inflicted by \u201cgreed, entitlement and vengefulness\u201d. But Brexit analogies were unintentional. The central idea of the film came to Cornish decades ago, when he was obsessed with both ET and the thought of having a sacred fantasy object that he had to preserve. If anything, the subtext concerns growing up and accepting life\u2019s hardships. Its cherubic lead \u2013 played by Andy Serkis\u2019s son, Louis \u2013 uncovers dark truths about his family and must confront school bullies. Given this focus \u2013 plus the fact a 12-year-old Cornish carried a cardboard cutout of ET with him everywhere he went \u2013 I wonder if he had a rough time at school? He nods wryly. \u201cI was a day boy in my boarding school and I used to keep all my books in a little padlocked cupboard, but quite early on I got pushed into it by a kid called Conrad, and he padlocked me in. It made me late for class and I got very anxious because I knew it meant I\u2019d have to kick my way out and destroy school property. Plus, my legs were very weak.\u201d He smiles. In his looming adult form, at least, Cornish could confidently destroy a book cupboard from within using only his pins. Being an underdog was always a key part of Cornish\u2019s appeal with Buxton. The DIY charm of the Adam and Joe Show and their XFM and BBC 6 Music radio programmes made them heroes of counter-culture. On late-night Channel 4 in the mid 90s, they were the antithesis of the hyper-energised lads found on shows such as The Word and The Big Breakfast. They also picked up something of a slacker reputation, once dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s foremost couch potatoes\u201d by Dermot O\u2019Leary. Did this go down well with Cornish\u2019s parents, I wonder? The ones who paid the fees for him to attend Westminster school, and sat through countless \u201cterrible short films\u201d. His father\u2019s tactic, says Cornish, was to address his opprobrium to the cat. \u201cHe used to walk past me and say: \u2018Oh, get a job.\u2019 To the cat. I\u2019d think, well that\u2019s just aimed at me, isn\u2019t it? He may well have been talking to the cat, who did not have a job and was still living at home, as was I.\u201d Cornish\u2019s first job was as a runner on Blue Juice \u2013 a British surfing movie starring Ewan McGregor and Catherine Zeta-Jones \u2013 but his first break he credits \u201calmost entirely\u201d to Buxton, who brought Cornish onboard as co-host on the home video clip show Takeover TV. The pair then had their own baby commissioned: The Adam and Joe Show, which ran from 1996 to 2001. After that they went on to host a show on XFM, then 6 Music, before pursuing separate ventures. Fans would have reason to question the relationship between the two over recent years. Cornish headed to Hollywood, cameoed in Star Wars and schmoozed with Tom Cruise. Buxton built a lower-key but devoted homegrown following with his excellent solo podcast, on which Cornish has appeared as a guest, regaling the clenched-jawed host with tales of Tinseltown. Yet the dynamic seems to have mellowed of late, as their profiles have achieved some sort of parity. Also in their year at Westminster, it turns out, was Louis Theroux (two years their junior, but moved up because he was so clever). Were they always competitive, I wonder? He nods. \u201cIt was very competitive between Adam and me for a bit in a quite an unhealthy way, but we managed to grow beyond that. I always remember being with Adam and Louis on a holiday and around the time of the Waco Siege and David Koresh. \u201cLouis looked very much like Koresh and Adam and I wanted to film a spoof interview with him, and Louis did it in the end, but he was very resistant. I always think he knew that someday it might be bad to have video footage of him pretending to be David Koresh. And also when we put on Bugsy Malone at school, Adam was Fat Sam. He didn\u2019t want to be called Fat Sam, it was Slightly Overweight Sam, and Louis was very stubborn about being in it. He eventually took a small part.\u201d His brow furrows as he sips his apple juice. \u201cWe were competitive, in a good way.\u201d As for the future, Cornish plans to make more films, saying that the eight-year gap between debut and followup was a case of a lack of confidence, rather than an absence of opportunity. He was recruited as a writer for tentpole productions such as Ant-Man and Spielberg\u2019s Tintin film, but links to other blockbusters such as Star Trek 3 and Die Hard 4 were just loose ends. \u201cI did get offered or approached about those movies and it was very flattering and I would often take a meeting or two. But then I\u2019d think: Nah, this is too much, too fast and I need a bit more experience at making bigger films before I do something like this because the history of cinema is littered with independent movie-makers who made one indie film, then take a massive film that maybe makes loads of money but it\u2019s not really their film. \u201cOr something terrible happens and they get fired or a different director takes over or something. I admired very much how Edgar [Wright] did it in terms of increasing his budgets little by little.\u201d He\u2019s even up for going back in front of the camera, he says \u2013 on the small screen, at least. In 2001, he co-hosted a shortlived topical series, This Week Only, with Nick Frost and Lauren Laverne. \u201cAfter Adam and Joe got cancelled, various people from Channel 4 said: OK, you\u2019ve had your fun \u2013 you\u2019ve done your silly late-night thing. Now it\u2019s time to get serious. Let\u2019s do a proper format \u2013 something that looks like normal television. I think [Adam and I] both felt: Oh, you\u2019re probably right. We better grow up now. So that was my attempt to do that. And it was weird.\u201d Does he feel grownup now? \u201cHow can one tell? I\u2019ve got a house. And I make a reasonable living. That\u2019s being grownup, isn\u2019t it? I get up in the morning now,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a cat that I harangue for being unemployed.\u201d The Kid Who Would Be King is released in the UK on 15 February",

From Woyzeck to Faust, Punchdrunk transforms classic plays into sprawling, interactive experiences. The idea is this: traditional theatre shows are passive affairs where you watch a distant stage from the comfort of a chair - but a Punchdrunk show is active, mysterious, and places you inside a fiction you can touch, smell, and even taste. The choice of what to do and where to go is up to you.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of breakthrough in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/dec/08/the-10-best-video-games-of-2016\">Stardew Valley</a> where you go, \u2018Oh my God, I understand what I\u2019m actually meant to be doing,\u2019\u201d says Barrett. \u201cYou have that satisfaction where the world makes sense \u2013 and that\u2019s what it\u2019s like in our shows.

The games industry in particular provides a home for nearly all forms of expression: art, animation, programming, voice performance, acting, stunts, dance, photography, music, literature, poetry, audience interaction and more. No other form of entertainment or art mixes so much, and Barrett is fascinated by the rich experiences this melting pot pours out. Developers conjure worlds from polygons and code, and when he\u2019s gaming he wants to explore every inch \u2013 without the inconvenience of a zombie bearing down on his back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f0bd1772b29991181eddb0c266c339f32656a2c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0bd1772b29991181eddb0c266c339f32656a2c5/0_0_427_349/427.jpg\" alt=\"Exploring a big house \u2026 Resident Evil.\" width=\"427\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exploring a big house \u2026 Resident Evil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c[For me] the original Resident Evil was exploring a big house,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it when the zombies turned up, because then it became too much about the shooting, and that was the only thing you worried about. Shooting has no theatrical attention. But for that magical 15 minutes before it was just empty space, pregnant with atmosphere.\u201d</p> <p>Barrett had exploration in mind in 2003 when his team created <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/dec/17/theatre2\">Sleep No More</a>. The production is a dreamlike retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, meshing a film noir aesthetic with dance, acting, written clues, audio effects, physical theatre, and audience interactivity across tens of rooms. During early research and development Barrett listened to music from Resident Evil and Final Fantasy composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2015/apr/07/nobuo-uematsu-video-game-composer-shaking-classical-music\">Nobuo Uematsu</a> \u2013 but he\u2019s emphatic he was never directly inspired by a particular game. Instead he intended to whip the cloak off a new form of theatre; his team worked to construct a hyper-stylised yet realistic world where masked audiences could wander into Macduff\u2019s empty bedroom and search his drawers for secrets.</p> <p>Sleep No More first opened in London in 2003, and garnered such critical acclaim that it\u2019s since opened in Boston, New York, and most recently Shanghai, where it\u2019s been localised to Chinese culture and language. Following its success, Barrett\u2019s team (including choreographer and Sleep No More co-director Maxine Doyle) continued to experiment with the format, creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/19/theatre\">Faust</a> (London, 2006), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/oct/04/theatre\">The Masque of the Red Death</a> (London, 2007), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/17/drowned-man-hollywood-fable-review\">The Drowned Man</a> (London, 2013).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e71e7ab0532891186051d1465a59065f285adf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e71e7ab0532891186051d1465a59065f285adf7/0_490_4934_2960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felix Barrett, left, and Peter Higgin from Punchdrunk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Levelling up \u2026 Felix Barrett, left, and Peter Higgin from Punchdrunk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But something strange happened after Punchdrunk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/31/sleep-no-more-avant-garde-theatre-new-york\">brought Sleep No More to New York</a> in 2011.</p> <p>\u201cWe had an amazing weird moment when the papers and blogs were doing their round ups of \u2018best album of the year\u2019, \u2018best film of the year\u2019 and so on,\u201d Barrett remembers. \u201cIn one of them, Sleep No More got \u2018best game of the year\u2019\u201d. The article described the show using gaming vocabulary and vernacular. Its hidden secrets were \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d while discovering a new floor was \u201clevelling up\u201d, and the choice of where to go made it an \u201copen world\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were described as a video game I started going back to games to find out more about them, to unpack it, and learn more about game mechanics,\u201d says Barrett. He realised while Punchdrunk wasn\u2019t \u201cever directly inspired by an open-world game\u201d, open worlds give birth to choice, which creates a new way to tell stories \u2013 similar to what he was trying to achieve in theatre.</p> <p>Neither open-world games nor Punchdrunk plots are linear. Events aren\u2019t always funnelled into \u201cbeginning, middle and end\u201d, but can often be experienced in any order. A player could choose to eschew the central plotline of a game and wander off on series of side-quests that another person would only complete after tens of hours of play. Similarly, in Shanghai\u2019s version of Sleep No More, you might pick up Macbeth\u2019s story at the \u201cout damned spot\u201d scene, because you\u2019d spent the first half following a subplot based on Chinese myth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f263b094c48566f530276500fb2e0bc316f4943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f263b094c48566f530276500fb2e0bc316f4943/74_155_3615_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Active and mysterious \u2026 Sleep No More\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Active and mysterious \u2026 Sleep No More</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiang Fan Sherlock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cinema, books and traditional theatre have cemented plot and structure as the building blocks of a good tale, where stories play out exactly as an author, playwright or director imagined. But whereas this type of storytelling is totalitarian \u2013 subject to the vision of the creator \u2013 video games and Punchdrunk\u2019s brand of theatre are democratic. Audiences build their own experiences from an original vision, filled with personal moments that only they might discover and then share with others. Before every Punchdrunk show, for instance, a production staff member called the \u201chead of detail\u201d secretes hand-written letters and clues in rooms that, if found, shed light on the plot \u2013 similar to environmental storytelling in games. Meaning here is more subjective; it depends on whatever you might have seen compared to another player or spectator.</p> <p>By abandoning the notion of linear plot, both Punchdrunk and games have created a new form of artistic experience where the activity of the player or spectator completes the work. Developers and Punchdrunk create the context; players animate it with their choices. Yet Barrett believes this can be pushed further.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"465801c0e7614037ef3733f952cf40dad4982b62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/465801c0e7614037ef3733f952cf40dad4982b62/0_268_4800_2878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Levelling up \u2026 Sleep No More.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The spectator completes the work \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Dobbie/Lindsay Nolin/Punchdrunk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat crazy space between video games and theatre, I reckon is the next frontier,\u201d says Barrett. \u201cIn the next decade that\u2019ll be the big thing. What happens when you actually have World of Warcraft in the real world? What happens when you have someone levelling up in a theatre production?\u201d Using the example of Sleep No More\u2019s, \u201cone-on-ones\u201d, where cast members randomly choose a person and separate them from the audience, taking them into a private room where a new part of the story is revealed, Felix wonders whether a meritocratic approach would change these interactions.</p> <p>\u201cSay you were a level five player, and [a character] would have to actually seek you out for your one on one. How would that change things?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m taking literal game mechanics to enter theatre \u2026 That\u2019s totally what we\u2019re doing. Asking questions in that space. In the same way as there are 15 different genres of games, we\u2019ll soon have 15 different genres of shows. I actually don\u2019t think there\u2019s a vocabulary for it yet. For a while, \u2018immersive theatre\u2019 was bandied about, but whatever this new thing is called, playable shows are the future.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

The choice of what to do and where to go is up to you. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of breakthrough in Stardew Valley where you go, \u2018Oh my God, I understand what I\u2019m actually meant to be doing,\u2019\u201d says Barrett. \u201cYou have that satisfaction where the world makes sense \u2013 and that\u2019s what it\u2019s like in our shows. You can see in that first hour the audience running around like headless chickens, and then start to understand: follow a performer, and the narrative will present itself.\u201d This laissez-faire approach to storytelling means both Punchdrunk and developers have the freedom to experiment with a wide range of narrative devices. The games industry in particular provides a home for nearly all forms of expression: art, animation, programming, voice performance, acting, stunts, dance, photography, music, literature, poetry, audience interaction and more. No other form of entertainment or art mixes so much, and Barrett is fascinated by the rich experiences this melting pot pours out. Developers conjure worlds from polygons and code, and when he\u2019s gaming he wants to explore every inch \u2013 without the inconvenience of a zombie bearing down on his back. \u201c[For me] the original Resident Evil was exploring a big house,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it when the zombies turned up, because then it became too much about the shooting, and that was the only thing you worried about. Shooting has no theatrical attention. But for that magical 15 minutes before it was just empty space, pregnant with atmosphere.\u201d Barrett had exploration in mind in 2003 when his team created Sleep No More. The production is a dreamlike retelling of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, meshing a film noir aesthetic with dance, acting, written clues, audio effects, physical theatre, and audience interactivity across tens of rooms. During early research and development Barrett listened to music from Resident Evil and Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu \u2013 but he\u2019s emphatic he was never directly inspired by a particular game. Instead he intended to whip the cloak off a new form of theatre; his team worked to construct a hyper-stylised yet realistic world where masked audiences could wander into Macduff\u2019s empty bedroom and search his drawers for secrets. Sleep No More first opened in London in 2003, and garnered such critical acclaim that it\u2019s since opened in Boston, New York, and most recently Shanghai, where it\u2019s been localised to Chinese culture and language. Following its success, Barrett\u2019s team (including choreographer and Sleep No More co-director Maxine Doyle) continued to experiment with the format, creating Faust (London, 2006), The Masque of the Red Death (London, 2007), and The Drowned Man (London, 2013). But something strange happened after Punchdrunk brought Sleep No More to New York in 2011. \u201cWe had an amazing weird moment when the papers and blogs were doing their round ups of \u2018best album of the year\u2019, \u2018best film of the year\u2019 and so on,\u201d Barrett remembers. \u201cIn one of them, Sleep No More got \u2018best game of the year\u2019\u201d. The article described the show using gaming vocabulary and vernacular. Its hidden secrets were \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d while discovering a new floor was \u201clevelling up\u201d, and the choice of where to go made it an \u201copen world\u201d. \u201cWhen we were described as a video game I started going back to games to find out more about them, to unpack it, and learn more about game mechanics,\u201d says Barrett. He realised while Punchdrunk wasn\u2019t \u201cever directly inspired by an open-world game\u201d, open worlds give birth to choice, which creates a new way to tell stories \u2013 similar to what he was trying to achieve in theatre. Neither open-world games nor Punchdrunk plots are linear. Events aren\u2019t always funnelled into \u201cbeginning, middle and end\u201d, but can often be experienced in any order. A player could choose to eschew the central plotline of a game and wander off on series of side-quests that another person would only complete after tens of hours of play. Similarly, in Shanghai\u2019s version of Sleep No More, you might pick up Macbeth\u2019s story at the \u201cout damned spot\u201d scene, because you\u2019d spent the first half following a subplot based on Chinese myth. Cinema, books and traditional theatre have cemented plot and structure as the building blocks of a good tale, where stories play out exactly as an author, playwright or director imagined. But whereas this type of storytelling is totalitarian \u2013 subject to the vision of the creator \u2013 video games and Punchdrunk\u2019s brand of theatre are democratic. Audiences build their own experiences from an original vision, filled with personal moments that only they might discover and then share with others. Before every Punchdrunk show, for instance, a production staff member called the \u201chead of detail\u201d secretes hand-written letters and clues in rooms that, if found, shed light on the plot \u2013 similar to environmental storytelling in games. Meaning here is more subjective; it depends on whatever you might have seen compared to another player or spectator. By abandoning the notion of linear plot, both Punchdrunk and games have created a new form of artistic experience where the activity of the player or spectator completes the work. Developers and Punchdrunk create the context; players animate it with their choices. Yet Barrett believes this can be pushed further. \u201cThat crazy space between video games and theatre, I reckon is the next frontier,\u201d says Barrett. \u201cIn the next decade that\u2019ll be the big thing. What happens when you actually have World of Warcraft in the real world? What happens when you have someone levelling up in a theatre production?\u201d Using the example of Sleep No More\u2019s, \u201cone-on-ones\u201d, where cast members randomly choose a person and separate them from the audience, taking them into a private room where a new part of the story is revealed, Felix wonders whether a meritocratic approach would change these interactions. \u201cSay you were a level five player, and [a character] would have to actually seek you out for your one on one. How would that change things? \u201cI\u2019m taking literal game mechanics to enter theatre \u2026 That\u2019s totally what we\u2019re doing. Asking questions in that space. In the same way as there are 15 different genres of games, we\u2019ll soon have 15 different genres of shows. I actually don\u2019t think there\u2019s a vocabulary for it yet. For a while, \u2018immersive theatre\u2019 was bandied about, but whatever this new thing is called, playable shows are the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Greg Dunn addressed a packed Toronto courtroom this week, his voice drew taut as he spoke of his close friend Andrew Kinsman, who was murdered by the serial killer Bruce McArthur. \u201cFractures never heal as well as a break and they tend to bother you for the rest of your life,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cMy life has been truly fractured. My heart, soul and spirit have been fractured. They may heal in time, but it will never be the same.\u201d Others remembered Kinsman as a man whose reserve concealed a generous and thoughtful nature. In the year since McArthur\u2019s arrest, the deaths of Kinsman, Selim Esen, Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Mahmudi, Dean Lisowick, Skandaraj (Skanda) Navaratnam, Abdulbasir Faizi and Kirushnakumar Kanagaratnam have remained open wounds for their friends and families \u2013 left exposed by the high-profile investigation and intense media scrutiny around the case. This week, as the city awaits McArthur\u2019s sentencing on Friday, family and friends have used victim and community impact statements in court as an opportunity to wrest the focus away from the killer, and instead celebrate the eight lives that he cut short \u2013 and mourn their loss. Jean-Guy Cloutier spoke of his best friend, Skanda Navaratnam. \u201cI was always afraid that [Skanda] would get himself in trouble or hurt, because if anyone was in trouble, he would step in to help,\u201d he said. Dean Lisowick\u2019s daughter, Emily Bourgeois, remembered him as as artistic soul, who had grappled with mental illness, homelessness and substance abuse \u2013 but had recently made strides to get his life back on track. She told the court she would never get the chance to reconnect with the father she hardly knew. \u201cThere is no way I could ever know what could have been because he has been taken away from the world,\u201d she said.

Police have denied racial bias in the case, but many of Toronto\u2019s LGBT people \u2013 especially those who are members of visible minorities \u2013 have experienced negative interactions with the police, Vijayanathan said. \u201cIf you want us to report crimes and to be engaged with the justice system, then you need to pay attention to us,\u201d he said. Some of the men lacked stable housing, while others lived in fear of police, the crown said during the sentencing hearing. \u201cThere is evidence that Mr McArthur sought out and exploited these vulnerabilities to continue his crimes undetected,\u201d said the crown prosecutor Michael Cantlon. Kanagaratnam was one of 492 Tamil asylum seekers who fled Sri Lanka after its brutal civil war, making a three-month voyage to Canada on a dilapidated cargo ship.

      "bodyText": "The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, privately complained that he was ordered by president Donald Trump to write the notorious memo justifying the firing of the FBI director James Comey, according to Comey\u2019s former deputy. Andrew McCabe writes in a new book that Rosenstein, who has publicly defended the memo, lamented that the president had directed him to rationalise Comey\u2019s dismissal, which is now the subject of inquiries into whether Trump obstructed justice. Rosenstein made his remarks in a private meeting at the justice department on 12 May 2017, according to McCabe\u2019s memoir, which also accuses Trump of operating like a criminal mob boss and of unleashing a \u201cstrain of insanity\u201d in American public life. McCabe recalls Rosenstein being \u201cglassy-eyed\u201d, visibly upset and sounding emotional after coming to believe the White House was using him as a scapegoat for Comey\u2019s dismissal. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,\u201d McCabe writes. Rosenstein said he was having trouble sleeping, McCabe writes. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here that I can trust,\u201d he is quoted as saying. McCabe\u2019s book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, is due on sale later this month. A copy was obtained by the Guardian prior to its release. The account supports reports last year that Rosenstein was left \u201cshaken\u201d by his role in Comey\u2019s firing. It provides the strongest indication so far that Rosenstein\u2019s private view on the memo clashed with his testimony to Congress saying: \u201cI wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.\u201d His memo was cited by Trump as a reason to fire Comey over his handling of the FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email use as secretary of state. Trump later said that he in fact fired Comey for pursuing the investigation into his presidential campaign\u2019s links with Russia. At the time, the White House flatly denied that Trump had directed Rosenstein to write a justification for firing Comey. \u201cIt was all him,\u201d Sean Spicer, the then press secretary, said of Rosenstein. Five days after his emotional remarks, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, the special counsel, to take over the inquiry into whether Trump\u2019s team coordinated with Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. US authorities concluded Russia aimed to help Trump. Mueller is also known to be investigating whether Trump sought to obstruct justice by firing Comey and taking other steps to impede the investigation. McCabe, a 22-year FBI veteran who was fired after internal investigators said he had been dishonest, is scathing about a president he views as posing a threat to the country. He accuses Trump of undermining the FBI out of fear and diminishing the rule of law. In his sharpest criticism, McCabe writes that after firing Comey, Trump and the White House counsel, Don McGahn, acted like mobsters by in effect offering McCabe protection in return for loyalty. \u201cThe president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate,\u201d McCabe writes, recalling an Oval Office meeting soon after his elevation to acting FBI director. He confirms reports that Trump asked him how he voted in 2016. Having been a lifelong registered Republican, McCabe writes, he did not cast a vote for president that year. McCabe was later publicly attacked by Trump, who abused him and his wife in tweets. McCabe portrays Trump and his senior aides as frequently distracted by TV news and suspicions of leakers in the White House. He is also sharply critical of Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s first attorney general, saying he had trouble focusing, frequently flew into red-faced rages and confused classified intelligence with things he had read in the media. He accuses Trump of using the tactics and rhetoric of totalitarian dictators in persuading loyal \u201cshock troops\u201d that anyone who disagrees with them is a traitor. Trump\u2019s \u201cheedless bullying\u201d and refusal to tolerate any view other than his own is \u201cnurturing a strain of insanity in public dialogue\u201d that is then further amplified by online media, McCabe writes. The book does not reveal new findings from the Trump-Russia investigation but gives a tantalizing detail within what McCabe says is a \u201chypothetical\u201d that explains FBI protocol. If the bureau learns that someone from a US political campaign and a high-ranking foreign official discussed \u201cpossibly colluding\u201d, he writes, then the FBI would be obliged to investigate.",

Plans were finalised in 1961, and construction completed five years later. Filled with timber and glass throughout the modern concrete shell, the building was designed in the brutalist style.

In 2007 it was announced that the former seminary was to be included in the World Monuments Fund\u2019s 100 most endangered sites list. Later that year, the developer Urban Splash became involved, working with the architect Gareth Hoskins, and in 2009 the environmental arts group NVA were awarded a grant by the Scottish Arts Council to develop temporary and permanent artworks as part of the redevelopment of the building and surrounding woodlands. In 2011, Urban Splash pulled out owing to viability issues. and the archdiocese of Glasgow reiterated its view that no commercial scheme would be viable for the site. ERZ landscape architects applied for planning permission for a site focused on regeneration in 2013. The National Lottery Heritage Fund helped initiate a major cleanup of the site in 2016, and that year the environmental and public art collective NVA stage a sellout 10-day a sound and light event. NVA\u2019s Hinterland in Performance in 2016, St Peter\u2019s Seminary. NVA hoped to make it a cultural centre but the plans never got off the ground. This month, the Catholic church, which still owns the site, said the building had been degraded by fire, rain and vandalism and described it as a \u201cruin\u201d. Ronnie Convery, the director of communications for the archdiocese of Glasgow, said the building was an \u201calbatross around the neck\u201d of the archdiocese, which has theresponsibility to maintain, secure, and insure it. The archdiocese could not sell, give away, or demolish the A-listed building, he said, adding that public funding was the only way forward. Graffiti now adorns the concrete through the shell. \u201cIf someone were to go today through the forest and try to find this A-listed masterpiece they would probably be shocked because it looks to an average person, who does not have a lot of architectural background, a bit like a concrete car park that has fallen into ruin,\u201d said Convery. \u201cFor those who understand such things, the brutalist architecture of the day, the materials used, were unique.\u201d On the concrete structure remains. The staircases and bannisters were timber, and there was wood panelling throughout. Photographs: GSA Archive He added: \u201cIt draws heavily from Le Corbusier\u2019s work in the south of France and was part of the Gillespie, Kidd and Coia empire and is considered the best of their works. Therefore it is a significant building for the nation and probably one that needs public money to survive.\u201d The convent block now, and when it was first completed. A Scottish government spokesman said: \u201cIn the first instance, the future of the building is a matter for the archdiocese of Glasgow, who own the building. Scottish ministers asked Historic Environment Scotland for advice on potential options for the future of the former seminary, and the wider site. This is under consideration.\u201d",

In this collection by the Nobel prize winning author \u2013 widely, ardently considered to be one of the world\u2019s best writers \u2013 there are 40 years of her essays, speeches and meditations, including her thoughts and arguments about politics, art and writing. The book contains exhortations and transcribed question-and-answer sessions, reflections and analyses, exegeses and commencement talks. In other words, it\u2019s a large, rich, heterogeneous book, and hallelujah.</p> <p>Organised into three parts titled \u201cThe Foreigner\u2019s Home\u201d, \u201cBlack Matter(s)\u201d, and \u201cGod\u2019s Language\u201d, each section begins with a moving address to the dead: respectively, to those who died on September 11, Martin Luther King and James Baldwin. \u201cThe Foreigner\u2019s Home\u201d is centred on politics, particularly on questions of otherness, foreignness, citizenship and nationalism. Of who, especially in the US, gets to belong. Morrison makes plain that racism, tribalism and bigotry are nothing new \u2013 are, in fact, inherent to the broken foundation on which the nation was formed.</p> <p>For instance, in \u201cMoral Inhabitants\u201d, she runs through a harrowing list of the things \u201cour conquerors (our forefathers), our men of vision and power in America\u201d have said about marginalised people. Morrison quotes Theodore Roosevelt on Native people, Ulysses S Grant on Jewish immigrants, the New York Tribune on Chinese people, Benjamin Franklin on black people, and on and on, ending with a deeply sickening diary selection from William Byrd, the founder of Richmond, Virginia, in which he catalogues who whipped and brutalised which of his slaves.</p> <p>That history is terrible; the present is, of course, hardly wonderful. Reviewing the history of genocide, she posits that \u201cnation-states, governments seeking legitimacy and identity, seem able and determined to shape themselves by the destruction of a collective \u2018other\u2019\u201d, and that \u201cfor an assumed safety, hegemony, or pure land grabs, foreigners were constructed as the sum total of the putative nation\u2019s ills\u201d. This is from a lecture given at Oberlin College, Ohio, in 2009, but until I checked the index, I thought it might be from 2019. \u201cPorous borders are understood in some quarters to be areas of threat and certain chaos, and whether real or imagined, enforced separation is posited as the solution,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may be that the most defining characteristic of our times is that, again, walls and weapons feature as prominently now as they once did in medieval times.\u201d</p> <p>With this book, one is tempted to quote at length from her words: her acuity and moral clarity are dazzling, but so is her vision for how we might find our way towards a less unjust, less hateful future. Race bias, she notes, \u201cis not absolute, inevitable, or immutable\u201d. What\u2019s more, \u201cit has a beginning, a life, a history in scholarship, and it can have an end.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison believes in the power of language to move us towards this more desirable end, and one of the keenest pleasures of this book, especially for the many admirers of her fiction, will be the detailed explications of her own writing. There\u2019s a fascinating explanation of revisions she made to the last sentence of her great 1987 novel, <em>Beloved</em>. In the printed version, the novel ends with the phrase \u201cCertainly no clamor for a kiss\u201d, and Morrison tells us there had been a different, more vernacular and \u201cracially resonant\u201d word than kiss, one that her editor found to be \u201ctoo dramatic, too theatrical\u201d.</p> <p>With this unspecified word, she wanted to carve from American English \u201cits accretions of deceit, blindness, ignorance, paralysis, and sheer malevolence so that certain kinds of perceptions were not only available but were inevitable\u201d. After much thinking, she changed the word to \u201ckiss\u201d, a decision she now regrets: \u201cThe trouble it takes to find just one word and know that it is that note and no other that would do is an extraordinary battle. To have found it and lost it is in retrospect infuriating.\u201d</p> <p>Could one word matter so much? Maybe, she says, especially if \u201cthe writing of it tries for racial specificity and figurative coherence\u201d (and this reader cheers, agreeing). The lasting regret has caused Morrison to \u201crethink the subtle yet pervasive attachments we may all have to the architecture of race\u201d. Next, she repudiates the first pages of her novel <em>Sula</em>, which she begins with what she calls a \u201csafe, welcoming lobby\u201d to bring readers past the threshold of her book into a \u201cblack-topic text\u201d. She wants, she says, to identify \u201cthe strategies one can be forced to resort to in trying to accommodate the mere fact of writing about, for, and out of black culture while accommodating and responding to mainstream \u2018white\u2019 culture\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d61d13cc3f73fee248bc8c45c23a2c15434aa336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d61d13cc3f73fee248bc8c45c23a2c15434aa336/0_112_1771_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Thandie Newton, Oprah Winfrey and Kimberly Elise in the film adaptation of Beloved (1998)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Thandie Newton, Oprah Winfrey and Kimberly Elise in the film adaptation of <em>Beloved</em> (1998)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/TOUCHSTONE PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then she turns her attention to the first, unforgettable lines of <em>Beloved</em>: \u201c124 was spiteful.

These are such important questions for writers, for readers and for everyone else: who\u2019s considered to be the audience?</p> <p>\u201cCanon building is empire building,\u201d Morrison says, words that should be sent to every professor who includes only white writers on a syllabus, to every all-white literary prize list. \u201cCanon defense is national defense.

These are difficult and alarming times, with hatred and fascism making front-page news day after day: \u201cIt really is not a good time to write,\u201d she concedes. But then again, she says, it never has been a good time to write. \u201cAs writers, what we do is remember. And to remember this world is to create it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a world Morrison has played a vital, original, farsighted role in creating. <em>Mouth Full of Blood</em> is a bracing reminder of what words do, how carefully they should and can be used. Here is one of Morrison\u2019s many magnificent, rigorously argued calls to bravery: \u201cOur past is bleak. Our future dim. But I am not reasonable. A reasonable man adjusts to his environment. An unreasonable man does not. All progress, therefore, depends on the unreasonable man. I prefer not to adjust to my environment.

Tuzla\u2019s name is derived from the Turkish word <em>tuz</em>, which means \u201csalt\u201d: the city is built over the ancient Pannonian Sea, which was mined for its rock salt over several centuries. By 2000 it was causing entire sections of the city centre to sink.</p> <p>Imamovi\u0107\u2019s solution was to turn Tuzla\u2019s biggest problem into its biggest asset. He employed a team of experts to create a fake lake, by siphoning saltwater to the surface and keeping it at a stable level. The result was the 12,000 sq ft Pannonian Lake, completed in 2003.</p> <p>Now the area, previously foetid marshland, has been transformed, with children playing in the turquoise water, couples sunbathing on the gravel beach and families strolling to the old town for <em>burek</em>, a Bosnian meat pastry.

      "bodyText": "In 2000, when Jasmin Imamovi\u0107 became mayor of Tuzla, it was a dilapidated, swampy mining settlement short on prospects. Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s third-largest city had suffered badly in the Bosnian war, and from recessions, low wages and exodus of people since. In an apt metaphor, the city was also sinking. Tuzla\u2019s name is derived from the Turkish word tuz, which means \u201csalt\u201d: the city is built over the ancient Pannonian Sea, which was mined for its rock salt over several centuries. By 2000 it was causing entire sections of the city centre to sink. Imamovi\u0107\u2019s solution was to turn Tuzla\u2019s biggest problem into its biggest asset. He employed a team of experts to create a fake lake, by siphoning saltwater to the surface and keeping it at a stable level. The result was the 12,000 sq ft Pannonian Lake, completed in 2003. Now the area, previously foetid marshland, has been transformed, with children playing in the turquoise water, couples sunbathing on the gravel beach and families strolling to the old town for burek, a Bosnian meat pastry. Last summer it attracted up to 13,000 people a day, many drawn by the supposedly medicinal properties of the only salt lake in a European city. Tuzla\u2019s economy has also changed massively. The tourism and service industries are now its biggest sectors \u2013 a sharp change of direction for a city previously known for its coal plants and smoke-filled skies.

The beach, the Catalan capital\u2019s largest, is credited with catapulting Barcelona into the top ranks of European travel destinations: the yearly number of visitors staying in hotels in the city rose from 1.7 million in 1990 to 8.9 million in 2017. Previously a neglected strip of waterfront populated by fishermen and residents pushed out of the centre, the Barceloneta neighbourhood is now the face of the city and one of its most vibrant areas. Not all Barcelona residents are enamoured with their artificial beach, though. \u201cBarceloneta is kind of a halfway house in terms of sustainable placemaking success,\u201d says Malcolm Allan, president of the place branding strategist Bloom Consulting. \u201cIt got people into an urban space that had not been used properly and transformed it.

Some of the research proposals were so poor as to be virtually illiterate, but they were still accepted so long as the students had their wallets open.</p> <p>Nobody cared about whether these students succeeded: they were provided with unsuitable supervisors who either didn\u2019t have a PhD or lacked expertise in the student\u2019s area of interest. I later discovered that some PhD students were not supervised at all. The computerised records claimed supervisions every one or two months, but the students said they took place once in two years. The quality of the work submitted at that point confirmed the students\u2019 version of events.</p> <p>I raised concerns about the practice verbally and in emails. A month later I was accused of gross misconduct (on another matter). I was accused of lacking professional integrity and taken through a shambolic disciplinary process. I received apologies but I was also advised to \u201cshut up\u201d about my concerns. The situation and how it was handled was devastating, and the stress became unbearable. The accusations of dishonesty were shocking and frightening, particularly as they were disseminated to other staff members.</p> <p>I was off sick for a while as a result of the experience. As soon as I was well enough, I lodged grievances about the arbitrary disciplinary process against me, as well as to alert the university to unethical behaviour in the department.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, while working in a business school, I was the academic in my department responsible for looking after PhD students. Around this time, the department dean identified international PhD students as a lucrative income stream. He hoped this might help shore up the department, since his strengths didn\u2019t lie in securing research funding or drawing income from local businesses. He started by aggressively recruiting international students with full fees or bursaries awarded by their country of origin, even when they didn\u2019t have the skills to complete the course successfully. This didn\u2019t matter to the dean \u2013 what counted was the money \u2013 and the scheme was a financial success. The international students recruited solely for income rather predictably did not make good progress because they were doomed to fail from the outset. Some of the research proposals were so poor as to be virtually illiterate, but they were still accepted so long as the students had their wallets open. Nobody cared about whether these students succeeded: they were provided with unsuitable supervisors who either didn\u2019t have a PhD or lacked expertise in the student\u2019s area of interest. I later discovered that some PhD students were not supervised at all. The computerised records claimed supervisions every one or two months, but the students said they took place once in two years. The quality of the work submitted at that point confirmed the students\u2019 version of events. I raised concerns about the practice verbally and in emails. A month later I was accused of gross misconduct (on another matter). I was accused of lacking professional integrity and taken through a shambolic disciplinary process. I received apologies but I was also advised to \u201cshut up\u201d about my concerns. The situation and how it was handled was devastating, and the stress became unbearable. The accusations of dishonesty were shocking and frightening, particularly as they were disseminated to other staff members. I was off sick for a while as a result of the experience. As soon as I was well enough, I lodged grievances about the arbitrary disciplinary process against me, as well as to alert the university to unethical behaviour in the department. The documents I compiled were methodical and careful \u2013 my claim was that I had been \u201cset up\u201d to be fired because I blew the whistle over the practice of recruiting international students for PhD courses that they could never complete, solely for the income they would bring to the business school. The university refused to investigate the grievances, saying they had arrived too late (disregarding my period of illness), and denied my attempts at whistleblowing on the grounds that it had no legal obligation towards the success of the international PhD students. Eventually, in a meeting, a senior member of staff agreed that there were big problems with international student recruitment in the business school. But again, I was disheartened to watch my appeal go nowhere. I\u2019m still exploring legal avenues to ensure the business school is held accountable for targeting these vulnerable international students, who placed their trust (and fees) in us.",

Or you may have been distracted by other things we don\u2019t have, like a functioning government or a vision for the future that doesn\u2019t feature critical pesto shortages.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s live selection is on BBC2 tonight, with a new twist: this year there are three songs in the shortlist, each performed by two artists so the public and panel of judges can choose the best version of the best song.</p> <p>It sounds good on paper, and in fairness we really can\u2019t do any worse than recent years \u2013 the UK hasn\u2019t troubled the top half of the Grand Final score board since Blue sang I Can in 2011. Clearly we <em>can\u2019t</em>, probably because we keep sending three-minute yawns to a contest that ditched naff novelty tunes in favour of uber-polished performances years ago. Sadly the BBC\u2019s selection criterion seems to be \u201cprobably won\u2019t come last\u201d, a bar so low you\u2019d need limbo training to navigate it.</p> <p>So who are this year\u2019s runners and riders, and are any of the songs likely to tickle Europe\u2019s fancy? SPOILER ALERT: NO. But let\u2019s go with it anyway; it\u2019s more fun than stockpiling chickpeas.</p> <h2><strong>Song one: Bigger Than Us</strong></h2> <p><strong>Artist one: Michael Rice</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr-6bmiMlys\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gr-6bmiMlys?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This soaring piano ballad has a key change so vast and cheesy you could pour it into a pot and call it fondue. Songs with a key change rarely do well at Eurovision unless they\u2019re amazing in all other respects. Unless Rice has some showstopping staging up his sleeve, this absolutely isn\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>Artist two: Holly Tandy</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVjG7nwBoN0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lVjG7nwBoN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Holly has given Bigger Than Us a foot-tappy country feel, switching the piano for a guitar and ditching the monster key change for a drum-based breakdown. I much prefer this: with some live drums and Holly crooning into a massive wind machine, I could imagine the crowd quite enjoying themselves.</p> <h2><strong>Song two: Freaks</strong></h2> <p><strong>Artist one: Jordan Clarke</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJjVSfSFk14\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sJjVSfSFk14?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This song lost me at the unforgivable use of the word \u201csoccer\u201d in line two, and was dangling over the bin by the time Jordan kicked into the chorus, which sounds like a CBeebies version of Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s less than 100 days to the Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv in May, and the beady-eyed among you may have noticed that the UK doesn\u2019t have a Song for Europe yet. Or you may have been distracted by other things we don\u2019t have, like a functioning government or a vision for the future that doesn\u2019t feature critical pesto shortages. The UK\u2019s live selection is on BBC2 tonight, with a new twist: this year there are three songs in the shortlist, each performed by two artists so the public and panel of judges can choose the best version of the best song. It sounds good on paper, and in fairness we really can\u2019t do any worse than recent years \u2013 the UK hasn\u2019t troubled the top half of the Grand Final score board since Blue sang I Can in 2011. Clearly we can\u2019t, probably because we keep sending three-minute yawns to a contest that ditched naff novelty tunes in favour of uber-polished performances years ago. Sadly the BBC\u2019s selection criterion seems to be \u201cprobably won\u2019t come last\u201d, a bar so low you\u2019d need limbo training to navigate it. So who are this year\u2019s runners and riders, and are any of the songs likely to tickle Europe\u2019s fancy? SPOILER ALERT: NO. But let\u2019s go with it anyway; it\u2019s more fun than stockpiling chickpeas. Song one: Bigger Than Us Artist one: Michael Rice This soaring piano ballad has a key change so vast and cheesy you could pour it into a pot and call it fondue. Songs with a key change rarely do well at Eurovision unless they\u2019re amazing in all other respects. Unless Rice has some showstopping staging up his sleeve, this absolutely isn\u2019t. Artist two: Holly Tandy Holly has given Bigger Than Us a foot-tappy country feel, switching the piano for a guitar and ditching the monster key change for a drum-based breakdown. I much prefer this: with some live drums and Holly crooning into a massive wind machine, I could imagine the crowd quite enjoying themselves. Song two: Freaks Artist one: Jordan Clarke This song lost me at the unforgivable use of the word \u201csoccer\u201d in line two, and was dangling over the bin by the time Jordan kicked into the chorus, which sounds like a CBeebies version of Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance. The only hope for this is if Jordan\u2019s performance is equally bonkers, in which case I might get on board. Artist two: MAID The second version of Freaks is sung by all-girl trio MAID, who all look suspiciously un-freakish \u2013 their version is accompanied by plinky plonky sound effects and the background moan of a dying bear. I can only conclude that this song was included to make the other two seem more appealing; it\u2019s the musical equivalent of the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu. We should never speak of it again. Song three: Sweet Lies Artist one: Kerrie-Anne Oh thank goodness, it\u2019s a throw-your-hands-in-the-air banger. Every Eurovision needs a massive dancefloor anthem, and I\u2019m not fussed that this one sounds like it\u2019s been shipped in from 1994 with no apologies for being 25 years late to the party. It\u2019s crying out for shirtless dancers and Kerrie-Anne belting this out in a haze of sequins. Count me in. Artist two: Anisa There are many things you could have done with a song this uplifting, from a soaring drum\u2018n\u2019bass remix to massive rock anthem.

The entitlement is offered to individuals who own shares in a company in recognition of the tax on profits paid by that company.

The value of the franking credit is equivalent to the tax paid on the individual\u2019s share of the company profit before it was distributed as a dividend.</p>\n    <p>The rationale for the credit is to avoid double taxation. Because the company has already paid tax on the dividend, the accompanying franking credit reduces tax payable by the individual on their total taxable income.</p>\n    <p>If a company is paying the full 30% company tax rate, a \u201cfully franked\u201d dividend of 70 cents per share will be accompanied by a franking credit of 30 cents per share, representing the tax that the company has paid on its $1 per share of pre-tax profits.</p>\n    <p>Franking credits are only available to Australian residents. Historically, the ATO did not refund individuals with cash for any franking credits in excess of their tax payable, but this was changed by the Howard government in 2000 to allow individuals to receive cash refunds even if they do not pay any personal income tax.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Thistlethwaite said the report was \u201chighly concerning\u201d and asked Colvin to investigate whether Tim Wilson or any officer of Wilson Asset Management \u201cmay have committed any criminal offence\u201d.</p> \n<p>He noted that under <a href=\"http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/s91b.html\">section 91B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act</a>, the use or disclosure of voter information obtained from the electoral roll is a crime, punishable by a fine of up to $210,000.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/s91a.html\">the Act allows use and disclosure</a> of the electoral roll by MPs and others including private companies for \u201cany purpose in connection with an election\u201d.</p> \n<p>Labor has also asked the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to consider whether Tim Wilson misused the Commonwealth coat of arms in a tweet and in letters to constituents, where it reportedly appeared alongside the Liberal party logo.</p> \n<p>Tim Wilson suggested voters might have been contacted because \u201cif [they] tick the box that they want to be kept informed of the campaign to stop the retirement tax at stoptheretirementtax.com.au we will do so\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is an election issue, and ultimately will be informed by who wins government,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>In his statement, Geoff Wilson said Wilson Asset Management \u201cdid not fund <a href=\"http://www.stoptheretirementtax.com/\">www.stoptheretirementtax.com</a>\u201d but admitted he \u201cpersonally contributed to the website in the appropriate way, along with a number of other concerned individuals\u201d.</p> \n<p>Geoff Wilson said: \u201cOur shareholders\u2019 data is safe and has not been shared.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have only communicated with our shareholders and signatories of our petition.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labor member David Craig, a retiree with a self-managed super fund, told Guardian Australia he made a submission in support of Labor\u2019s policy on the stoptheretirementtax website.</p> \n<p>At that time the website required submitters to tick to sign a petition, which is run by Wilson Asset Management, and agree to future campaign communications.</p> \n<p>Craig was then contacted by Wilson Asset Management with campaign information, including future hearing dates for the committee.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought I was sending a submission to a parliamentary inquiry,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was infuriated I had to tick that I was against the policy to make a submission.

      "bodyText": "The fund manager Geoff Wilson has admitted to part-funding the website through which the Liberal MP Tim Wilson has coordinated opposition to Labor\u2019s franking credit policy, while chairing an inquiry into it. Late on Friday Geoff Wilson issued a statement clarifying his involvement in stoptheretirementtax.com.au, after a growing controversy over whether the pair \u2013 who are first cousins once-removed \u2013 have inappropriately politicised the parliamentary inquiry. On Friday Labor asked the Australian federal police to investigate whether Tim Wilson inappropriately shared electoral roll information for commercial purposes while campaigning against the opposition\u2019s franking credit policy. The referral was based on a Fairfax Media report that a constituent of Wilson\u2019s received material both from the Liberal MP and from Wilson Asset Management, the funds management company chaired by Geoff Wilson, after responding to a robopoll. Tim Wilson, who chairs the House economics committee and is also a shareholder in funds managed by Wilson Asset Management, has denied any wrongdoing, telling Guardian Australia he had \u201cnot shared any voter\u2019s private information from the electoral roll with [Wilson Asset Management]\u201d. The Fairfax Media report quoted a resident of the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, Gwen Woodford, who said she had answered \u201cyes\u201d to a robocall from Tim Wilson, and later received \u201cmultiple emails promoting Wilson Asset Management funds\u201d. Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite, the deputy chair of the committee, wrote to the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, on Friday arguing the report suggested Tim Wilson had \u201cobtained private information from the Commonwealth electoral roll and disclosed it to Wilson Asset Management\u201d to allow it to market its financial products to voters. Thistlethwaite said the report was \u201chighly concerning\u201d and asked Colvin to investigate whether Tim Wilson or any officer of Wilson Asset Management \u201cmay have committed any criminal offence\u201d. He noted that under section 91B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the use or disclosure of voter information obtained from the electoral roll is a crime, punishable by a fine of up to $210,000. However, the Act allows use and disclosure of the electoral roll by MPs and others including private companies for \u201cany purpose in connection with an election\u201d. Labor has also asked the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to consider whether Tim Wilson misused the Commonwealth coat of arms in a tweet and in letters to constituents, where it reportedly appeared alongside the Liberal party logo. Tim Wilson suggested voters might have been contacted because \u201cif [they] tick the box that they want to be kept informed of the campaign to stop the retirement tax at stoptheretirementtax.com.au we will do so\u201d. \u201cThis is an election issue, and ultimately will be informed by who wins government,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. In his statement, Geoff Wilson said Wilson Asset Management \u201cdid not fund www.stoptheretirementtax.com\u201d but admitted he \u201cpersonally contributed to the website in the appropriate way, along with a number of other concerned individuals\u201d. Geoff Wilson said: \u201cOur shareholders\u2019 data is safe and has not been shared. \u201cWe have only communicated with our shareholders and signatories of our petition.\u201d Labor member David Craig, a retiree with a self-managed super fund, told Guardian Australia he made a submission in support of Labor\u2019s policy on the stoptheretirementtax website. At that time the website required submitters to tick to sign a petition, which is run by Wilson Asset Management, and agree to future campaign communications. Craig was then contacted by Wilson Asset Management with campaign information, including future hearing dates for the committee. \u201cI thought I was sending a submission to a parliamentary inquiry,\u201d he said. \u201cI was infuriated I had to tick that I was against the policy to make a submission. I knew it was a partisan, biased inquiry but I still wanted to make my voice heard.\u201d Tim Wilson said stoptheretirementtax was clearly a \u201ccampaign site\u201d and there \u201cis no subtlety\u201d. \u201cIf people choose to submit their details for petitions and campaigning that is their choice.\u201d Submissions to the committee can also be made on the official parliament website. On Friday the committee held further hearings in the Sydney suburbs of Chatswood and Bondi Junction. The morning meeting in Chatswood was interrupted by a protester who labelled the inquiry a \u201csham\u201d, as tempers flared among retirees who say they will be financially disadvantaged by the Labor policy and citizens who object to the handling of the inquiry. Senior Liberals, including the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have backed Wilson. On Friday Frydenberg told Radio National Wilson had \u201cadhered to the rules [and] adhered to his disclosure requirements\u201d by noting he owned shares in funds managed by Wilson Asset Management on his pecuniary interest register. \u201cThe only thing he\u2019s done wrong is got up the nose of [shadow treasurer] Chris Bowen because \u2026 this policy announcement by the Labor party is causing an enormous amount of disquiet,\u201d he said. The Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman accused Labor of trying to \u201cattack the chair, attack the committee process to distract attention from the very real anger and concerns\u201d of retirees. On Thursday Guardian Australia revealed that while Geoff Wilson has campaigned against the franking credit policy by claiming the reform will devastate retirees\u2019 livelihoods, he has also told his own investors that Labor\u2019s revenue claims were \u201cludicrous\u201d because investors could simply restructure their affairs.",

In strained talks on Thursday, Donald Tusk suggested Theresa May should consider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/07/what-corbyns-terms-back-may-brexit-labour-eu\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s permanent customs union plan.</a> May\u2019s meeting with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was described as \u201crobust\u201d after he rebuffed her demand to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.</p> \n<p>It is understood EU officials are looking at offering May a potential plan for a technological solution to the Irish border. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the parliament was willing \u201cto make this political declaration more binding, more precise.

But officials believe it is increasingly likely that any deal for Brexit itself will come so late in March that article 50 will have to be extended. May said she continued to insist on \u201clegally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop\u201d. The PM and Juncker agreed to hold more face-to-face talks by the end of February. Meanwhile May will be in Dublin today trying to swing the Irish PM towards her way of thinking.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Sala\u2019s tragic fate confirmed \u2013 </strong>The body recovered from a light plane that crashed in the Channel has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/07/police-confirm-emiliano-sala-body-pulled-from-plane-wreckage\">formally identified by the Dorset coroner as that of the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala</a>, police have said.

Kai Hensel from Cambridge University said researchers had wanted to test the saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/08/beer-before-wine-not-fine-scientists-find-after-vomit-filled-tests\">\u201cbeer before wine and you\u2019ll feel fine; wine before beer and you\u2019ll feel queer\u201d</a>. One group drank about two-and-a-half pints of lager followed by four large glasses of white wine. The second group had the same but in reverse order. A third had only beer or wine up to the same breath alcohol concentration of 0.11. They then rated their hangovers. A week later they did it all again, but took the drinks in reverse order. The results showed that \u201changover intensity\u201d was the same. Hensel concluded: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the same whatever order you drink these beverages in.\u201d But wait on a minute, the study only compared beer with white wine, and did not include red wine, spirits or dark beers.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Brexit brinkmanship Good morning, I\u2019m Warren Murray with the news resized to fit your screen. There are 50 days remaining until Brexit and things appear to be going to the brink, with any EU offer on the Irish backstop predicted to be put to MPs only towards the end of March. In strained talks on Thursday, Donald Tusk suggested Theresa May should consider Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s permanent customs union plan. May\u2019s meeting with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was described as \u201crobust\u201d after he rebuffed her demand to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. It is understood EU officials are looking at offering May a potential plan for a technological solution to the Irish border. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the parliament was willing \u201cto make this political declaration more binding, more precise. Also on the issue of the backstop explaining and saying very clearly that this is an insurance and not more than that.\u201d A joint statement from Downing Street and the European commission committed them to speeding up the post-Brexit finalisation of the \u201cfuture relationship\u201d between the EU and Britain, to make triggering the backstop less likely. But officials believe it is increasingly likely that any deal for Brexit itself will come so late in March that article 50 will have to be extended. May said she continued to insist on \u201clegally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop\u201d. The PM and Juncker agreed to hold more face-to-face talks by the end of February. Meanwhile May will be in Dublin today trying to swing the Irish PM towards her way of thinking. * * * Sala\u2019s tragic fate confirmed \u2013 The body recovered from a light plane that crashed in the Channel has been formally identified by the Dorset coroner as that of the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala, police have said. The aircraft crashed on 21 January en route from Nantes to Cardiff. \u201cThe families of Mr Sala and the pilot David Ibbotson have been updated with this news and will continue to be supported by specially trained family liaison officers,\u201d Dorset police said. The Air Accident Investigation Branch said the effort to raise the plane had proven unsuccessful \u2013 \u201cthe weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close\u201d. Sala had been signed by Cardiff City from the French Ligue 1 club FC Nantes and was flying to south Wales from the French city where he had been saying goodbye to friends and teammates. * * * \u2018No thank you, Mr Pecker\u2019 \u2013 Jeff Bezos has accused David Pecker, the Trump ally behind the National Enquirer, of \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d after its lawyers threatened to publish text messages and intimate photos \u2013 colloquially, \u201cdick pics\u201d \u2013 involving the Amazon CEO. After the tabloid previously printed some of his personal messages, Bezos brought in a private investigator to find out how it got them. In a blogpost, Bezos published in full Pecker\u2019s lawyers\u2019 emails which demand Bezos cease his pursuit of AMI. Bezos wrote that any personal embarrassment \u201ctakes a back seat\u201d, saying: \u201cIf in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u201d Pecker (straight faces everyone) and his AMI publishing company have been caught up in the investigations into Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Bezos. The Amazon founder owns the Washington Post, which Trump hates. * * * French fury over Di Maio meddling \u2013 France has recalled its ambassador from Italy in the worst crisis between the two neighbouring countries since the second world war. The French government was enraged after Italy\u2019s co-deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio of the populist Five Star Movement, met members of France\u2019s gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protest movement and cheered them as part of a \u201cwind of change\u201d in the coming European elections. The French foreign office said: \u201cHaving disagreements is one thing but manipulating the relationship for electoral aims is another.\u201d Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Italy\u2019s far-right populist coalition government have clashed heavily over a range of issues, chiefly the movement of migrants from Africa. * * * Bid to topple Isis \u2018caliph\u2019 \u2013 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Isis, is believed to have been the target of a coup attempt launched by foreign fighters in his eastern Syrian hideout. Intelligence agencies think it happened on 10 January in a village near Hajin in the Euphrates River valley. Iraqi officials and their counterparts in Britain and the US are confident that Baghdadi has recently spent time in the location, where the group\u2019s diehard members have regrouped after two years of battlefield losses. * * * Thai princess to run for PM \u2013 The sister of Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been unveiled as a prime ministerial candidate in next month\u2019s elections. The Thai Raksa Chart party confirmed Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi has joined the race, a move one expert said had created a \u201cpolitical earthquake\u201d. Thai Raksa Chart was founded as an alternative to the Peu Chart party formerly led by Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006. Ubolratana has openly maintained close ties with Thaksin. She will face coup leader and head of the ruling military junta Prayut Chan-o-cha, who said on Friday he would run to \u201cmaintain peace and order\u201d. * * * You won\u2019t feel fine \u2013 Too much beer and wine in any order will do you in, according to scientists who recruited 90 people for drinking sessions followed by bleary sleep, hangovers and a statistically significant amount of vomiting. Kai Hensel from Cambridge University said researchers had wanted to test the saying \u201cbeer before wine and you\u2019ll feel fine; wine before beer and you\u2019ll feel queer\u201d. One group drank about two-and-a-half pints of lager followed by four large glasses of white wine. The second group had the same but in reverse order. A third had only beer or wine up to the same breath alcohol concentration of 0.11. They then rated their hangovers. A week later they did it all again, but took the drinks in reverse order. The results showed that \u201changover intensity\u201d was the same. Hensel concluded: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the same whatever order you drink these beverages in.\u201d But wait on a minute, the study only compared beer with white wine, and did not include red wine, spirits or dark beers. Ah, there you go then \u2026 Today in Focus podcast: Is EU ready for no-deal Brexit? Unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks, Britain will crash out of the European Union without a deal. There have been stark warnings about the effects for the UK, but how badly would it hurt the EU? The Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin, Angelique Chrisafis and Kate Connolly dig into the detail. Plus Amelia Gentleman on the resumption of deportation flights to Jamaica after the Windrush scandal. Lunchtime read: They should never have put Stonehenge next to the A303 Nobody knows for sure why, or by whom, the vast arrangement of boulders known as Stonehenge was erected on Wiltshire\u2019s downlands. Today it is at the centre of an agonisingly long planning dispute, claims of government incompetence, deeply entrenched opposing sides and a preoccupation with traffic and tourism. The A303 may offer wonderful views of the monoliths, but is just as famous for its dire traffic jams \u2013 a torture to holidaymakers making for Devon and Cornwall, a drag on the region\u2019s economy, and a bane to locals. The proposal is to widen and sink the road into a tunnel running for almost two miles \u2013 but to some archaeologists\u2019 horror, it means boring through an ancient landscape unique in the world. Later this year, experts will examine the evidence for and against the scheme before making their recommendation to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, on whether it should go ahead. Sport The biggest shutdown since foot and mouth has hit racing with all meetings cancelled until at least Wednesday while the sport\u2019s governing body awaits test results from more than 100 stables. Ben Stokes is in doubt for the third Test against the West Indies with a bruised right heel that may have been caused by running on the beach. Manu Tuilagi is back in the Six Nations fold and relishing the chance to occupy a more senior role in Eddie Jones\u2019s squad. Great Britain set up a winner-takes-all Fed Cup clash with Hungary on Friday, but their victory against Greece was dogged by controversial line calls. What started out as a \u201ccrazy ambition\u201d ended in a world record as the British runner Susannah Gill completed seven marathons across seven continents in seven days. Bernardo Silva has said Manchester City feared they had blown their defence of the Premier League title with last week\u2019s defeat at Newcastle only to receive \u201ca big boost\u201d psychologically from Liverpool. Mark Allen faces a fine from World Snooker after conceding a match-winning frame with 11 reds still left on a \u201cdisgusting\u201d table at the World Grand Prix. Business Asian markets have tumbled after Donald Trump said he doesn\u2019t plan to meet President Xi Jinping of China before a tariffs truce ends in March.

      "bodyText": "A huge bushfire that has been raging in the parched New Zealand countryside for four days has forced hundreds of residents to be evacuated from their homes and prompted fears that climate change has caused the nation to become \u201cmore flammable\u201d. Firefighters have been working for most of the week to put out fires covering more than 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) around Nelson on the northern tip of the South Island of New Zealand. On Friday an estimated 700 people were evacuated from the town of Wakefield as fire chiefs warned that a northerly wind could force the original blaze, which began on Tuesday, back toward residential areas. Others in the town of 3,000 have been warned to prepare to evacuate or to leave themselves. Those forced to leave their homes were asked to report to a nearby stadium if they needed emergency accommodation and instructed by local authorities to take water, food, medicines, pets and valuables with them. Other, smaller fires were also flaring up in the region, including in the city of Nelson, which is home to about 50,000 people. Local firefighting services have deployed helicopters and trucks to fight the fire. By Friday one home had been lost, but so far no deaths had been reported. The fire was most likely to have been caused by a spark from agricultural machinery, according to authorities. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern visited Nelson on Thursday to meet with fire and civil defence teams. She called the fire \u201cpretty devastating\u201d and praised firefighters and volunteers for their work, as well as pledging additional funding toward the mayoral relief fund. Bushfires are relatively uncommon in New Zealand, but this is the second significant blaze in two years and follows a heatwave that pushing temperatures in some parts of the country to 30C. In February 2017, fires in Christchurch burned more than 2,000 hectares of land, destroying nine houses and leading to the death of one person, when a helicopter that was fighting the fires crashed, killing the pilot. George Perry, professor of environmental science at the University of Auckland, said on average 4,000 hectares of land is burned in the country each year, with the average fire size being less than four hectares. \u201cIf you look at the average over the last 30 years [these fires] are very large,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as big say as the fires that are going on in Tasmania at the moment, [which are] an order of magnitude larger but for New Zealand, they are very significant, especially because the vegetation here has not really adapted to fire at all.\u201d As Australia sweltered through its hottest month on record in January, more than 50 fires in the southernmost state of Tasmania have destroyed 173,000 hectares of land. The Nelson area fires in New Zealand have been so severe due to a combination of the land use in the area \u2013 a mixture of small holdings, large plantations of pine trees which are highly flammable and scrub \u2013 coupled with the heatwave, said Perry. Richard Kirby, the group recovery manager for Civil Defence, said it might be four of five days before the fire is contained due to the hot, dry conditions. \u201cThere\u2019s no rain on horizon and it\u2019s very dry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe realism is coming through that perhaps the worst can happen: that the rivers go dry and we can\u2019t irrigate, and have severe restrictions on urban water use.\u201d There are concerns that large fires such as this will become more frequent, as New Zealand\u2019s climate become drier and more drought-prone due to climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s a high risk that what we end up with is a more flammable landscape that is more vulnerable to fire,\u201d said Perry, who said New Zealanders would need to adapt in order to protect themselves and their properties from future blazes. \u201cI would say most people in New Zealand are not prepared at all [for fire],\u201d said Perry. \u201cPeople are very prepared for earthquakes and tsunamis and volcanic activity, but I don\u2019t think most people would have thought about fire as a threat.

The Australian National University study found atmospheric metal contaminates from historic mining activities in Queenstown and Rosebery in Tasmania had \u201ccontaminated most of the Wilderness World Heritage Area\u201d. The six lakes studied \u2013 including the heritage-protected Dove Lake at Cradle Mountain, Perched Lake, Lake Dobson and Lake Cygnus \u2013 were contaminated with lead, copper, arsenic and cadmium. But the readings for Owen Tarn and Basin Lake \u2013 which are on the border of the protected area and closest to the Queenstown mine \u2013 were much worse.

Sometimes, it\u2019s because you feel the producer(s) responsible didn\u2019t do the subject justice. At other times \u2013 and this is quite possibly the worst kind of frustration \u2013 it\u2019s because you\u2019re left with the feeling of: \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, with <a href=\"https://www.thedream.fm/\">The Dream</a>, it\u2019s very much the latter.

Picks of the week Homo Sapiens Will Young and Chris Sweeney\u2019s podcast is back for a third series, with the charismatic hosts having what sounds like the world\u2019s best road trip across the US to meet guests including Sam Smith and Troye Sivan. The interviews are a masterclass in easy rapport, but some of the best nuggets come out in the preliminary ramble. One minute Young is chewing a toffee, the next he\u2019s giving a very thoughtful explanation of why he had to call out The Grand Tour for its retro homophobia. HV Public Official A Not to be confused with Individual 1, the code name for a certain Oval Office inhabitant currently being investigated by the FBI, the Public Official A here refers to former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was caught on a wiretap offering to sell on the senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. Currently serving a 14-year prison sentence for his crimes, Blagojevich is now seeking a pardon from Donald Trump himself. This podcast from This American Life producer WBEZ recalls the whole grubby tale in vivid detail. Gwilym Mumford Guardian pick: Science Weekly There are some things in life that, thankfully, are rooted to the same spot. Things like, say, the north pole. As it turns out, though, it might be more movable than one would like think \u2013 at least with regards to Earth\u2019s magnetic north. In this week\u2019s episode of Science Weekly, Ian Sample delves into navigational history and looks at the origins of our cardinal directions \u2013 north, south, east and west. And with the recent announcement that our magnetic north is on the move, the episode also explores what has led to this movement and how the latest walkabout might affect us direction-dependent humans. Producer pick: The Dream \u2013 Wanna Swim in Cash? Chosen by Max Sanderson (lead producer, Audio) As a producer, listening to podcasts can be difficult. After a day of wearing headphones, editing and sound designing, often the last thing you want to do is, well, listen. But there are other reasons that it can be a frustrating endeavour. Sometimes, it\u2019s because you feel the producer(s) responsible didn\u2019t do the subject justice. At other times \u2013 and this is quite possibly the worst kind of frustration \u2013 it\u2019s because you\u2019re left with the feeling of: \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Thankfully, with The Dream, it\u2019s very much the latter. Brought to us by the good people at Stitcher, the series invites us into the world of pyramid schemes and multi-level marketing with its opening episode, Wanna Swim in Cash?. Produced and presented by the Peabody-winning Jane Marie (formerly of This American Life), the series plays with the usual investigative-doc format as Marie injects elements of her own life \u2013 including a trip home to Michigan and some difficult conversations with family members. The result is a very gripping and a very human take on something that, due to the damage it can cause, we should all know much more about.",

      "bodyText": "20. As You Like It (1992) Despite its hey-nonny-nonny reputation, Shakespeare\u2019s pastoral comedy, written during a time of immense social upheaval, has sharp edges. Or at least it does in this modern-dress version by director Christine Edzard, which makes it into a thinly veiled commentary on the inequalities of post-Thatcherite Britain. Arden becomes a cardboard city in London\u2019s Docklands, while the \u201ccourt\u201d from which Rosalind (Emma Croft) and co are expelled is a glitzy bank. Heavy-handed but thought-provoking. 19. Julius Caesar (1953) It may be a little too plush and self-satisfied, but Joseph L Mankiewicz\u2019s golden-age Hollywood version of the tragedy some Americans regard as their own has stood the test of time. Perhaps its most impressive aspect is the cast: John Gielgud, James Mason, Deborah Kerr, Louis Calhern. Marlon Brando\u2019s blazing turn as Antony (\u201cLend me your ears\u201d) is so riveting that you almost forget Roland Barthes wrote an entire essay mocking the wigs. 18. Twelfth Night (1996) The surprise success of Branagh\u2019s Much Ado (see below) set off a minor Shakespearean gold rush during the mid-1990s. One movie that has dated better than most is Trevor Nunn\u2019s Victorian country-house Twelfth Night, which captures the shadowy magic of the play well. Nunn may be a journeyman film-maker, but he\u2019s a superlative director of actors: Imogen Stubbs and Helena Bonham-Carter have genuine chemistry as Viola and Olivia, and Nigel Hawthorne harrumphs well as Malvolio. 17. Angoor (1982) Barely known outside India, Gulzar\u2019s classic Hindi-language version of The Comedy of Errors is not merely the only feature movie adaptation of the play ever made \u2013 it\u2019s a genuinely insightful one. Shakespeare\u2019s good-natured romp about two sets of identical twins who are continually mistaken for each other is a great fit for broad-brush Bollywood comedy. Via some camera trickery, Sanjeev Kumar puts in a lugubrious, long-suffering performance as two of them. 16. Titus (1999) Julie Taymor\u2019s version of this gore-filled early tragedy \u2013 hand-lopping, people being baked in a pie, plus the rest \u2013 is both stylised and stylish, somewhere between Mad Max and The Craft. Anthony Hopkins\u2019s embattled old soldier, Titus, and Alan Cumming\u2019s high-camp Saturninus both command attention, but Taymor deserves full credit for making the experience both horrible and appallingly funny. 15. Othello (1989) Not technically a movie, rather a TV recording of a stage production. But what a production: Janet Suzman\u2019s version of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy of race, staged at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg during the apartheid era, caused a sensation, and with good cause. John Kani is youthful and surprisingly timorous in the lead, fatally outmanoeuvred by Richard Haines\u2019s bullying Afrikaner Iago. Many productions strive to make the play \u201crelevant\u201d; this one hardly needed to, and is all the more potent for it. 14. The Bad Sleep Well (1960) Freer even than his avant-garde adaptation of Macbeth \u2013 see below \u2013 Akira Kurosawa\u2019s riff on Hamlet brilliantly relocates Denmark to mid-century Tokyo and makes the angst-ridden prince into a downtrodden salaryman (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) frantic to find out who killed his father. A scathing excoriation of post-war Japanese corruption and a masterly demonstration of noir. 13. A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (1935) Soon after fleeing the Nazis and arriving in the US, theatre director Max Reinhardt started work on a movie of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. It\u2019s an odd collision of styles \u2013 German high romanticism meets Hollywood glitz \u2013 but Hal Mohr\u2019s cinematography is astonishing, a surreal visual fantasy of dancing sprites and flying unicorns. Legend has it that the set used up some 600,000 yards of cellophane and 67 tonnes of trees. 12. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) Kenneth Branagh\u2019s devotion to putting Shakespeare on the silver screen has produced some so-so efforts (Hamlet, Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost) as well as some genuine turnips (an inexplicably Japanese As You Like It). His earliest attempt at comedy is in some ways the best, full of sunny high spirits and still terrific fun to watch. The Tuscan setting is glorious, and Emma Thompson\u2019s thoughtful Beatrice is more than a match for Branagh\u2019s fusspot Benedick. 11. King Lear (1971) The second of two masterly Shakespeare movies, Grigori Kozintsev\u2019s Russian Lear was shot almost concurrently with Peter Brook\u2019s version (see below). The two couldn\u2019t be more different: where Brook\u2019s is all harrowing domestic torment, Kozintsev goes for the wide angle, depicting how the insanity of one man (a wild-haired, shellshocked J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet) brings an entire nation to the brink. The opening panorama \u2013 a painfully slow tracking shot of peasants trudging towards Lear\u2019s castle \u2013 is one of the great set pieces of Shakespearean cinema. 10. Romeo + Juliet (1996) Baz Luhrmann\u2019s high-octane version of Romeo and Juliet is still an object lesson for film-makers attempting to do Shakespeare with style. Setting the action in \u201cVerona Beach\u201d \u2013 a futuristic cross between Miami and Mexico City, imaginatively designed by Catherine Martin \u2013 Luhrmann captures the play\u2019s gangland violence as well as its raw sex appeal. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes wouldn\u2019t make it through an RSC audition, but that\u2019s very much the point. 9. Hamlet (1921) Taking her cue from an esoteric academic essay arguing that Hamlet was in fact a woman, the Danish star Asta Nielsen formed her own production company to get this silent version made. It\u2019s a stunning piece, full of creeping expressionist shadow and centred in every way on Nielsen\u2019s Prince \u2013 whip-smart, alluringly androgynous and more than a little loopy. His/her eye-rolling at Polonius deserves its own Tumblr account.8. The Tempest (1979) Shakespeare\u2019s mystical late play has inspired several directors to live out wild cinematic fantasies, the wildest of which might be Fred MWilcox\u2019s brilliantly strange sci-fi reboot, Forbidden Planet (1956). Derek Jarman\u2019s rendering is perhaps a touch too art-school for its own good, but contains many beautiful things, among them a gruff Prospero from Heathcote Williams and a roistering turn by the performance artist Jack Birkett as Caliban. The deliciously camp finale features the jazz diva Elisabeth Welch warbling Stormy Weather to a chorus of sailors. Even Shakespeare might applauded that. 7. Richard III (1955) An Olivier that has aged well. At first glance, this mid-1950s version of the early historical thriller looks every one of its 60-plus years, down to the over-saturated Technicolor and hey-nonny-nonny musical score by William Walton. What makes it gloriously watchable, now as then, is Olivier\u2019s effortlessly virtuosic performance as Richard: imperious, ironic, brutish, sometimes hysterical and never less than smirkingly seductive. 6. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) It isn\u2019t quite as clever as Amy Heckerling\u2019s take on Jane Austen in Clueless, but Gil Junger\u2019s attempt to pull a similar trick with Shakespeare \u2013 what would happen if you made a boring old set text into a high-school romcom? \u2013 is smart and sassy. A brightly contemporary retelling of The Taming of the Shrew, it features Julia Stiles as a scowling tomboy refusing to play the dating game and a shaggy Heath Ledger trying to charm her into doing just that. The sexual politics are queasy, but somehow Junger makes you smile. 5. King Lear (1971) When Peter Brook\u2019s production of Lear opened at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, with a tormented Paul Scofield as the mad king, it was acclaimed for its Beckettian sense of despair. The version they put on screen nine years later is even bleaker. Guttural and rasping, with a face resembling a tree scorched by lightning, Scofield bristles with anger, but is in the end desperately lonely. The supporting cast (including Cyril Cusack and Patrick Magee) is superb, and the setting \u2013 it was mostly shot in the barren reaches of rural Denmark \u2013 looks like warmth has never touched it. 4. Maqbool (2003) Indian cinema has a long history of imaginative Shakespeare adaptations, and this is one of the finest. A modern-day Macbeth relocated to the murky Mumbai crimeworld by director Vishal Bhardwaj, it\u2019s like watching the Scottish play through a Francis Ford Coppola filter and city smog. The pouch-eyed Irrfan Khan is nicely shady as the hero, but the show is nearly stolen by a fire-breathing Lady Macbeth from Bollywood legend Tabu. Great tunes, too. 3. Chimes at Midnight (1966) Orson Welles\u2019s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare was best realised in his monumental version of the Henry IV plays. Centre-stage, naturally, is Welles\u2019s own Falstaff, far more ruthless than you would guess from his Christmas pudding-like appearance. Yet there are a feast of other fine performances: a conniving Keith Baxter as the rapscallion Prince Hal, a glacially unimpressed John Gielgud as King Henry IV, and Jeanne Moreau on ardent, impassioned form as Falstaff\u2019s sweetheart. 2. Hamlet (1964) Forget your Oliviers and your Branaghs: the greatest cinematic Dane was Russian. As well as being the prince of Soviet actors, Innokenti Smoktunovsky was a Red Army hero who spent time in Stalin\u2019s gulag, and his boyish, bewildered Hamlet knows only too well what it\u2019s like to be crushed by the machine. Manoeuvring the camera around a warren of suffocating spaces, director Grigori Kozintsev makes the tragedy into a parable of power and powerlessness. 1. Throne of Blood (1957) Little remains of Shakespeare\u2019s script, but in Akira Kurosawa\u2019s masterly interpretation of Macbeth the poetry is all visual: brooding castle gates, misty battlefields, empty rooms where only the worst will happen. Reimagining the story as a samurai epic, Kurosawa pares the tragedy down to its essentials and turns it into a thrilling cinematic experience \u2013both utterly different from the play and wholly in its spirit. In the lead, Toshir\u00f4 Mifune roars and bellows like a wild beast, and as his wife Isuzu Yamada journeys from venomous malevolence to terrified insanity.",

      "body": "<p>Stonehenge, with the possible exception of Big Ben, is Britain\u2019s most recognisable monument. As a symbol of the nation\u2019s antiquity, it is our Parthenon, our pyramids \u2013 although, admittedly, less impressive. Neil MacGregor, the former director of the British Museum, recalls that when he took a group of Egyptian archaeologists to see it, they were baffled by our national devotion to the stones, which, compared to the refined surfaces of the pyramids, seemed to them like something hastily thrown up over a weekend.</p> <p>Unlike those other monuments, though, Stonehenge is more or less a complete mystery. Nobody knows for sure why, or by whom, this vast arrangement of boulders was erected on Wiltshire\u2019s downlands, in the south of England, about 5,000 years ago. Into this void have rushed myriad theories, from the academically sober to the blatantly fantastic. Over the centuries, its construction has been confidently credited to giants, wizards, Phoenicians, Mycenaeans, Romans, Saxons, Danes and aliens. (According to one medieval theory, Merlin had it transported from Ireland to serve as the funeral monument for Britons slaughtered by Hengist, the treacherous Saxon.)</p> <p>Since Stonehenge slipped into the written record in the medieval era, it has been a place to project our ideas of ourselves. It was said, by the 20th-century archaeologist and writer Jacquetta Hawkes, that \u201cevery age has the Stonehenge it deserves\u201d.</p> <p>And so today\u2019s Stonehenge is not William Blake\u2019s terrifying \u201cbuilding of eternal death\u201d; nor is it Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cmonstrous place\u201d, where Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles sleeps her last night before being taken to be hanged. Nor is it even the Stonehenge of the counterculture, where peace-freaks revelled until they were brutally routed in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/15/battle-of-the-beanfield-stonehenge-1985-rose-brash-photograph\" title=\"\">the Battle of the Beanfield</a>\u201d in 1985, one of the most notorious episodes in the history of British policing.</p> <p>Our Stonehenge has none of this grandeur or pathos. Instead, it is at the centre of a peculiarly modern British circus \u2013 one that involves an agonisingly long planning dispute, allegations of government incompetence, two deeply entrenched opposing sides, and a preoccupation with traffic and tourism. This absurdist drama, entirely worthy of our times, is a long and bitter battle over whether to sink the highway that runs beside it into a tunnel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/feb/25/the-battle-for-the-future-of-stonehenge-podcast\">The battle for the future of Stonehenge \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The A303, the road in question, is celebrated for the wonderful views it offers of the Stonehenge monoliths. But as one of the two major routes connecting the domesticated landscapes of the south-east of England with the wilder West Country, it is just as famous for its dire traffic jams, which begin as the highway narrows to a single lane near Stonehenge.</p> <p>What could be a 10-minute ride through the 6,500-acre Unesco world heritage site in which Stonehenge sits is at peak times an hour-long, bad-tempered grind \u2013 a torture to holidaymakers making for Devon and Cornwall, a drag on the economy of the south-west of England and a bane to locals. According to David Bullock, who works for the national road-building agency, Highways England: \u201cOn Fridays, for a person living in Amesbury, it is quite a torrid affair, if you want to go anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>But this gridlock is not easily resolved. Diverting the road is hard to do: north of the current route lies Britain\u2019s biggest Ministry of Defence training area, south of it pristine countryside. Simply widening it is unthinkable: the Stonehenge heritage site is a precious prehistoric landscape. Governments have been trying, and failing, to solve the problem of the A303 since the 1980s: numerous plans have been suggested and then dropped, at the cost of untold millions. A dizzying number of bodies have been involved, representing every possible interest-group and opinion, from roadbuilders, heritage organisations, government departments and councils to the Campaign for the Preservation of the Lower Till Valley, the Stonehenge Traffic Action Group, the British Horse Society and the organisation that protects Europe\u2019s heaviest flying birds, the Great Bustard Group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/stonehenge_road_proposals/giv-3902qpygu0X2X4Ub/\" data-alt=\"Map of Stonehenge tunnel/bypass proposal\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/stonehenge_road_proposals/giv-3902qpygu0X2X4Ub/\">Map of Stonehenge tunnel/bypass proposal</a> </figure>  <p>The current proposal, to widen and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB6PDa-DuWc\" title=\"\">sink the road into a tunnel</a> running for almost two miles, mostly about 600 metres south of the stones, was announced in 2014, although the basic idea goes right back to the 1990s. The main difficulty is the cost: the government has allocated \u00a31.7bn, which is not enough for a passage sufficiently long to avoid the world heritage site. That means tunnel portals would be bored, and dual carriageways built, through an ancient landscape unique in the world. This protected area is home to traces of a mesolithic settlement long predating Stonehenge, the ancient \u201cAvenue\u201d linking the monument and the river Avon, and hundreds of bronze-age burial mounds, or barrows.</p> <p>But the long planning process is entering its endgame. Later this year, a panel of inspectors will meet in Wiltshire and, over a period of six months, examine the evidence for and against the scheme. They will have three months to make their recommendation to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. He will have a further three months to decide whether or not to accept it. Construction could start in 2021.</p> <p>Tempting as it is to suggest that the dispute pits the forces of modernity against the defenders of tradition, the argument boils down to whether you think a major construction project in a world heritage site is absolute madness, or the commonsense solution to a long-term traffic problem. English Heritage, the national body that cares for Stonehenge, insists that doing nothing is not an option. It argues that the A303 will only get busier as new homes are built in the south-west \u2013 and that the tunnel, in any case, would significantly improve the \u201cvisitor experience\u201d by returning the circle to its intended setting, without the intrusion of the sights and sounds of the A303. They also say that the plans have been carefully drawn up to avoid damage to prehistoric features, and that they are still working hard with Highways England to minimise their impact.</p> <p>Battling English Heritage\u2019s smooth assurances, however, is the Stonehenge Alliance \u2013 a coalition of NGOs, including Friends of the Earth and the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Supported by an eclectic band of well-wishers, including archaeologists, historians, farmers and druids, they think it is ridiculous to remove the sight of the stones from passing motorists. More seriously, they argue that the tunnel would \u201cscar the Stonehenge landscape for ever\u201d. Prof Mike Parker Pearson, the archaeologist who has done the most influential recent work on the monument, has entered the fray on the side of the Stonghenge Alliance. He calls the scheme \u201can unattractive British compromise: a bit of a tunnel, but one that is not long enough to protect the archaeology of the world heritage site\u201d. In his view, the plan would amount to the biggest intervention in the landscape for 5,000 years \u2013 and all for a construction project that might have a lifetime of a century.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Stonehenge is both smaller and larger than you expect. From the middle distance it can seem surprisingly tiny, like seeing a celebrity in real life. Most tourists don\u2019t ever get right up to the stones, since they are cordoned off. But if you are lucky enough to get among them (by booking special access, or by attending ceremonies held at the solstices and equinoxes) the monoliths loom massively, and seem full of threatening, or beguiling, character: dour and grey on a dull day, but an almost apricot pink when lit by a summer\u2019s sunset.</p> <p>Touching them is forbidden, although this has not always been the case: their surfaces are scarred with graffiti both ancient and modern, from images of daggers gouged out in the Bronze Age to Christopher Wren\u2019s <a href=\"https://blog.histouries.co.uk/2010/11/10/was-sir-christopher-wren-a-mason-and-why-he-did-he-carve-his-name-on-stonehenge/\" title=\"\">neatly carved signature</a>. \u201cYou\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have known better,\u201d said English Heritage archaeologist Heather Sebire disapprovingly, when we walked among the stones one dusk. Sebire is pro-tunnel: \u201cEveryone knows the scheme\u2019s not perfect. But it is the best we\u2019re going to get at this point in time.\u201d</p> <p>There are some 1,300 stone circles in the UK, from the Ring of Brodgar in the Orkneys to the Merry Maidens in Cornwall, according to archaeologist Mike Pitts (pro-tunnel). But none of them is quite like Stonehenge. Two things make it unique, archaeologist Julian Richards (anti-tunnel) told me.</p> <p>First are its lintels \u2013 the horizontal stones atop the great upright boulders. This act of placing stone on stone is what makes it Britain\u2019s \u201cfirst essay \u2026 in architecture\u201d, as Samuel Johnson put it. (Its circular form inspired John Wood\u2019s mid-18th-century Circus in Bath, itself the model for Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus, meaning, according to historian Rosemary Hill, it is the probably the ultimate ancestor of the British roundabout.) The second thing is that Stonehenge is the only neolithic monument in the UK to use stones not found locally. Only the taller \u201csarsens\u201d are from Wiltshire. The smaller \u201cbluestones\u201d were quarried around 124 miles away in the Preseli Hills in Wales \u2013 an act of transportation that has long puzzled scholars.</p> <p>To celebrate the millennium, an ill-fated project, funded with \u00a3100,000 from the national lottery, attempted to re-enact the fetching of a single three-tonne dolerite bluestone from Wales to Wiltshire. The original plan was for volunteers, some 40 a day, to wear \u201c\u2018appropriate clothing\u2019 of skins and furs\u201d. But that had to be abandoned for safety reasons, according to Mike Pitts\u2019 book Hengeworld \u2013 and many of the volunteers drifted away, disenchanted by the awful task. After eventually loading the boulder on to a boat at Milford Haven, from where it was meant to travel up the Bristol channel, a frisky wind saw it tumble into the sea. At this point it was rescued, using the un-neolithic technology of a crane, and transported on a flatbed truck to the botanical gardens in Carmarthenshire, 140 miles from Stonehenge, where it remains. As a spokesman for Pembrokeshire council remarked at the time: \u201cStone-age man never had the health-and-safety people looking over his shoulder.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3debff623f639dd1c13b71797a1336987afe53a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3debff623f639dd1c13b71797a1336987afe53a1/0_225_5011_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Shearer as Spinal Tap bassist Derek Smalls with a miniature model of Stonehenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Shearer in character as Spinal Tap bassist Derek Smalls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Knighton/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even leaving aside the innate absurdity of a nation spending three decades deciding whether or not to build a tunnel beside it, Stonehenge often operates as a magnet for the ludicrous. In the 1984 mockumentary This is Spinal Tap, the fictional rock band commissions a reproduction of the monument as a stage set, but there is a confusion between feet and inches. As a result, a comically tiny arrangement descends on to the stage. (Harry Shearer, who played Spinal Tap bassist Derek Smalls before finding greater fame as the voice of Mr Burns in The Simpsons, is one of the many people whose anti-tunnel views can be found on the planning website, where he writes as a member of the \u201cadmittedly fictitious band\u201d.) The episode echoes the real events of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1983 US tour, for which a vastly oversize Stonehenge set was accidentally produced owing to a mix-up between metric and imperial.</p> <p>Indeed, Stonehenge\u2019s massy blocks seem irresistible to copyists: a website, <a href=\"https://clonehenge.com/\" title=\"\">Clonehenge</a>, charts replicas made of everything from cars and lava-lamps to vegetables and gingerbread. The most celebrated duplicate of recent times may be the artist Jeremy Deller\u2019s lifesize version in the form of a bouncy castle, which he memorably described a \u201ca way to get reacquainted with ancient Britain with your shoes off\u201d. (Deller is anti-tunnel. \u201cA nice idea, but it\u2019s clearly not long enough.\u201d)</p> <p>In its time Stonehenge has been interpreted as temple to the sun, Boudicca\u2019s tomb, Satan\u2019s court, an observatory, a computer, a phallic device for symbolically impregnating the sun, and, fairly recently, as a place of healing \u2013 \u201cthe neolithic A&amp;E unit for southern England\u201d, as the theory\u2019s proponent put it. (Perhaps it was inevitable that at some point Britain\u2019s favourite monument should be imagined as prefiguring its most treasured institution, the NHS.)</p> <p>Deller, who has followed his inflatable Stonehenge with a range of clothing including T-shirts adorned with mouths full of crooked megaliths and the caption \u201cEnglish teeth\u201d, regards Stonehenge as a mutable, open-ended symbol of Englishness \u2013 like Jerusalem, a hymn that can be sung with equal fervour at socialist rallies and rugby tournaments. \u201cStonehenge is fluid \u2013 in the way that national identity is fluid,\u201d he said. And, he argued, more necessary than ever. \u201cAs times become more uncertain, people look to the stones for a kind of truth,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople want the stones to speak.\u201d</p> <p>Stonehenge is a mirror \u2013 it reflects back your obsessions. In the 1960s, astronomer Gerald S Hawkins argued that Stonehenge was an astronomical \u201ccomputing machine\u201d capable of predicting eclipses \u2013 a theory that held sway for decades, although now many of the celestial alignments he discovered are thought to be coincidental. A gynaecologist, Anthony Perks, writing in 2003, thought it was a fertility symbol in the shape of a vulva. (His article was titled The Vagina Monoliths.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"feff12b6073bc4e27090a2c5c80e18c31668e27c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feff12b6073bc4e27090a2c5c80e18c31668e27c/0_309_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stonehenge, Wiltshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some 17th- and 18th-century scholars were convinced Stonehenge had been built by the druids, a sect of rather frightening Celtic priests mentioned in Roman texts. This theory proved so heady that it inspired the creation of an actual, modern religion: druids began performing ceremonies at the stones in 1905, and still do. Unfortunately for the modern druids, Stonehenge is now known to predate their imagined predecessors by several thousand years. (Even so, it would be a hard-hearted person who entirely dismissed the modern druids. You don\u2019t have to be a believer in ley lines to agree with them that the stones radiate a power beyond rational considerations.)</p> <p>In fact, scholars are now convinced that Stonehenge can finally \u2013 after centuries of debate \u2013 be fixed at about 5,000 years old, after organic material excavated at the base of the stones was radiocarbon-dated in the 1990s. It is not easy dating such monuments \u2013 a fact demonstrated by the recent revelation that an unusual bronze-age stone circle in Aberdeenshire was actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/21/ancient-scottish-stone-circle-was-built-in-1990s\" title=\"\">built 20 years ago</a> by a farmer.</p> <p>Currently, the dominant theory about the purpose of Stonehenge is that of Mike Parker Pearson, who excavated in the area for several years from 2003. He hypothesises that it was a first and foremost a place built to honour the dead \u2013 and that the community that built it lived nearby, at Durrington Walls. For him, the inclusion of the Welsh bluestones was a gesture symbolic of some kind of \u201cpolitical unification\u201d of disparate British peoples after a period of \u201cneolithic Brexit\u201d \u2013 a slow period of recession, some six centuries after the introduction of farming, when Britain\u2019s ties with the continent were cut off.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the early 1990s, Stonehenge was a mess. Tourists got to it via a grubby pedestrian passageway under the A344, the road nearest to the monument; the visitor centre and parking facilities were tatty; the annual solstice celebrations saw embarrassing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jun/21/3\" title=\"\">clashes</a> between travellers and law enforcement. When the Department for Transport first announced plans to improve the A303, it seemed \u2013 at least to the energetic new boss of English Heritage, Thatcher favourite Jocelyn Stevens \u2013 as if all of this could be tackled at once. But it wasn\u2019t so simple. It took two decades for the A344 to be closed and grassed over and a new visitor centre opened. The problem of the A303, however, has proved even more stubborn.</p> <p>The first proposal was a \u201ccut-and-cover\u201d tunnel (effectively, a trench with a lid), rejected after public consultation in 1993. The following year, English Heritage and the National Trust, which owns more than 2,000 acres of land around Stonehenge, announced that their preferred option was a deeper, bored tunnel of about two-and-a-half miles that would avoid disturbing the archaeology \u2013 but in 1998, the government declared this \u201cunaffordable and uneconomic\u201d. In 2002, the DoT unveiled plans for yet another tunnel, this time only 1.3 miles long \u2013 supported by English Heritage, but too short to satisfy the National Trust, which said it presented an \u201curgent, serious and imminent\u201d threat to the landscape. Finally, in 2007, the scheme, the development of which had already cost around \u00a320m, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/06/pollution.homeaffairs\" title=\"\">was dropped</a> on grounds of cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"769dd998f575c950f8b39924c2391baf1823cc92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/769dd998f575c950f8b39924c2391baf1823cc92/0_0_2464_1478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heavy traffic on the A303 road by stonehenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For the campaigners who had fought these projects for 15 years, it seemed like a victory. \u201cIn 2007, we thought we\u2019d cracked the road scheme, but obviously not,\u201d Kate Fielden told me over tea and cake in her pottery-filled cottage. A retired archaeologist and one of the leading lights of the tunnel resistance, Fielden first got wind of the revived tunnel scheme in 2013, when it was being eagerly promoted by MPs keen for a boost to the local economy. Her group, the Stonehenge Alliance, which had become something of a sleeper cell, snapped back into action, writing to ministers even before the new scheme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/01/stonehenge-tunnel-plan-divided-reaction-victory-disaster-world-heritage-site\" title=\"\">was announced</a> by David Cameron in December 2014. This time, the National Trust had been brought back on side by the promise that the mooted tunnel would be half a mile longer than in the previous scheme.</p> <p>Then Highways England got to work, drawing a spaghetti of lines on a map to delineate possible \u201croute corridors\u201d, as the parlance has it. David Bullock is the project manager for the Stonehenge section of the A303 upgrade. The scheme, he told me when we met in October, \u201cis in the hard-to-do bracket \u2026 not only have you the challenge of the world heritage site, to the north you have Salisbury Plain, the largest area of military exercise in the country. To the south, you have open very lush and ecologically rich areas, so it\u2019s a very difficult environment with which to weave a highway system.\u201d The Stonehenge section of the A303 was designed for 13,000-14,000 cars a day, \u201cbut you are squeezing through an average of about 25,000. And that can rise by about 30% at peak times.\u201d The A303, he said, is \u201ca problem, it has been a problem for 25 years, and it is spreading like a cancer across the local road network.\u201d</p> <p>After a public consultation in 2017, the 1.8-mile tunnel was named as the \u201cpreferred route\u201d by the DoT \u2013 to no one\u2019s surprise at all, given that it had been effectively announced in 2014. Objectors such as Mike Parker Pearson are infuriated by the decision not to simply reroute the road well to the south of the site \u2013 which Highways England argues could disturb untouched archaeology. \u201cI have never seen a statement that sets out why the archaeology around a southern route might be important, or what that is based on,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Highways England commissioned dozens of exploratory surveys looking at water tables and archaeology, at congestion and pollution, at the flight path of bats and the population of the marsh fritillary butterfly, a process that has so far cost \u00a340m. Some locals are aggrieved by the disruption caused by all this preliminary work \u2013 and feel ignored by the consultation process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcf05603ef77d1167d3d74f4ffdd8628d77c381c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcf05603ef77d1167d3d74f4ffdd8628d77c381c/0_697_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merlin, co-leader of the The Astronumerical Druid Order.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merlin, co-leader of the The Astronumerical Druid Order.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Deller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the major decisions are taken by people deemed to be in positions of authority \u2013 like the National Trust, English Heritage and Wiltshire county council. But I\u2019m just a farmer. I\u2019m expendable,\u201d Rachel Hosier told me in the kitchen of her farmhouse, a couple of miles south of the stones. Her land contains important ancient barrows and an RSPB reserve for the rare, eccentric-looking bird, the stone curlew. She told me there had been disturbances to livestock, work done at inappropriate times in the farming year, and material from investigations left on her land \u2013 she even holds up a zip-lock bag of flints left behind by one of the archaeological teams. (Highways England said that work was discussed in advance, damage to crops compensated for, and steps taken to prevent a reoccurrence of the mislaid flints episode. Public consultations did result in changes: to the location of the tunnel\u2019s western portal, the line of the road, and to a local bypass.)</p> <p>Icomos, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, which advises Unesco, reported in April 2018 that there would be \u201cirreversible damage\u201d if the scheme went ahead; Unesco\u2019s own world heritage committee has said that the project would \u201cimpact adversely on the integrity and the outstanding universal value\u201d of the area. The Stonehenge Alliance has submitted documents arguing that the scheme contravenes a blizzard of laws, directives and conventions, including the 2008 Planning Act, the World Heritage Convention, the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and the Birds Directive.</p> <p>Among the other opponents are a number of readers of the Telegraph, who took to the paper\u2019s letters page to protest that motorists would no longer glimpse the large field of pigs adjacent to the stones, on Hosier\u2019s land. (Typical letter: \u201cOn our visits to Shepton Mallet, my wife always looks forward to seeing the porkers enjoying their freedom, roaming the vast field \u2026 a wonderful advertisement for British farming.\u201d) The druid Merlin, co-leader of the The Astronumerical Druid Order, raised a similar objection: a tunnel would rob passing motorists of the view of the stones, one of the most famous sights in England.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One blustery, perishingly cold October day last year, English Heritage threw a celebration at Stonehenge marking the monument\u2019s centenary in public ownership. In a little marquee, where dignitaries huddled out of the wind, was a large Stonehenge-shaped cake, over a metre in diameter, which the archaeologist Julian Richards judged to be \u201cpretty accurate\u201d. Off near the visitors\u2019 centre was Deller\u2019s work Sacrilege \u2013 his inflatable Stonehenge \u2013 on which enthusiastic children and archaeologists bounced. A darkly weird piece for brass instruments, by composer Matt Rogers, was performed inside the stone circle, as tourists looked on in faint bewilderment.</p> <p>At one point a group of druids, their medieval-style robes flapping about to reveal 21st-century jeans and boots, passed around bread and mead \u2013 more like Church of England communicants than the human-sacrificing druid priests of Julius Caesar\u2019s imagination. As a line of Gore-Texed visitors patiently queued for a cuppa, it was hard to imagine anything more English. The tunnel scheme had been submitted to the planning inspectorate the previous week, and was being discussed in tones \u2013 depending on point of view \u2013 varying from horror to resignation to relief.</p> <p>The principle of preserving a \u201cnational heritage\u201d in perpetuity can seem as though it has been with us for ever \u2013 perhaps because bodies such as the National Trust seem like such timeless bastions of middle England. In fact, the idea is fairly recent \u2013 and Stonehenge itself played an important role in its invention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86ebbdee72ef8c3a6114b1ea4bd330030f054f71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86ebbdee72ef8c3a6114b1ea4bd330030f054f71/239_105_4957_2974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Deller on his bouncy castle replica of Stonehenge, called Sacrilege, in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Deller on his bouncy castle replica of Stonehenge, called Sacrilege, in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For centuries, the monument has been a tourist destination; by the mid-18th century the classic trip was to combine it with Salisbury Cathedral, 10 miles to the south. They were \u201ctwo eminent models of art and rudeness\u201d, Dr Johnson wrote, the cathedral exemplifying sophistication and Stonehenge, primitivism. (This is also the tourist programme that the Russians accused of poisoning Sergei and Yulia Skripal were planning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/russian-television-channel-rt-says-it-is-to-air-interview-with-skripal-salisbury-attack-suspects\" title=\"\">so they said</a>, before they were foiled by slush underfoot.)</p> <p>Victorian Stonehenge was a place of day-trippers, bicycle outings, Sunday school jollies, cricket matches and concerts. The craze for the new discipline of geology saw visitors chipping chunks out of the stones for their collections (a stall rented out chisels). It was this popularity and accessibility, partly brought about by the railway boom, that began to imperil Stonehenge \u2013 and simultaneously forge the idea that it ought to be preserved for future generations.</p> <p>For many decades, landowners had rejected the principle of a national patrimony that would threaten their property rights. But finally, the antiquarian and MP John Lubbock (the man who coined the terms \u201cpalaeolithic\u201d and \u201cneolithic\u201d) succeeded in pushing through the Ancient Monuments Protection Act of 1882. Stonehenge was one of first 26 English and Welsh monuments \u201cscheduled\u201d, or protected, under the act. At the time, the land was owned by a local grandee, Sir Edmund Antrobus, who put a fence around the site and began to charge for entrance; he also tried, unsuccessfully, to sell it to the nation for the inflated price of \u00a3125,000.</p> <p>As the first world war loomed, the army bought up tracts of Salisbury Plain to use for exercises; camps and hangars crept close to the stones. A military presence is still obvious to any visitor: Apaches and Chinooks can approach thunderously close. \u201cIs this normal?\u201d I recently heard a worried-looking overseas tourist asking a staff member, as curls of artillery smoke dissipated in the middle distance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6db7fbcffb389536d77d9ebf08415f0228159fd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6db7fbcffb389536d77d9ebf08415f0228159fd7/0_311_4001_2616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A druidic ceremony at Stonehenge circa 1923.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A druidic ceremony at Stonehenge circa 1923.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harlingue/Roger Viollet/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1915, Sir Edmund and his heir were dead, and the estate was put up for auction. A local man, Cecil Chubb, had come to the auction (according to local legend) looking for some dining room chairs; instead he bought Stonehenge for \u00a36,600. Three years later, he gave it to the nation. After the war, fears grew that the downs around Stonehenge would be built on, and in 1927 land nearby was bought by public subscription for the young National Trust, founded a dozen years earlier.</p> <p>Among those who rallied to the new cause of protecting rural England from the tentacles of development was a group of young women who formed a kind of 1930s Pussy Riot. Ferguson\u2019s Gang, as they called themselves, were masked, anonymous activists who went by codenames such as Bill Stickers, Granny the Throttler, Black Maria and Red Biddy. They raised money for the National Trust and handed it over in the form of elaborate stunts \u2013 concealing cash in a fake pineapple, or rolled up in a cigar, and gatecrashing grand events to present it.</p> <p>At their very first meeting, on 26 March 1932, Ferguson\u2019s Gang passed a resolution, later sworn as a solemn oath beneath the stones themselves, \u201cThat ENGLAND is STONEHENGE and not Whitehall\u201d. The sprawling capital, the machinations of politics, the grinding wheels of bureaucracy \u2013 none of that was important. For them, the soul of the nation lay in the ancient, slumbering magic of Stonehenge.</p> <p>In 2015, the Conservative government <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/english-heritage-has-changed/\" title=\"\">spun off English Heritage</a> \u2013 the descendent of the government body that cared for monuments after the 1882 act \u2013 into an independent charity, earning its own keep. Its ability to do this is strongly dependent on Stonehenge, which brings in 21% of its annual income of about \u00a3112m and which, with its 1.5 million visitors a year, attracts a million more than the next-most popular site, Dover Castle. Kate Mavor, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, told me she thought of Stonehenge as a publisher might a bestseller \u2013 a title that supports other, less lucrative, works. While entry is free for English Heritage and Trust members, it otherwise costs \u00a317.50 to buy a ticket to Stonehenge. More than half the visitors are from overseas. A vast coach park at the site decants tourists who will often also take in Bath and Windsor on a day trip from London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"274157bf4696d296d47614776d777ccc06d31d6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/274157bf4696d296d47614776d777ccc06d31d6d/0_336_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stonehenge in the snow, February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At the cafe, there is Stonehenge branded water, the bottle decorated with runes (a Germanic writing system irrelevant to the monument), and there is a brisk trade in rock cakes (get it?). <a href=\"https://www.english-heritageshop.org.uk/gift-ideas/stonehenge-gifts\" title=\"\">The shop</a> sells Stonehenge woollies, T-shirts, snowdomes, fridge magnets and jewellery. Visiting Stonehenge today does not offer much in the way of solitary communion with the eternal verities; this is heritage commodified within an inch of its life.</p> <p>But the narrative that Stonehenge has been ruined by mass tourism goes back a long way. Even Samuel Pepys complained of being ripped off by shepherds and innkeepers. Jacquetta Hawkes\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes\" title=\"\">A Land</a>, a classic work on British prehistory, was published in 1951, when visitors numbered only about 200,000 a year. \u201cCafes and chewing gum, car parks and conducted excursions, a sense of the hackneyed induced by post cards, calendars and cheap guide books has done more to damage Stonehenge than the plundering of some of its stones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMen made it and men destroyed it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Who owns Stonehenge? Who gets a say in its future? Who is listened to, and who is ignored, in the making of these decisions? These are the questions that crowd round the monument \u2013 questions that are not so different from those that surge around the future of the British Isles themselves. Stonehenge is often regarded as a symbol of comforting longevity; of the persistence of deep antiquity against the insistent tides of more recent history.</p> <p>But that is not quite true: permanence and certainty seem to bounce off its sandstone and dolerite surfaces. At the beginning of Rosemary Hill\u2019s book Stonehenge, published in 2008, the author describes in two sentences what she regards as the only unarguable facts about the monument, including the name of the county in which it sits, its latitude, its proximity to the A344 and its management by a government-funded agency. But even some of these are already out of date: the road is gone and English Heritage is now a charity. Even the physical appearance of the monument has altered relatively recently. In 1797, and again in 1900, two of the great sarsen stones collapsed; they were re-erected after the first world war, and at the same time, other vulnerable stones stabilised in concrete. Further restorations were carried out in the 1950s and 60s.</p> <p>Radiocarbon analysis conducted in the 1990s resulted in the monument becoming \u2013 more or less at a stroke \u2013 nearly 1,000 years older than previously thought. Stonehenge is not even, properly speaking, a henge. The term, coined by Thomas Kendrick of the British Museum in 1932, was adapted from the word Stonehenge (which probably derives from a Saxon word meaning \u201changing rock\u201d). But \u201chenge\u201d is supposed to describe circular monuments enclosed by a ditch inside a bank; Stonehenge\u2019s ditch and bank are actually the other way around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bcc61b1b505ba72fe3bcc484db2ffd26b57b8d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bcc61b1b505ba72fe3bcc484db2ffd26b57b8d0/0_61_2662_3327/800.jpg\" alt=\"Restoration of Stonehenge in 1958.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restoration work in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stonehenge, then, is not so much about solidity and eternity as confusion and internal contradiction. It is partly its quicksilver ungraspability as a sign that makes it so magnetic, so available to every generation. \u201cNot a week goes past without a news story about Stonehenge, some discovery, some controversy,\u201d said Jeremy Deller. It is this endless mutability of meaning that makes it, for him, \u201cthe most contemporary building in Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Many people lay claim to Stonehenge, from the charities who care for it, the archaeologists who study it, the druids who revere it, to artists like Deller who borrow its power to make meaning of their own. It resists ownership, but it is vulnerable, and not immune to human activity. Parker Pearson, whose research on the purpose and people of Stonehenge continues, talks of the world heritage site as a kind of island, on the fringes of which hover threats in the form of gradually encroaching development. In the north, there are 917 new homes for military families \u201cdebased\u201d from the last cold war-era German garrisons. At the east, there are the glinting sheds of the new, bathetically named Solstice Park, an out-of-town business estate complete with a Costa, a McDonald\u2019s and a Holiday Inn.</p> <p>The tunnel project that Chris Grayling, or his successor, will soon approve or reject, is an example of a British compromise that even its most ardent champions find difficult to praise to the skies. The whole point of a road scheme, Highways England\u2019s David Bullock told me, \u201cis to take all those not quite good enoughs to make a good enough project\u201d.</p> <p>Heather Sebire, the English Heritage archaeologist with direct responsibility for Stonehenge, talks about how the experience of seeing the stones is at present horribly disrupted by the noise and pollution of the cars and lorries, by the twinkle of headlights at dusk and dawn; she believes the landscape around the stones could be so much better understood and appreciated by visitors without the dangerous, fast-moving A303 bisecting the downland. Even she, though, accepts it is not ideal. \u201cIt is difficult,\u201d she conceded, \u201cand the government is adamant it has funding only for a tunnel of a certain length. We have managed to stretch it a bit, and there have been other mitigating factors.\u201d For Kate Fielden, who has fought such developments for 30 years, it is simply not worth it \u2013 in fact, it would be better to do nothing at all. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you should ruin a world heritage site and get to Exeter 10 minutes faster,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\">\u2018A tale of decay\u2019: the Houses of Parliament are falling down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to English Heritage\u2019s Kate Mavor, it is pointless to try to argue for a longer tunnel, because the money is simply not going to be made available. \u201cThe whole economic argument crumbles, and there has to be an economic argument for it to get to the top of the Highways England list,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we were to push for a longer tunnel, the scheme would never happen. You have to balance the good versus the bad. In this scheme, the good, at the economically viable length for the tunnel, outweighs the bad.\u201d</p> <p>So it is that a plan no one can bring themselves to support wholeheartedly is trundling forward, despite many anxieties about the long-term consequences. Parker Pearson talks about previous incursions into the landscape around Stonehenge \u2013 the first world war camps, an old custodian\u2019s cottage, the A344. \u201cBut all these things were undone. This is so enormous that it cannot be undone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be blasting through the densest group of neolithic barrows anywhere in Britain. It\u2019s going to affect the setting for ever.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stonehenge, with the possible exception of Big Ben, is Britain\u2019s most recognisable monument. As a symbol of the nation\u2019s antiquity, it is our Parthenon, our pyramids \u2013 although, admittedly, less impressive. Neil MacGregor, the former director of the British Museum, recalls that when he took a group of Egyptian archaeologists to see it, they were baffled by our national devotion to the stones, which, compared to the refined surfaces of the pyramids, seemed to them like something hastily thrown up over a weekend. Unlike those other monuments, though, Stonehenge is more or less a complete mystery. Nobody knows for sure why, or by whom, this vast arrangement of boulders was erected on Wiltshire\u2019s downlands, in the south of England, about 5,000 years ago. Into this void have rushed myriad theories, from the academically sober to the blatantly fantastic. Over the centuries, its construction has been confidently credited to giants, wizards, Phoenicians, Mycenaeans, Romans, Saxons, Danes and aliens. (According to one medieval theory, Merlin had it transported from Ireland to serve as the funeral monument for Britons slaughtered by Hengist, the treacherous Saxon.) Since Stonehenge slipped into the written record in the medieval era, it has been a place to project our ideas of ourselves. It was said, by the 20th-century archaeologist and writer Jacquetta Hawkes, that \u201cevery age has the Stonehenge it deserves\u201d. And so today\u2019s Stonehenge is not William Blake\u2019s terrifying \u201cbuilding of eternal death\u201d; nor is it Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cmonstrous place\u201d, where Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles sleeps her last night before being taken to be hanged. Nor is it even the Stonehenge of the counterculture, where peace-freaks revelled until they were brutally routed in \u201cthe Battle of the Beanfield\u201d in 1985, one of the most notorious episodes in the history of British policing. Our Stonehenge has none of this grandeur or pathos. Instead, it is at the centre of a peculiarly modern British circus \u2013 one that involves an agonisingly long planning dispute, allegations of government incompetence, two deeply entrenched opposing sides, and a preoccupation with traffic and tourism. This absurdist drama, entirely worthy of our times, is a long and bitter battle over whether to sink the highway that runs beside it into a tunnel. The A303, the road in question, is celebrated for the wonderful views it offers of the Stonehenge monoliths. But as one of the two major routes connecting the domesticated landscapes of the south-east of England with the wilder West Country, it is just as famous for its dire traffic jams, which begin as the highway narrows to a single lane near Stonehenge. What could be a 10-minute ride through the 6,500-acre Unesco world heritage site in which Stonehenge sits is at peak times an hour-long, bad-tempered grind \u2013 a torture to holidaymakers making for Devon and Cornwall, a drag on the economy of the south-west of England and a bane to locals. According to David Bullock, who works for the national road-building agency, Highways England: \u201cOn Fridays, for a person living in Amesbury, it is quite a torrid affair, if you want to go anywhere.\u201d But this gridlock is not easily resolved. Diverting the road is hard to do: north of the current route lies Britain\u2019s biggest Ministry of Defence training area, south of it pristine countryside. Simply widening it is unthinkable: the Stonehenge heritage site is a precious prehistoric landscape. Governments have been trying, and failing, to solve the problem of the A303 since the 1980s: numerous plans have been suggested and then dropped, at the cost of untold millions. A dizzying number of bodies have been involved, representing every possible interest-group and opinion, from roadbuilders, heritage organisations, government departments and councils to the Campaign for the Preservation of the Lower Till Valley, the Stonehenge Traffic Action Group, the British Horse Society and the organisation that protects Europe\u2019s heaviest flying birds, the Great Bustard Group. The current proposal, to widen and sink the road into a tunnel running for almost two miles, mostly about 600 metres south of the stones, was announced in 2014, although the basic idea goes right back to the 1990s. The main difficulty is the cost: the government has allocated \u00a31.7bn, which is not enough for a passage sufficiently long to avoid the world heritage site. That means tunnel portals would be bored, and dual carriageways built, through an ancient landscape unique in the world. This protected area is home to traces of a mesolithic settlement long predating Stonehenge, the ancient \u201cAvenue\u201d linking the monument and the river Avon, and hundreds of bronze-age burial mounds, or barrows. But the long planning process is entering its endgame. Later this year, a panel of inspectors will meet in Wiltshire and, over a period of six months, examine the evidence for and against the scheme. They will have three months to make their recommendation to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. He will have a further three months to decide whether or not to accept it. Construction could start in 2021. Tempting as it is to suggest that the dispute pits the forces of modernity against the defenders of tradition, the argument boils down to whether you think a major construction project in a world heritage site is absolute madness, or the commonsense solution to a long-term traffic problem. English Heritage, the national body that cares for Stonehenge, insists that doing nothing is not an option. It argues that the A303 will only get busier as new homes are built in the south-west \u2013 and that the tunnel, in any case, would significantly improve the \u201cvisitor experience\u201d by returning the circle to its intended setting, without the intrusion of the sights and sounds of the A303. They also say that the plans have been carefully drawn up to avoid damage to prehistoric features, and that they are still working hard with Highways England to minimise their impact. Battling English Heritage\u2019s smooth assurances, however, is the Stonehenge Alliance \u2013 a coalition of NGOs, including Friends of the Earth and the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Supported by an eclectic band of well-wishers, including archaeologists, historians, farmers and druids, they think it is ridiculous to remove the sight of the stones from passing motorists. More seriously, they argue that the tunnel would \u201cscar the Stonehenge landscape for ever\u201d. Prof Mike Parker Pearson, the archaeologist who has done the most influential recent work on the monument, has entered the fray on the side of the Stonghenge Alliance. He calls the scheme \u201can unattractive British compromise: a bit of a tunnel, but one that is not long enough to protect the archaeology of the world heritage site\u201d. In his view, the plan would amount to the biggest intervention in the landscape for 5,000 years \u2013 and all for a construction project that might have a lifetime of a century. * * * Stonehenge is both smaller and larger than you expect. From the middle distance it can seem surprisingly tiny, like seeing a celebrity in real life. Most tourists don\u2019t ever get right up to the stones, since they are cordoned off. But if you are lucky enough to get among them (by booking special access, or by attending ceremonies held at the solstices and equinoxes) the monoliths loom massively, and seem full of threatening, or beguiling, character: dour and grey on a dull day, but an almost apricot pink when lit by a summer\u2019s sunset. Touching them is forbidden, although this has not always been the case: their surfaces are scarred with graffiti both ancient and modern, from images of daggers gouged out in the Bronze Age to Christopher Wren\u2019s neatly carved signature. \u201cYou\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have known better,\u201d said English Heritage archaeologist Heather Sebire disapprovingly, when we walked among the stones one dusk. Sebire is pro-tunnel: \u201cEveryone knows the scheme\u2019s not perfect. But it is the best we\u2019re going to get at this point in time.\u201d There are some 1,300 stone circles in the UK, from the Ring of Brodgar in the Orkneys to the Merry Maidens in Cornwall, according to archaeologist Mike Pitts (pro-tunnel). But none of them is quite like Stonehenge. Two things make it unique, archaeologist Julian Richards (anti-tunnel) told me. First are its lintels \u2013 the horizontal stones atop the great upright boulders. This act of placing stone on stone is what makes it Britain\u2019s \u201cfirst essay \u2026 in architecture\u201d, as Samuel Johnson put it. (Its circular form inspired John Wood\u2019s mid-18th-century Circus in Bath, itself the model for Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus, meaning, according to historian Rosemary Hill, it is the probably the ultimate ancestor of the British roundabout.) The second thing is that Stonehenge is the only neolithic monument in the UK to use stones not found locally. Only the taller \u201csarsens\u201d are from Wiltshire. The smaller \u201cbluestones\u201d were quarried around 124 miles away in the Preseli Hills in Wales \u2013 an act of transportation that has long puzzled scholars. To celebrate the millennium, an ill-fated project, funded with \u00a3100,000 from the national lottery, attempted to re-enact the fetching of a single three-tonne dolerite bluestone from Wales to Wiltshire. The original plan was for volunteers, some 40 a day, to wear \u201c\u2018appropriate clothing\u2019 of skins and furs\u201d. But that had to be abandoned for safety reasons, according to Mike Pitts\u2019 book Hengeworld \u2013 and many of the volunteers drifted away, disenchanted by the awful task. After eventually loading the boulder on to a boat at Milford Haven, from where it was meant to travel up the Bristol channel, a frisky wind saw it tumble into the sea. At this point it was rescued, using the un-neolithic technology of a crane, and transported on a flatbed truck to the botanical gardens in Carmarthenshire, 140 miles from Stonehenge, where it remains. As a spokesman for Pembrokeshire council remarked at the time: \u201cStone-age man never had the health-and-safety people looking over his shoulder.\u201d Even leaving aside the innate absurdity of a nation spending three decades deciding whether or not to build a tunnel beside it, Stonehenge often operates as a magnet for the ludicrous. In the 1984 mockumentary This is Spinal Tap, the fictional rock band commissions a reproduction of the monument as a stage set, but there is a confusion between feet and inches. As a result, a comically tiny arrangement descends on to the stage. (Harry Shearer, who played Spinal Tap bassist Derek Smalls before finding greater fame as the voice of Mr Burns in The Simpsons, is one of the many people whose anti-tunnel views can be found on the planning website, where he writes as a member of the \u201cadmittedly fictitious band\u201d.) The episode echoes the real events of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1983 US tour, for which a vastly oversize Stonehenge set was accidentally produced owing to a mix-up between metric and imperial. Indeed, Stonehenge\u2019s massy blocks seem irresistible to copyists: a website, Clonehenge, charts replicas made of everything from cars and lava-lamps to vegetables and gingerbread. The most celebrated duplicate of recent times may be the artist Jeremy Deller\u2019s lifesize version in the form of a bouncy castle, which he memorably described a \u201ca way to get reacquainted with ancient Britain with your shoes off\u201d. (Deller is anti-tunnel. \u201cA nice idea, but it\u2019s clearly not long enough.\u201d) In its time Stonehenge has been interpreted as temple to the sun, Boudicca\u2019s tomb, Satan\u2019s court, an observatory, a computer, a phallic device for symbolically impregnating the sun, and, fairly recently, as a place of healing \u2013 \u201cthe neolithic A&amp;E unit for southern England\u201d, as the theory\u2019s proponent put it. (Perhaps it was inevitable that at some point Britain\u2019s favourite monument should be imagined as prefiguring its most treasured institution, the NHS.) Deller, who has followed his inflatable Stonehenge with a range of clothing including T-shirts adorned with mouths full of crooked megaliths and the caption \u201cEnglish teeth\u201d, regards Stonehenge as a mutable, open-ended symbol of Englishness \u2013 like Jerusalem, a hymn that can be sung with equal fervour at socialist rallies and rugby tournaments. \u201cStonehenge is fluid \u2013 in the way that national identity is fluid,\u201d he said. And, he argued, more necessary than ever. \u201cAs times become more uncertain, people look to the stones for a kind of truth,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople want the stones to speak.\u201d Stonehenge is a mirror \u2013 it reflects back your obsessions. In the 1960s, astronomer Gerald S Hawkins argued that Stonehenge was an astronomical \u201ccomputing machine\u201d capable of predicting eclipses \u2013 a theory that held sway for decades, although now many of the celestial alignments he discovered are thought to be coincidental. A gynaecologist, Anthony Perks, writing in 2003, thought it was a fertility symbol in the shape of a vulva. (His article was titled The Vagina Monoliths.) Some 17th- and 18th-century scholars were convinced Stonehenge had been built by the druids, a sect of rather frightening Celtic priests mentioned in Roman texts. This theory proved so heady that it inspired the creation of an actual, modern religion: druids began performing ceremonies at the stones in 1905, and still do. Unfortunately for the modern druids, Stonehenge is now known to predate their imagined predecessors by several thousand years. (Even so, it would be a hard-hearted person who entirely dismissed the modern druids. You don\u2019t have to be a believer in ley lines to agree with them that the stones radiate a power beyond rational considerations.) In fact, scholars are now convinced that Stonehenge can finally \u2013 after centuries of debate \u2013 be fixed at about 5,000 years old, after organic material excavated at the base of the stones was radiocarbon-dated in the 1990s. It is not easy dating such monuments \u2013 a fact demonstrated by the recent revelation that an unusual bronze-age stone circle in Aberdeenshire was actually built 20 years ago by a farmer. Currently, the dominant theory about the purpose of Stonehenge is that of Mike Parker Pearson, who excavated in the area for several years from 2003. He hypothesises that it was a first and foremost a place built to honour the dead \u2013 and that the community that built it lived nearby, at Durrington Walls. For him, the inclusion of the Welsh bluestones was a gesture symbolic of some kind of \u201cpolitical unification\u201d of disparate British peoples after a period of \u201cneolithic Brexit\u201d \u2013 a slow period of recession, some six centuries after the introduction of farming, when Britain\u2019s ties with the continent were cut off. * * * In the early 1990s, Stonehenge was a mess. Tourists got to it via a grubby pedestrian passageway under the A344, the road nearest to the monument; the visitor centre and parking facilities were tatty; the annual solstice celebrations saw embarrassing clashes between travellers and law enforcement. When the Department for Transport first announced plans to improve the A303, it seemed \u2013 at least to the energetic new boss of English Heritage, Thatcher favourite Jocelyn Stevens \u2013 as if all of this could be tackled at once. But it wasn\u2019t so simple. It took two decades for the A344 to be closed and grassed over and a new visitor centre opened. The problem of the A303, however, has proved even more stubborn. The first proposal was a \u201ccut-and-cover\u201d tunnel (effectively, a trench with a lid), rejected after public consultation in 1993. The following year, English Heritage and the National Trust, which owns more than 2,000 acres of land around Stonehenge, announced that their preferred option was a deeper, bored tunnel of about two-and-a-half miles that would avoid disturbing the archaeology \u2013 but in 1998, the government declared this \u201cunaffordable and uneconomic\u201d. In 2002, the DoT unveiled plans for yet another tunnel, this time only 1.3 miles long \u2013 supported by English Heritage, but too short to satisfy the National Trust, which said it presented an \u201curgent, serious and imminent\u201d threat to the landscape. Finally, in 2007, the scheme, the development of which had already cost around \u00a320m, was dropped on grounds of cost. For the campaigners who had fought these projects for 15 years, it seemed like a victory. \u201cIn 2007, we thought we\u2019d cracked the road scheme, but obviously not,\u201d Kate Fielden told me over tea and cake in her pottery-filled cottage. A retired archaeologist and one of the leading lights of the tunnel resistance, Fielden first got wind of the revived tunnel scheme in 2013, when it was being eagerly promoted by MPs keen for a boost to the local economy. Her group, the Stonehenge Alliance, which had become something of a sleeper cell, snapped back into action, writing to ministers even before the new scheme was announced by David Cameron in December 2014. This time, the National Trust had been brought back on side by the promise that the mooted tunnel would be half a mile longer than in the previous scheme. Then Highways England got to work, drawing a spaghetti of lines on a map to delineate possible \u201croute corridors\u201d, as the parlance has it. David Bullock is the project manager for the Stonehenge section of the A303 upgrade. The scheme, he told me when we met in October, \u201cis in the hard-to-do bracket \u2026 not only have you the challenge of the world heritage site, to the north you have Salisbury Plain, the largest area of military exercise in the country. To the south, you have open very lush and ecologically rich areas, so it\u2019s a very difficult environment with which to weave a highway system.\u201d The Stonehenge section of the A303 was designed for 13,000-14,000 cars a day, \u201cbut you are squeezing through an average of about 25,000. And that can rise by about 30% at peak times.\u201d The A303, he said, is \u201ca problem, it has been a problem for 25 years, and it is spreading like a cancer across the local road network.\u201d After a public consultation in 2017, the 1.8-mile tunnel was named as the \u201cpreferred route\u201d by the DoT \u2013 to no one\u2019s surprise at all, given that it had been effectively announced in 2014. Objectors such as Mike Parker Pearson are infuriated by the decision not to simply reroute the road well to the south of the site \u2013 which Highways England argues could disturb untouched archaeology. \u201cI have never seen a statement that sets out why the archaeology around a southern route might be important, or what that is based on,\u201d he told me. Meanwhile, Highways England commissioned dozens of exploratory surveys looking at water tables and archaeology, at congestion and pollution, at the flight path of bats and the population of the marsh fritillary butterfly, a process that has so far cost \u00a340m. Some locals are aggrieved by the disruption caused by all this preliminary work \u2013 and feel ignored by the consultation process. \u201cAll the major decisions are taken by people deemed to be in positions of authority \u2013 like the National Trust, English Heritage and Wiltshire county council. But I\u2019m just a farmer. I\u2019m expendable,\u201d Rachel Hosier told me in the kitchen of her farmhouse, a couple of miles south of the stones. Her land contains important ancient barrows and an RSPB reserve for the rare, eccentric-looking bird, the stone curlew. She told me there had been disturbances to livestock, work done at inappropriate times in the farming year, and material from investigations left on her land \u2013 she even holds up a zip-lock bag of flints left behind by one of the archaeological teams. (Highways England said that work was discussed in advance, damage to crops compensated for, and steps taken to prevent a reoccurrence of the mislaid flints episode. Public consultations did result in changes: to the location of the tunnel\u2019s western portal, the line of the road, and to a local bypass.) Icomos, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, which advises Unesco, reported in April 2018 that there would be \u201cirreversible damage\u201d if the scheme went ahead; Unesco\u2019s own world heritage committee has said that the project would \u201cimpact adversely on the integrity and the outstanding universal value\u201d of the area. The Stonehenge Alliance has submitted documents arguing that the scheme contravenes a blizzard of laws, directives and conventions, including the 2008 Planning Act, the World Heritage Convention, the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and the Birds Directive. Among the other opponents are a number of readers of the Telegraph, who took to the paper\u2019s letters page to protest that motorists would no longer glimpse the large field of pigs adjacent to the stones, on Hosier\u2019s land. (Typical letter: \u201cOn our visits to Shepton Mallet, my wife always looks forward to seeing the porkers enjoying their freedom, roaming the vast field \u2026 a wonderful advertisement for British farming.\u201d) The druid Merlin, co-leader of the The Astronumerical Druid Order, raised a similar objection: a tunnel would rob passing motorists of the view of the stones, one of the most famous sights in England. * * * One blustery, perishingly cold October day last year, English Heritage threw a celebration at Stonehenge marking the monument\u2019s centenary in public ownership. In a little marquee, where dignitaries huddled out of the wind, was a large Stonehenge-shaped cake, over a metre in diameter, which the archaeologist Julian Richards judged to be \u201cpretty accurate\u201d. Off near the visitors\u2019 centre was Deller\u2019s work Sacrilege \u2013 his inflatable Stonehenge \u2013 on which enthusiastic children and archaeologists bounced. A darkly weird piece for brass instruments, by composer Matt Rogers, was performed inside the stone circle, as tourists looked on in faint bewilderment. At one point a group of druids, their medieval-style robes flapping about to reveal 21st-century jeans and boots, passed around bread and mead \u2013 more like Church of England communicants than the human-sacrificing druid priests of Julius Caesar\u2019s imagination. As a line of Gore-Texed visitors patiently queued for a cuppa, it was hard to imagine anything more English. The tunnel scheme had been submitted to the planning inspectorate the previous week, and was being discussed in tones \u2013 depending on point of view \u2013 varying from horror to resignation to relief. The principle of preserving a \u201cnational heritage\u201d in perpetuity can seem as though it has been with us for ever \u2013 perhaps because bodies such as the National Trust seem like such timeless bastions of middle England. In fact, the idea is fairly recent \u2013 and Stonehenge itself played an important role in its invention. For centuries, the monument has been a tourist destination; by the mid-18th century the classic trip was to combine it with Salisbury Cathedral, 10 miles to the south. They were \u201ctwo eminent models of art and rudeness\u201d, Dr Johnson wrote, the cathedral exemplifying sophistication and Stonehenge, primitivism. (This is also the tourist programme that the Russians accused of poisoning Sergei and Yulia Skripal were planning, so they said, before they were foiled by slush underfoot.) Victorian Stonehenge was a place of day-trippers, bicycle outings, Sunday school jollies, cricket matches and concerts. The craze for the new discipline of geology saw visitors chipping chunks out of the stones for their collections (a stall rented out chisels). It was this popularity and accessibility, partly brought about by the railway boom, that began to imperil Stonehenge \u2013 and simultaneously forge the idea that it ought to be preserved for future generations. For many decades, landowners had rejected the principle of a national patrimony that would threaten their property rights. But finally, the antiquarian and MP John Lubbock (the man who coined the terms \u201cpalaeolithic\u201d and \u201cneolithic\u201d) succeeded in pushing through the Ancient Monuments Protection Act of 1882. Stonehenge was one of first 26 English and Welsh monuments \u201cscheduled\u201d, or protected, under the act. At the time, the land was owned by a local grandee, Sir Edmund Antrobus, who put a fence around the site and began to charge for entrance; he also tried, unsuccessfully, to sell it to the nation for the inflated price of \u00a3125,000. As the first world war loomed, the army bought up tracts of Salisbury Plain to use for exercises; camps and hangars crept close to the stones. A military presence is still obvious to any visitor: Apaches and Chinooks can approach thunderously close. \u201cIs this normal?\u201d I recently heard a worried-looking overseas tourist asking a staff member, as curls of artillery smoke dissipated in the middle distance. By 1915, Sir Edmund and his heir were dead, and the estate was put up for auction. A local man, Cecil Chubb, had come to the auction (according to local legend) looking for some dining room chairs; instead he bought Stonehenge for \u00a36,600. Three years later, he gave it to the nation. After the war, fears grew that the downs around Stonehenge would be built on, and in 1927 land nearby was bought by public subscription for the young National Trust, founded a dozen years earlier. Among those who rallied to the new cause of protecting rural England from the tentacles of development was a group of young women who formed a kind of 1930s Pussy Riot. Ferguson\u2019s Gang, as they called themselves, were masked, anonymous activists who went by codenames such as Bill Stickers, Granny the Throttler, Black Maria and Red Biddy. They raised money for the National Trust and handed it over in the form of elaborate stunts \u2013 concealing cash in a fake pineapple, or rolled up in a cigar, and gatecrashing grand events to present it. At their very first meeting, on 26 March 1932, Ferguson\u2019s Gang passed a resolution, later sworn as a solemn oath beneath the stones themselves, \u201cThat ENGLAND is STONEHENGE and not Whitehall\u201d. The sprawling capital, the machinations of politics, the grinding wheels of bureaucracy \u2013 none of that was important. For them, the soul of the nation lay in the ancient, slumbering magic of Stonehenge. In 2015, the Conservative government spun off English Heritage \u2013 the descendent of the government body that cared for monuments after the 1882 act \u2013 into an independent charity, earning its own keep. Its ability to do this is strongly dependent on Stonehenge, which brings in 21% of its annual income of about \u00a3112m and which, with its 1.5 million visitors a year, attracts a million more than the next-most popular site, Dover Castle. Kate Mavor, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, told me she thought of Stonehenge as a publisher might a bestseller \u2013 a title that supports other, less lucrative, works. While entry is free for English Heritage and Trust members, it otherwise costs \u00a317.50 to buy a ticket to Stonehenge. More than half the visitors are from overseas. A vast coach park at the site decants tourists who will often also take in Bath and Windsor on a day trip from London. At the cafe, there is Stonehenge branded water, the bottle decorated with runes (a Germanic writing system irrelevant to the monument), and there is a brisk trade in rock cakes (get it?). The shop sells Stonehenge woollies, T-shirts, snowdomes, fridge magnets and jewellery. Visiting Stonehenge today does not offer much in the way of solitary communion with the eternal verities; this is heritage commodified within an inch of its life. But the narrative that Stonehenge has been ruined by mass tourism goes back a long way. Even Samuel Pepys complained of being ripped off by shepherds and innkeepers. Jacquetta Hawkes\u2019s book A Land, a classic work on British prehistory, was published in 1951, when visitors numbered only about 200,000 a year. \u201cCafes and chewing gum, car parks and conducted excursions, a sense of the hackneyed induced by post cards, calendars and cheap guide books has done more to damage Stonehenge than the plundering of some of its stones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMen made it and men destroyed it.\u201d * * * Who owns Stonehenge? Who gets a say in its future? Who is listened to, and who is ignored, in the making of these decisions? These are the questions that crowd round the monument \u2013 questions that are not so different from those that surge around the future of the British Isles themselves. Stonehenge is often regarded as a symbol of comforting longevity; of the persistence of deep antiquity against the insistent tides of more recent history. But that is not quite true: permanence and certainty seem to bounce off its sandstone and dolerite surfaces. At the beginning of Rosemary Hill\u2019s book Stonehenge, published in 2008, the author describes in two sentences what she regards as the only unarguable facts about the monument, including the name of the county in which it sits, its latitude, its proximity to the A344 and its management by a government-funded agency. But even some of these are already out of date: the road is gone and English Heritage is now a charity. Even the physical appearance of the monument has altered relatively recently. In 1797, and again in 1900, two of the great sarsen stones collapsed; they were re-erected after the first world war, and at the same time, other vulnerable stones stabilised in concrete. Further restorations were carried out in the 1950s and 60s. Radiocarbon analysis conducted in the 1990s resulted in the monument becoming \u2013 more or less at a stroke \u2013 nearly 1,000 years older than previously thought. Stonehenge is not even, properly speaking, a henge. The term, coined by Thomas Kendrick of the British Museum in 1932, was adapted from the word Stonehenge (which probably derives from a Saxon word meaning \u201changing rock\u201d). But \u201chenge\u201d is supposed to describe circular monuments enclosed by a ditch inside a bank; Stonehenge\u2019s ditch and bank are actually the other way around. Stonehenge, then, is not so much about solidity and eternity as confusion and internal contradiction. It is partly its quicksilver ungraspability as a sign that makes it so magnetic, so available to every generation. \u201cNot a week goes past without a news story about Stonehenge, some discovery, some controversy,\u201d said Jeremy Deller. It is this endless mutability of meaning that makes it, for him, \u201cthe most contemporary building in Britain\u201d. Many people lay claim to Stonehenge, from the charities who care for it, the archaeologists who study it, the druids who revere it, to artists like Deller who borrow its power to make meaning of their own. It resists ownership, but it is vulnerable, and not immune to human activity. Parker Pearson, whose research on the purpose and people of Stonehenge continues, talks of the world heritage site as a kind of island, on the fringes of which hover threats in the form of gradually encroaching development. In the north, there are 917 new homes for military families \u201cdebased\u201d from the last cold war-era German garrisons. At the east, there are the glinting sheds of the new, bathetically named Solstice Park, an out-of-town business estate complete with a Costa, a McDonald\u2019s and a Holiday Inn. The tunnel project that Chris Grayling, or his successor, will soon approve or reject, is an example of a British compromise that even its most ardent champions find difficult to praise to the skies. The whole point of a road scheme, Highways England\u2019s David Bullock told me, \u201cis to take all those not quite good enoughs to make a good enough project\u201d. Heather Sebire, the English Heritage archaeologist with direct responsibility for Stonehenge, talks about how the experience of seeing the stones is at present horribly disrupted by the noise and pollution of the cars and lorries, by the twinkle of headlights at dusk and dawn; she believes the landscape around the stones could be so much better understood and appreciated by visitors without the dangerous, fast-moving A303 bisecting the downland. Even she, though, accepts it is not ideal. \u201cIt is difficult,\u201d she conceded, \u201cand the government is adamant it has funding only for a tunnel of a certain length. We have managed to stretch it a bit, and there have been other mitigating factors.\u201d For Kate Fielden, who has fought such developments for 30 years, it is simply not worth it \u2013 in fact, it would be better to do nothing at all. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you should ruin a world heritage site and get to Exeter 10 minutes faster,\u201d she said. According to English Heritage\u2019s Kate Mavor, it is pointless to try to argue for a longer tunnel, because the money is simply not going to be made available. \u201cThe whole economic argument crumbles, and there has to be an economic argument for it to get to the top of the Highways England list,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we were to push for a longer tunnel, the scheme would never happen. You have to balance the good versus the bad. In this scheme, the good, at the economically viable length for the tunnel, outweighs the bad.\u201d So it is that a plan no one can bring themselves to support wholeheartedly is trundling forward, despite many anxieties about the long-term consequences. Parker Pearson talks about previous incursions into the landscape around Stonehenge \u2013 the first world war camps, an old custodian\u2019s cottage, the A344. \u201cBut all these things were undone. This is so enormous that it cannot be undone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be blasting through the densest group of neolithic barrows anywhere in Britain. It\u2019s going to affect the setting for ever.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

It has butchered youth clubs, health centres, daycare for the elderly, libraries, museums, parks and gardens. Now councils claim they are barely able to sustain statutory \u201ccore\u201d services, notably to the <a href=\"http://www.publicsectorexecutive.com/Public-Sector-News/social-care-needs-1bn-boost-or-councils-at-risk-of-failing-statutory-duties\" title=\"\">old</a> and very young.</p> <p>Councils have long cried wolf. But any observant user of local services knows a real wolf is at the door. We may not all use youth clubs, home visits or homeless shelters, but we can all see potholes deepening and bin collections dwindling. We see parks untended and museums and libraries closing. We see councils such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/29/tory-run-northamptonshire-county-council-bailed-out-by-government\" title=\"\">Northampton</a> declaring themselves close to bankruptcy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/03/council-tax-unfair-westminster\">Council tax should be fair and progressive. Ours is neither</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the commons public accounts committee described the government as \u201cin denial\u201d on the state of council finances, and chastised it for \u201clacking clear plans for ensuring long-term sustainability\u201d. Councils were allowed to increase local taxes only by inflation, but have received far less central government money as a result. Business rates remain centralised, and anyway tend to benefit richer areas.</p> <p>The withering away of local taxes has been a tacit and cynical power grab by Britain\u2019s political establishment, ever since Margaret Thatcher capped domestic rates in 1985. She and her successors have sought to make councils little more than executive agencies of Whitehall. Local taxes, according to the OECD, comprise just 1.6% of GDP in the UK, against 5.8% in France, 11% in Germany and 15.8% in Sweden. This is localism in collapse. Accountability through the ballot box is all but insignificant when revenue is so low.</p> <p>Had domestic rates remained in place as a property tax under Thatcher, and risen in line with inflation (not property values), most people would now be paying double what they are. Domestic rates on my old house in Camden were \u00a33,400 a year in 1989. Today, council tax on the property is just \u00a32,600. With inflation, the tax should be running at \u00a37,200. People may dislike such a rise, but indexation is hardly unreasonable.</p> <p>Crazier still, council tax bands were fixed so the highest was only three times the lowest, and were never adjusted to reflect rising house prices. Within the top band, West End palaces pay the same as modest terrace houses. As a result, councils have been unable to benefit during the house price boom, as New York did under its former mayor Michael Bloomberg. Stamp duty is Britain\u2019s only price-related property tax, and that goes nowhere near a local council.</p> <p>An expert on local taxation, Professor Tony Travers of LSE, finds this incomprehensible and absurd. He points out that: \u201cWhitehall treats Britain as if it were a failed state. It is as if local institutions were so weakened that only ministers should be allowed to make decisions on local matters.\u201d Hence the occasional dollops of headline cash for potholes or mental health, carefully ring-fenced so councils cannot \u201csteal\u201d it. As it is, the world\u2019s rich park their wealth in London with good reason. It is dirt-cheap to do so. I cannot see why Griffin should pay New York a quarter of a million to be kept secure, clean and transported, and not pay a similar amount to Westminster. The rich plead that there are too few of them to make much difference. That is rubbish. The annual tax take from one of Manhattan\u2019s pencil towers must be in the region of \u00a310m a year. That would be one-fifth of Westminster\u2019s total council tax revenue, from one block.</p> <p>No healthy democracy should deny local people the right to vote and tax themselves for their own benefit. It is democracy\u2019s second nature. Britain is not a banana republic, or a bureaucratised communist state. Taxation is about fairness, and Britain\u2019s local taxes are unfair. There are a thousand Griffins, and tens of thousands of people who, like me, can vote for higher taxes for better local services for everyone. By what distorted ideology is that not permitted?</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The third is a penthouse atop a \u201cpencil block\u201d at New York\u2019s 220 Central Park South, costing $238m (\u00a3200m). All have been eulogised as \u201cstunning\u201d. Something else is stunning, but is not reported. The property tax that Griffin will pay to New York on his \u00a3200m home will be at least an eye-watering $280,000 a year. But dry the starting tear. He can afford it. Instead, switch to London. Here the sum total of what Griffin will pay Westminster for his pieds-a-terre is just \u00a32,842 \u2013 that is the council tax on two H-band properties. This is the lunatic reality of Britain\u2019s hyper-centralised public finances. The Treasury happily squanders money on its favourites, on defence procurement, high-speed trains and universities. But local government can go hang. Last week came another pathetic bleat from its association, after hearing how much it will not have to run its services next year. The answer is 1.4% lower than four years ago in real terms. This is on top of a 49% real-terms cut in central government funding of local councils between 2010 and 2017. For a decade councils have been stripping out optional or \u201cdiscretionary\u201d services, not specifically ordained by central statute. It has butchered youth clubs, health centres, daycare for the elderly, libraries, museums, parks and gardens. Now councils claim they are barely able to sustain statutory \u201ccore\u201d services, notably to the old and very young. Councils have long cried wolf. But any observant user of local services knows a real wolf is at the door. We may not all use youth clubs, home visits or homeless shelters, but we can all see potholes deepening and bin collections dwindling. We see parks untended and museums and libraries closing. We see councils such as Northampton declaring themselves close to bankruptcy. Last week the commons public accounts committee described the government as \u201cin denial\u201d on the state of council finances, and chastised it for \u201clacking clear plans for ensuring long-term sustainability\u201d. Councils were allowed to increase local taxes only by inflation, but have received far less central government money as a result. Business rates remain centralised, and anyway tend to benefit richer areas. The withering away of local taxes has been a tacit and cynical power grab by Britain\u2019s political establishment, ever since Margaret Thatcher capped domestic rates in 1985. She and her successors have sought to make councils little more than executive agencies of Whitehall. Local taxes, according to the OECD, comprise just 1.6% of GDP in the UK, against 5.8% in France, 11% in Germany and 15.8% in Sweden. This is localism in collapse. Accountability through the ballot box is all but insignificant when revenue is so low. Had domestic rates remained in place as a property tax under Thatcher, and risen in line with inflation (not property values), most people would now be paying double what they are. Domestic rates on my old house in Camden were \u00a33,400 a year in 1989. Today, council tax on the property is just \u00a32,600. With inflation, the tax should be running at \u00a37,200. People may dislike such a rise, but indexation is hardly unreasonable. Crazier still, council tax bands were fixed so the highest was only three times the lowest, and were never adjusted to reflect rising house prices. Within the top band, West End palaces pay the same as modest terrace houses. As a result, councils have been unable to benefit during the house price boom, as New York did under its former mayor Michael Bloomberg. Stamp duty is Britain\u2019s only price-related property tax, and that goes nowhere near a local council. An expert on local taxation, Professor Tony Travers of LSE, finds this incomprehensible and absurd. He points out that: \u201cWhitehall treats Britain as if it were a failed state. It is as if local institutions were so weakened that only ministers should be allowed to make decisions on local matters.\u201d Hence the occasional dollops of headline cash for potholes or mental health, carefully ring-fenced so councils cannot \u201csteal\u201d it. As it is, the world\u2019s rich park their wealth in London with good reason. It is dirt-cheap to do so. I cannot see why Griffin should pay New York a quarter of a million to be kept secure, clean and transported, and not pay a similar amount to Westminster. The rich plead that there are too few of them to make much difference. That is rubbish. The annual tax take from one of Manhattan\u2019s pencil towers must be in the region of \u00a310m a year. That would be one-fifth of Westminster\u2019s total council tax revenue, from one block. No healthy democracy should deny local people the right to vote and tax themselves for their own benefit. It is democracy\u2019s second nature. Britain is not a banana republic, or a bureaucratised communist state. Taxation is about fairness, and Britain\u2019s local taxes are unfair. There are a thousand Griffins, and tens of thousands of people who, like me, can vote for higher taxes for better local services for everyone. By what distorted ideology is that not permitted? \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

But amendments to the motion could lead to \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit options or an extension of the two-year article 50 process, possibly via a relaunched Yvette Cooper-Nick Boles amendment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/brexit-backstop-amendment-would-give-may-enormous-firepower\">setting a deadline</a> for MPs to back the agreement.</p> <p><strong>14 February: first statutory instrument</strong><strong> deadline.</strong> According to the Institute for Government, this is the final day on which about half the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/28/mps-may-have-to-work-fridays-and-weekends-to-avoid-legal-cliff-edge-brexit\">secondary legislation</a> needed to import EU laws can be introduced, because parliament must be given 40 sitting days to object to it. EU-related SIs can be passed more quickly in \u201curgent circumstances\u201d, but still need to be approved by both houses within a 28-day window.</p> <p><strong>17 February: more trade woes.</strong> From this date, ships setting sail for Japan from the UK and vice versa could arrive to find themselves in the middle of no-deal tariff mayhem.</p> <p><strong>20 February: international treaty ratification deadline.</strong> About 80 of roughly 100 international treaties with other countries remain to be ratified by parliament, a process that \u2013 barring \u201cexceptional cases\u201d \u2013 requires 21 sitting days.</p> <p><strong>28 February: self-imposed deadline</strong> agreed by May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/feb/07/brexit-latest-news-developments-theresa-may-brussels-talks-corbyn-faces-backlash-from-labour-pro-europeans-after-sending-brexit-plan-to-pm-politics-live?page=with:block-5c5c1d32e4b04a6f567daa7e#block-5c5c1d32e4b04a6f567daa7e\">discuss progress</a> made by the two sides towards a revised deal the prime minister can bring back to the Commons.</p> <p><strong>Early-mid March: second \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. </strong>The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 obliges the British parliament to hold a vote on the withdrawal agreement before the European parliament has its say.</p> <p><strong>21-22 March: article 50 extension request?</strong> With barely a week to go before Brexit day, EU leaders gather for their annual spring summit. This is when some EU officials think the UK might ask for more time to conclude Brexit by requesting an extension to article 50. This would need to be agreed unanimously by the EU27 and there is no time limit for it to do so \u2013 it could happen very late.</p> <p><strong>By 28 March: UK ratification of extension?</strong> If Britain has asked for an extension and the EU27 has granted it, both houses of parliament must vote to allow the legally binding exit date of 29 March to be changed.</p> <p><strong>Mid-late March: UK ratification of deal.</strong> If MPs eventually back May\u2019s deal without an article 50 extension, the government still has to get the bill through both houses. Primary legislation of this sort can be rushed through quickly, perhaps with controversial elements stripped out. But an avalanche of amendments could still make the 29 March departure date unattainable.</p> <p><strong>25-28 March: EU ratification.</strong> If there has been no extension, the European parliament\u2019s second Strasbourg meeting would be the last chance for MEPs to vote through the withdrawal agreement to get it agreed before Brexit day.

      "bodyText": "With 50 days remaining until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March, the two sides have agreed to continue exploring possible tweaks to the Brexit deal that might get it over the line in the House of Commons, while still respecting the EU27\u2019s guidelines. So far, neither looks set to budge. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for Westminster, Brussels and businesses. Here are some of the key dates and deadlines as Brexit finally gets real. 8 February: possible export problems. From this week, freighters setting sail from UK ports with cargo for far-flung destinations such as Australia and New Zealand, a journey of about 50 days, risk arriving after Brexit day with \u2013 in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 no idea of the trade rules that will be in place. 14 February: Brexit debate in the Commons. This is most likely to be a general debate following a prime ministerial statement, because Theresa May will almost certainly not have a revised deal by then. But amendments to the motion could lead to \u201cindicative votes\u201d on Brexit options or an extension of the two-year article 50 process, possibly via a relaunched Yvette Cooper-Nick Boles amendment setting a deadline for MPs to back the agreement. 14 February: first statutory instrument deadline. According to the Institute for Government, this is the final day on which about half the secondary legislation needed to import EU laws can be introduced, because parliament must be given 40 sitting days to object to it. EU-related SIs can be passed more quickly in \u201curgent circumstances\u201d, but still need to be approved by both houses within a 28-day window. 17 February: more trade woes. From this date, ships setting sail for Japan from the UK and vice versa could arrive to find themselves in the middle of no-deal tariff mayhem. 20 February: international treaty ratification deadline. About 80 of roughly 100 international treaties with other countries remain to be ratified by parliament, a process that \u2013 barring \u201cexceptional cases\u201d \u2013 requires 21 sitting days. 28 February: self-imposed deadline agreed by May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to discuss progress made by the two sides towards a revised deal the prime minister can bring back to the Commons. Early-mid March: second \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 obliges the British parliament to hold a vote on the withdrawal agreement before the European parliament has its say. 21-22 March: article 50 extension request? With barely a week to go before Brexit day, EU leaders gather for their annual spring summit. This is when some EU officials think the UK might ask for more time to conclude Brexit by requesting an extension to article 50. This would need to be agreed unanimously by the EU27 and there is no time limit for it to do so \u2013 it could happen very late. By 28 March: UK ratification of extension? If Britain has asked for an extension and the EU27 has granted it, both houses of parliament must vote to allow the legally binding exit date of 29 March to be changed. Mid-late March: UK ratification of deal. If MPs eventually back May\u2019s deal without an article 50 extension, the government still has to get the bill through both houses. Primary legislation of this sort can be rushed through quickly, perhaps with controversial elements stripped out. But an avalanche of amendments could still make the 29 March departure date unattainable. 25-28 March: EU ratification. If there has been no extension, the European parliament\u2019s second Strasbourg meeting would be the last chance for MEPs to vote through the withdrawal agreement to get it agreed before Brexit day. EU ambassadors would then have a few dozen hours to rubber-stamp the final deal. 29 March: Brexit day? Without an extension, the UK will formally leave the EU on 29 March at 11pm UK time (midnight in Brussels). EU officials think a last-minute plea for more time by the UK would be unlikely, as by this late hour, events would have their own momentum. Equally unlikely, they believe, is the possibility of Britain cancelling Brexit \u2013 although the European court of justice set no notice period when it ruled the UK could unilaterally revoke article 50, so in theory, the government could still make a U-turn even at this stage. 15-18 April: EU ratification following an extension. If the UK has been granted a short technical extension to complete the Brexit process, MEPs\u2019 monthly plenary meeting in Strasbourg would be the final opportunity for the European parliament to ratify the agreement before European elections. 23-26 May: European elections. If the UK sought and obtained an extension to article 50 that went beyond 2 July \u2013 the first day of the new parliament \u2013 it would have to take part in those elections, EU officials have said.",

This is not to dismiss the tenacious efforts of British and allied forces on the ground who struggled valiantly, for instance, to bring stability to Helmand province. But they, and the Afghan people, have paid a terrible price for a lack of clarity and candour on the part of the politicians who sent them there.</p> <p>Another delusion \u2013 that Afghan security forces could be trained and equipped to a point where they could, unaided, contain the Taliban and control the country \u2013 <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-afghanistan-airforce/afghanistan-lacks-pilots-engineers-to-handle-black-hawk-copters-u-s-watchdog-warns-idUKKCN1PU0L6\" title=\"\">has also been shattered</a>. Despite Nato\u2019s best efforts, 30 to 40 Afghan soldiers and police were being killed each day last autumn.

This increase in mortality mirrors the decrease in western troop numbers since the 2011 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44164430\" title=\"\">peak</a>.</p> <p>Despite massive diplomatic and developmental assistance, the Afghan government holds limited sway beyond the barricaded safe zones of central Kabul. The Taliban refuse to allow it to participate in withdrawal talks, dismissing it as a mere puppet. The implications, once the Americans have gone, are ominous. A rapid descent into civil war, involving government forces, jihadist groups and rival warlords, in a rerun of not-forgotten 1990s anarchy, is a strong possibility. Last year saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/15/civilian-deaths-afghanistan-record-high-un-says\" title=\"\">record civilian deaths</a>, caused by terror bombings, intensified fighting and increased US airstrikes. Coming years may prove yet more deadly.</p> <p>Even if the worst is avoided, Afghan civil society organisations and education, public health and women\u2019s rights advocates rightly dread the inclusion of Taliban Sunni fundamentalists in any postwar political settlement. Despite assurances to the contrary, the prospective return of Taliban hardliners to positions of influence presages a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47139908\" title=\"\">new dark age</a> of regression, discrimination and bigotry. And how long will any pretence of democratic government persist? As in the past, Afghanistan could <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game\" title=\"\">quickly revert</a> to a Great Game free-for-all involving Pakistan, India, Russia, Iran \u2013 and now China, too. In sum, the Americans are leaving an unholy mess that they, more than any other individual actor, helped create.</p> <p>From a narrow US viewpoint, there are still plenty of reasons for quitting while they\u2019re behind. Donald Trump campaigned against \u201cendless wars\u201d, and recently decided <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46643500\" title=\"\">to halve</a> the current US force of 14,000. Most voters <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/10/08/most-americans-would-support-withdrawal-afghanista\" title=\"\">want the troops out</a>. Billions of dollars have been expended to no lasting effect, while millions more have been lost to corruption. In the absence of any post-9/11 foreign terrorist attacks on US soil, Bush\u2019s old claim that fighting terror abroad avoids the need to fight it at home carries diminishing weight.</p> <p>In a significant shift, the New York Times which, like all major US media, supported the 2001 invasion, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/opinion/afghanistan-war.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">called this week</a> for the troops to come home \u2013 and eviscerated the overall US approach to fighting terror. Far from eradicating international terrorism as Bush pledged, the \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d was in large part responsible for the worldwide growth since 2001 of Islamist-inspired terrorist groups, the paper\u2019s editorial noted.</p> <p>Put this another way. The British-supported US global war on terror, which has claimed about half a million lives, been waged across 80 nations, corroded respect for human rights and international law, and cost an estimated <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2018/Human%20Costs%2C%20Nov%208%202018%20CoW.pdf\" title=\"\">$5.9tn,</a> was, from the outset, a catastrophic mistake based on a false premise, aggravated by self-righteous arrogance and an unforgivable ignorance of the world beyond America\u2019s shores.

      "bodyText": "The approaching US withdrawal from Afghanistan is not an honourable retreat \u2013 it\u2019s a capitulation. The best the Americans can hope for in exit talks with the Taliban, due to resume in Doha later this month, is a promise that coalition troops, unlike the British army led by General Elphinstone in 1842, will not depart under fire. After more than 17 years of conflict, with at least 38,000 civilians killed and millions more injured, traumatised or exiled, none of the long-term objectives set out by George W Bush following the 2001 invasion has been met. In short, the US has lost the war, and lost badly. The al-Qaida terrorists who used Afghanistan as a base from which to launch the 9/11 attacks have not been wholly vanquished, as Bush promised. Their former leader, Osama bin Laden, is dead but the group, and likewise Islamic State, made territorial gains in Afghanistan last year, according to UN experts. It is unlikely that Taliban leaders could in future prevent jihadists once again using parts of the country as a terrorist safe haven \u2013 a key demand of American negotiators \u2013 even if they sincerely wanted to. The idea, promoted by successive US administrations and Nato partners such as Britain, that Afghanistan could become a model nation-building exercise has long since been exposed as a neoliberal fantasy. This is not to dismiss the tenacious efforts of British and allied forces on the ground who struggled valiantly, for instance, to bring stability to Helmand province. But they, and the Afghan people, have paid a terrible price for a lack of clarity and candour on the part of the politicians who sent them there. Another delusion \u2013 that Afghan security forces could be trained and equipped to a point where they could, unaided, contain the Taliban and control the country \u2013 has also been shattered. Despite Nato\u2019s best efforts, 30 to 40 Afghan soldiers and police were being killed each day last autumn. About 45,000 Afghan soldiers have died since 2014. This increase in mortality mirrors the decrease in western troop numbers since the 2011 peak. Despite massive diplomatic and developmental assistance, the Afghan government holds limited sway beyond the barricaded safe zones of central Kabul. The Taliban refuse to allow it to participate in withdrawal talks, dismissing it as a mere puppet. The implications, once the Americans have gone, are ominous. A rapid descent into civil war, involving government forces, jihadist groups and rival warlords, in a rerun of not-forgotten 1990s anarchy, is a strong possibility. Last year saw record civilian deaths, caused by terror bombings, intensified fighting and increased US airstrikes. Coming years may prove yet more deadly. Even if the worst is avoided, Afghan civil society organisations and education, public health and women\u2019s rights advocates rightly dread the inclusion of Taliban Sunni fundamentalists in any postwar political settlement. Despite assurances to the contrary, the prospective return of Taliban hardliners to positions of influence presages a new dark age of regression, discrimination and bigotry. And how long will any pretence of democratic government persist? As in the past, Afghanistan could quickly revert to a Great Game free-for-all involving Pakistan, India, Russia, Iran \u2013 and now China, too. In sum, the Americans are leaving an unholy mess that they, more than any other individual actor, helped create. From a narrow US viewpoint, there are still plenty of reasons for quitting while they\u2019re behind. Donald Trump campaigned against \u201cendless wars\u201d, and recently decided to halve the current US force of 14,000. Most voters want the troops out. Billions of dollars have been expended to no lasting effect, while millions more have been lost to corruption. In the absence of any post-9/11 foreign terrorist attacks on US soil, Bush\u2019s old claim that fighting terror abroad avoids the need to fight it at home carries diminishing weight. In a significant shift, the New York Times which, like all major US media, supported the 2001 invasion, called this week for the troops to come home \u2013 and eviscerated the overall US approach to fighting terror. Far from eradicating international terrorism as Bush pledged, the \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d was in large part responsible for the worldwide growth since 2001 of Islamist-inspired terrorist groups, the paper\u2019s editorial noted. Put this another way. The British-supported US global war on terror, which has claimed about half a million lives, been waged across 80 nations, corroded respect for human rights and international law, and cost an estimated $5.9tn, was, from the outset, a catastrophic mistake based on a false premise, aggravated by self-righteous arrogance and an unforgivable ignorance of the world beyond America\u2019s shores. At long last, reality dawns! Yet wait. Is this a lesson the US leviathan in all its many guises can now safely be assumed to have learned? Not really. Trump\u2019s announcement this week that he plans to redeploy troops and air power from Syria to neighbouring Iraq, in order to \u201ckeep watch\u201d on Iran, is the latest clue to Washington\u2019s next Middle East war of choice. US intelligence chiefs told Trump last week that Iran was not a pressing concern, noting that it continued (unlike the US) to honour the 2015 nuclear pact. But Trump and his gang of ideologues and know-nothings, egged on by Israel and the Saudis, persist in mendaciously characterising the Tehran regime as the \u201cworld\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror\u201d, and a direct threat to US national security. That is what they said about Saddam Hussein. In Washington speak, it\u2019s a casus belli. Perhaps there is something in the nature and psyche of the ever-embattled American republic that means it needs monstrous foreign enemies \u2013 hateful bogeymen such as Saddam, Manuel Noriega, Muammar Gaddafi, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro or Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2013 in order to sustain its own founding myths. King George, the original \u201ctyrant\u201d, was vanquished by force of arms, and they have never forgotten it. It\u2019s a mindset that has to change. Instead of threatening to begin a new war with Iran, US leaders should be trying much harder to end the old one in Afghanistan in a responsible, sustainable, humane manner. Don\u2019t just scuttle away. The US should work with all elements of Afghan society, including Taliban moderates \u2013 in a civilian, not military, capacity \u2013 to reconstruct the country the war destroyed. After 17 or so years of ultimately pointless,criminal mayhem, an apology plus reparations to the Afghan people would be a good start. \u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator",

Our choice is actually about <em>how</em> we will transition to clean energy.</p> <p>We have already failed to stop climate change, we now need to manage the effects and prevent it from getting worse. The path we take to renewables could be slow, bumpy, costly and unjust. Or it could be a rare chance to make our electricity system fair again, but only if we act fast.</p> <h2><strong>The inevitable transition</strong></h2> <p>The good news is the transition to clean energy is now inevitable. It is happening and will continue and ultimately we will move to a system powered by renewable energy and storage.</p> <p>This long-term trajectory is now locked-in because the economics of energy are such that it is now <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/News/News-releases/2018/Annual-update-finds-renewables-are-cheapest-new-build-power\">cheaper to build solar and wind</a>, backed-up by batteries or pumped-hydro than to build a new coal, gas or nuclear power station. That means that when Australia\u2019s 19 operating coal power stations close they will be replaced with clean energy solutions.</p> <p>Because Australia has some of the best renewable resources in the world, forward looking business people such as <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrystanpaul/2018/03/21/why-sanjeev-gupta-may-just-be-the-worlds-most-ambitious-industrialist/\">Sanjeev Gupta</a> are seeing the long-term economic opportunity of clean energy in Australia and are working to speed it up. And businesses aren\u2019t the only ones \u2013 more than two million Australian households and businesses have installed rooftop solar and this trend is set to continue.</p> <p>The bad news is, that while Australia will move to clean, renewable energy in the long run, there is no guarantee that it will happen fast enough or in a way that doesn\u2019t entrench existing inequality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/australia-could-hit-100-renewables-much-sooner-than-most-people-think\">Australia could hit 100% renewables sooner than most people think | Nicky Ison</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>A fast transition</strong></h2> <p>Analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that if the world is to have a hope of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees, countries like Australia must move beyond coal by 2030. That means that just waiting for coal power plants to naturally retire and be replaced with cleaner alternatives will take too long.</p> <p>Burning coal for longer means more floods, more droughts, more record-breaking heatwaves, more coral bleaching, more heat-related deaths and the list goes on.</p> <p>The great news \u2013 a faster transition to clean energy is entirely possible. Australia is in the midst of a renewables boom, we are building 6GWs of renewables and storage this year. If we can keep this rate going, we can move beyond coal generation for electricity by 2032 according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/08/australia-can-meet-its-paris-targets-if-government-doesnt-hinder-progress\">analysis by ANU</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, what their analysis doesn\u2019t state is that to keep building renewables at the current rate for the next decade, will require the removal of a <a href=\"https://reneweconomy.com.au/is-australia-still-on-the-solar-coaster-78486/\">number of significant barriers</a>. Specifically, speeding up the timeframes for upgrading our transmission infrastructure (big poles and wires) and putting in place more ambitious policy support than either the ALP or Coalition currently has on the table.</p> <p>The current plans by the federal energy minister Angus Taylor to use taxpayer funds to support a new coal power station is just one example of Australia choosing the slow and costly path to clean energy. These efforts are tantamount to Taylor standing in front of the Townsville dam last week, trying to keep the floodgates closed. With <a href=\"https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-05/what-is-causing-record-rainfall-and-floods-in-townsville/10779032?pfmredir=sm\">a year\u2019s worth of rain falling in nine days</a>, the flooding of Townsville was unfortunately inevitable, the water was going to come over the spillway whether we liked it or not. Keeping the floodgates closed any longer would have just made the flooding worse and damaged the dam in the process.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s plans to support a new coal power station, delays the inevitable transition to clean energy. However, it damages the climate, investor confidence, Australia\u2019s international reputation, will cost taxpayers billions of dollars in the process.</p> <p>While Labor is no doubt better than the Coalition on climate, even the ALP\u2019s plans do little to put us on the right path.</p> <p>Indeed, everyone from the <a href=\"https://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Planning-and-forecasting/Integrated-System-Plan\">market operator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.laborsclimatechangeactionplan.org.au/\">to the ALP</a> are developing plans that are slower than the science says is necessary and what current industry growth shows is possible.</p> <p>Current industry and ALP plans only get only half of the job done by 2030. This is not good enough and it comes at a cost. Analysis of the ALP\u2019s 50% renewables target by 2030 shows that the rate of renewables deployment would drop by 65% from current rates. That means <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/news/australia-on-track-for-50pc-renewables-by-2030-20181128-h18g3m\">a 75% reduction in renewable jobs between 2020 and 2030</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/tony-abbott-played-us-for-a-fool-on-electricity-prices-will-we-be-played-agaib\">Tony Abbott played us for fools on electricity prices. Will we be played again? | Nicky Ison</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>A fair transition</strong></h2> <p>As we move to replace coal power stations with renewables and storage, there is no guarantee that we will look after the people most affected. The owners of Hazelwood gave their workers a mere five months warning that they would be out of a job. Meanwhile AGL which owns Liddell coal power station gave its workers a five-year warning, only to be subject to a scare campaign by the Federal Government, discouraging actions to drive a fairer transition.</p> <p>While more than six million Australians enjoy the opportunity to lower their carbon pollution and electricity bills through rooftop solar, the most vulnerable low-income renters are not able to enjoy the same benefits.</p> <p>Then there are the people most affected by climate change, be they Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory battling fracking or households in Western Sydney suffering from intense urban heat islands.</p> <p>There are practical and popular policy solutions to all these injustices \u2013 from the ALP\u2019s proposed Just Transition Agency, to a new Solar for All rebate idea, to banning fracking and planting trees and upgrading building standards. We know what to do, we merely need our political leaders to get on with it.</p> <p>A fairer pathway is also faster. A fair energy transition involves everyone in the task be they the 30% of households locked out of solar or Australia\u2019s coal communities and helps to remove opposition in the process.</p> <p>In the transition to renewables, people as well as the environment matter.</p> <p>For those of us who care deeply for this planet we call Earth and all that live on it, our job is clear: to ensure Australia and all other countries around the world choose the faster and fairer path to a clean energy future.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicky Ison is the founding director of the Community Power Agency and research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney. </p></li> </ul>",

This long-term trajectory is now locked-in because the economics of energy are such that it is now cheaper to build solar and wind, backed-up by batteries or pumped-hydro than to build a new coal, gas or nuclear power station. That means that when Australia\u2019s 19 operating coal power stations close they will be replaced with clean energy solutions. Because Australia has some of the best renewable resources in the world, forward looking business people such as Sanjeev Gupta are seeing the long-term economic opportunity of clean energy in Australia and are working to speed it up. And businesses aren\u2019t the only ones \u2013 more than two million Australian households and businesses have installed rooftop solar and this trend is set to continue. The bad news is, that while Australia will move to clean, renewable energy in the long run, there is no guarantee that it will happen fast enough or in a way that doesn\u2019t entrench existing inequality. A fast transition Analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that if the world is to have a hope of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees, countries like Australia must move beyond coal by 2030. That means that just waiting for coal power plants to naturally retire and be replaced with cleaner alternatives will take too long. Burning coal for longer means more floods, more droughts, more record-breaking heatwaves, more coral bleaching, more heat-related deaths and the list goes on. The great news \u2013 a faster transition to clean energy is entirely possible. Australia is in the midst of a renewables boom, we are building 6GWs of renewables and storage this year. If we can keep this rate going, we can move beyond coal generation for electricity by 2032 according to analysis by ANU. Unfortunately, what their analysis doesn\u2019t state is that to keep building renewables at the current rate for the next decade, will require the removal of a number of significant barriers. Specifically, speeding up the timeframes for upgrading our transmission infrastructure (big poles and wires) and putting in place more ambitious policy support than either the ALP or Coalition currently has on the table. The current plans by the federal energy minister Angus Taylor to use taxpayer funds to support a new coal power station is just one example of Australia choosing the slow and costly path to clean energy. These efforts are tantamount to Taylor standing in front of the Townsville dam last week, trying to keep the floodgates closed. With a year\u2019s worth of rain falling in nine days, the flooding of Townsville was unfortunately inevitable, the water was going to come over the spillway whether we liked it or not. Keeping the floodgates closed any longer would have just made the flooding worse and damaged the dam in the process. Taylor\u2019s plans to support a new coal power station, delays the inevitable transition to clean energy. However, it damages the climate, investor confidence, Australia\u2019s international reputation, will cost taxpayers billions of dollars in the process. While Labor is no doubt better than the Coalition on climate, even the ALP\u2019s plans do little to put us on the right path. Indeed, everyone from the market operator, to the ALP are developing plans that are slower than the science says is necessary and what current industry growth shows is possible. Current industry and ALP plans only get only half of the job done by 2030. This is not good enough and it comes at a cost. Analysis of the ALP\u2019s 50% renewables target by 2030 shows that the rate of renewables deployment would drop by 65% from current rates. That means a 75% reduction in renewable jobs between 2020 and 2030. A fair transition As we move to replace coal power stations with renewables and storage, there is no guarantee that we will look after the people most affected. The owners of Hazelwood gave their workers a mere five months warning that they would be out of a job. Meanwhile AGL which owns Liddell coal power station gave its workers a five-year warning, only to be subject to a scare campaign by the Federal Government, discouraging actions to drive a fairer transition. While more than six million Australians enjoy the opportunity to lower their carbon pollution and electricity bills through rooftop solar, the most vulnerable low-income renters are not able to enjoy the same benefits. Then there are the people most affected by climate change, be they Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory battling fracking or households in Western Sydney suffering from intense urban heat islands. There are practical and popular policy solutions to all these injustices \u2013 from the ALP\u2019s proposed Just Transition Agency, to a new Solar for All rebate idea, to banning fracking and planting trees and upgrading building standards. We know what to do, we merely need our political leaders to get on with it. A fairer pathway is also faster. A fair energy transition involves everyone in the task be they the 30% of households locked out of solar or Australia\u2019s coal communities and helps to remove opposition in the process. In the transition to renewables, people as well as the environment matter. For those of us who care deeply for this planet we call Earth and all that live on it, our job is clear: to ensure Australia and all other countries around the world choose the faster and fairer path to a clean energy future.

Al-Sharara field, 560 miles south of Tripoli, is capable of producing 315,000 barrels of crude a day \u2013 about a third of Libya\u2019s total current output. But it has been closed by the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC) since December when the installation was seized by local tribes demanding the Tripoli government did more to lift the area out of poverty.

No date or venue for the conference has been set by the UN, which is still trying to win an agreement on those attending the meeting and the broad agenda. Haftar forces, already in control of large tracts of Libyan oil including in the \u201coil crescent\u201d in the north, moved south last month in what was billed as an operation to push out terrorists and militias. An LNA spokesman, Lt Gen Ali Suleiman Muhammad claimed on Wednesday that Haftar\u2019s forces had seized al-Shara oil fields largely without a fight, in conjunction with the forces that had previously controlled the field. This was later contradicted by other local reports that suggested five people had been killed and 16 injured in the fighting. The UN-backed Government of National Accord denounced Haftar\u2019s move and said forces loyal to the GNA had travelled south determined to protect the fields from Haftar. If Haftar can capture the southern oil field, he would have a lock on the bulk of Libyan oil production, placing him in a stronger position in any UN-supervised elections due this year.

A rebel group opposed to D\u00e9by said it had been the target of the strikes.

Hill had almost almost lost her voice completely by the time she croaked her way through Doo Wop (That Thing), but this was the moment some of the energy came back too \u2013 and we finally saw the Lauryn Hill we were hoping for. She gave it her all, but her throat was clearly in need of respite. Hill is due on stage in Brisbane on Sunday, before two shows in Melbourne next week. Sending good vibes to her throat between now and then.",

It tells the story of quaint, fictional American community Grover\u2019s Corners between 1901 and 1913.

      "bodyText": "\u201cImagine you\u2019re a Pez dispenser.\u201d A circle of doctors, teachers, undertakers and Perth citizens who\u2019ve never trod the boards before are being led in warm-up exercises at the downstairs rehearsal room of Western Australia\u2019s State Theatre Centre in bustling Northbridge. They\u2019re one week out from their acting debut in the locally-produced centrepiece of this year\u2019s Perth Festival: Black Swan State Theatre Company\u2019s staging of the Pulitzer prize-winning classic Our Town. A bunch of novices having a crack at prestige theatre. No biggie. In rehearsals, attended by Guardian Australia, the community cast of dozens make like Pez dispensers \u2013 standing tall and letting their heads roll back and forth \u2013 while battling stomach butterflies. One of them is Tajinderpal \u201cTJ\u201d Singh. A doctor of 20 years, he has one performance credit to his name: playing a rat in the Pied Piper, in Year 3. In Our Town, he\u2019ll play Dr Gibbs and tonight he\u2019s running lines with Shari Sebbens \u2013 one of only three professional actors in the cast, who starred in the Sapphires. \u201c[Acting\u2019s] harder than the work I do, mate,\u201d he says during a break. \u201cMedicine\u2019s easier. I think I\u2019ll stick to that.\u201d Thornton Wilder\u2019s Our Town was first staged in 1938, with no props or set dressing. It tells the story of quaint, fictional American community Grover\u2019s Corners between 1901 and 1913. During those years seemingly not much of consequence happens \u2013 only for the characters to discover, too late, that much has passed them by indeed. A ghost in the third act asks the fourth-wall-breaking Stage Manager: \u201cDo any human beings ever realise life while they live it?\u201d The Stage Manager replies: \u201cThe saints and poets, maybe.\u201d Now, in Perth, the doctors, teachers and undertakers do too. \u201cMaking these two realities sit side by side \u2013 having the people in the here and now tell a story about \u2018then\u2019 \u2013 meant that we could also make a comment on who we might be as a community, and the rich diversity of a city like Perth,\u201d says director Clare Watson. Watson hasn\u2019t changed a word of Wilder\u2019s script, yet the casting of non-professional actors as their olden-time equivalents, and especially three First Nations actors as the leads (Sebbens, Ian Michael, Abbie-Lee Lewis), alters the context hugely. \u201cTo have a Noongar man [Michael] play the part of the Stage Manager seems both relevant to who we are but also makes us hear some of that text differently,\u201d Watson says. \u201cWe even hear him say words like \u2018treaty\u2019, and suddenly those words have a different meaning to \u2026 an American high school production of this play.\u201d There are about 40 people involved in each production, including a choir, but the cast changes each night \u2013 there are more than 90 locals involved all up. For some of the acting amateurs, this is a lifelong dream come true; for others, it\u2019s an opportunity to overcome a long-held fear. And for a few, it\u2019s just a laugh. The exercises continue: \u201cNow we\u2019re going to blow out like a horse.\u201d The rehearsal space fills with enthusiastic whinnies. Singh says he was inspired to audition for the sake of wider Sikh representation. \u201cIf there\u2019s a Sikh on TV, my kids go berserk: \u2018Dad, dad, there\u2019s a Sikh on the NAB commercial!\u2019\u201d Their excitement about Our Town, however, is notably muted: \u201cAll they say is, \u2018Dad, don\u2019t embarrass us, our friends are coming.\u201d Nick Lawrence, a fly-in/fly-out worker formerly of not-for-profit Transfolk WA, plays Sam Craig \u2013 and the significance of tackling a cisgender role is not lost on him. \u201cIt\u2019s important just for visibility; for people to see there are trans people in everyday jobs doing everyday things,\u201d he says. \u201cOur Town specifically just shows that I\u2019m an everyday person from an everyday sort of job, doing FIFO work like the next bloke, and yet, I\u2019m not quite like the next bloke at all.\u201d \u201cI think all of us secretly believe we\u2019re great actors, but whether that\u2019s true or not, we\u2019ll see,\u201d says Jonathan Paxman, a choir conductor and lecturer in mechatronic engineering. He is taking on the role of Our Town\u2019s black sheep, Simon Stimson. Susie Finch of Purslowe and Chipper Funerals, who plays an undertaker, has more stage experience than most, having studied theatre in high school. (\u201cI actually kissed Heath Ledger in a play,\u201d she says.) She also fronts a cover band by night. Finch believes the theatricality of burial rites in her day job translates well to the theatre \u2013 but with her 10 lines of dialogue, there\u2019s one significant difference. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk this much as a funeral director.\u201d Though rehearsal is indoors, the play will be staged in the Black Swan courtyard. There will still be no props and no set dressing. Watson is taking inspiration from podcasts \u2013 which ask listeners to imagine an unseen town \u2013 and will equip the audience with headphones to hear the dialogue more intimately.

There is no part of the system that allows for patients to be overseas working, to have deadlines or performances or responsibilities to anything but management of their disability.

It\u2019s the job we can\u2019t get, because having a disability is viewed as an inherent weakness rather than living with it being a demonstration of strength. Narratives like those in Beware of Pity foster the assumption that people with disability are only ever passive participants in other people\u2019s stories, and that our disabilities rule our lives. Many days, the most difficult part of the disease I have is not the pain or stiffness, surgeries, side-effects of medication, or extreme cost; it\u2019s the administration and time it takes to look after myself in a medical system that assumes I don\u2019t have the same kinds of responsibilities to work or family as anyone else. There is no part of the system that allows for patients to be overseas working, to have deadlines or performances or responsibilities to anything but management of their disability. The assumption is that, like Edith, people with disabilities exist only in relation to our disabilities; small lives waiting to recover. Representation matters. In 2017, I travelled the country looking for a young trans man to play a key role in Hir at Belvoir. It took time and money, and it was a risk putting an inexperienced actor on such a well-loved stage. But we couldn\u2019t have made the work without Kurt Pimblett, what he brought to the rehearsal room, and his honest and heartfelt performance. Directors have a responsibility to the people they represent on stage, particularly when representing people from a minority group. This is not a limitation; it makes the work better. Beware of Pity would have been a far more compelling work had people with visible, physical disabilities been on stage. It is heartening to see Sydney festival have recently announced a new disability programming initiative. Because many of us are not only alive, we are thriving. If this was more visible then there would be structures in place to support not only our recovering or our dying, but also our living. \u2022 Anthea Williams is an Australian theatre director and dramaturg",

C.\u2014Congress, the press, the White House, the ambassadorial class, the lobbying world\u2014have been blown up by the Trumps. Two of the biggest annual nights in Washington, the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner and the Kennedy Center Honors, revolve around the president\u2019s participation. In 2017, several reporters (I was one of them) publicly suggested that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to toast a president who was vilifying us. Trump preemptively responded to the nascent revolt by announcing he wouldn\u2019t come anyway. </p> <p>The same year, when some Kennedy honorees said they would boycott a White House reception, Trump canceled the event and refused to attend the gala at the Kennedy Center. Both weekends are now much more low-key affairs. In December, Trump called off the annual White House holiday party for the press. Fox News, which broke the story, pointed out that even Bill Clinton had hosted the event and posed for endless pictures just days after he was impeached in 1998.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c5c9e3de4b042feedcb9689\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-07T21:09:27.819Z\">9.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>New surveillance video of Roger Stone\u2019s arrest has just been released.

Here\u2019s what happened Thursday evening: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos alleged that the owner of the National Enquirer threatened to post nude photos of him if he didn\u2019t stop an investigation into how the tabloid got his \u201cintimate text messages\u201d a few weeks ago. Read more here, from my colleague Sam Levin: Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker is still expected to appear before the House Judiciary Committee tomorrow, after insisting he\u2019d only answer questions if the House Democrats, who are newly in charge, pledge not to use their subpoena power. Chairman Nadler responded that Whitaker would only get a subpoena if he failed to give them answers. The New York Times broke a story that the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in statements a year before the journalist was killed. See you tomorrow! According to the Associated Press, the United Nations human rights office has called out the US for force-feeding immigrant detainees, who are on hunger strike in Texas, saying it might be a violation of the Convention Against Torture. The statement followed pushback from 14 Democrats who sent a letter to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement today, describing how one 22-year-old asylum seeker \u201cwas dragged from his cell three times a day and strapped down on the bed as a group of people poured liquid into tubes inserted into his nose\u201d. From the AP: Hunger strikes are relatively uncommon inside ICE detention. Last month, ICE began non-consensual feeding and hydration of numerous El Paso detainees after a federal judge issued a court order allowing them to be force-fed against their will. \u2018ICE is committed to preserving the lives of those in its custody and maintaining orderly detention facility operations,\u2019 the agency said Thursday in response to the U.N.\u2019s statement. \u2018For their health and safety, ICE closely monitors the food and water intake of those detainees identified as being on a hunger strike. Medical staff constantly monitor detainees to evaluate whether the hunger strike poses a risk to the detainee\u2019s life or permanent health\u2019\u201d. Amazon billionaire and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is accusing the publisher of the National Enquirer of blackmail, alleging that the tabloid made threats to publish more of his photos unless he stop an investigation into how they got the photos and intimate texts during his high-profile divorce. After Bezos hired Gavin de Becker, a private security consultant, David Pecker, AMI\u2019s chief executive and a close Trump ally was allegedly \u201capoplectic\u201d, which prompted the emailed threats describing photos the National Enquirer could still release. From my colleague Sam Levin: The email, which Bezos published in full, with redactions of personal information, went on to say that the Enquirer had obtained a \u201cbelow the belt selfie \u2014 otherwise colloquially known as a \u2018d*ck pick\u2019\u201d as well as nine other images. Those included a selfie, a shirtless photo of him holding his phone \u201cwhile wearing his wedding ring\u201d, a \u201cfull-length body selfie\u201d of him in his underwear, and photos and messages from Laura Sanchez, a former TV anchor. \u2018It would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail \u2014 and quickly,\u2019 Howard allegedly wrote.In his blogpost Bezos explained his decision to publish the emails, writing, \u2018Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there\u2019s a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u2019\u201d Pecker is also part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, after playing a role in helping Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen pay off former Playboy model Karen McDougal, in order to stop her from releasing details about her affair with Trump during his campaign in 2016. Pecker paid $150,000 as part of a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d scheme that gave his publication the sole rights to the story. Here is a long profile on Pecker and his relationship with the President from Guardian reporter Lucia Graves: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has accused the owner of the National Enquirer of \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d in an extraordinary blogpost alleging that the tabloid threatened to public nude images of him. The world\u2019s richest man, who also owns the Washington Post, published a lengthy Medium post on Thursday, accusing American Media Inc (AMI), which publishes the National Enquirer, of telling him \u201cthey had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn\u2019t stop our investigation\u201d. Bezos, who recently became the subject of tabloid fodder after he and his wife announced they were divorcing, wrote that he had \u201cengaged investigators\u201d after the National Enquirer published his \u201cintimate text messages\u201d a few weeks ago. He said he was seeking \u201cto determine the motives for the many unusual actions taken by the Enquirer\u201d. More to come. Jared Kushner is heading to the Middle East this month, Politico reports, to plug his new peace plan. While details have not been released, the plan is expected to include economic proposals aimed to bring incentives and opportunities for Palestinians, which have been in the works for the past two years. He will spend a week at the end of February in Oman, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, joined by officials from Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy and the State Department. Per Politico: \u2018Part of this is intended to show they\u2019re really serious about presenting something\u2019 said Dennis Ross, a veteran peace process negotiator. \u2018I think the key is going to be Arab leaders being persuaded that the overall deal \u2014 not just the economic side but the political side \u2014 looks credible to them\u2019. The incentives would have to overcome Palestinian hostility to Trump\u2019s overtures, particularly since the Trump administration last year moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which the Palestinians do not recognize as Israel\u2019s capital. The White House also evicted the Palestine Liberation Authority from its offices in Washington, D.C., last year as retribution for the Palestinians\u2019 refusal to enter into direct talks with the Israelis\u201d. The New York Times is reporting that American intelligence agencies have evidence that Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman played a key role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and had voiced plans a year before the grisly killing took place. Per the New York Times: The Saudi government has denied that the young crown prince played any role in the killing, and President Trump has publicly shown little interest in trying get the facts about who was responsible. Prince Mohammed, the next in line to the Saudi throne behind his ailing father, King Salman, has become the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia and a close ally of the Trump White House \u2014 especially Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser\u201d. The White House has also weighed in on the Whitaker situation, framing Chairman Nadler\u2019s inquiry as a political ploy. \u201cThe fact Chairman Nadler would try to force the public disclosure of private conversations that he knows are protected by law proves he only wants to play politics. The Chairman should focus on helping the American people, rather than wasting time playing pointless political games\u201d, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. For more context about what this spat is all about, here\u2019s a good explainer from Vox: On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee authorized a subpoena for Whitaker, which Chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) said he would use only if Whitaker refused to answer the committee\u2019s questions. But Whitaker fired back, saying through a letter from the Justice Department that he would not testify at all if the committee issued a subpoena. The DOJ demanded a response, in writing, by 6 pm Thursday... But Democrats still want to find out how \u2014 and why \u2014 Whitaker was appointed, and what conversations he\u2019s had with the White House before and during his time as acting attorney general about the Mueller investigation. And they\u2019re clearly prepared to use subpoena power if Whitaker doesn\u2019t cooperate\u201d. Representative Jerry Nadler, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has issued a response to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker who refused to come to an oversight hearing scheduled tomorrow, unless he is guaranteed he won\u2019t face a subpoena. \u201cIf you appear before the Committee tomorrow morning and it fyou are prepared to respond to questions from our Members, then I assure you that there will be no need for the Committee to issue a subpoena on or before February 8\u201d Nadler wrote. The Department of Justice has not yet responded to the letter. Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Ben Jacobs for the afternoon. The Associated Press writes that a newly unsealed court transcript in Paul Manafort\u2019s criminal case reveals details about an August 2016 meeting at the \u201cheart\u201d of the Russia investigation: A prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller says the meeting between Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik goes to the \u201clarger view of what we think is going on\u201d and what \u201cwe think the motive here is\u201d. Previous court documents have revealed that one of the topics discussed by Manafort and Kilimnik was a possible peace plan to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Crimea. The comments came during a hearing over whether Manafort lied to investigators and violated the terms of his plea agreement. Many details from the transcript are blacked out\u201d. Emily Holden and Lauren Gambino report from DC: The Green New Deal pioneers on Capitol Hill insist they have support for the radical plan from Democratic leadership, despite comments from House Leader Nancy Pelosi calling it the \u201cgreen dream\u201d and noting that the sweeping plan is just one of many proposals for combating climate change. The resolution unveiled by New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts senator Ed Markey this morning has at least 60 co-sponsors in the House and around a dozen in the Senate, according to the authors. No Republicans are on board. Supporters include a handful of presidential contenders, including Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. Lawmakers were still signing on today. The plan calls for fighting inequity with a huge investment in cleaner energy and aims for a carbon-neutral economy within 10 years. Asked at a crowded press conference about Pelosi\u2019s comments that the resolution is a \u201cgreen dream,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said it \u201cis a green dream,\u201d because it is so ambitious. Markey called Pelosi an original climate change champion. The speaker later said she was \u201cvery excited\u201d about a Green New Deal and welcomed \u201call the enthusiasm\u201d surrounding the proposal. Pelosi has named members of a climate change select committee, and Ocasio-Cortez is not one of them, but she said that was by the freshman lawmaker\u2019s choice. Ocasio-Cortez said the committee will investigate, while lawmakers on other panels will work on legislative solutions. The US over time has contributed more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than any other nation, and Ocasio-Cortez said it is obligated to lead on climate change. Senator John Barrasso, a Republican of Wyoming, called the plan a \u201csocialist manifesto\u201d that would \u201ctake our growing economy off the cliff and our nation into bankruptcy\u201d. The official response from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was simply: \u201cLOL.\u201d For more about the Green New Deal: Virginia had yet another top politician in a blackface scandal when it was revealed that the state senate majority leader edited a yearbook with blackface pictures The outlines of the much touted \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d were introduced on Capitol Hill today by a number of Democrats including freshman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez The nomination of William Barr to be Attorney General was advanced by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party line vote. The Federal Election Commission announced today that the maximum contribution an individual could make to a candidate for federal office per election is now $2800, up from $2700 in the 2018 election cycle. This means the individual maximum for both a primary and general combined is $5600. The Wall Street Journal reports that the United States has set an end of April deadline to pull all American forces out of Syria. The planned withdrawal comes months after Trump announced his intention to pull out of Syria, which prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis. Per the WSJ: With U.S.-backed fighters poised to seize the final Syrian sanctuaries held by Islamic State in the coming days, the U.S. military is turning its attention toward a withdrawal of American forces in the coming weeks, these officials said on Thursday. Unless the Trump administration alters course, the military plans to pull a significant portion of its forces out by mid-March, with a full withdrawal coming by the end of April, they said. The military-planning process comes as the Trump administration is struggling to come up with an agreement to protect Kurdish allies from being attacked by Turkish forces when the U.S. leaves. Not just politics but cocktail parties have been turned upside because of Donald Trump. His arrival in Washington has shaken up the elite social scene that defined \u201cThis Town. Ryan Lizza in Esquire reports: Meanwhile, the widely attended major events that once lubricated relations between various strata of official D. C.\u2014Congress, the press, the White House, the ambassadorial class, the lobbying world\u2014have been blown up by the Trumps. Two of the biggest annual nights in Washington, the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner and the Kennedy Center Honors, revolve around the president\u2019s participation. In 2017, several reporters (I was one of them) publicly suggested that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to toast a president who was vilifying us. Trump preemptively responded to the nascent revolt by announcing he wouldn\u2019t come anyway. The same year, when some Kennedy honorees said they would boycott a White House reception, Trump canceled the event and refused to attend the gala at the Kennedy Center. Both weekends are now much more low-key affairs. In December, Trump called off the annual White House holiday party for the press. Fox News, which broke the story, pointed out that even Bill Clinton had hosted the event and posed for endless pictures just days after he was impeached in 1998. New surveillance video of Roger Stone\u2019s arrest has just been released. And Stone, known for his strong views on fashion, is wearing a unique outfit; a shirt that says \u201cRoger Stone did nothing wrong.\u201d Kamala Harris has just unveiled a raft of endorsements in her home state of California. The 2020 Democratic presidential contender announced the endorsement of President Pro Tem of the State Senate, Toni Atkins and endorsement from 19 other of the 28 Democrats in the California state senate. She now has the support of 21 of the 28 Democrats in her home state\u2019s upper chamber and has solidified her claim to be the favorite daughter of the state. Jaime Harrison, the former chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, has officially started an exploratory committee to mount a Senate race against three-term Republican Lindsay Graham. Harrison faces an uphill battle in a state that Trump won by a margin of 55%-40%. The next head of a State Department counter propaganda effort will be a former Fox News reporter. CNN reports that Lea Gabrielle has been tapped to be the next special envoy and coordinator of the Global Engagement Center. According to CNN: Gabrielle was a general assignment reporter for \u201cShepard Smith Reporting,\u201d according to her Fox News biography, and was previously a military reporter. A friend of Gabrielle\u2019s told CNN in September that she was leaving Fox News and moving to Washington, DC. Gabrielle is a United States Naval Academy graduate and served in the US Navy as fighter pilot for more than a decade, as well as taking part in some intelligence operations. She has said that her time in the Navy made her a better reporter. \u201cI know how important it is that those who wear combat boots have their voices heard and their perspectives understood in news reporting,\u201d Gabrielle said during a 2016 interview with fightersweep.com. \u201cMy goal as I report on military topics is always to honor them ... by getting it right.\u201d Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation is due to come out with a statement in support of state attorney general Mark Herring, who admitted earlier this week to appearing in blackface at a college party when he was 19-years-old. The state has been in crisis with all three of its top statewide elected official facing scandal, two of them blackface-related. Although Virginia is still consumed with ongoing series of political scandals, Florida is still doing its best to be just as dysfunctional. Nancy Oakley, a city commissioner in Madeira Beach, resigned earlier this week after an ethics complaint was upheld that she had a \u201chabit of licking men that either she was attracted to or thought that she had authority over.\u201d Elizabeth Warren has made another tranche of key hires in Iowa ahead of her expected announcement on Saturday. The most notable is Jason Noble, the former chief politics reporter at the Des Moines Register to be her communications director. Noble had previously worked for Let America Vote, the voting rights non-profit led by former Missouri secretary of state Jason Kander. Vice President Mike Pence will visit the Port of Baltimore on Friday. It is one of the biggest ports in the country and will represent a rare visit by top Trump administration official to a major urban area. Trump had canceled a scheduled visit to Baltimore last month during the partial government shutdown. In light of the ongoing series of scandals in Virginia surrounding blackface, it\u2019s worth noting that only 58% of Americans find it \u201cunacceptable\u201d to wear blackface. As the Washington Post reports: The poll, conducted Saturday through Tuesday by the firm YouGov, asked respondents: \u201cIs it acceptable or unacceptable for a White person to wear blackface make up?\u201d Although 58 percent said \u201cunacceptable,\u201d 16 percent said \u201cacceptable\u201d and 26 percent said that they were not sure. In other words, 42 percent of Americans either endorse blackface or do not have a clear opinion on it. Perhaps, though, this finding isn\u2019t that surprising. Earlier YouGov polls also revealed tolerance for blackface. A 2013 poll found 43 percent said it was acceptable for white people to wear blackface to dress up as a black person for Halloween. Only 37 percent opposed this. A 2015 poll found slightly more support for blackface costumes: 47 percent said it was acceptable. A Customs and Border Protection officer has been charged with illegally selling guns, the Los Angeles Times reports. Wei Xu, a CBP watch commander, used his status as a law enforcement officer to buy handguns not available to the public and then sold them, authorities say. He was charged with selling or transferring at least 70 guns since 2014 without a license. Senator John Barrasso, a Republican of Wyoming, called the Green New Deal plan released today a \u201csocialist manifesto\u201d that would \u201ctake our growing economy off the cliff and our nation into bankruptcy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the first step down a dark path to socialism.\u201d he warned in a statement. The official response from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was simply \u201cLOL\u201d, which is internet slang stands for \u201claughing out loud\u201d. A link in the statement directed viewers to a gif of actor Ryan Gosling laughing. In statements targeting moderate and swing state Democrats, Republicans dismissed the plan as \u201cridiculous\u201d and asked whether this meant the Democrats supported banning air travel and eliminating all jobs in the energy industry. The NAACP is urging the Senate judiciary committee to reject judicial nominees who refused to say that Brown v Board of Education, the landmark supreme court case that ended segregation in schools, was rightly decided. Georgia representative Rob Woodall will not seek re-election, per the Atlanta Journal Constitution. It\u2019s a seat likely to be targeted by Democrats. Another Virginia politician is in hot water over racist content in a yearbook. State senate majority leader Tommy Norment oversaw a yearbook at the Virginia Military Institute in 1968 that contains a host of racist photos and slurs, the Virginian-Pilot reports. They include photos of people wearing blackface. Norment, a Republican, was managing editor of the yearbook. It features a photo of a student in blackface at a costume party and another photo of two men in blackface holding a football. It gets worse: the yearbook uses the N-word at least once. It also uses the slurs \u201cChink\u201d and \u201cJap\u201d to refer to a student from Thailand. And another student is described as a \u201cBarracks Jew\u201d for his involvement in classmates\u2019 financial affairs. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer will oppose William Barr\u2019s nomination for attorney general, he says in a speech on the Senate floor. The Green New Deal released today by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a notable omission: it does not contain any mention of legislative or regulatory restrictions on carbon emissions, a CNN reporter notes. More optimism on a border security deal from Senator Richard Shelby after his budget meeting with Donald Trump. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker issued a statement on his threat not to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. The committee \u201chas deviated from historic practice and protocol and taken the unnecessary and premature step of authorizing a subpoena to the me, the Acting Attorney General, even though I had agreed to voluntarily appear,\u201d Whitaker said, according to the Hill. The committee voted earlier Thursday to authorize a subpoena of Whitaker, which could be used to compel him to answer certain questions if he refuses to answer them voluntarily. \u201cSuch unprecedented action breaches our prior agreement and circumvents the constitutionally required accommodation process. Based upon today\u2019s action, it is apparent that the Committee\u2019s true intention is not to discuss the great work of the Department of Justice, but to create a public spectacle. Political theater is not the purpose of an oversight hearing, and I will not allow that to be the case,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cConsistent with longstanding practice, I remain willing to appear to testify tomorrow, provided that the Chairman assures me that the Committee will not issue a subpoena today or tomorrow, and that the Committee will engage in good faith negotiations before taking such a step down the road.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed optimism Thursday over prospects of congressional negotiators hammering out a border security deal before a 15 February deadline, Reuters reports. From Reuters: A bipartisan group of 17 members of the House of Representatives and Senate have been meeting behind closed doors to try to break an impasse over Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7bn this year to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. Pelosi, who says she will not meddle in the negotiations, had held a firm line against any money for building a wall, sparking a stand-off with Trump that resulted in a 35-day partial government shutdown that began on 22 December. In her weekly press conference on Thursday, Pelosi told reporters: \u201cHopefully we will get some good news in a short period of time and certainly in time for the deadline of 15 February.\u201d She did not provide any details what kind of border security measures might be funded in any deal to keep the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies operating through the end of this fiscal year on 30 September. \u201cJust let them do their work,\u201d Pelosi said of the panel appointed to broker a border security funding agreement. Negotiators have talked about a mix of border security tools, such as more law enforcement agents, procuring more high-tech devices to repel illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants from entering the United States and additional physical barriers. A lead negotiator, Senate appropriations committee chairman Richard Shelby, who is a Republican, met at the White House on Thursday morning to talk to Trump about the ongoing negotiations, according to a Senate aide. No further details on that meeting were immediately available. A group of Democratic lawmakers will visit the US-Mexico border this weekend, CNN reports. House majority leader Steny Hoyer will travel Saturday with a group of newly-elected congresswomen to Texas and New Mexico, where they will meet with US Customs and Border Protection and immigration advocates. \u201cDespite the president\u2019s demagoguery over immigration, there is not a national emergency or a security crisis at the border that demands a wall,\u201d Hoyer said Thursday, according to CNN. The trip comes as Democrats and Republicans are trying to work out a border security deal before government funding expires next week. The Justice Department is saying that acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker will not testify before the House Judiciary Committee Friday unless he is assured he will not be subpoenaed to answer questions, according to journalist Shimon Prokupecz. Earlier Thursday, the Judiciary Committee voted to authorize a subpoena of Whitaker. Committee chair Jerry Nadler says he hopes not to have to actually use the subpoena, but will do so if Whitaker refuses to answer certain questions about his conversations with the White House about the Russia investigation. Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general has been approved by the Senate judiciary committee. The committee voted 12-10 along party lines to approve the nomination of William Barr, Politico reports. The full Senate could vote later this month. Senator Doug Jones said Thursday that he would vote for the nomination, becoming the first Democrat to do so, according to the Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Thursday that Democrats will pursue Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. \u201cI think overwhelmingly the public wants to see the president\u2019s tax returns,\u201d Pelosi said at a press conference when asked if she thinks it\u2019s important for Congress to obtain the documents, the Hill reported. \u201cThey want to know the truth. They want to know the facts. And he has nothing to hide.\u201d But Pelosi added Democrats have to be \u201cvery, very careful\u201d in pursuing the taxes. The law gives the House the power to obtain any citizen\u2019s tax returns from the IRS, but making them public may be a more complicated matter. A vast majority of Americans want special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s full Russia investigation report to be made public, according to a new poll. In the CNN poll, 87% of respondents said investigators should produce a full public report. Meanwhile, 48% said they believe Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to help get him elected, while 42% said there was no collusion. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services opposed the policy of separating immigrant children from their parents, a top official there told Congress Thursday. \u201cI do not believe that separation of children from their parents is in the best interest of the child,\u201d Commander Jonathan White told a House oversight subcommittee, CNN reported. \u201cNeither I nor any career person in (the Office of Refugee Resettlement) would ever have supported such a policy proposal.\u201d The refugee resettlement office within HHS is responsible for running shelters to care for immigrant children who cross the border on their own or are separated from their parents. The Trump administration put in place a since-reversed zero tolerance policy which called for adults to be prosecuted for crossing the border illegally, requiring them to be separated from their children. The kids were then put in care of HHS. The comments came at an oversight hearing on the child separation policy. HHS Secretary Alex Azar refused to testify, according to CNN. Senator Kamala Harris called the sexual assault allegations against Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor \u201ccredible\u201d and called for an investigation Thursday. \u201cI think there should be an investigation to determine what happened,\u201d Harris said of the allegations against Justin Fairfax, Politico reports. \u201cCertainly her letter reads \u2014 it\u2019s quite detailed \u2014 and suggests that there\u2019s credibility there. But there needs to be an investigation to determine what exactly happened,\u201d said the California senator and presidential candidate. The House of Representatives kicked off hearings Thursday on the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. Democrats at the hearing blasted the policy, Politico reports. \u201cThere is no evidence that [Department of Health and Human Services] leaders ever tried to stop this abhorrent policy,\u201d said Rep. Diana DeGette, chair of the Energy and Commerce\u2019s oversight subcommittee. \u201cAs the agency dedicated to the health and welfare of children, we need to know why.\u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois called the administration\u2019s actions \u201cstate-sponsored child abuse and, I would go as far to say, kidnapping of children,\u201d according to BuzzFeed. Nearly two weeks after the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S history, many federal workers still have not received their back pay or have only gotten a fraction of what they are owed as government agencies struggle with payroll glitches and other delays, the Associated Press reports. From AP: And even as they scramble to catch up on unpaid bills and to repay unemployment benefits, the prospect of another shutdown looms next week. \u201cPresident Trump stood in the Rose Garden at the end of the shutdown and said, \u2018We will make sure that you guys are paid immediately.\u2019 ... And here it is, it\u2019s almost two weeks later,\u201d said Michael Walter, who works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture food safety inspection service in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and only got his paycheck Wednesday. He said two co-workers told him they still had received nothing. The government has been short on details about how many people are still waiting to be paid. Bradley Bishop, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said the Trump administration had taken \u201cunprecedented steps to ensure federal employees impacted by the shutdown received back pay within a week.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond to questions about how many people still hadn\u2019t been paid. Senate Appropriations committee chair Richard Shelby briefed Donald Trump on the state of border security negotiations Thursday, and there appears to be some hope for a deal. Democrats and Republicans have been trading offers back and forth, and any deal will likely include new money for border security technology and possibly new fencing, Politico reports. The wild card remains Donald Trump, and whether he\u2019ll be willing to accept a deal that doesn\u2019t give him the $5 billion he wants to build a border wall. \u201cEverybody is feeling increasingly upbeat about the possibility of getting a deal. The question is whether it\u2019s something the president can sign,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows the answer to that.\u201d Negotiators are hoping to strike a deal by Sunday night. The three week funding bill that the parties agreed to to end the government shutdown expires on Feb. 15. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for a ban on late-term abortions is unlikely to prevail in Congress, but Republican legislators in several states are pushing ahead with their own tough anti-abortion bills that they hope can pass muster with the Supreme Court, the Associated Press reports. From AP: Two bills proposing to outlaw abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, advanced out of House and Senate committees in the Mississippi Legislature this week. GOP Gov. Phil Bryant is pledging to sign either into law. Efforts to pass similar bills are underway in Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee. In Ohio, former Republican Gov. John Kasich twice vetoed the measure; his successor, Republican Mike DeWine, has said he would sign it. In Tennessee, Republican Gov. Bill Lee and the top two GOP state lawmakers say they support the measure. Iowa passed a heartbeat bill last year that was struck down by a state judge on Jan. 22. In response, many GOP lawmakers are trying to place a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that would stipulate there is no right to abortion in Iowa. South Carolina, in addition to a heartbeat bill, will consider a measure introduced Wednesday that would broadly ban abortions and allow the possibility of criminal charges against individuals who perform them. Trump, in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, cited recent controversies in New York and Virginia over late-term abortions, and urged Congress \u201cto prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in a mother\u2019s womb.\u201d Senator Richard Shelby says he expects there will be a government funding deal over the weekend or on Monday, according to Bloomberg News. First Lady Melania Trump spoke to an anti-drug conference Thursday, saying \u201crecovery is possible.\u201d The Associated Press reports: The first lady traveled to Maryland on Thursday to address the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America\u2019s annual youth leadership forum. Her signature \u201cBe Best\u201d campaign focuses on a number of issues, including the opioid crisis. Mrs. Trump spoke about a former opioid and substance abuse addict who joined her for Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address. The first lady says Ashley Evans received treatment at an Ohio facility, has been in recovery for over a year and looks forward to being reunited with her daughter. Mrs. Trump says Evans\u2019 story shows that \u201crecovery is possible\u201d and that community programs can help make a difference. The first lady was also visiting the Office of National Drug Control Policy for a briefing. Spending on last year\u2019s Congressional elections topped $5.7 billion - a record high. The tally from the Center for Responsive Politics includes spending by candidates, outside groups, parties, and political action committees, CNN reports. The House Judiciary Committee has voted to authorize a subpoena for acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, CNN reports. The vote was 23-13, along party lines with Democrats voting for it and Republicans opposed. Whitaker is set to testify before the committee Friday, and chairman Jerry Nadler says he will use the subpoena if the acting AG refuses to answer questions about his conversations with the White House about the Russia investigation. \u201cTo be clear, this resolution merely authorizes the subpoena. If Mr. Whitaker appears in the hearing room, as scheduled, and if he provides direct answers to our questions, then I have no intention of ever issuing this subpoena. If he does not, then we will have the tools we need to ensure that we may adequately meet our own responsibilities,\u201d Nadler said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWhen we invite officials to testify before this Committee, they have to appear. When we ask them questions, they have to provide us with answers\u2014or provide us with a valid and clearly articulated reason to withhold certain information. Without the threat of a subpoena, I believe it may be difficult to hold Mr. Whitaker to this standard.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is dodging questions about the political crisis in Virginia, saying she has enough to do without getting involved in the state\u2019s affairs. Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin gave a similar non-answer, saying \u201cI don\u2019t live there\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not getting into that,\u201d journalist Matt Laslo reports. Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax has hired the same law firm that represented Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Politico reports. Fairfax, who has been accused of sexual assault, brought on Wilkinson Walsh Eskovitz, which also represented Kavanaugh during confirmation hearings where he battled charges of assault. And his accuser, college professor Vanessa Tyson, hired the firm Katz Marshall and Banks, which also represented Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing in March on the deaths of two children in border patrol custody, its chairman said Thursday. Two lawmakers are demanding information from the National Rifle Association about allegations the powerful gun group violated campaign finance laws. Watchdog groups have alleged that the NRA illegally coordinated with Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The Trace reported that the conservative consulting firm National Media Research and its affiliates executed ad buys for Trump and the NRA that seemed coordinated to enhance each other. In a letter to NRA president Wayne Lapierre, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Jamie Raskin asked for information on the NRA\u2019s relationship with media consulting firms that also worked for the Trump Campaign and other Republican candidates. They also sent letters to five of the media consulting firms. \u201cBecause a payment for a coordinated communication is an in-kind contribution to a candidate, the NRA may have violated contribution limits under the Federal Election Campaign Act by making coordinated communications in excess of applicable contribution caps,\u201d they wrote. Donald Trump in his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast praised his vice president\u2019s wife Karen Pence for her work at a school that bans gay students and staff. \u201cOur incredible second lady Karen Pence and by the way, by the way, I\u2019ve gotten to know Karen so well. She is a Marine Corps mom, a tremendous woman, a proud supporter of military families and she just recently went back to teaching art classes at a Christian school. Thank you. Thank you, Karen,\u201d Trump said at the breakfast, CNN reported. He did not mention the Christian school\u2019s LGBT policies. The Committee to Protect Journalists and other press freedom organizations are holding a press conference outside the White House to demand justice for murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The event comes ahead of a Friday deadline for the Trump administration to deliver a report to the Senate on the journalist\u2019s murder. In the report, the administration is required to say whether they believe Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s murder, and to say whether they will impose sanctions, according to CBS. The Federal Election Commission has issued new contribution limits for the 2020 election cycle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has named members to the new select committee on climate change, but Politico reports they don\u2019t include the highest-profile freshmen like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida will chair the committee, according to the Politico report. The Democratic members are Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (N.M.), Suzanne Bonamici (Ore.), Julia Brownley (Calif.), Sean Casten (Ill.), Jared Huffman (Calif.), Mike Levin (Calif.), Donald McEachin (Va.) and Joe Neguse (Colo.). Sen. Kamala Harris and Rep. Brenda Lawrence have introduced a bill to award Aretha Franklin the Congressional Gold Medal. \u201cAretha\u2019s songs were the soundtrack of my childhood, from listening to \u2018Mary Don\u2019t You Weep,\u2019 to standing in the living room dancing to \u2018Rock Steady\u2019 over and over again, to hearing from the Queen herself how lucky I was to be young, gifted and black,\u201d Harris told the Beat DC. \u201cAretha was simply a legend.\u201d Donald Trump weighed in on abortion in his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, per PBS. The comments come after he proposed a federal ban on late term abortion in his State of the Union speech. He\u2019s trying to reverse laws like on recently passed in New York, which allows abortions after 24 weeks to protect the health of the mother or if the fetus is not viable. Trump also made a verbal slip, saying that many of America\u2019s great accomplishments including the \u201cabolition of civil rights\u201d were driven by people of faith. A scandal centered on the use of blackface is rocking Virginia politics, but a new poll finds that not everyone has a problem with white people wearing blackface. In the YouGov poll, a clear majority - 58% - did say it was unacceptable for a white person to wear blackface makeup. But that leaves 16% who said it was acceptable, and 26% who aren\u2019t sure. 73% of black respondents said it was unacceptable, compared to 57% of whites. There was a clear party divide as well, with 81% of Democrats calling blackface unacceptable, while only 44% of Republicans did. Asked if Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam should resign after a photo from his yearbook page surfaced showing a man wearing KKK robes and another in blackface, 40% said he should, 30% said he should not, and another 30% weren\u2019t sure. Donald Trump claimed in his tweet storm earlier today that the Republican-controlled Congress never investigated President Barack Obama. This is not true. Congress conducted a lengthy probe of the Benghazi attacks, in addition to investigations into allegations of political bias at the IRS and other matters. Read the Washington Post\u2019s fact check here. Donald Trump spoke this morning at the National Prayer Breakfast. \u201cI will never let you down,\u201d he told the religious crowd, according to CBS News. House Democrats will hold their first hearing Thursday morning on a bill that would require presidents to disclose their tax returns, CNN reports. Donald Trump has been the first president in modern history to refuse to release his taxes. The hearing before a House ways and means subcommittee panel will focus on a provision in a broader ethics bill that would require future presidents and presidential candidates to release ten years of tax returns. The bill doesn\u2019t apply to the current occupant of the White House, but Congress also has the power to obtain Trump\u2019s taxes from the IRS. \u201cIf you think this is important, then you should require its release,\u201d Joe Thorndike, executive director of the Tax History Project, who will testify at the hearing, told CNN. \u201cIf you are not prepared to require its release then you don\u2019t really think that it\u2019s very important.\u201d The father of a murdered Parkland student, who clashed with Florida representative Matt Gaetz at a congressional hearing, said Thursday the congressman\u2019s rhetoric was \u201coffensive\u201d. Manuel Oliver shouted out in protest after Gaetz, a Republican, brought up illegal immigration at a hearing on gun violence and said that building a border wall would help prevent murders committed by unauthorized immigrants. Gatez asked for him and another Parkland dad to be removed from the hearing room, but they ended up getting a warning, according to NPR. \u201cDon\u2019t bring the wall as a solution for everything. It\u2019s pretty offensive,\u201d Oliver said Thursday on CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cIf this is how this is going to work, I\u2019ve got to stop this guy. I\u2019ve got to let the whole nation know that he is wrong.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed that there will not be another government shutdown over Donald Trump\u2019s demands for a border wall. \u201cThere will not be another shutdown,\u201d she told Politico. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Pelosi predicted that after a widely unpopular partial government shutdown that lasted 35 days, Republican leaders would not be willing to go along with a shutdown again. \u201cI have a club that I started, it\u2019s called the \u2018Too-Hot-to-Handle Club\u2019. And this is a too-hot-to-handle issue,\u201d she said. A stopgap funding bill that was passed to end the shutdown is set to expire on 15 February. In the interview with Politico, Pelosi also took a shot at Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time on this. This is theatrics, this is not government,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just take this in stride.\u201d As political scandals roil Virginia, Donald Trump charged Thursday that Democrats \u201care killing the Great State of Virginia\u201d. The state\u2019s politics have been in turmoil since a racist photo surfaced on Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s medical school yearbook page. Within days the lieutenant governor was publicly accused of sexual assault, and the attorney general admitted he had also worn blackface while in college. \u201cDemocrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia. If the three failing pols were Republicans, far stronger action would be taken,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cVirginia will come back HOME Republican) in 2020!\u201d Donald Trump is attacking the congressional investigations planned by the new Democratic House majority, calling them \u201cunlimited presidential harassment\u201d. Trump in a series of tweets Thursday morning called the expected congressional investigations a continuation of the \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d he has accused special counsel Robert Mueller of pursuing with the ongoing investigations into Russian election interference, which has resulted in a host of indictments of Trump\u2019s associates. \u201cSo now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so,\u201d he said, referring to the new chair of the House intelligence committee. \u201cNever happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment ... The Dems and their committees are going \u2018nuts.\u2019 The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will on Thursday release her Green New Deal resolution, beginning to put policy specifics behind what became a campaign rallying cry. The six-page proposal calls for a carbon neutral economy within 10 years, and says the federal government should \u201cachieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions\u201d by getting all power from \u201cclean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources\u201d. Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution. It doesn\u2019t stay strictly focused on climate policy, but endorses a host of progressive priorities including universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education.",

Two days later, twin bombings ripped through the Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Jolo, on Sulu island in the south-western tip of Mindanao, killing 23 people attending a Sunday mass and wounding 109 others. In the days between the skirmish and the bloody church attack, Isis issued a bulletin, the first since the fall of Marawi in 2017, which claimed more than 30 soldiers had died in the clashes with Abu Dar\u2019s men \u2013 a claim Brawner says is false \u2013 and issuing what was later interpreted as a warning for the church attack. \u201cLet the worshippers of the Cross and their helpers everywhere know that the Islamic State continues to break their thorn and smash their crosses and idols, and Allah is the granter of success and He is the helper,\u201d said the message translated by the Site Intelligence Group which monitors jihadist activities. The attack came as people in the Muslim-majority south Philippines voted in a historic referendum to create a new autonomous region, which the government hoped would bring peace to a war-torn part of the country and address issues that lure recruits to Isis-inspired groups. According to the military, the church bombing was perpetrated by Indonesian suicide bombers and was planned and executed with the assistance of the Abu Sayyaf group. The Abu Sayyaf group has been responsible for decades of violence, including the 2004 Superferry bombing that killed 116 people, making it south-east Asia\u2019s worst terror attack at the time. It is a highly factionalised group and is divided over its views on Isis, but sub-commanders like the late Isis emir Isnilon Hapilon reached out to develop ties. The Sulu attack created a frenzy in the Isis propaganda machine, with the group publishing a photograph edited to show President Rodrigo Duterte as an Isis captive in the wake of his threats against the group. Duterte has said: \u201cThe only way to fight them is to become evil also.\u201d Rommel Banlaoi of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism said the Jolo church attack underscored the growing security challenge for the country, at the hands of foreign fighters, citing the blast in Lamitan City by a suspected suicide bomber from Morocco in July 2018. \u201cIsis is a clear and present danger to the Philippines being a new land of jihad by foreign fighters,\u201d he said. The challenge is underscored by the presence of about 100 foreign fighters in Mindanao, influencing local armed groups. Lieutenant General Arnel Dela Vega, overall commander of areas where Isis-linked groups operate, said Duterte had ordered the military to \u201cwipe out\u201d the groups. \u201cWe will further intensify intelligence efforts, collaborate with all concerned stakeholders, and cooperate and coordinate with counterpart Asian armies for common boundary security and intel sharing,\u201d Dela Vega told the Guardian.",

      "body": "<h2>1) A striking duel between City and Chelsea</h2> \n<p>The fact that Manchester City are pursuing four trophies makes each one more difficult to claim, and the effort could take a toll even on Pep Guardiola\u2019s lavish squad. Chelsea should be able to make Sunday\u2019s fixture one of the most demanding yet for City this season, but Maurizio Sarri\u2019s erratic side have been so bad in recent away matches \u2013 deservedly losing at Arsenal and Bournemouth \u2013 that there is no telling what sort of outfit will turn up at the Etihad. With Gonzalo Higua\u00edn looking sharp and Eden Hazard capable of bewildering Kyle Walker, Chelsea could, in theory, be even stronger than they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/08/chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">when they beat City 2-0</a> at Stamford Bridge in December. Mind you, City squandered several chances to take the lead that day \u2013 and this time Sergio Ag\u00fcero is available. <strong>PD</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) Liverpool need Firmino to find form</h2> \n<p>At his best, Roberto Firmino is the player who makes Liverpool tick. He is the pulsing brain behind many of their devastating attacks, sometimes knitting moves together in the false nine role, or creating space for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 with clever movement off the ball. Salah is the team\u2019s undoubted star after scoring 63 goals since joining Liverpool two summers ago, but the front three would not work without Firmino\u2019s intelligent promptings. Just look at how Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team struggled when the Brazilian had a subdued game in the tense 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday. After being taken off with 15 minutes left at the London Stadium, Firmino needs to rediscover his zest when Liverpool host Bournemouth. <strong>JS</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/07/liverpool-premier-league-title-race-manchester-city-eni-aluko\">Something may be shifting mentally at Liverpool. How will they respond? | Eni Aluko</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) How many risks will Pochettino take?</h2> \n<p>Mauricio Pochettino has a difficult balance to strike when Tottenham host Leicester on Sunday. His side are gathering powerful momentum again and are five points off top spot after scoring late winners against Fulham, Newcastle and Watford. Yet Tottenham\u2019s squad remains light after another quiet transfer window, Harry Kane and Dele Alli are still injured and Pochettino has to think about making sure his players are fresh to face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League next Wednesday. Does the Argentinian rotate his side before the Dortmund game? Does he keep his team fresh for a crucial knockout game and rest someone like Christian Eriksen? If Pochettino feels that Danny Rose needs to be managed carefully and cannot start twice in the space of four days, which game is made for the buccaneering left-back? Do Spurs prioritise the grind of the league or the unpredictability of Europe? Or do they put it all on the line, throw caution to the wind and go for both? Fatigue be damned; history is there to be made. <strong>JS</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec415144-8a01-4474-89ef-b2c4da369a72\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Manchester City (86 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>24 Apr </b>Man Utd (a)<br><b>28 Apr&nbsp;</b>Burnley (a)<br><b>4 May&nbsp;</b>Leicester (h)<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Brighton (a)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Liverpool (85 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>21 Apr&nbsp;</b>Cardiff (a)&nbsp;<br><b>26 Apr&nbsp;</b>Huddersfield (h)<br><b>5 May&nbsp;</b>Newcastle (a)&nbsp;<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Wolves (h)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Watford have plans for Silva return</h2> \n<p>Marco Silva comes back to his old Vicarage Road stomping ground with a vote of confidence from his chairman that is unlikely to be endorsed by Everton fans who have watched his team lose seven of their past 10 Premier League matches. Everton\u2019s comic inability to defend set-pieces properly is an area likely to be targeted by Watford, who in left-back Jos\u00e9 Holebas have one of the top-flight\u2019s best dead-ball specialists. No slouch over a stationary ball himself, the aerial threat caused by Troy Deeney \u2013 not to mention Craig Cathcart and Adrian Mariappa \u2013 is likely to cause Everton\u2019s defenders no end of problems at free-kicks and corners on an afternoon when they desperately need a win to appease increasingly impatient fans. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/feb/07/the-premier-league-title-race-and-savehakeem-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">The Premier League title race and #SaveHakeem \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5) Dendoncker is Wolves\u2019 man in form</h2> \n<p>Leander Dendoncker had to wait for his chance after joining Wolves from Anderlecht last summer, but the versatile Belgian is beginning to demonstrate why he is regarded as one of the brightest young players in Europe. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo rarely changes a winning team and the Wolves manager found it hard to find space for Dendoncker during the first half of the season. Yet the 23-year-old has impressed since making his first Premier League start in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/tottenham-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">the 3-1 win over Tottenham</a> on 29 December. Capable of playing in defence and midfield, Dendoncker has helped Wolves win their last three league games and scored his first goal for the club in last weekend\u2019s impressive 3-1 win over Everton. He is likely to have a big role as Nuno\u2019s team look to extend their winning sequence to four league matches when they host Newcastle on Monday. <strong>JS</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c589b519973bded0e2b9cf68f474a14d7ba60df\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c589b519973bded0e2b9cf68f474a14d7ba60df/186_134_4278_2567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lazar Markovic could make his first Fulham appearance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lazar Markovic could make his first Fulham appearance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Tuttle/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s fringe options to get Fulham run-out</h2> \n<p>Days before the arrival of PSG at Old Trafford, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r could be forgiven for engaging in a little rotation when he takes Manchester United to Craven Cottage for a match against a Fulham side seven points from safety and with only Huddersfield beneath them. Despite his public pronouncements and nice-guy image, Solskj\u00e6r has been ruthless in banishing those players he evidently doesn\u2019t rate to the margins. If fit peripheral figures such as Fred, Antonio Valencia, Andreas Pereira, Matteo Darmian and Scott McTominay can\u2019t be trusted to do a job on Saturday, then they probably have no future at Manchester United. Keep your eyes peeled, too, for the lesser spotted Lazar Markovic, who could play in the Premier League for the first time since 2017 after signing for Fulham on deadline day. <strong>BG</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/07/fulham-manchester-united-claudio-ranieri\">Claudio Ranieri struggling to reinvent Fulham as he urges forward momentum | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>7) Here come the Belgians for Palace</h2> \n<p>Belgians could be the order of the day for Crystal Palace, following Christian Benteke\u2019s impressive start in the win over Fulham, coupled with Michy Batshuayi\u2019s debut impact. It would be a sign of Roy Hodgson\u2019s intent if he decides to select the two strikers in the absence of the suspended Wilfried Zaha. Hodgson is known for playing with the handbrake firmly on, but now he has a potentially exciting forward line at his disposal he might be keen to utilise it against West Ham, and create some breathing space above the drop zone. Attack being the best form of defence might be largely alien to Hodgson but rarely has he been permitted such talent in the final third, even if Batshuayi may be required to play out wide. Palace need points and Hodgson knows how to eke them out, but this is his chance to get them with a sledgehammer rather than reason. <strong>WU</strong></p> \n<h2>8) Su\u00e1rez to get his teeth into Arsenal task</h2> \n<p>Having come off the bench against Manchester City, a full debut against the worst team in the top flight will give January signing Denis Su\u00e1rez<strong> </strong>as good an opportunity as any to show what he can bring to the Arsenal party. Despite failing to impress at Barcelona, the midfielder clearly did enough in the one season he spent playing under Unai Emery at Sevilla to convince Arsenal\u2019s manager he has much to offer and, if he starts, it will be intriguing to see in what role.

Burnley, meanwhile, have found form and another victory for them on Saturday would take Sean Dyche\u2019s side to the same points tally as Chris Hughton\u2019s, indicating that Burnley are pulling clear of trouble and Brighton are slipping into it.

      "bodyText": "1) A striking duel between City and Chelsea The fact that Manchester City are pursuing four trophies makes each one more difficult to claim, and the effort could take a toll even on Pep Guardiola\u2019s lavish squad. Chelsea should be able to make Sunday\u2019s fixture one of the most demanding yet for City this season, but Maurizio Sarri\u2019s erratic side have been so bad in recent away matches \u2013 deservedly losing at Arsenal and Bournemouth \u2013 that there is no telling what sort of outfit will turn up at the Etihad. With Gonzalo Higua\u00edn looking sharp and Eden Hazard capable of bewildering Kyle Walker, Chelsea could, in theory, be even stronger than they were when they beat City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in December. Mind you, City squandered several chances to take the lead that day \u2013 and this time Sergio Ag\u00fcero is available. PD 2) Liverpool need Firmino to find form At his best, Roberto Firmino is the player who makes Liverpool tick. He is the pulsing brain behind many of their devastating attacks, sometimes knitting moves together in the false nine role, or creating space for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 with clever movement off the ball. Salah is the team\u2019s undoubted star after scoring 63 goals since joining Liverpool two summers ago, but the front three would not work without Firmino\u2019s intelligent promptings. Just look at how Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team struggled when the Brazilian had a subdued game in the tense 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday. After being taken off with 15 minutes left at the London Stadium, Firmino needs to rediscover his zest when Liverpool host Bournemouth. JS 3) How many risks will Pochettino take? Mauricio Pochettino has a difficult balance to strike when Tottenham host Leicester on Sunday. His side are gathering powerful momentum again and are five points off top spot after scoring late winners against Fulham, Newcastle and Watford. Yet Tottenham\u2019s squad remains light after another quiet transfer window, Harry Kane and Dele Alli are still injured and Pochettino has to think about making sure his players are fresh to face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League next Wednesday. Does the Argentinian rotate his side before the Dortmund game? Does he keep his team fresh for a crucial knockout game and rest someone like Christian Eriksen? If Pochettino feels that Danny Rose needs to be managed carefully and cannot start twice in the space of four days, which game is made for the buccaneering left-back? Do Spurs prioritise the grind of the league or the unpredictability of Europe? Or do they put it all on the line, throw caution to the wind and go for both? Fatigue be damned; history is there to be made. JS 4) Watford have plans for Silva return Marco Silva comes back to his old Vicarage Road stomping ground with a vote of confidence from his chairman that is unlikely to be endorsed by Everton fans who have watched his team lose seven of their past 10 Premier League matches. Everton\u2019s comic inability to defend set-pieces properly is an area likely to be targeted by Watford, who in left-back Jos\u00e9 Holebas have one of the top-flight\u2019s best dead-ball specialists. No slouch over a stationary ball himself, the aerial threat caused by Troy Deeney \u2013 not to mention Craig Cathcart and Adrian Mariappa \u2013 is likely to cause Everton\u2019s defenders no end of problems at free-kicks and corners on an afternoon when they desperately need a win to appease increasingly impatient fans. BG 5) Dendoncker is Wolves\u2019 man in form Leander Dendoncker had to wait for his chance after joining Wolves from Anderlecht last summer, but the versatile Belgian is beginning to demonstrate why he is regarded as one of the brightest young players in Europe. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo rarely changes a winning team and the Wolves manager found it hard to find space for Dendoncker during the first half of the season. Yet the 23-year-old has impressed since making his first Premier League start in the 3-1 win over Tottenham on 29 December. Capable of playing in defence and midfield, Dendoncker has helped Wolves win their last three league games and scored his first goal for the club in last weekend\u2019s impressive 3-1 win over Everton. He is likely to have a big role as Nuno\u2019s team look to extend their winning sequence to four league matches when they host Newcastle on Monday. JS 6) Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s fringe options to get Fulham run-out Days before the arrival of PSG at Old Trafford, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r could be forgiven for engaging in a little rotation when he takes Manchester United to Craven Cottage for a match against a Fulham side seven points from safety and with only Huddersfield beneath them. Despite his public pronouncements and nice-guy image, Solskj\u00e6r has been ruthless in banishing those players he evidently doesn\u2019t rate to the margins. If fit peripheral figures such as Fred, Antonio Valencia, Andreas Pereira, Matteo Darmian and Scott McTominay can\u2019t be trusted to do a job on Saturday, then they probably have no future at Manchester United. Keep your eyes peeled, too, for the lesser spotted Lazar Markovic, who could play in the Premier League for the first time since 2017 after signing for Fulham on deadline day. BG 7) Here come the Belgians for Palace Belgians could be the order of the day for Crystal Palace, following Christian Benteke\u2019s impressive start in the win over Fulham, coupled with Michy Batshuayi\u2019s debut impact. It would be a sign of Roy Hodgson\u2019s intent if he decides to select the two strikers in the absence of the suspended Wilfried Zaha. Hodgson is known for playing with the handbrake firmly on, but now he has a potentially exciting forward line at his disposal he might be keen to utilise it against West Ham, and create some breathing space above the drop zone. Attack being the best form of defence might be largely alien to Hodgson but rarely has he been permitted such talent in the final third, even if Batshuayi may be required to play out wide. Palace need points and Hodgson knows how to eke them out, but this is his chance to get them with a sledgehammer rather than reason. WU 8) Su\u00e1rez to get his teeth into Arsenal task Having come off the bench against Manchester City, a full debut against the worst team in the top flight will give January signing Denis Su\u00e1rez as good an opportunity as any to show what he can bring to the Arsenal party. Despite failing to impress at Barcelona, the midfielder clearly did enough in the one season he spent playing under Unai Emery at Sevilla to convince Arsenal\u2019s manager he has much to offer and, if he starts, it will be intriguing to see in what role. While Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have forged a successful partnership and clearly enjoy playing together, Andrew Mangan of Arseblog is of the opinion Emery may rotate them \u201ca bit more if Su\u00e1rez can find his feet quickly, ensuring he doesn\u2019t fatigue them, as well as giving us a bit more depth on the bench\u201d. That, or given his current paucity of defenders, the Spaniard may be handed a pair of stilts and asked to do a job in the centre of defence. BG 9) Brighton\u2019s bid to end league slump Before Brighton travelled to Turf Moor, they were 11 points above Burnley. But their 1-0 defeat that day was the start of a slump during which they have mustered just one win from 10 league games. Burnley, meanwhile, have found form and another victory for them on Saturday would take Sean Dyche\u2019s side to the same points tally as Chris Hughton\u2019s, indicating that Burnley are pulling clear of trouble and Brighton are slipping into it. Glenn Murray was not fit enough to play from the start in December\u2019s meeting, but he underlined his readiness for this game, and his continued importance to Brighton despite the promise of Florin Andone, by scoring twice in Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup win at West Brom. If Brighton defend set-pieces better than they did in the away game, they should be able to keep Burnley at a reassuring distance below them in the table. PD 10) Saints face true test of improvement under Hasenh\u00fcttl Cardiff City are the first Premier League side Southampton have faced twice since Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s appointment, after losing 1-0 away in his first game in charge. The Austrian has turned Saints\u2019 fortunes around, but defeat would see Neil Warnock\u2019s side leapfrog them in the league. Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side have beaten Arsenal and drawn with Chelsea since his arrival, but victory over relegation rivals at St Mary\u2019s will be a truer test of his side\u2019s improvement and character. On that December day, Cardiff were well-organised, and the return fixture is a chance for Hasenh\u00fcttl to show he can break down the archetypal lower-half Premier League side as he continues his learning curve.

      "bodyText": "The mining company Adani released water into the Caley Valley wetlands during a week of intense monsoonal rain and flooding in north Queensland. The company issued a statement saying it had suspended operations at Abbot Point this week because the extreme weather had made it unsafe for workers. It said an inspection on Thursday had found floodwater had been released into the wetlands from an authorised release point, but a spokesperson said no water had gone into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. \u201cThe inspection indicates there has been no release of waters into the marine environment or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, however flood water has been released to the Caley Valley wetlands from an authorised release point,\u201d the official said. \u201cAbbot Point Operations promptly reported these preliminary inspection findings to the Department of Environment and Science.\u201d The spokesperson said the company \u201cis confident that no environmental harm has or will occur\u201d and the company would continue to monitor releases and inform the Queensland Department of Environment and Science. The Queensland government took legal action against Adani last year for breaching an amended licence for the release of polluted water during cyclone Debbie in 2017. The coordinator of the Mackay Conservation Group, Peter McCallum, said the government had given an undertaking in September that it would monitor emissions at Abbot Point to ensure Adani was complying with its environmental conditions. He said the monitoring needed to occur in real time. \u201cWe know that the government is intending on visiting the site today to do some testing of the water flow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the government has not put in place the monitoring regime they said they would back in September.\u201d McCallum said the current monitoring was \u201clike testing a drunk driver several days after they finished drinking\u201d. A spokesperson for the Department of Environment and Science said Adani had advised it about the release of stormwater at an authorised release point in the Caley Valley wetlands. Officers from the department were to inspect the site on Friday. \u201cThe stormwater release is currently occurring from a dam spillway as a result of recent heavy rain associated with the monsoon trough,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDES officers will be onsite at the coal terminal this morning to assess the situation and ensure compliance with environmental conditions.\u201d The spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to implement a long-term monitoring program in the Caley Valley Wetland to determine any adverse impacts on environmental values\u201d. The department also confirmed that the Sun Metals zinc refinery, 15km south of Townsville, had been granted a temporary emissions licence to manage flood water this week. \u201cDES will continue to work closely with the operators of the Sun Metals refinery to manage the risk in the current conditions,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

Since 2010 there has been an almost 40% real-terms cut in spending on planners, according to the public spending watchdog.</p> <p>The NAO report follows claims from Conservative ministers that housebuilding is a top policy priority and that by the mid-2020s the rate will increase to 300,000 new homes a year. Between 2005-06 and 2017-18 the housebuilding rate has averaged 177,000 a year and the annual number has never exceeded 224,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/08/bounced-from-place-to-place-the-unsettled-lives-of-housing-crisis-victims\">\u2018Bounced from place to place\u2019: the unsettled lives of housing crisis victims</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Separately, a study by the National Housing Federation (NHF) has found that an estimated 1.3 million children are living in poverty in privately rented homes in England, an increase of 69% since 2008. Its report says 242,753 of these children would not be living in poverty if they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/08/england-needs-3m-new-social-homes-by-2040-says-cross-party-report\">access to social housing</a> as their parents would be paying lower rents.</p> <p>Kate Henderson, the NHF\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is a disgrace that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world we cannot provide our children with a secure and affordable home. The critical lack of social housing is pushing more and more families into poverty by forcing them into insecure privately rented homes they cannot afford.\u201d</p> <p>The NAO report cites research by a planning and development consultancy, Lichfields, which found that in 2020 about 50% of local authorities are likely to fail the test for building enough homes and could face penalties, including giving developers in those areas greater freedoms regarding where they can build.</p> <p>The report says only 44.1% of local authorities had up-to-date plans setting out how they could meet the need for new homes.</p> <p>Government figures show that while the average contributions agreed with developers for public infrastructure such as schools, health centres, roads and social housing remained at about \u00a319,000 per new home between 2012 and 2017, average house prices increased by 31% in that period. The top five developers\u2019 average operating profit margin increased from about 12% to 21%.</p> <p>Only 47% of local authorities had implemented a community infrastructure levy, intended to raise money from developers. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the NAO that town halls may not have the commercial and negotiating skills needed to deal with developers\u2019 arguments on viability and that some were unable to negotiate effectively.</p> <p>The report also found that planning appeals were taking longer and between 2010-11 and 2017-18 there was a 37.9% real-terms fall in net expenditure on planning functions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/kit-malthouse\">Kit Malthouse</a>, the housing minister, said he recognised the challenges identified by the NAO. \u201cOver the last three decades, governments of all stripes have built too few homes of all types,\u201d he said, adding that the figure of 220,000 homes built in 2017-18 was higher than in all but one of the last 31 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re conducting independent reviews on build-out rates and planning inquiries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd through multibillion-pound funding, planning reforms and giving councils the freedom to borrow more to build homes, we\u2019re helping to make the housing market work for everyone.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Targets for new homes are likely to be missed by half of England\u2019s local authorities, according to a damning assessment of the government\u2019s housing strategy, while increasingly profitable building companies are getting away with paying less for infrastructure and more than half of councils have failed to draw up adequate plans to solve the housing crisis. The National Audit Office (NAO) concludes that the planning system in England is \u201cnot working well\u201d and says councils are struggling to negotiate successfully with developers, leaving swaths of the country vulnerable to either housing shortages or situations where the wrong homes are built in the wrong places. Since 2010 there has been an almost 40% real-terms cut in spending on planners, according to the public spending watchdog. The NAO report follows claims from Conservative ministers that housebuilding is a top policy priority and that by the mid-2020s the rate will increase to 300,000 new homes a year. Between 2005-06 and 2017-18 the housebuilding rate has averaged 177,000 a year and the annual number has never exceeded 224,000. Separately, a study by the National Housing Federation (NHF) has found that an estimated 1.3 million children are living in poverty in privately rented homes in England, an increase of 69% since 2008. Its report says 242,753 of these children would not be living in poverty if they had access to social housing as their parents would be paying lower rents. Kate Henderson, the NHF\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is a disgrace that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world we cannot provide our children with a secure and affordable home. The critical lack of social housing is pushing more and more families into poverty by forcing them into insecure privately rented homes they cannot afford.\u201d The NAO report cites research by a planning and development consultancy, Lichfields, which found that in 2020 about 50% of local authorities are likely to fail the test for building enough homes and could face penalties, including giving developers in those areas greater freedoms regarding where they can build. The report says only 44.1% of local authorities had up-to-date plans setting out how they could meet the need for new homes. Government figures show that while the average contributions agreed with developers for public infrastructure such as schools, health centres, roads and social housing remained at about \u00a319,000 per new home between 2012 and 2017, average house prices increased by 31% in that period. The top five developers\u2019 average operating profit margin increased from about 12% to 21%. Only 47% of local authorities had implemented a community infrastructure levy, intended to raise money from developers. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the NAO that town halls may not have the commercial and negotiating skills needed to deal with developers\u2019 arguments on viability and that some were unable to negotiate effectively. The report also found that planning appeals were taking longer and between 2010-11 and 2017-18 there was a 37.9% real-terms fall in net expenditure on planning functions. Kit Malthouse, the housing minister, said he recognised the challenges identified by the NAO. \u201cOver the last three decades, governments of all stripes have built too few homes of all types,\u201d he said, adding that the figure of 220,000 homes built in 2017-18 was higher than in all but one of the last 31 years. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting independent reviews on build-out rates and planning inquiries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd through multibillion-pound funding, planning reforms and giving councils the freedom to borrow more to build homes, we\u2019re helping to make the housing market work for everyone.\u201d",
