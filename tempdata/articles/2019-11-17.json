      "bodyText": "Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics this morning, Brexit party leader Nigel Farage has insisted that claims the party\u2019s candidates were offered jobs by the Conservatives to persuade them to stand aside were \u201cfact\u201d. Scotland Yard announced yesterday that it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud in relation to the claims. Farage accused Boris Johnson\u2019s party of corruption. Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar? Perhaps he is, I don\u2019t know. Ann Widdecombe made it perfectly clear she received two phone calls, from a senior official in number 10, offering her a job on the negotiating team if she stood down as an election candidate. Fact. Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show his government would allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people, in a sign Labour would look to keep a liberal immigration regime with Europe if Brexit goes ahead. The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto said free movement would end at the point of Brexit, but a motion passed by Labour conference argued for the UK to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d free movement. Labour\u2019s Kensington parliamentary candidate Emma Dent Coad is to report her Lib Dem rival \u2013 and former Tory MP \u2013 Sam Gyimah to the police over claims he made that she \u201cwas part of all the discussions that went on\u201d regarding the cladding that was on Grenfell Tower. \u201cIf this is a political game, shame on him. We\u2019ve sent rebuttals with all the links and all the evidence is there,\u201d she told the Guardian. You can read the full story here. Guardian environment correspondents Sandra Laville and Matthew Taylor report that the Conservative party\u2019s record on tackling the climate crisis has been condemned by leading scientists and former government advisers. Experts have accused the Conservatives of copying right-wing politicians in the US by deliberately weakening environmental protections. Meanwhile, new analysis by Labour reveals environmental policies put forward since 2017 and opposed by the Tories would have led to emissions reductions of over 70m tonnes a year by 2030 \u2013 more than the annual emissions of Portugal. Conservative politicians have criticised Angela Eagle \u2013 former Labour leadership hopeful \u2013 for retweeting this image of the foreign secretary. She has dismissed it as a joke: Labour\u2019s candidate in Ashfield in Nottinghamshire \u2013 Gloria de Piero\u2019s old seat \u2013 has tweeted pictures of her office with its windows smashed. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: The force was called to Outram Street in Sutton on November 17, 2019 at around 10.30am following reports of criminal damage. The incident is believed to have happened between 5.30pm on Saturday to 10am on Sunday. A number of windows have been smashed. If you saw the incident or have any information please call 101 quoting incident number 266 of 17 November 2019. The Guardian\u2019s northern correspondent Nazia Parveen reports that housing and fire chiefs have criticised the government over a \u201ccladding lottery\u201d and called for an overhaul in UK fire safety regulations after a fire at student flats in Bolton. An investigation has been launched after more than 200 students were evacuated when a fire ripped through the upper part of the town-centre six-storey building, which is cladded in high-pressure laminate (HPL) material. The mayor of Salford city council, Paul Dennett, who leads the Greater Manchester\u2019s high rise taskforce set up after the Grenfell tragedy, said it was an industrial crisis and called on the government to invest more funds in what he described as a \u201ccladding lottery\u201d. You can read the full story here: Labour has claimed that its living wage commitments would give workers who earn the national minimum wage at least \u00a39,000 more by 2024 than the Tories. The party has said: Coupled with Labour\u2019s pledge to not raise income tax or national insurance contributions for the bottom 95% of earners, this means a worker on the minimum wage will be at least \u00a36,000 better off after tax. Analysis of latest ONS figures on earnings also shows that Labour\u2019s pledge to immediately introduce a \u00a310 an hour Real Living Wage for all workers over 16 will give approximately 7.5 million people a pay rise, including over 1.2 million young people. The current minimum wage is \u00a38.21 for people 25 and over and \u00a34.35 for 16-17 year olds. The Conservatives have responded with a statement from chief secretary to the treasury, Rishi Sunak: Since 2010, under the Conservatives, the lowest paid workers have \u00a34,500 more in their pockets thanks to increases in the living wage and tax cuts. Whilst we\u2019ve been working to make sure you keep more of the money you earn, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour would take the equivalent of a month\u2019s extra wages from you after hitting you with higher taxes to pay for their spending splurge. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent, Peter Walker, commenting on Conservative immigration plans. See Raab\u2019s comments from earlier. The SNP has issued a statement in response to the BBC and Sunday Times investigation that accuses the UK government and the British army of covering up the killing of children in Afghanistan and Iraq. Journalists have obtained documents that allegedly contain evidence implicating troops in killing children and the torture of civilians. The reports claim to have obtained new evidence from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British soldiers in Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government closed IHAT and Operation Northmoor in 2017, after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations he had paid people in Iraq to find clients. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC earlier: All of the allegations that had evidence have been looked at by the armed forces prosecuting authorities, because we want to have accountability where there\u2019s wrongdoing ... What we\u2019re quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don\u2019t lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who\u2019ve served their country for years on end. And we\u2019ve got the right balance. Jeremy Corbyn has told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show his government would allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people, in a sign Labour would look to keep a liberal immigration regime with Europe if Brexit goes ahead. The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto said free movement would end at the point of Brexit, but a motion passed by Labour conference argued for the UK to \u201cmaintain and expand\u201d free movement. The Labour leader said: A lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society. A lot of British people lie in different parts of the EU and many of those families have been through unbelievable stress. So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here. You can read our full report here. Labour has pledged this morning to scrap charges for dental checkups, giving everyone in England the right to a \u201cfree teeth MOT\u201d. The proposals, estimated to cost \u00a3450m a year, would eliminate band-one dentistry charges, which were introduced by the NHS in 1951. The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said it is not \u201cremotely likely\u201d that the UK will leave the EU without a deal. Also speaking to Marr, Raab initially declined to get into \u201chypothetical negotiating objectives\u201d when asked if a no-deal would take place if the UK failed to secure its fishing objectives in trade talks. But he later replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s remotely likely\u201d. Critics have warned a no-deal Brexit could still occur at the end of 2020 given the lack of time to negotiate the future relationship between the UK and EU. The US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has told ITV\u2019s Exposure that Boris Johnson brutally cast her aside \u201clike some one-night stand\u201d, leaving her \u201cheartbroken\u201d since he became prime minister and the controversy over their four-year relationship became public. The full interview will be aired on ITV\u2019s Exposure this evening. Here\u2019s our story. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics this morning, Brexit party leader Nigel Farage insisted that claims the party\u2019s candidates were offered jobs by the Conservatives to persuade them to stand aside were \u201cfact\u201d.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics this morning, Brexit party leader Nigel Farage insisted that claims the party\u2019s candidates were offered jobs by the Conservatives to persuade them to stand aside were \u201cfact\u201d. It has been claimed that Brexit figures \u2013 including Ann Widdecombe \u2013 were offered post-election roles or peerages as part of an attempt to get them to stand down at the general election, something the Conservatives have denied. Scotland Yard announced yesterday that it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud in relation to the claims. Farage said: Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar? Perhaps he is, I don\u2019t know. Ann Widdecombe made it perfectly clear she received two phone calls, from a senior official in number 10, offering her a job on the negotiating team if she stood down as an election candidate. Fact. You can agree with Ann\u2019s views in life or disagree, but the fact that she\u2019s a very honest woman, I think nobody would ever disagree with. Fact. Fact number two, [Boris Johnson\u2019s chief strategic adviser] Sir Eddie Lister, rang up our candidate for Peterborough, offering him a job in higher education if he stood down as a candidate. They\u2019re the things that are already out in the open. What I have said, John, is there was actually a package put together, in which eight senior figures of the Brexit party would go to the house of Lords and be offered a place in the negotiating team. It\u2019s corruption. It\u2019s corruption. The Brexit party leader said the situation showed how absolutely \u201crotten and broken\u201d politics has become. Labour\u2019s Kensington parliamentary candidate Emma Dent Coad is to report her Lib Dem rival \u2013 and former Tory MP \u2013 Sam Gyimah to the police over claims he made that she \u201cwas part of all the discussions that went on\u201d regarding the cladding that was on Grenfell Tower. Dent Coad won the marginal constituency from the Conservatives by 20 votes in 2017. Under the representation of the people act it is illegal for any person to \u201cpublish any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate\u2019s personal character or conduct, unless he or she can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing that statement to be true\u201d. The Liberal Democrats have sent a legal letter to the BBC about leader Jo Swinson being left out of the broadcaster\u2019s election TV debate. In the letter sent to the corporation\u2019s director-general Tony Hall, the party\u2019s lawyers said that the exclusion of Swinson was \u201cclearly unlawful\u201d. The party has already launched a High Court challenge against ITV over its decision not to include Swinson in the debate it has arranged. The \u2018BBC Prime Ministerial Debate\u2019 on Friday 6 December will see a head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn live from Southampton. ITV is to hold \u2018Johnson v Corbyn: The ITV Debate\u2019 this coming Tuesday. The Lib Dem letter reads: The BBC\u2019s approach is fundamentally disrespectful to the many millions of people who strongly support remaining in the EU. It ignores their concerns, their right to be heard and to be represented. People need to hear the arguments about Remain and Leave in a balanced way, but the leaders of the Labour Party and Conservative Party both want Britain to leave the EU. That means the BBC\u2019s leaders\u2019 debate has no place for those who take the opposite view. As you should be aware, the BBC is under a strict legal obligation to achieve \u2018due impartiality\u2019 in its election broadcasting. The exclusion of any voice of Remain in the leaders\u2019 debate will clearly put the BBC in breach of that obligation. The SNP have similar complaints and they are taking legal action against ITV over its exclusion from a general election debate. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, the party\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: We\u2019ll be in court tomorrow, because it\u2019s grossly unfair. [...] We are the third party at Westminster. We\u2019ve been in the government in Scotland for the last 12 years, we\u2019re leading the polls in Scotland at 42% in the YouGov poll last week. And we\u2019ve got to recognise that the public take their views from these debates. Deborah Mattinson, a founding partner of research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks, has written in the Observer that very little seems to be getting through to voters in the election campaign so far. \u201cWhat have you picked up about the election so far?\u201d I asked a focus group of undecided voters last week. Although they had plenty to say about policies, parties and politicians, their confident chatter died away fast. Eye contact was avoided. No one could think of anything that related to the campaign. A recent poll found a similar lack of engagement. Four thousand voters were asked what \u201cincidents, events, stories etc\u201d they had noticed. The winning score, at 42%, was for \u201cnone\u201d. In second place came the 5% mentioning Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Grenfell remarks. Just 2% mentioned \u201cBrexit\u201d and 1% NHS funding. The shadow home secretary has responded to comments by Michael Gove in the Mail on Sunday. He wrote: Under EU rules, European nationals arriving here have preferential access to free NHS care whereas other migrants have to wait until they\u2019ve paid into the system and secured settled status, a process which typically takes five years. It\u2019s unfair that people coming from European countries can access free NHS care without paying in while others make significant contributions. Abbott points out that EU workers pay taxes like everybody else, so it is wrong to say they aren\u2019t \u201cpaying in\u201d. Here are some highlights from this morning\u2019s political broadcast interviews. Jeremy Corby told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that he would want his government to allow \u201ca great deal of movement\u201d of people if he became the next prime minister. Asked whether Labour would pledge to end free movement in its election manifesto \u2013 as it did in its 2017 manifesto \u2013 the Labour leader said we would have to wait until the document is unveiled on Thursday. A lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society. A lot of British people live in different parts of the EU and many of those families have been through unbelievable stress. So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that it was now \u201cnot remotely likely\u201d that the UK would leave the UK without a deal. \u201cCould we leave without a deal?\u201d said Marr. \u201cI think it\u2019s, no,... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s remotely likely,\u201d Raab responded. Asked about claims that the Tories offered peerages and jobs to Brexit Party figures in return for them standing aside, security minister Brandon Lewis told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday: We have not offered any deals to anybody. I think what\u2019s rather surreal with this conversation, not least of all is the fact that actually as chairman I removed Ann Widdecombe\u2019s membership of the Conservative Party because she had joined the Brexit Party - that\u2019s completely in breach of our constitution - but also because we\u2019re the party saying we need to get a clear Conservative majority, we are fighting these seats to get Brexit done and deliver for people. Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth refused to say whether immigration would increase or decrease under a Labour government. We want a balanced approach to immigration and what that means for the NHS is if a hospital trust thinks that a surgeon or a nurse or a midwife is qualified enough to come to our country to care for our sick and our elderly and offers them that opportunity, then they should be allowed to come to our country to care for our sick and our elderly. Here are some more details on Labour\u2019s dentistry announcement. The party has pledged to scrap band one dentistry charges, giving everyone a free teeth MOT with their dentist, including checks for oral cancers. They say this will save money in the long run, taking pressure off GPs and hospitals. The British Dental Association has estimated that the measures would cost \u00a3450m per year. Here are some key passages from the announcement: Charges put people off from going to their dentist, and actively undermines prevention - nearly 1 in 5 patients delay going to the dentist because they can\u2019t afford to see one ... The current system is also putting pressure on the wider NHS. Around 380,000 patients with toothache are choosing to head to their GPs who cannot provide dental treatment, costing the NHS over \u00a320 million a year. Around 135,000 patients per year are also estimated to attend A&amp;E units with dental problems, at a cost of \u00a318 million. Today\u2019s measures are also aimed at improving children\u2019s oral health. More than 100 children a day have rotting teeth removed in hospital, when nine in ten cases could have been prevented. Tooth decay remains the leading reason for hospitals admissions among 5 to 9 year olds, and are more than double those for tonsillitis. Corbyn says that their proposals for re-nationalisation are \u201cvery, very modest\u201d. The water companies are failing and so is Royal Mail. He finishes the interview by saying he is \u201cdetermined to win it and looking forward to winning it on 12 December\u201d. On the party\u2019s pledge to give people free dental check-ups, Corbyn says that the measure would actually save money because it would prevent more expensive \u2013 and painful \u2013 problems emerging. \u201cYou should look at expenditure as investment in the future,\u201d he says. Asked if he agrees with army chief Nick Carter\u2019s comment that NATO was the most successful military alliance in history, Corbyn says he wouldn\u2019t define it as that but as \u201ca product of an attempt to bring people together after the second world war\u201d. On Trident, Corbyn says the nuclear deterrent would part of \u201cnuclear non-proliferation discussions\u201d if he became prime minister. The real insecurities in the world are not the same as they were in the Cold War, he says, they are more to do with cyber-security. Corbyn is asked about the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford\u2019s insistence that his party would insist on a Scottish independence referendum in the first year of a Labour government. Corbyn says he cannot promise that. \u201cWe are not doing deals with anybody, we are not forming coalition,\u201d he says. The issue of an independence referendum should not come \u201cin the early years of a Labour government\u201d, says Corbyn. He says the SNP will have a choice between bringing in a Tory government with all its austerity measures and a progressive Labour government. We paid \u00a311bn into the EU budget last year to access the bloc\u2019s market. Would Corbyn agree to that, says Marr. The Labour leader says it depends how much they were asking for but that we need to maintain access to EU markets. Corbyn is asked if the Labour party\u2019s manifesto will repeat its 2017 promise to end free movement. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait until Thursday [when the Labour manifesto will be unveiled] to find out the wording of it,\u201d says Corbyn. A lot of EU nationals have made their homes here and make a massive contribution to this society, he says. They should be able to remain. Marr asks the Labour leader about his party\u2019s conference motion to \u201cextend free movement\u201d. Corbyn says he thinks the movers of the motion had in mind \u201cfamily reunion\u201d, so allowing people to bring members of their family to the UK from outside the EU. (The Conservative party is interpreting the motion as meaning the extension of free movement to other countries.) Will free movement end if we leave the EU? \u201cThere will be an awful lot of movement,\u201d says Corbyn. Corbyn is on Marr. Asked if he wanted the UK to leave the EU or not, he said he would put that choice to the British people and that he wanted \u201ca close relationship with the EU\u201d. \u201cWe will negotiate a credible option of leaving and put that along side remain and put that to the British people,\u201d he said, adding that negotiations with the EU would start as soon as they entered government. Marr points out that most of the senior members of the shadow cabinet have said they would campaign to remain in any second referendum. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to take with me into those negotiations,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cHowever people voted in the referendum, they didn\u2019t vote to loose their job, they didn\u2019t vote for a deregulated society,\u201d he says. A Labour-negotiated deal would be put to the party\u2019s conference as well as to parliament, he says. Labour would back a customs union with the EU. \u201cWe have to be realistic about where British trade is at the moment\u201d, says Corbyn, and about half of UK trade is done with the EU. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab is on Marr, talking about Conservative plans on immigration \u2013 some of which have been set out this morning. Asked about the previous target of getting immigration down to 10s of thousands, Raab says that \u2013 speaking as the son of a refugee \u2013 he thinks that immigration can be very beneficial, but that people coming to the UK should have to wait five years before they can claim benefits and that they should pay into the NHS. His party has said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of migrants will need a job offer to come to the UK to work if they form the next government, regardless of where they are from in the world. They say there will be a small number of exceptions, including high-skilled scientists and those who want to come to the UK to start a business. Asked what groups of migrant workers the party wanted fewer of in the UK, Raab said he didn\u2019t want to stigmatise groups. He said he wanted to invest in innovation so that the UK was more productive and he wanted to reduce the need for cheap labour from abroad. The Conservatives have pledged that access to benefits will be equalised between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world, meaning non-UK citizens will typically need to wait five years before they are able to claim benefits. Under current rules, EU migrants can access welfare and services after being in the UK for three months. The party said it would put an end to the practice of child benefit being sent abroad to support children who do not live in the UK and that it would increase the immigration health surcharge from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625. They said the change will raise more than \u00a3500m a year. The surcharge was introduced in 2015 in a clampdown on so-called \u201chealth tourism\u201d, and has previously been doubled from \u00a3200 to \u00a3400. Good morning and welcome to Politics live. Prince Andrew\u2019s bombshell interview with Emily Maitlis for BBC\u2019s Newsnight last night is likely to dominate this morning\u2019s news agenda. The Duke of York claimed that he could not have had sex with a teenage girl in the London home of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell because he was at home after attending a children\u2019s party at Pizza Express in Woking. You can read the full story here and some analysis here. In politics news, the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has told ITV\u2019s Exposure that Boris Johnson brutally cast her aside \u201clike some one-night stand\u201d, leaving her \u201cheartbroken\u201d since he became prime minister and the controversy over their four-year relationship became public. The full interview will be aired on ITV\u2019s Exposure this evening. Writing in the Observer, Jeremy Corbyn has said the Labour government will pass an emergency \u201cNHS protection\u201d law if it wins the general election, to ensure that powerful US pharmaceutical companies cannot infiltrate the health service and dramatically force up the price of drugs. The party has also pledged to provide free NHS dental check-ups for everyone in England this morning. Corbyn said that over half of adults and 40% of children haven\u2019t been to the dentist in the last year. If you don\u2019t go to the dentist for check-ups, you end up storing up problems in the long term. Over 100,000 are admitted to hospital every year because of problems with their teeth. The Labour leader is due on the Andrew Marr show shortly. I\u2019ll bring you the latest from that.",

Doctors throughout the country are angry and frustrated at the chronic underfunding of the NHS and want to make it clear that continuing in this vein is dangerous to the public.\u201d</p> <p>NHS England\u2019s performance against key waiting times for A&amp;E and cancer care and planned operations has fallen to record lows, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/ae-waiting-times-in-england-hit-worst-ever-level\">figures published last week</a>. The figures prompted claims that the service has been left unable to cope with fast-rising demand for care because of nine years of austerity funding and staff shortages.</p> <p>A paramedic in the north of England said: \u201cI feel it is shameful on our management to have gagged us from speaking out out for political reasons. It\u2019s disrespectful, frustrating and could cost lives.</p> <p>\u201cIn the NHS the truth hurts, and it feels like bosses are stopping us from telling people what is really going on. People are dying in the NHS due to cuts, but management don\u2019t want us to tell anyone. Just because there is an election on, we are being gagged to prevent the truth coming out \u2013 it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for EveryDoctor, which campaigns to improve working conditions for doctors, said: \u201cFor many people, the NHS is the key issue this election season. The current conditions in the NHS are a direct consequence of nine years of planned austerity cuts by the government. To silence frontline NHS staff and prevent them from speaking up about the daily atrocities they witness is deeply wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Harrison, a national officer with the GMB union, said: \u201cNHS staff are the ones who have kept our health service running despite a decade of slashed funding, austerity and real-terms pay cuts. So earlier this month when our members received notices instructing them not to speak about the current state of the NHS and the damage that has been done over the last decade of a Tory government, it was the final straw for some.</p> <p>\u201cGMB members on the frontline of the NHS should be able to speak openly and honestly about their real-life experiences at work in whatever forum why choose.\u201d</p> <p>Kerry Gulliver, the director of human resources and organisational development at East Midlands ambulance service, said: \u201cThe purdah advice that we have included in our internal newsletter to staff is consistent with national guidelines and is what is being followed by all NHS organisations. The advice is the same advice we have provided to our staff in all previous pre-election periods.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 18 November 2019.

But its section on \u201cstaff activism\u201d does not mention behaviour on social media. It says only: \u201cNHS employees are free to undertake political activism in a personal capacity but should not involve their organisation or create the impression of their organisation\u2019s involvement.\u201d Kevin McGee, the chief executive of Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS trust, recently wrote to all its staff saying they \u201cshould not use the trust\u2019s premises for political activism and should make every effort to preserve public professional neutrality, especially on social media.\u201d Many of the NHS\u2019s 1.5 million staff use social media, especially Twitter, to describe the pressure that the service is under. They often cite understaffing and lack of funding as key issues. One Blackpool consultant who asked to remain anonymous said: \u201cBeing told that I cannot share my views on social media in the run-up to the election is oppressive. I feel I am being denied both my right to express myself freely and denied this opportunity to share my opinions on manifestos or party policy which the public may find valuable, given my extensive experience within the NHS.\u201d Health Education England has told its staff that during the campaign they should not use social networks \u201cor online forums, communities and other public online discussions in a way that will call into question your political impartiality regarding your professional role at HEE\u201d. Similarly, Pauline Howie, the chief executive of the Scottish ambulance service, recently wrote to her staff saying that during the campaign \u201cif you mention that you work for the Scottish ambulance service on your personal social media channels, you cannot get involved in any online activity, debate or discussion which is political in nature.\u201d NHS bodies are keen to ensure that staff who do debate political issues online do not mention which part of the health service they work for, in case it is seen to compromise their political impartiality. For example, the \u201cstaff activism\u201d section of East Midlands ambulance service\u2019s guidance to employees about the pre-election period says: \u201cNHS employees are free to undertake political activism in a personal capacity but should not involve their organisation or create the impression of their organisation\u2019s involvement. \u201cPlease be careful therefore with your personal social media accounts if you include where you work and/or photographs of you in uniform/with an EMAS vehicle feature in your profile.\u201d The Scottish government\u2019s advice to NHS bodies says staff \u201cshould not use their official premises, uniforms or equipment and should not make comments based on information not generally available to the public.\u201d Dr Kumail Versi, a specialist registrar in paediatrics, said: \u201cIn light of the political climate, it is shocking to see NHS bosses trying to stop doctors from speaking out about the deterioration of the NHS under the Tory government. Doctors throughout the country are angry and frustrated at the chronic underfunding of the NHS and want to make it clear that continuing in this vein is dangerous to the public.\u201d NHS England\u2019s performance against key waiting times for A&amp;E and cancer care and planned operations has fallen to record lows, according to figures published last week. The figures prompted claims that the service has been left unable to cope with fast-rising demand for care because of nine years of austerity funding and staff shortages. A paramedic in the north of England said: \u201cI feel it is shameful on our management to have gagged us from speaking out out for political reasons. It\u2019s disrespectful, frustrating and could cost lives. \u201cIn the NHS the truth hurts, and it feels like bosses are stopping us from telling people what is really going on. People are dying in the NHS due to cuts, but management don\u2019t want us to tell anyone. Just because there is an election on, we are being gagged to prevent the truth coming out \u2013 it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d A spokesperson for EveryDoctor, which campaigns to improve working conditions for doctors, said: \u201cFor many people, the NHS is the key issue this election season. The current conditions in the NHS are a direct consequence of nine years of planned austerity cuts by the government. To silence frontline NHS staff and prevent them from speaking up about the daily atrocities they witness is deeply wrong.\u201d Rachel Harrison, a national officer with the GMB union, said: \u201cNHS staff are the ones who have kept our health service running despite a decade of slashed funding, austerity and real-terms pay cuts. So earlier this month when our members received notices instructing them not to speak about the current state of the NHS and the damage that has been done over the last decade of a Tory government, it was the final straw for some. \u201cGMB members on the frontline of the NHS should be able to speak openly and honestly about their real-life experiences at work in whatever forum why choose.\u201d Kerry Gulliver, the director of human resources and organisational development at East Midlands ambulance service, said: \u201cThe purdah advice that we have included in our internal newsletter to staff is consistent with national guidelines and is what is being followed by all NHS organisations. The advice is the same advice we have provided to our staff in all previous pre-election periods.\u201d \u2022 This article was corrected on 18 November 2019. Kerry Gulliver works for the East Midlands ambulance service, not Blackpool teaching hospitals as stated in an earlier version.",

Everything had become about extracting a \u201cgotcha\u201d clip in which the hapless MP floundered or was skewered, footage that could go triumphantly viral. Informed investigation or examination of the issues was secondary to such exchanges. Political interviewers, Gibb said, needed to \u201cget back in their box\u201d.</p> <p>Gibb was in charge of BBC political output \u2013 responsible for everything from <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> to the 2017 election coverage \u2013 before taking on the calamitous role of trying to get May\u2019s tin-eared message over to parliament and the public. Leaving aside the fact that it requires some monumental chutzpah for him of all people to take issue with the culture of broadcast journalism, you can\u2019t honestly watch the progress of the current campaign without seeing some truth in his analysis.</p> <p>The most memorable moments of the grim political fortnight so far have almost all been triggered by short viral clips from broadcast interviews: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\" title=\"\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s shameful arrogance about the residents of Grenfell Tower</a> in a conversation with LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari; 5 Live\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/labour-candidate-kate-ramsden-steps-down-israel-comparison\" title=\"\">Emma Barnett letting Labour\u2019s Jane Aitchison</a> dangle in silence for 12.5 seconds (count them) while she deliberated whether it was reasonable for a fellow candidate to imagine \u201ccelebrating\u201d the deaths of Tony Blair and Benjamin Netanyahu; Sophy Ridge on Sky asking Jo Swinson to explain the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/16/lib-dems-criticised-for-selective-use-of-polling-data-on-leaflets\" title=\"\">misleading graphs on Lib Dem election leaflets</a>; and pretty much every exchange with the prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bf45bb17f4337667421cd65af094082108e5cde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bf45bb17f4337667421cd65af094082108e5cde/0_936_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sophy Ridge of Sky confronted Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson with claims her party was using misleading campaign literature.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophy Ridge of Sky confronted Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson with claims her party was using misleading campaign literature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Previous campaigns have turned on disastrous media moments \u2013 Gordon Brown and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/29/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-bigot\" title=\"\">that bigoted woman</a>\u201d, Ed Miliband and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/06/sun-ed-miliband-labour-mail-telegraph-election\" title=\"\">his bacon sandwich</a> \u2013 but they have generally appeared as accidental exclamation marks in the narrative of electioneering. This, by contrast, is coming to seem a campaign made up of nothing but meme-worthy gaffes and clangers, a live stream that is all heckle and no debate.</p> <p>TV viewers and radio listeners have, apparently, long bought into the idea that it is in the aggressive interview that political presenters earn their sometimes eye-watering salaries. Twitter foregrounds that long-held vicarious desire for them to \u201cgo in hard\u201d on our elected representatives, to catch them out, rather than to tease out genuine dilemmas or complications. Ever since Robin Day first mauled Harold Macmillan on TV in 1958, a ritualistic pattern has been established in which politicians attempt to convey only narrow pre-planned messages, and presenters dramatise the frustration of trying to trip them up. In this arena, as Tony Blair\u2019s spin doctor Tim Allan once observed, \u201cany communication by the politician on his or her terms is regarded [by the journalist and the viewer] as a failure.\u201d Or as the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis had it: \u201cOne of the purposes of what we do is to be seen to be pouring a bucket of custard over powerful people.\u201d</p> <p>Those custard moments have been amplified by dramatic changes in the way that we tend to receive political news. Previously, there was the sense that they might be the cathartic conclusion of a longer strategic conversation. Given the way that interview clips are now shared, however, the bucket and the custard stand alone. One of the most telling demographic changes of the last decade or so is the way in which younger people have switched off TV news. According to the most recent <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/157914/uk-news-consumption-2019-report.pdf\" title=\"\">Ofcom report</a>, the average British pensioner watches 33 minutes of real-time TV news a day, but this figure falls to just two minutes among people aged 16-24. These ratios of attention are broadly reversed when it comes to viral messaging.</p> <p>For political campaigners, clipping interviews is easier than knocking doors. Labour\u2019s highly organised Momentum group has what the organisation\u2019s co-founder Emma Rees describes as a \u201cdistributed clipping team\u201d, in which all media channels are monitored day and night by volunteers around the country. They wait to pounce on that precise moment when \u201ca Labour MP has said something good, or a Tory MP has said something terrible\u201d and get it trending. The Conservative party \u2013 bruised early on by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance\" title=\"\">unethical edit of Keir Starmer being interviewed by Piers Morgan</a> \u2013 is more likely to rely on foghorn sites such as Guido Fawkes and Breitbart to do its clip-attack work.</p> <p>If the mechanics of this process are increasingly transparent, the effect is more difficult to measure. The viral interview clips that have made headlines in this campaign have mostly gained traction because they seem to illustrate a broader truth: Rees-Mogg\u2019s patrician self-regard, in imagining himself escaping the inferno is which others perished, amplified a perception that the Tories were criminally out of touch; Aitchison\u2019s 12.5 seconds of \u201cdead air\u201d served to dramatise Labour\u2019s wider difficulty over allegations of antisemitism; Swinson\u2019s dodgy graphs appeared to illuminate a degree of exaggerated ambition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45d091f2723824ee317781bcde00da5e708b427c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45d091f2723824ee317781bcde00da5e708b427c/0_226_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Marr, here interviewing Sajid Javid, admits he looks at the impact his shows have online.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Marr, here interviewing Sajid Javid, admits he looks at the impact his shows have online.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does this potential for great internet excitement change the way that interviewers approach their subjects, as Gibb argued? Andrew Marr recently suggested that he measured success in two ways when faced with a guarded politician. \u201cI judge myself by the newspaper stories and the online stories that follow any particular programme,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut secondly, at the same time, for the couple of million people watching the show, I really want them to be able to understand the person on the other side of conversation better.\u201d</p> <p>And does it change the way that politicians approach the media? Channel 4\u2019s Cathy Newman took to Twitter last week to express dismay that the leading lights of the government and opposition no longer felt duty bound to submit themselves to questioning. The old Mephistophelean exchange on which political interviews are based \u2013 trading publicity for scrutiny \u2013 has also been disrupted by social media. The prime minister can trot out no end of homemade videos in which he brews cups of tea and answers questions no harder than the name of his favourite pop group, and trust that at least part of the electorate won\u2019t notice the difference. The easiest way to minimise potential damage is to minimise the number of interviews which could produce damaging clips. And, when that fails, to keep any such interviews short.</p> <p>Perhaps the most famous moment in the history of TV political interviewing came when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/02/david-frost-interview-frost-nixon\" title=\"\">David Frost extracted his mea culpa from Richard Nixon</a>. That ultimate clippable moment was not the result of five-minute jugular-directed questioning, however, but long hours of attritional listening and insidious charm. Frost\u2019s forensic researcher James Reston Jr reflected of that moment: \u201cThe first and greatest sin of the deception of television is that it simplifies; it diminishes great, complex ideas, stretches of time; whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.\u201d</p> <p>If news stations understand the force of that fact, then so do politicians and their strategists. The interview clips that have gone viral in the current campaign are not always the ones that illustrate the most urgent news item. On Thursday morning, it appeared for once that damaging facts might upend the government\u2019s election argument, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/14/ae-waiting-times-in-england-hit-worst-ever-level\" title=\"\">the desperate figures</a> for waiting times in NHS A&amp;E departments were released. In response, Twitter found health secretary Matt Hancock making selfies in a West Country field where a health centre was apparently planned. Interview clips of Priti Patel, meanwhile, started trending, revealing her refusal to answer a question about whether the Conservatives would increase or decrease immigration numbers. The clip appeared to show the Home Secretary cornered by the journalist, prevaricating. But it also served, online, to switch the focus away from those headline NHS figures \u2013 and perhaps imply that most cynical of all current political equations, that waiting times in A&amp;E were getting longer not because of cuts to services, but because of unchecked immigration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4322a14b7dbf70a8e5dc41165233de6bdcfc9416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4322a14b7dbf70a8e5dc41165233de6bdcfc9416/0_170_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MIchael Gove has been giving the impression that he isn\u2019t taking media encounters entirely seriously.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MIchael Gove has been giving the impression that he isn\u2019t taking media encounters entirely seriously.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Gove appears to be using this election campaign to test just that kind of \u201cevolved\u201d theory of news management. Consider that weird exchange with Andrew Neil on the subject of a second referendum just before campaigning began. In answer to Neil\u2019s typically forthright questions, Gove adopted an unhinged patois, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1184796948617781248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1184800897018355712&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thepoke.co.uk%2F2019%2F10%2F18%2Fmichael-gove-second-ref-aint-gonna-happen%2F\" title=\"\">\u201cdere ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum\u201d</a> that prompted several online observers to gleefully suggest he was stoned. The strange delivery not only guaranteed that the clip racked up views, but also carried the subtext from Gove that the interview format itself was bogus, comic, all a silly game. When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1194554888006623232\" title=\"\">Nick Robinson confronted Gove</a> with a backtrack on a commitment to an inquiry into Islamophobia, also on Thursday, Gove maintained his innocence in a comparable jocular tone. If the interviewee can make the whole process appear contrived or trivial, then it loses its power to hurt.</p> <p>The prime minister, of course, has built his entire career on this principle. He appears to have calculated in this campaign that the more clips there are of him describing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax\" title=\"\">building buses out of wine crates</a> or stepping on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/15/boris-johnson-says-brexit-will-realise-potential-of-country\" title=\"\">shards of shattered cafeti\u00e8res</a>, the less likely he is to be on the wrong end of the kind of brutal dismantling that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/mar/24/boris-johnson-accused-nasty-video\" title=\"\">Eddie Mair\u2019s persistent questioning</a> once delivered. On Friday, on the BBC <em>Breakfast</em> sofa, Johnson was apparently undone by a short, open question from Naga Munchetty about what made him \u201crelatable\u201d to the public. He waffled and mumbled in the same manner that he has been waffling and mumbling in response to brush-offs and fuck-offs from the flooded public in Yorkshire and the north Midlands, before attempting to dismiss the word \u201crelatable\u201d as absurd. Jeremy Vine leapt on to Twitter to congratulate his fellow BBC interrogator for her tactics. But was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/15/boris-johnson-struggles-to-say-what-makes-him-relatable-to-voters-in-bbc-interview-video\" title=\"\">disseminated clip of Johnson muttering</a> about semantics the most damaging possible outcome of their exchange?</p> <p>It would be encouraging to believe that such journalistic moments, magnified by social media, serve to change hearts and minds. The evidence, among polarised news feeds, is not compelling. Paradoxically, the politicians who have lately found themselves unwelcome in party and parliament are not those exposed by interview pratfall and subsequent Twitter outrage, but those who have attempted to trade in the nuttiness of logic and nuance. However forensic the interviewer, when the medium is geared to promote 30 seconds of theatrical slapstick the political winners are not likely to be those wrestling with the difficult truths, but those who are simply least embarrassable.</p> <h2>Sophy Ridge, Sky News </h2> <p><em>Morning anchor started the campaign by exposing Jo Swinson\u2019s double-standards in some of the Lib Dems campaign claims. \u201cThe people that I look up to in the way they interview, are those who just listen very carefully to the answers and then home in on something that they know is a story,\u201d she says.</em></p> <h2>Emily Maitlis, BBC</h2> <p><em>Earlier in the year, an eye-roll from Newsnight\u2019s lead interrogator, as she listened to Barry Gardiner set out Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, was acknowledged to \u201csum up the national mood\u201d. She describes TV interviewing as \u201cMessy. It gets things wrong. It is imperfect \u2013 sometimes laughably so \u2013 [but] sometimes you just nail it.\u201d</em></p> <h2>Emma Barnett, BBC</h2> <p><em>Barnett described the 12.5 seconds in which she waited for an answer from Labour candidate for Pudsey Jane Aitchison about whether it would be appropriate to celebrate the death of Tony Blair as the longest pause of her career. Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman identifies her as the interviewer he most admires.</em></p> <h2>Andrew Marr, BBC</h2> <p><em>The BBC had to apologise to home secretary Priti Patel after Marr accused her of laughing at him while he outlined business leaders\u2019 concerns about Brexit. \u201cI watch body language, sweat, eye movements. I\u2019ll try smiley-gentle, nasty, repetitive ... almost anything to get a fresh or surprising answer,\u201d he says.</em></p> <h2>Nick Ferrari, LBC</h2> <p><em>The Breakfast host is a cheerful scourge of woolly liberalism. His matey interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg, however, produced perhaps the most damaging quote of the campaign to date, when the minister suggested Grenfell Tower victims would have survived had they used \u201ccommon sense\u201d and ignored firefighters\u2019 instructions.</em></p> <h2>Naga Munchetty, BBC</h2> <p><em>On Friday, the Breakfast presenter sat coolly alongside a squirming prime minister while asking him if he had ever used a mop before and why voters found it hard to relate to him. Fellow BBC broadcaster Jeremy Vine tweeted in admiration: \u201cGreat lesson for interviewers, this \u2013 the question so open, and so lethal.\u201d</em></p> <p><em> </em></p>",

Gibb was in charge of BBC political output \u2013 responsible for everything from The Andrew Marr Show to the 2017 election coverage \u2013 before taking on the calamitous role of trying to get May\u2019s tin-eared message over to parliament and the public. Leaving aside the fact that it requires some monumental chutzpah for him of all people to take issue with the culture of broadcast journalism, you can\u2019t honestly watch the progress of the current campaign without seeing some truth in his analysis. The most memorable moments of the grim political fortnight so far have almost all been triggered by short viral clips from broadcast interviews: Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s shameful arrogance about the residents of Grenfell Tower in a conversation with LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari; 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett letting Labour\u2019s Jane Aitchison dangle in silence for 12.5 seconds (count them) while she deliberated whether it was reasonable for a fellow candidate to imagine \u201ccelebrating\u201d the deaths of Tony Blair and Benjamin Netanyahu; Sophy Ridge on Sky asking Jo Swinson to explain the misleading graphs on Lib Dem election leaflets; and pretty much every exchange with the prime minister. Previous campaigns have turned on disastrous media moments \u2013 Gordon Brown and \u201cthat bigoted woman\u201d, Ed Miliband and his bacon sandwich \u2013 but they have generally appeared as accidental exclamation marks in the narrative of electioneering. This, by contrast, is coming to seem a campaign made up of nothing but meme-worthy gaffes and clangers, a live stream that is all heckle and no debate. TV viewers and radio listeners have, apparently, long bought into the idea that it is in the aggressive interview that political presenters earn their sometimes eye-watering salaries. Twitter foregrounds that long-held vicarious desire for them to \u201cgo in hard\u201d on our elected representatives, to catch them out, rather than to tease out genuine dilemmas or complications. Ever since Robin Day first mauled Harold Macmillan on TV in 1958, a ritualistic pattern has been established in which politicians attempt to convey only narrow pre-planned messages, and presenters dramatise the frustration of trying to trip them up. In this arena, as Tony Blair\u2019s spin doctor Tim Allan once observed, \u201cany communication by the politician on his or her terms is regarded [by the journalist and the viewer] as a failure.\u201d Or as the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis had it: \u201cOne of the purposes of what we do is to be seen to be pouring a bucket of custard over powerful people.\u201d Those custard moments have been amplified by dramatic changes in the way that we tend to receive political news. Previously, there was the sense that they might be the cathartic conclusion of a longer strategic conversation. Given the way that interview clips are now shared, however, the bucket and the custard stand alone. One of the most telling demographic changes of the last decade or so is the way in which younger people have switched off TV news. According to the most recent Ofcom report, the average British pensioner watches 33 minutes of real-time TV news a day, but this figure falls to just two minutes among people aged 16-24. These ratios of attention are broadly reversed when it comes to viral messaging. For political campaigners, clipping interviews is easier than knocking doors. Labour\u2019s highly organised Momentum group has what the organisation\u2019s co-founder Emma Rees describes as a \u201cdistributed clipping team\u201d, in which all media channels are monitored day and night by volunteers around the country. They wait to pounce on that precise moment when \u201ca Labour MP has said something good, or a Tory MP has said something terrible\u201d and get it trending. The Conservative party \u2013 bruised early on by its unethical edit of Keir Starmer being interviewed by Piers Morgan \u2013 is more likely to rely on foghorn sites such as Guido Fawkes and Breitbart to do its clip-attack work. If the mechanics of this process are increasingly transparent, the effect is more difficult to measure. The viral interview clips that have made headlines in this campaign have mostly gained traction because they seem to illustrate a broader truth: Rees-Mogg\u2019s patrician self-regard, in imagining himself escaping the inferno is which others perished, amplified a perception that the Tories were criminally out of touch; Aitchison\u2019s 12.5 seconds of \u201cdead air\u201d served to dramatise Labour\u2019s wider difficulty over allegations of antisemitism; Swinson\u2019s dodgy graphs appeared to illuminate a degree of exaggerated ambition. Does this potential for great internet excitement change the way that interviewers approach their subjects, as Gibb argued? Andrew Marr recently suggested that he measured success in two ways when faced with a guarded politician. \u201cI judge myself by the newspaper stories and the online stories that follow any particular programme,\u201d he said. \u201cBut secondly, at the same time, for the couple of million people watching the show, I really want them to be able to understand the person on the other side of conversation better.\u201d And does it change the way that politicians approach the media? Channel 4\u2019s Cathy Newman took to Twitter last week to express dismay that the leading lights of the government and opposition no longer felt duty bound to submit themselves to questioning. The old Mephistophelean exchange on which political interviews are based \u2013 trading publicity for scrutiny \u2013 has also been disrupted by social media. The prime minister can trot out no end of homemade videos in which he brews cups of tea and answers questions no harder than the name of his favourite pop group, and trust that at least part of the electorate won\u2019t notice the difference. The easiest way to minimise potential damage is to minimise the number of interviews which could produce damaging clips. And, when that fails, to keep any such interviews short. Perhaps the most famous moment in the history of TV political interviewing came when David Frost extracted his mea culpa from Richard Nixon. That ultimate clippable moment was not the result of five-minute jugular-directed questioning, however, but long hours of attritional listening and insidious charm. Frost\u2019s forensic researcher James Reston Jr reflected of that moment: \u201cThe first and greatest sin of the deception of television is that it simplifies; it diminishes great, complex ideas, stretches of time; whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.\u201d If news stations understand the force of that fact, then so do politicians and their strategists. The interview clips that have gone viral in the current campaign are not always the ones that illustrate the most urgent news item. On Thursday morning, it appeared for once that damaging facts might upend the government\u2019s election argument, when the desperate figures for waiting times in NHS A&amp;E departments were released. In response, Twitter found health secretary Matt Hancock making selfies in a West Country field where a health centre was apparently planned. Interview clips of Priti Patel, meanwhile, started trending, revealing her refusal to answer a question about whether the Conservatives would increase or decrease immigration numbers. The clip appeared to show the Home Secretary cornered by the journalist, prevaricating. But it also served, online, to switch the focus away from those headline NHS figures \u2013 and perhaps imply that most cynical of all current political equations, that waiting times in A&amp;E were getting longer not because of cuts to services, but because of unchecked immigration. Michael Gove appears to be using this election campaign to test just that kind of \u201cevolved\u201d theory of news management. Consider that weird exchange with Andrew Neil on the subject of a second referendum just before campaigning began. In answer to Neil\u2019s typically forthright questions, Gove adopted an unhinged patois, \u201cdere ain\u2019t gonna be no second referendum\u201d that prompted several online observers to gleefully suggest he was stoned. The strange delivery not only guaranteed that the clip racked up views, but also carried the subtext from Gove that the interview format itself was bogus, comic, all a silly game. When Nick Robinson confronted Gove with a backtrack on a commitment to an inquiry into Islamophobia, also on Thursday, Gove maintained his innocence in a comparable jocular tone. If the interviewee can make the whole process appear contrived or trivial, then it loses its power to hurt. The prime minister, of course, has built his entire career on this principle. He appears to have calculated in this campaign that the more clips there are of him describing building buses out of wine crates or stepping on shards of shattered cafeti\u00e8res, the less likely he is to be on the wrong end of the kind of brutal dismantling that Eddie Mair\u2019s persistent questioning once delivered. On Friday, on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Johnson was apparently undone by a short, open question from Naga Munchetty about what made him \u201crelatable\u201d to the public. He waffled and mumbled in the same manner that he has been waffling and mumbling in response to brush-offs and fuck-offs from the flooded public in Yorkshire and the north Midlands, before attempting to dismiss the word \u201crelatable\u201d as absurd. Jeremy Vine leapt on to Twitter to congratulate his fellow BBC interrogator for her tactics. But was that disseminated clip of Johnson muttering about semantics the most damaging possible outcome of their exchange? It would be encouraging to believe that such journalistic moments, magnified by social media, serve to change hearts and minds. The evidence, among polarised news feeds, is not compelling. Paradoxically, the politicians who have lately found themselves unwelcome in party and parliament are not those exposed by interview pratfall and subsequent Twitter outrage, but those who have attempted to trade in the nuttiness of logic and nuance. However forensic the interviewer, when the medium is geared to promote 30 seconds of theatrical slapstick the political winners are not likely to be those wrestling with the difficult truths, but those who are simply least embarrassable. Sophy Ridge, Sky News Morning anchor started the campaign by exposing Jo Swinson\u2019s double-standards in some of the Lib Dems campaign claims. \u201cThe people that I look up to in the way they interview, are those who just listen very carefully to the answers and then home in on something that they know is a story,\u201d she says. Emily Maitlis, BBC Earlier in the year, an eye-roll from Newsnight\u2019s lead interrogator, as she listened to Barry Gardiner set out Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, was acknowledged to \u201csum up the national mood\u201d. She describes TV interviewing as \u201cMessy. It gets things wrong. It is imperfect \u2013 sometimes laughably so \u2013 [but] sometimes you just nail it.\u201d Emma Barnett, BBC Barnett described the 12.5 seconds in which she waited for an answer from Labour candidate for Pudsey Jane Aitchison about whether it would be appropriate to celebrate the death of Tony Blair as the longest pause of her career. Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman identifies her as the interviewer he most admires. Andrew Marr, BBC The BBC had to apologise to home secretary Priti Patel after Marr accused her of laughing at him while he outlined business leaders\u2019 concerns about Brexit. \u201cI watch body language, sweat, eye movements. I\u2019ll try smiley-gentle, nasty, repetitive ... almost anything to get a fresh or surprising answer,\u201d he says. Nick Ferrari, LBC The Breakfast host is a cheerful scourge of woolly liberalism. His matey interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg, however, produced perhaps the most damaging quote of the campaign to date, when the minister suggested Grenfell Tower victims would have survived had they used \u201ccommon sense\u201d and ignored firefighters\u2019 instructions. Naga Munchetty, BBC On Friday, the Breakfast presenter sat coolly alongside a squirming prime minister while asking him if he had ever used a mop before and why voters found it hard to relate to him. Fellow BBC broadcaster Jeremy Vine tweeted in admiration: \u201cGreat lesson for interviewers, this \u2013 the question so open, and so lethal.\u201d",
