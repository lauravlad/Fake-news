      "body": "<p>As Professor Judith Okely notes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/01/gypsy-life-in-essex-is-brushed-over\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 2 July), John Constable does indeed include a Gypsy woman and her baby in his 1828 painting of the Vale of Dedham, but this is unlikely to be as a sign of sympathy. Constable had no time for agricultural labourers, whom he regarded as potential agitators and troublemakers, and even less for Travellers. It is true that his Gypsy is in the foreground of his composition, but this only highlights her isolation from the community signified by the village in the background.</p> <p>An important formal source for Constable\u2019s picture is Claude\u2019s Hagar and the Angel, and it may be that the links between the two works go beyond structural similarity. The Bible tells that Hagar became pregnant by Abraham, but left his house after an understandable row with Abraham\u2019s childless wife Sarah. The angel is sent to require Hagar\u2019s return to her previous abode (submission to the established authority). I doubt the reactionary Constable (a natural Brexiteer \u201cavant la lettre\u201d) would have been praising the Gypsy\u2019s right to choose her own lifestyle; rather he would have been intimating the need for her to live according to the dictates of her \u201cbetters\u201d.<br><strong>Ed Lilley</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 Had the picture of Harlow Market Square that David Reed disparages (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/28/essex-lies-and-stereotypes\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 29 June) been taken on the day it appeared, it would have looked very different. The town centre was filled with colourful stalls representing the community under the banner of Harlow Showcase. And his first sentence is an insult to the memory of master planner Sir Frederick Gibberd and his colleagues on Harlow Development Corporation. Of course a town built during the genuine austerity postwar years could not compete with, say, Nash\u2019s Bath terraces or Brussels\u2019 Grande Place. (Incidentally, the clock in the picture commemorates the corporation\u2019s first general manager, Eric Adams.) But it did provide well-built, affordable, homes in a clean and green environment, together with an amazingly rich cultural life. For the working classes who moved to Harlow from east London in the 50s, 60s and 70s \u2013 many of them, or their descendants, are still in those houses \u2013 it was a transformation. Today, like many other urban areas, Harlow has problems. The privatisation of the town\u2019s assets, which should have been devolved to the community when the corporation completed its work, by the Thatcher government, the sale of council houses ditto, and the further cuts by more recent Tory governments, have made life generally much harder for everyone. But it is still a great place to live. At this time of year it is especially beautiful, with green everywhere. And as \u201cSculpture Town\u201d, it is unique.<br><strong>Frank Jackson</strong><br><em>Harlow, Essex</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "As Professor Judith Okely notes (Letters, 2 July), John Constable does indeed include a Gypsy woman and her baby in his 1828 painting of the Vale of Dedham, but this is unlikely to be as a sign of sympathy. Constable had no time for agricultural labourers, whom he regarded as potential agitators and troublemakers, and even less for Travellers. It is true that his Gypsy is in the foreground of his composition, but this only highlights her isolation from the community signified by the village in the background. An important formal source for Constable\u2019s picture is Claude\u2019s Hagar and the Angel, and it may be that the links between the two works go beyond structural similarity. The Bible tells that Hagar became pregnant by Abraham, but left his house after an understandable row with Abraham\u2019s childless wife Sarah. The angel is sent to require Hagar\u2019s return to her previous abode (submission to the established authority). I doubt the reactionary Constable (a natural Brexiteer \u201cavant la lettre\u201d) would have been praising the Gypsy\u2019s right to choose her own lifestyle; rather he would have been intimating the need for her to live according to the dictates of her \u201cbetters\u201d. Ed Lilley Bristol \u2022 Had the picture of Harlow Market Square that David Reed disparages (Letters, 29 June) been taken on the day it appeared, it would have looked very different. The town centre was filled with colourful stalls representing the community under the banner of Harlow Showcase. And his first sentence is an insult to the memory of master planner Sir Frederick Gibberd and his colleagues on Harlow Development Corporation. Of course a town built during the genuine austerity postwar years could not compete with, say, Nash\u2019s Bath terraces or Brussels\u2019 Grande Place. (Incidentally, the clock in the picture commemorates the corporation\u2019s first general manager, Eric Adams.) But it did provide well-built, affordable, homes in a clean and green environment, together with an amazingly rich cultural life. For the working classes who moved to Harlow from east London in the 50s, 60s and 70s \u2013 many of them, or their descendants, are still in those houses \u2013 it was a transformation. Today, like many other urban areas, Harlow has problems. The privatisation of the town\u2019s assets, which should have been devolved to the community when the corporation completed its work, by the Thatcher government, the sale of council houses ditto, and the further cuts by more recent Tory governments, have made life generally much harder for everyone. But it is still a great place to live. At this time of year it is especially beautiful, with green everywhere. And as \u201cSculpture Town\u201d, it is unique.

And it works, since the messaging is effective within the fact-vacuum of home counties conservatism, where non-negotiable withdrawal agreements can, in fact, be renegotiated and huge, lasting damage to the UK\u2019s economy is a price worth paying for the right to be poorer for decades afterwards. More worrying for the party\u2019s Ulster supporters \u2013 and their fellow travellers within the DUP \u2013 is when asked to accept the premise that a hard border would pose an existential threat to either Brexit or the union, a clear majority of leavers now say they would happily help their Ulster cousins pack their bags. For Northern Irish people, this failure to acknowledge what a border is, and how every border on Earth has ever worked, was Brexit\u2019s original sin \u2013 the first dead canary in the caved-in coalmine of nonsense British politics has since become. Northern Ireland has long been regarded as a dribbling basket case with a retrograde polity of cranks and dinosaurs, so dysfunctional that it is currently in its 906th day of suspended government. It\u2019s miraculous that Westminster has debased itself so fully that we now appear to be the adults in the room, presenting stubborn facts and inconvenient truths, that have been studiously, and perilously, ignored. \u2022 S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly is a writer from Derry",

      "body": "<p>How does public investment in the arts shape our culture? And why should we care?</p> <p>These are the questions facing New South Wales right now following the minister for the arts Don Harwin\u2019s announcement that artist peer assessment for arts grants <a href=\"https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/news-and-publications/news/simpler-nsw-arts-funding-launched-with-call-for-expert-artform-boards-2/\">has been replaced by \u201cart form boards\u201d of his choosing</a>, and that dedicated funding for artistic projects no longer exists. Artists will now have to compete directly with requests for major capital infrastructure in one and the same funding round, making NSW likely the only government in the world to end its commitment to artists as central to funding programs.</p> <p>The announcement last Friday has concerned artists and sector bodies, especially given the minister\u2019s direct interference in past funding rounds to prioritise capital expenditure or specific electorates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/28/stop-stealing-from-us-nsws-demoralising-raid-on-arts-funding-should-concern-the-nation\">\u2018Stop stealing from us\u2019: NSW's demoralising raid on arts funding should concern the nation | Ben Eltham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year Harwin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/28/stop-stealing-from-us-nsws-demoralising-raid-on-arts-funding-should-concern-the-nation\">redirected $400,000 out of an already peer-assessed project funding round</a> towards the capital infrastructure needs of one organisation, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. That interference was revealed only through <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-26/arts-groups-miss-out-as-minister-funds-special-project/10298452\">exhaustive freedom of information research by the ABC</a>. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/sydney-symphony-orchestra-harwin-arts-grant-20181220-p50ngf.html\">returned the money soon afterwards</a>. Earlier this year, the minister took<a href=\"https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-14/nsw-ministers-accused-of-pork-barrelling-over-regional-arts-fund/10898154\"> money from two future funding rounds to give it to projects in Liberal or National electorates ahead of the NSW election</a>, which was also revealed by the ABC.</p> <p>The reintroduction of art form boards creates a great deal of confusion. Since the Australia Council rejected that structure following an independent review in 2012 in response to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-21/30204\">long-held artist and sector concerns</a>,<strong> </strong>Australia\u2019s funding bodies have assessed projects through peer review. This means a diverse pool of arts practitioners with extensive art form and industry knowledge debate funding decisions rigorously, based on ongoing engagement with the work of their peers.</p> <p>Art form-specific boards present problems. How do you define an art form? What if an artist works across more than one? Given the NSW government hasn\u2019t proposed funding programs specific to each board, will the applications be assessed multiple times, first by an art form board then in a separate shortlisting process? Will there instead be art form-specific quotas? Or will there be art form-specific funding pools within each round? How would such amounts be determined?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Artists and organisations are reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, it\u2019s artists and not governments who determine art forms. Which \u201cart form\u201d board would Wiradjuri conceptual artist Amala Groom choose for her socially engaged practice across diverse media? Or Justine Youssef, who works across performance, video, scent and collaboration? What about Skye Gellman, whose practice shifts between stage, installation, circus, site-specific, photography and video work?</p> <p>These NSW artists are known regionally, nationally and internationally and have won multiple awards \u2013 but what about artists who are only just emerging? Which box do they tick? And if they can\u2019t decide, or if they tick the wrong one, what disadvantage will befall their career when people who are not their peers judge their work \u2013 whether that assessment results in funding or not?</p> <p>That question of judgment is fraught, especially in a situation where political interference has already marred such judgment.</p> <p>When a minister <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/largest-arts-funding-shake-up-in-a-decade-announced-20190627-p521rc.html\">chooses 10 \u201cart form\u201d boards, selects the chair of each one and works with that chair to appoint members,</a> it\u2019s difficult for taxpayers to have confidence in the integrity of their decisions. Especially with arts projects and capital infrastructure requests now explicitly in the one funding pool, so there\u2019s no longer any need for the minister to hide non-artistic grants.</p> <p>Despite applications currently being open to join an art form board, all artists and organisations who\u2019ve raised this new framework with me are reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences. Indeed, with no dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s difficult to understand where artists fit in this structure. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.copyright.com.au/2018/06/nsw-government-non-payment-an-update-from-our-ceo/\">the NSW government is in court with the Copyright Agency</a>: NSW is the only state or territory in Australia that refuses to pay writers and visual artists fairly for the use of their intellectual property. And it\u2019s the only government that actively <a href=\"http://apraamcos.com.au/news/2019/february/nsw-australias-new-festival-free-zone/\">jeopardises its live music and festivals industries</a> through unworkable regulation.</p> <p>Of course, only a small fraction of artists seek or earn public investment through grants. Yet all artists look to arts and cultural policies as a marker of how their work is valued by society. And all arts organisations expect governments to set policies that help creative businesses thrive. Otherwise, remaining in NSW becomes less and less practical for artists.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/03/years-of-savage-cuts-leave-australian-cultural-institutions-struggling-to-survive\">Australian cultural institutions struggle to survive as War Memorial gets half-billion dollar upgrade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW government already spends less on arts and cultural activity per capita than other state governments and just over half of Victoria\u2019s spend, <a href=\"https://www.create.nsw.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Economic-Value-of-Arts-Screen-and-Culture-2018-Report.pdf\">according to KPMG analysis</a>. Meanwhile, artists\u2019 incomes are falling, it\u2019s taking longer for them to become established in their field, and their career prospects are dwindling, <a href=\"https://australiacouncil.gov.au/research/making-art-work/\">according to research by the Australia Council</a>. These trends suggest the clear and urgent priorities for the arts in NSW which are not at all addressed by the new framework.</p> <p>Courageous ministers with ambition place their confidence in artists, recognising artists\u2019 power to create the invigorating experiences, indelible images and compelling stories as our society\u2019s conscience and cultural record. The power of the artist should not be feared; it should be welcomed and embraced by policy that\u2019s ambitious and fair.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Esther Anatolitis is the executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "How does public investment in the arts shape our culture? And why should we care? These are the questions facing New South Wales right now following the minister for the arts Don Harwin\u2019s announcement that artist peer assessment for arts grants has been replaced by \u201cart form boards\u201d of his choosing, and that dedicated funding for artistic projects no longer exists. Artists will now have to compete directly with requests for major capital infrastructure in one and the same funding round, making NSW likely the only government in the world to end its commitment to artists as central to funding programs. The announcement last Friday has concerned artists and sector bodies, especially given the minister\u2019s direct interference in past funding rounds to prioritise capital expenditure or specific electorates. Last year Harwin redirected $400,000 out of an already peer-assessed project funding round towards the capital infrastructure needs of one organisation, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. That interference was revealed only through exhaustive freedom of information research by the ABC. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra returned the money soon afterwards. Earlier this year, the minister took money from two future funding rounds to give it to projects in Liberal or National electorates ahead of the NSW election, which was also revealed by the ABC. The reintroduction of art form boards creates a great deal of confusion. Since the Australia Council rejected that structure following an independent review in 2012 in response to long-held artist and sector concerns, Australia\u2019s funding bodies have assessed projects through peer review. This means a diverse pool of arts practitioners with extensive art form and industry knowledge debate funding decisions rigorously, based on ongoing engagement with the work of their peers. Art form-specific boards present problems. How do you define an art form? What if an artist works across more than one? Given the NSW government hasn\u2019t proposed funding programs specific to each board, will the applications be assessed multiple times, first by an art form board then in a separate shortlisting process? Will there instead be art form-specific quotas? Or will there be art form-specific funding pools within each round? How would such amounts be determined? Of course, it\u2019s artists and not governments who determine art forms. Which \u201cart form\u201d board would Wiradjuri conceptual artist Amala Groom choose for her socially engaged practice across diverse media? Or Justine Youssef, who works across performance, video, scent and collaboration? What about Skye Gellman, whose practice shifts between stage, installation, circus, site-specific, photography and video work? These NSW artists are known regionally, nationally and internationally and have won multiple awards \u2013 but what about artists who are only just emerging? Which box do they tick? And if they can\u2019t decide, or if they tick the wrong one, what disadvantage will befall their career when people who are not their peers judge their work \u2013 whether that assessment results in funding or not? That question of judgment is fraught, especially in a situation where political interference has already marred such judgment. When a minister chooses 10 \u201cart form\u201d boards, selects the chair of each one and works with that chair to appoint members, it\u2019s difficult for taxpayers to have confidence in the integrity of their decisions. Especially with arts projects and capital infrastructure requests now explicitly in the one funding pool, so there\u2019s no longer any need for the minister to hide non-artistic grants. Despite applications currently being open to join an art form board, all artists and organisations who\u2019ve raised this new framework with me are reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences. Indeed, with no dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s difficult to understand where artists fit in this structure. At the same time, the NSW government is in court with the Copyright Agency: NSW is the only state or territory in Australia that refuses to pay writers and visual artists fairly for the use of their intellectual property. And it\u2019s the only government that actively jeopardises its live music and festivals industries through unworkable regulation. Of course, only a small fraction of artists seek or earn public investment through grants. Yet all artists look to arts and cultural policies as a marker of how their work is valued by society. And all arts organisations expect governments to set policies that help creative businesses thrive. Otherwise, remaining in NSW becomes less and less practical for artists. The NSW government already spends less on arts and cultural activity per capita than other state governments and just over half of Victoria\u2019s spend, according to KPMG analysis. Meanwhile, artists\u2019 incomes are falling, it\u2019s taking longer for them to become established in their field, and their career prospects are dwindling, according to research by the Australia Council. These trends suggest the clear and urgent priorities for the arts in NSW which are not at all addressed by the new framework. Courageous ministers with ambition place their confidence in artists, recognising artists\u2019 power to create the invigorating experiences, indelible images and compelling stories as our society\u2019s conscience and cultural record. The power of the artist should not be feared; it should be welcomed and embraced by policy that\u2019s ambitious and fair. \u2022 Esther Anatolitis is the executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts",
