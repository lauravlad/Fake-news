      "bodyText": "A series of announcements of major new infrastructure projects in hospitals and transport to mark the start of the Conservative conference has prompted criticism after it emerged much of the spending was either not new or notably less ambitious than billed. Labour was particularly scathing about a package of transport measures headlined with \u00a325bn in already-declared funds for road improvements, calling it a \u201ccombination of re-announcements and damp squibs\u201d. The main pre-conference spending pledge, presented as \u00a313bn to build 40 new hospitals, fell apart after it emerged that the actual money committed so far, \u00a33bn, would go to just six NHS trusts, which had plans already in place for hospitals in need of rebuilding. Another 21 trusts would receive much smaller sums, but only to assist preparatory work for plans to take place almost a decade from now. Speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative conference in Manchester, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, stuck to the official line, saying the government was committed to \u201c40 new hospital projects\u201d. Hancock said the plans would survive future spending decision rounds: \u201cWe\u2019ll have that debate in the spending review. But the thing is I\u2019ve got absolute rock-solid support from the prime minister for what I\u2019ve needed to do.\u201d He also said the \u00a33bn extra would be in addition to an already announced \u00a31.8bn tranche of funding for NHS building repairs. Hancock also claimed that Labour would not support the extra spending, something rejected by Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who said he was simply querying the opaqueness of the plans. The news about the hospitals was heavily trailed in newspapers on Sunday as part of a government PR push on the NHS, with Boris Johnson calling it \u201cthe biggest hospital building programme in a generation\u201d. However, Ashworth said, this had \u201cquickly unravelled as spin\u201d. \u201cThis isn\u2019t 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,\u201d he said. \u201cNew investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this.\u201d The subsequent announcement of spending on roads, buses and internet connectivity, was unveiled by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as \u201cthe first step in our plans to deliver an infrastructure revolution\u201d. \u201cInvestment in our infrastructure will be key to making the next decade one of renewal \u2013 boosting our economy and making life easier for people all across the country,\u201d Javid said. However, the Treasury said that the only new element in the main part of the announcement, \u00a325bn to upgrade roads over five years, was confirmation of which specific projects had been chosen as the first to go ahead. The actual sum was announced last year in the form of the government\u2019s second so-called road investment strategy, with many of the 14 specific road projects, such as making all the A66 trans-Pennine road dual carriageway, also unveiled at the time. Another major element, \u00a3220m for what is billed as a national bus strategy to improve services across England, including money on electric buses, was announced at the last government spending round, with the only news being how it will be spent. The Treasury said, however, that all but \u00a3200m of an announced \u00a35bn to improve full-fibre and 5G internet networks was new. However, Labour said that according to the National Infrastructure Commission, building and maintaining a national full-fibre network would cost more than \u00a333bn. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThis combination of re-announcements and damp squibs shows up the real difference between the parties: the Tories tinkering around the edges, versus Labour\u2019s fundamental shift of power and wealth from the few \u2013 to the many. \u201cA hundred and thirteen times more for roads than for public transport makes a mockery of the Tories\u2019 so-called green credentials. \u201cAnd yet another headline pledge, this time on broadband, turns out to be false: Boris Johnson called for full-fibre for all premises by 2025, but the chancellor now says he\u2019ll invest \u00a35bn in lower grade \u2018gigabit-capable\u2019 technology, less than a sixth of what it will take to deliver full fibre to all.\u201d",

She was also allowed to join two mayoral trade missions despite initially being told her firm did not qualify. Andrew Marr put it to Johnson that he was bound at mayor by a code of conduct saying he was not meant to take decisions to gain benefits for family or friends. Asked if he had declared his friendship with Arcuri, Johnson at first just said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of everything that he did as mayor and that \u201ceverything was done in accordance with the code ... and everything was done with full propriety\u201d. Asked why he did not declare this interest, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was no interest to declare.</p> </blockquote> <p>This could be significant because it puts pressure on Johnson to explain the full nature of his full relationship with Arcuri.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson claimed that the Arcuri allegations about him were politically motivated and driven by critics opposed to Brexit.</strong> Marr asked if Johnson was embarrassed by the story, saying Johnson did not look embarrassed. Johnson replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I tell you what I really think is going on. I really think that people can feel this country is approaching an important moment of choice, and we have to get on and we have to deliver Brexit, and I think that there is a large constituency, in parliament and elsewhere, who do want to frustrate that objective. And, rightly or wrongly, they see me as the person most likely to deliver that objective. And I\u2019m going to get on and do it.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Marr asked Johnson if he was saying this attack was politically motivated, Johnson replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think you\u2019ve got to be realistic if you\u2019re in my position. You\u2019ve got to expect a lot of shot and shell.</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson made this claim even though the original Arcuri story was broken by the Sunday Times, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose flagship tabloid paper, the Sun, is now one of the most fervent newspaper supporters of Johnson and his Brexit strategy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson,with Jennifer Arcuri at the Innotech Summit in July 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson,with Jennifer Arcuri at the Innotech Summit in July 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Innotech Network/YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d9074de8f08fbb0c171d7ad\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-29T09:19:18.754Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson rejects claim his language incites violence, saying he has been 'model of restraint'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a summary of what <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said about his use of language in the interview.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Boris Johnson rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. </strong>He was asked if he accepted what <strong>Amber Rudd</strong>, the former work and pensions secretary, said i<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/amber-rudd-the-boris-johnson-s-casual-approach-to-the-safety-of-mps-is-immoral-a4248456.html\">n an interview with the Evening Standard last week.</a> <strong>Andrew Marr</strong> quoted Rudd as saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from Number 10 does incite violence ...

One of the interesting questions to be explored this week is whether that is compatible with also being a party hell-bent on delivering Brexit, possibly the hardest version available.</p> <p>But a more pressing question, of course, is how the prime minister expects to deliver Brexit when no deal with the EU has emerged, he has lost his majority in parliament and MPs have legislated to try to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> <p>This morning\u2019s papers, which are full of interviews and briefings to mark the opening today\u2019s Conservative party conference in Manchester, shed very little light on what Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy might be. But they are illuminating about his election strategy, which as we know involves depicting himself as the champion of the people, trying to deliver Brexit in the face of opposition from parliament. And one headline pushes this proposition almost to the point of absurdity.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Boris Johnson has suggested that the EU was involved in helping his Brexit critics draw up the Benn Act, the legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</strong> He raised the idea discreetly in an interview with <strong>Edward Malnick</strong> <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/28/boris-johnson-interview-surrender-act-like-abject-capitulation/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=li-recommendation-widget\">in the Sunday Telegraph (paywall)</a>, saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the case of the surrender act, we don\u2019t know whether or not for instance, the European Union has been consulted on on the surrender act, or European Commission lawyers.</p> </blockquote> <p>But a turbo-charged version of the same allegation has made the Mail on Sunday splash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MoS_Politics/status/1178047071519215616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8NO10 LAUNCH \u2018FOREIGN COLLUSION\u2019 PROBE INTO REMAINER PLOTTING WITH FRANCE \ud83d\udea8 <a href=\"https://t.co/ejj7XfIKOM\">pic.twitter.com/ejj7XfIKOM</a></p>&mdash; MoS_Politics (@MoS_Politics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoS_Politics/status/1178047071519215616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7516083/No-10-probes-MPs-foreign-collusion-amid-plot-John-Bercow-send-surrender-letter-Brussels.html\">In his story</a>, the Mail on Sunday\u2019s <strong>Glen Owen</strong> writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Downing Street has launched a major investigation into alleged links between foreign governments and the MPs behind the \u2018Surrender Act\u2019 which could force <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/boris_johnson/index.html\">Boris Johnson</a> to delay <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/brexit/index.html\">Brexit</a>, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.</p> <p>Sources said No 10 took the unprecedented action after officials received intelligence that the MPs, including former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, had received help drafting the Bill from members of the French government and the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/european-union/index.html\">European Union</a> ...</p> <p>Last night, a senior No 10 source said: \u2018The government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn [who tabled the Bill] and their involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities. Governments have proper rules for drafting legislation, but nobody knows what organisations are pulling these strings.</p> <p>\u2018We will demand the disclosure of all details of their personal communications with other states. The drafting of primary legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p>The Mail on Sunday does not produce evidence to back up this claim. But the main point is that there is nothing unusual about British politicians discussing Brexit with their EU counterparts. The leading Tory Brexiters Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith had <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/politics/2019/04/12/owen-paterson-mp-in-brussels-talks-over-brexit-plan/\">their own meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier this year, </a>but no one started talking about \u201ccollusion\u201d. And, given that the Benn Act requires the PM to request an article 50 extension under certain conditions, it would be surprising if those behind it did not make some inquiries as to what length extension might be acceptable to the EU. The act settled on three months.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson has escalated his criticism of the Benn Act, calling it not just the \u201csurrender\u201d act but the \u201cabject capitulation act\u201d.</strong> The term surrender act has been condemned on the grounds that, by depicting the act\u2019s backers as people collaborating with an enemy, it could incite violence against them. But <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/28/boris-johnson-interview-surrender-act-like-abject-capitulation/?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=li-recommendation-widget\">in his Sunday Telegraph interview (paywall) </a>Johnson was unrepentant about the phrase. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I won\u2019t be bullied off use of that term. It seems to me a perfectly humdrum political metaphor.</p> <p>Actually, when you read the the text of the Benn Act, the \u2018abject capitulation act\u2019 might be just as good a term for it, because it would attempt to force the prime minister of the UK to write a letter requesting to stay in the EU, and it would ... allow the EU to decide how long we would stay on in the EU.</p> <p>If that isn\u2019t an attempt of the wholesale destruction of a country\u2019s negotiating position, I don\u2019t know what is.</p> <p>So I think my language was really quite moderate.</p> </blockquote> <p>As explained before, Johnson\u2019s account of what the act does is not correct. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice. HuffPost\u2019s <strong>Paul Waugh</strong> says if any surrendering is involved, it is not to the EU, but to parliament. (And, remember: Brexit was supposed to be about restoring the sovereignty of parliament.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1177492744849113088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What the Benn Act really does is fetter a PM&#39;s power to decide how he wants to engage with the EU.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has ramped up speculation that he is planning to bypass a law that stops the UK from crashing out of the EU without a deal. Johnson was speaking in a long interview with Andrew Marr in which he also rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. See 11.44am for a full summary. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said that her party would consider agreeing to the Irish backstop provided it were time limited. (See 6.12pm.) In the past the DUP has said that even a temporary version of the backstop would make a Brexit deal unacceptable. Downing Street has categorically denied a claim that Johnson groped the journalist Charlotte Edwardes. In a column in the Sunday Times, Edwardes said the incident took place at the offices of the Spectator magazine in London shortly after Johnson became editor in 1999. After the lunch she spoke to the young woman sitting on the other side of Johnson who said the same thing had happened to her. Describing what happened, Edwardes said: I\u2019m seated on Johnson\u2019s right; on his left is a young woman I know. More wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright. A Number 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe allegation is untrue.\u201d Sources said the quote related to the allegation that Johnson put his hand on Edwardes\u2019 knee. Sources close to Johnson are said to be furious at the claim, which has been described as \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister, said Johnson had serious questions to answer. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has said the EU \u201ccan\u2019t last long\u201d in its current form. (See 4.30pm.) Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has suggested that delaying Brexit could cause more damage than a no-deal one on 31 October. (See 3.45pm.) David Gauke has rejected the idea that former Tory rebels colluded with foreign powers to block a no-deal Brexit, and called on No 10 to stop using the tactics and language of Donald Trump. As Bloomberg\u2019s Kitty Donaldson reports, Dominic Grieve, one of those Tory rebels, has said he has received a death threat following the publication of Number 10\u2019s \u201ccollusion\u201d allegation in the Mail on Sunday. The government is \u201clooking very seriously\u201d at making vaccinations compulsory for state school pupils and has taken advice on how such a law could work, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the quote from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, telling a fringe at the party conference that her party would consider agreeing to a time-limited Irish backstop. (See 5.20pm.) Foster said: In terms of the time-limited backstop, can I remind you what Leo Varadkar thinks of the time-limited backstop - he says it is not a backstop at all. And so in terms of the time-limited backstop we have said in the past it is something we would look at. I don\u2019t think it is something that Leo Varadkar would look at, but certainly if a time-limited backstop was on offer it is something that we would look at but I don\u2019t believe it is at this present moment in time. But Foster also said that she was adamant that Northern Ireland had to \u201cleave on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom\u201d in relation to customs arrangements. She said: We cannot have internal customs borders within the United Kingdom ... it has constitutional implications as well as economic implications. Actually when you think of the amount of trade we does east-west and west-east it completely blows out of the water the North-South trade. I\u2019m not saying the north-south trade is not important - it is of course important - but our east-west trade is much more important. In the official text of the speech he delivered earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, is quoted as saying: On the right we have Nigel Farage \u2013 supported by the finest politician we have sent to Brussels \u2013 my sister. However we must not delude ourselves into thinking that a vote for the Brexit party does anything other than increase the risk of Brexit being cancelled entirely. But when he was delivering his speech, Rees-Mogg including four words before Farage\u2019s name not in the original text. I have flagged them up in bold. On the right we have the in many ways admirable Nigel Farage ... Rees-Mogg is an arch Brexiter and so it is not surprising that he thinks like this. And of course his sister, Annunziata, is a Brexit party MEP. But it is definitely not the approved line from Tory HQ. Earlier this month a senior party source briefed journalists that Farage and his sidekick Arron Banks were not \u201cfit and proper persons and ... should never be allowed anywhere near government.\u201d Talking of the DUP, Arlene Foster, its leader, has been speaking at a fringe meeting at the conference. Here are some excerpts. These are from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne, Politico Europe\u2019s Charlie Cooper, and the Sun\u2019s Kate Ferguson. In the Q&amp;A in the conference hall this afternoon the panel was also asked why there were grounds to think a Brexit deal might get through parliament now, when MPs voted Theresa May\u2019s down three times. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, replied: I think the mood has changed in the country at large, that everybody now wants to leave and start talking about other things. And I think that\u2019s true in the House of Commons as well. And I think if the DUP are happy with the deal, there will be very few Conservatives, including those who are without the whip, who are against a deal. And at that point there are a number of people in other parties who think that, yes, we must now just finish this. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has posted this in response to the Matthew d\u2019Ancona tweet I featured earlier. (See 2.04pm.) In between their speeches Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Barclay answered a few questions on stage posed by a moderator, the Telegraph\u2019s Brexit editor Dia Chakravarty. The most interesting answers came when Chakravarty asked if they thought that other countries would follow the UK and leave the EU. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said he did not think the EU would survive long in its current form. In response to the question about whether other countries would leave, he replied: Well, they would if they\u2019d got any sense, wouldn\u2019t they? Rees-Mogg went on: I think the problems with the euro are so deep-seated that the current Euro project, European Union project, can\u2019t last long into the future. But things often last longer than one anticipates. Michael Gove said he did not expect any other countries to join the UK in leaving. He replied: I don\u2019t think so ... I think there are particular reasons why Britain was right to leave the European Union at this time, and I respect the right of other nations to forge their own future. So, my own hunch is Britain will leave, other countries will stay, but 10, 15, 20 years on, I think we may see a very different European Union from the one we have now. For Gove, this marks something a U-turn. In 2016, during the EU referendum, he gave a speech saying Brexit could lead to the \u201cdemocratic liberation of a whole continent\u201d as other countries followed the UK and left. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just finished his speech. Here are the main points. Barclay urged people to embrace the opportunities of Brexit. It\u2019s time to stop apologising for Brexit, and to unleash the opportunities it offers. We can source products that we do not produce at a better price. Too often the EU restricts access to markets that want to trade with us\u2026 Like the foods that we do not grow, or the goods that we do not specialise in producing, With new trade deals with other countries we can help the developing world through trade, rather than handing out aid. To empower countries through free trade is the essence of being Conservative, and an important reason why I am a Brexiteer. He urged EU states to match the UK in terms of offering to protect the right of nationals after Brexit. We value the contribution you make to our country and are pleased that you have chosen to make your home here. We have guaranteed your rights to live, work and stay in the UK with full citizens rights for as long as you choose. Now it is time for the EU to match that guarantee. He claimed delaying Brexit would cost the UK \u00a31bn a month. And it has a massive financial cost - in extra payments to the EU. It costs an extra \u00a31bn in payments to Brussels every month we delay. This is misleading because, if the UK were to get a deal with a transition period until the end of next year, which is its stated goal, the UK would continue to make those payments. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, told the conference in his speech that MPs were holding voters in contempt. He said: The people have spoken. Ladies and gentlemen, you have spoken. We are not your leaders, we are your servants, and it is our responsibility to do what you have willed. Parliament has promised to do it, over 80 per cent of members of parliament were elected on a pledge to respect the result. The sovereignty of parliament does not come to Parliament out of a void. It comes to parliament from the people. Yet this parliament is now holding the people in contempt. They are holding you in contempt. Hence we must have a general election. It is time for a new parliament. A new egg must be laid that will not be addled. We trust the people. Our opponents do not. Gove said in his speech that the UK must leave the EU on 31 October. If necessary, the UK will leave without a deal, he said. The level of our preparations has accelerated massively since Boris became Prime Minister. Of course we cannot anticipate every risk and cannot guarantee against some turbulence. Gove also claimed that, if the UK has to leave the EU without a deal, the difficulties caused \u201cwill pass\u201d. But delaying Brexit would be more damaging, he implied. But if we can\u2019t [get a deal], then leave we must. Because, while the difficulties caused by leaving without a deal will pass, the damage to our democracy in not getting Brexit done would endure, and resound, for much longer. Our democracy is precious - and it depends on people trusting us as politicians - when we say we will put our trust in them. Gove says getting Brexit done will allow the Tories to focus on \u201cwhat matters\u201d, like the NHS, education and crime. He goes on: These are the people\u2019s priorities. They are our priorities. That is why we are the real people\u2019s party. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for no-deal planning, is speaking now. He starts with the message of the conference. 17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. More than have ever voted for any party, or any policy, in our country\u2019s history. But three years on that democratic verdict has not been honoured. We cannot allow this division and delay to continue. We must Get. Brexit. Done. Joking about his relationship with Boris Johnson (Gove scuppered his leadership challenge in 2016), he says Johnson \u201cdelivers\u201d. Now, I\u2019ve known Boris for more than thirty years. And while we haven\u2019t always agreed on everything, let me tell you this. Boris is brave, he is determined, he loves this country, and he delivers. And that is because Boris is an optimist. Raab says the government is committed to a UK version of the Magnitsky law - named after calls for legislation to impose sanctions on those involved in the death of the whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian jail. We will relish not shrink from our duty to take a leading role in bringing the perpetrators of the worst injustices to account. Whether it\u2019s ensuring the release of the two Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar for reporting on the plight of the Rohingya refugees or bringing war criminals to trial from Yugoslavia to the Democratic Republic of Congo. And when we leave the EU, we\u2019ll be able to do even more. So, conference, I can tell you today that we will bring into force a UK Magnitsky law, to place visa bans and asset freezes on those individuals deemed responsible for serious human rights abuses, including torture. Raab says the UK must stand up for freedom around the world. We must never forget the lessons of history. And we must keep the flame of freedom alive in the darkest corners of the bleakest jails. For those struggling for the basic liberties we take for granted\u2026 The right you jealously guard \u2013 here, this week \u2013 to debate, to have your say, to hold your politicians to account. So, we won\u2019t look the other way, when the people of Hong Kong are beaten indiscriminately on commuter trains for exercising the right to peaceful protest. We won\u2019t stand idly by whilst journalists are jailed or beaten up for criticising the despotic regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. And we will never rest until all those bearing UK nationality, detained on a cruel whim in Iran, are free to re-join their loved ones at home. Raab says the British are fed up with EU leaders disrespecting their prime ministers. I think the British people have had more than enough of EU leaders disrespecting British prime ministers. So, we\u2019ll strive in good faith for a deal. But if the EU spurn the opportunity for a win-win deal, We will leave at the end of October \u2026 no ifs, no buts. We want to stay good European neighbours. But we\u2019ll be free to chart our own course, as masters of our own destiny \u2013 at home and abroad, with a more liberal and energetic approach to free trade. (Raab does speculate about what EU leaders may feel about British politicians disrespecting them.) In the conference Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is speaking now. He starts with that is almost a good joke. The truth is we Brits get a warm welcome almost everywhere in world. Ok, maybe not in Luxembourg. There is one opinion poll out today, from Opinium. It gives the Conservatives a very healthy 12-point lead. And these are from Matthew Goodwin, the academic and national populism expert who likes reminding liberals that the have underestimated the potency of populist messages. Thousands of protesters marched through Manchester braving the biblical rain to demonstrate against the government. Amongst the sea of umbrella\u2019s there were drum beats, hooting and chants of \u201cBoris, Out, Out, Out!\u201d. The march named Reject Brexit, Defend Our Democracy- a collaboration between Manchester for Europe and March for Change - set off from the city\u2019s Whitworth Park before heading up Oxford Road and eventually snaking its way to the Manchester Central Convention Complex where the conference is being held. Security remained high with police are forming a \u201cring of steel\u201d around the conference venue, while hundreds of officers surrounded protestors and blocked off roads leading to the convention centre. Boris Johnson sounded confident in his Andrew Marr interview that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. Even though parliament has supposedly legislated to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, Johnson said \u201cof course\u201d the government would be able to bypass this law - although he would not say how. (See 11.44am.) But fewer than half of Conservative party members share Johnson\u2019s confidence, according to a survey for the ConservativeHome website. Its surveys are seen as a reasonably reliable guide to grassroots Tory opinion and this one found just 48% of members saying they think the UK will leave the EU by 31 October. Another 32% said they did not think the UK would leave by that date, and the others said they did not know - which means they also don\u2019t share Johnson\u2019s confidence. Last month 78% of Tory members thought Johnson would achieve his Brexit deadline, ConservativeHome found. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was also speaking at a lunchtime fringe. My colleague Peter Walker was there, and has posted some highlights. (Peter, author of the acclaimed Bike Nation: How Cycling Can Save the World, is something of an expert on this.) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and Jonathan Ashworth, his Labour shadow, have been arguing about the new hospital announcement on Twitter today. After Boris Johnson\u2019s Marr interview, Ashworth posted this. Hancock claimed this meant Labour was opposing the plan. Ashworth responded. James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman, is addressing the conference now. It has just formally opened. According to a news release put out this, he will say that the party has formally signed the armed forces covenant. The news release says: The party will now offer reduced price conference passes to veterans, proactively advertise employment vacancies to the veteran community and strive to accommodate the training and deployment commitments of reserves. The party already offers concessionary membership rates to serving or former members of the armed forces. This builds on the work of the Conservative government to support the armed forces. Since 2010, the Conservatives have enshrined the armed forces covenant in law, launched the first ever UK-wide veterans strategy and awarded ID cards to all veterans, making it easier for ex-forces personnel to access specialist support. Matthew d\u201dAncona from Tortoise says he thinks Boris Johnson was hinting in his Andrew Marr interview that the Tories could end up backing a motion of no confidence in the government this week. Marr thinks d\u2019Ancona may be right. David Gauke, a former cabinet minister, has rejected the idea that ex-Tory rebels colluded with foreign powers to block a no-deal Brexit and warned No 10 to stop using the tactics and language of Donald Trump. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Peter Walker report, the former justice secretary, who had the whip withdrawn by Boris Johnson, responded with dismay to an anonymous briefing from someone in Downing Street that he and others had help from EU countries in drafting the Benn Act to block a no-deal exit on 31 October. In an interview with Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge, Gauke said: It\u2019s not true, and I think here is a very good example of a No 10 briefing, using the word \u2018collusion\u2019 \u2013 and that\u2019s a very potent word in itself \u2013 providing no evidence that there was anything like help with the drafting from foreign countries. Here is the story in full. The North Manchester general hospital is one of 21 NHS trust getting seed funding for redevelopment under the Tory hospital building plan announced today. On his visit to the hospital Boris Johnson said: Talking to the doctors, the nurses, the staff, they\u2019re doing an amazing job but they\u2019re doing it in buildings that were built in 1870, so this is a plan that will cost about \u00a3500m, we\u2019re embarking on that plan now, we\u2019re giving the go-ahead to them to embark on it. They\u2019ll have to take down those old Victorian buildings, they\u2019ll have to build a fantastic new site. It will cost a lot of money but we\u2019ve got to start. He also insisted that this was new money. It is new money. It is bright, shiny, new money coming out of the Treasury in a great geyser. Boris Johnson visited North Manchester general hospital this morning to coincide with his hospital building announcement. (See 9.14am.) The Brexit party has a double-page advert in today\u2019s Sunday Telegraph saying that the Tories face a choice between \u201cclean-break Brexit or surrender\u201d. It goes on: Democracy, or betrayal of 17.4m leave voters. It is time for Conservatives to make up their minds. If the Tories are not ready to deliver a clean-break Brexit - we in the Brexit party are. This is from Matthew Goodwin, an academic specialising in populism. In his Andrew Marr interview this morning Boris Johnson ruled out an electoral pact with the Brexit party. (See 11.44am.) According to the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth, in his blog about the interview, Johnson believes such a pact might be counterproductive. [Johnson] was clear that the Tories won\u2019t be fighting that election in a pact with Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson told Tory MPs that the party would lose as much support as it would gain from such an agreement and I really don\u2019t see him shifting on this question. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves The mayor of Greater Manchester has condemned an \u201cunacceptable\u201d banner which threatened Tories as they arrived in the city for their party conference, the Press Association reports. The banner said \u201c130,000 killed under Tory rule, time to level the playing field\u201d. Andy Burnham, a former Labour cabinet minister and now mayor of Greater Manchester, said the sign was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and was being removed. Tory councillor Kerry Boyd spotted the offensive sign in Manchester as she went for a pre-conference run and described it as \u201cutterly vile\u201d. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has ruled out allowing the former Islamic State member Shamima Begum to return to the UK, the Sun reports. As the Press Associaton reports, Begum, now 19, left Britain to join IS in Syria in 2015. She later married Dutch-born Yago Riedijk and spent more than three years living under the group\u2019s rule. But in an interview last week Begum pleaded to be allowed to return home, saying her only role in the so-called caliphate was to \u201cmake babies\u201d. According to the Sun, Patel\u2019s response to this request was: \u201cNo way, no way\u201d. Patel told the paper: Our job is to keep our country safe. We don\u2019t need people who have done harm and left our country to be part of a death cult and to perpetrate that ideology. We cannot have people who would do us harm allowed to enter our country - and that includes this woman. Everything I see in terms of security and intelligence, I am simply not willing to allow anybody who has been an active supporter or campaigner for IS in this country. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s interview. Boris Johnson rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. (See 10.19am.) He said he was \u201csorry\u201d if the Labour MP Paula Sherriff took his reply \u201chumbug\u201d in the Commons last week to refer to the concerns she was raising about the safety of MPs. That was not what he intended, he said. He explained: My use of the word humbug was in the context of people trying to prevent me - us - from using the word \u2018surrender\u2019. When Andrew Marr pointed out that Sherriff\u2019s question was very specific, Johnson replied: In that case, that was a total misunderstanding and that was wrong. I can certainly say sorry for the misunderstanding, but my intention was to refuse to be crowded out from using the word \u2018surrender\u2019 to describe the Surrender Act. You can read Sherriff\u2019s question to Johnson in full here. It is easy to see why MPs did reasonably conclude the \u201chumbug\u201d comment was seen as a response to what she was saying about threats. Johnson claimed that he had no interest to declare when he was London mayor in relation to his friend Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s firm getting sponsorship from a mayoral organisation. (See 10.42am.) He claimed that the Arcuri allegations about him were politically motivated and driven by critics opposed to Brexit. (See 10.42am.) He said \u201cof course\u201d it would be possible for the UK to leave the EU without a Brexit deal on 31 October. Asked if this would be possible, despite the passing of the Benn Act, which says the PM has to request an extension if there has been no deal passed by 19 October and and no Commons vote for no deal, Johnson said \u201cof course\u201d. Marr asked: Can we still leave the EU on October 31 without a deal? Johnson replied: Of course we can. Johnson dismissed suggestions that he might resign rather than request on article 50 extension. This would be one way of honouring his promise not to request an extension in the event of no deal being agreed. But, asked if he would do this, he replied: I have undertaken to lead the party and my country at a difficult time, and I\u2019m going to continue to do that. I believe it\u2019s my responsibility to do that and I think that it\u2019s our job to get Brexit done on October 31 and to move the country on. He refused to say whether he had asked another EU country to veto an article 50 extension as a means of ensuring the UK has to leave on 31 October. When asked if he had done this, he replied: I\u2019m not going to get into my discussions with any other EU head of state about the negotiations, because they are extremely interesting but they are also delicate. Johnson also refused to comment on whether the government was planning various other strategies to get around the Benn Act: using EU law, using the Civil Contingencies Act or getting someone to submit the extension request on his behalf. Johnson claimed that other EU states did not want the UK to stay in. He said: It is certainly true that other EU countries also don\u2019t want this thing to keep dragging on. They don\u2019t want the UK to remain in the EU, truculent and mutinous and in a limbo, and not wishing to co-operate in the way that they would like. He claimed there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting a Brexit deal. But he did not explain what it might entail. He described the supreme court ruling as \u201cpeculiar\u201d, hinting it might lead to pressure for the court to change. He said: I think that the judgment by the 11 justices was certainly novel and peculiar in the sense that they went against the Master of the Rolls and the Lord Chief Justice in extending the remit of the court into what was, I think, obviously a political question. The consequences of that decision are going to be working their way through for quite some time. You are now already starting to see a backlash of people questioning the implications of that decision. In the Sunday Telegraph this morning Johnson goes slightly further, hinting that there could be a case for having justices approved by parliament. See 9am. We are still a long way off from ministers saying the supreme court should contain an equal number of remain-voting and leave-voting judges, but Johnson\u2019s comments, and the comments of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general on this on Wednesday, suggest that in time the argument might gain traction. Johnson did not deny a Sunday Times report saying he has apologised to the Queen. Asked about this, he replied:\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into my conversations with Her Majesty.\u201d He ruled out an electoral pact with the Brexit party. Asked about this, he said: The Conservative party is the oldest, greatest political party in the world, it\u2019s a big, broad church and we don\u2019t do deals with other parties. Presumably he was referring to electoral pacts, not deals. Only this decade the Conservative party has formed a coalition with one other party, and a confidence and supply agreement with another. (In the past it has formed electoral pacts too - for example, in 1918.) He rejected the suggestion that the claim he has announced plans to build 40 new hospitals is misleading. Asked about this, he replied: There is a long-term infrastructure plan for 40 hospitals. There is going to be seed funding for all 40. Six are going to start immediately ... that is all going ahead and I\u2019m incredibly proud of that - but there are then 34 more that are coming down the track. He claimed that Labour\u2019s plan to cut working hours announced last week would harm the poor. He said: They\u2019ve decided that they want a four-day [working] week which would hit the poorest. Labour said last week it would try to bring the average number of hours worked per week down to 32 over a decade, without workers losing pay. Interestingly, there is some evidence that the public do not accept this claim and will believe what Johnson is saying about the plan. This is from a report in the Times (paywall) on Saturday which wrote up the findings of a focus group in Stoke featuring people who all voted Labour in 2015. It said: Tony, who works at B&amp;Q, was concerned the plan to cut the working week could put jobs at risk because it would increase costs to business. Sarah said that if she worked fewer hours she would get less pay, which she couldn\u2019t afford. No one thought the plan was a good idea but most thought it had been proposed simply to win their votes. \u201cIt\u2019s unworkable,\u201d said one. \u201cIt\u2019s just idealistic nonsense, isn\u2019t it? What Labour are trying to do is hit on the things that bother people. If you work in a school, Ofsted bothers you so they say they\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d And this is what Boris Johnson said about the allegations about his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri. Johnson claimed that he had no interest to declare in this case. The main allegations is that Arcuri\u2019s company received a total of \u00a311,500 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation when she was a close friend of Johnson\u2019s. She was also allowed to join two mayoral trade missions despite initially being told her firm did not qualify. Andrew Marr put it to Johnson that he was bound at mayor by a code of conduct saying he was not meant to take decisions to gain benefits for family or friends. Asked if he had declared his friendship with Arcuri, Johnson at first just said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of everything that he did as mayor and that \u201ceverything was done in accordance with the code ... and everything was done with full propriety\u201d. Asked why he did not declare this interest, he replied: There was no interest to declare. This could be significant because it puts pressure on Johnson to explain the full nature of his full relationship with Arcuri. Johnson claimed that the Arcuri allegations about him were politically motivated and driven by critics opposed to Brexit. Marr asked if Johnson was embarrassed by the story, saying Johnson did not look embarrassed. Johnson replied: I tell you what I really think is going on. I really think that people can feel this country is approaching an important moment of choice, and we have to get on and we have to deliver Brexit, and I think that there is a large constituency, in parliament and elsewhere, who do want to frustrate that objective. And, rightly or wrongly, they see me as the person most likely to deliver that objective. And I\u2019m going to get on and do it. When Marr asked Johnson if he was saying this attack was politically motivated, Johnson replied: I think you\u2019ve got to be realistic if you\u2019re in my position. You\u2019ve got to expect a lot of shot and shell. Johnson made this claim even though the original Arcuri story was broken by the Sunday Times, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum and which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose flagship tabloid paper, the Sun, is now one of the most fervent newspaper supporters of Johnson and his Brexit strategy. Here is a summary of what Boris Johnson said about his use of language in the interview. Boris Johnson rejected claims that the language he was using against his Brexit opponents would incite violence. He was asked if he accepted what Amber Rudd, the former work and pensions secretary, said in an interview with the Evening Standard last week. Andrew Marr quoted Rudd as saying: The sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from Number 10 does incite violence ... The casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff is immoral. Johnson replied: \u201cWell, obviously I don\u2019t agree with Amber.\u201d He repeatedly tried to justify the use of the term \u201csurrender act\u201d by referring to what the Benn Act does (see 9am for an explanation as to why his claims are misleading) and he defended politicians\u2019 right to use military metaphors. He said: I think you will find that the speeches of most politicians for centuries have been studded with the use of military metaphor. When Marr put it to him that there was something dark and \u201cvery 1930s\u201d about the Mail on Sunday splash (see 9am), which accuses Johnson\u2019s critics of \u201ccollusion\u201d, using a word used by a Number 10 source in a statement to the paper, Johnson said he did not agree with Marr\u2019s description. But he accepted there was a need for people to calm down. He said: I certainly think everybody should calm down. Asked if that included him, he replied: I think I\u2019ve been a model of restraint. Johnson says he will not bring back Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. And that\u2019s it. The interview is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: The headlines say you are promising 40 new hospitals. But it is only six, isn\u2019t it? Johnson said not accept that. He criticises Labour, saying their plans for a four-day week would hit the poorest most. Johnson claims Labour\u2019s plans to cut average working hours to 32 hours a week over a decade would hit the poorest most. Q: As mayor of London you signed a declaration saying you would not take decisions to benefit family or friends. Did you declare your interest with Jennifer Arcuri? Johnson says he did everything properly. Q: Did you declare an interest? Johnson says there was nothing to declare. He criticises the current major, Sadiq Khan, saying he spends too much money on press officers. He says there are people who want to frustrate Brexit. He says these people are attacking him because he is the person who wants to deliver Brexit. You have got to expect \u201cshock and shell\u201d, he says. Johnson implies the criticism of him over his relationship with Jennifer Acruri is motivated by opposition to his stance on Brexit. Johnson says the supreme court decision was extraordinary. He says he thinks it will have long-lasting implications. Johnson refuses to confirm that he apologised to the Queen. Q: Would you resign and get someone else to request an extension? Johnson implies he would not. He was elected to take this party forward, he says. Johnson dismisses suggestions he might resign as alternative to seeking article 50 extension. Q: How would you get round the Benn Act. By using EU law? Johnson says he will not discuss hypotheticals. Q: What about using civil contingency powers? Or getting someone else to request the extension? Johnson will not say. Q: Have you asked another EU leader to veto an extension? Johnson says he will not discuss his conversations with other EU leader. Johnson refuses to say if he has asked another EU leader to veto a Brexit extension. Q: What are the chances of a no-deal Brexit? Johnson says this has not been helped by the surrender act. He says, if Brussels thinks Brexit will be delayed, they have less incentive to negotiate. But he thinks there is a \u201cgood chance\u201d of getting a deal, he says. Q: Would you ever do a deal with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party? No, says Johnson. He says the Conservative party is the oldest and most successful party in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, broad church,\u201d he says. We don\u2019t do deals with other parties. Q: If there is a confidence vote next week, do you want to win or lose? Johnson says it is surprising that Labour won\u2019t vote for an election. Q: If you lost the vote, you would get your election. Johnson says people need a parliament devoted to their interests, a Conservative government with a one nation agenda. Q: So if you lose, you will get an election. Johnson says the most honourable thing for the opposition to do would be to hold an election. Johnson says, if Paula Sherriff thinks his phrase \u201chumbug\u201d applied to what she was saying about threats to MPs, he is sorry because that was not his intent. He was referring to the argument about the Benn Act. Q: Do you not accept that you have been loose and dangerous in your use of language? Johnson says the surrender act would compel the PM to write a letter to the EU keeping the UK in the EU. And the EU would decide the terms of exit. He says using martial metaphors is standard. He tried to tell a joke about John Major saying when you have your back against the wall, you turn and fight. He says politicians have used fighting metaphors for years. Q: Look at the Mail on Sunday splash. (See 9am). There is a darkness about this language. Johnson repeats his point about the surrender act. Q: Don\u2019t you think you should calm down. Johnson says everyone should calm down. Q: Including you. Johnson replies: I think I\u2019ve been a model of restraint. Johnson says, whether people voted leave or remain, they want Brexit done. Q: You said the best way to minimise threats is to get Brexit done. That sounds like a threat. Johnson denies this. He says the Brexit discussion has gone on for too long. He says the best wasy to get this is to get Brexit done by 31 October and move the country forward. \u201cThat is what we are going to do.\u201d Q: You seem to be trying to whip things up. No, says Johnson. He says people feel their vote has not been respected. He says we need to get this done. Q: Amber Rudd says your language incites violence. Johnson says he does not accept that. He says people are indignant because they know what the surrender act is trying to do. Boris Johnson is on the Andrew Marr Show now. Boris Johnson says he did not know Jo Cox. Q: Why did you say what Paula Sherriff was saying about threats to MPs being humbug? Johnson says he was not trying to make light of threats to MPs. But he was trying to make the point that politicians should be able to use \u201ctried and tested\u201d words, like surrender, to talk about legislation. Q: She was not talking about that. She was talking about death threats. Johnson says he loathes threats to MPs. Here is my colleague John Harris on the Conservative party\u2019s conference slogan. The Conservatives claim their hospital plans announced today amount to \u201cthe biggest hospital building programme in a generation\u201d. There are more details in the party\u2019s news release here. Here is an extract. As part of the health infrastructure plan, 40 new hospitals will be built across England over the next decade. Six of the hospital builds are getting the full go-ahead today, and a further twenty one new build projects (consisting of thirty four new hospitals in total) are receiving seed funding to kick start their schemes. Other projects will be able to bid into this and other future waves too. The package includes \u00a3200m to replace MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment, so that no scanner in the NHS is more than 10 years old. And the government is today confirming that the Department of Health and Social Care will receive a new multi-year capital settlement at the next capital review to develop capacity, plan effectively, get better value for money and deliver on the commitments we have already made. The six hospitals getting the full go-ahead today are: Whipps Cross Hospital, Epsom and St Helier Trust, West Hertfordshire Trust, Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester Trust, and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. These projects are being funded with a \u00a32.7bn cash injection of brand new money from the Treasury. The projects receiving the \u00a3100 million seed funding include Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge, the Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph this morning Boris Johnson claims that he is leading a \u201ca sensible, moderate, one nation\u201d Conservative party. One of the interesting questions to be explored this week is whether that is compatible with also being a party hell-bent on delivering Brexit, possibly the hardest version available. But a more pressing question, of course, is how the prime minister expects to deliver Brexit when no deal with the EU has emerged, he has lost his majority in parliament and MPs have legislated to try to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. This morning\u2019s papers, which are full of interviews and briefings to mark the opening today\u2019s Conservative party conference in Manchester, shed very little light on what Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy might be. But they are illuminating about his election strategy, which as we know involves depicting himself as the champion of the people, trying to deliver Brexit in the face of opposition from parliament. And one headline pushes this proposition almost to the point of absurdity. Here are the main points. Boris Johnson has suggested that the EU was involved in helping his Brexit critics draw up the Benn Act, the legislation designed to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. He raised the idea discreetly in an interview with Edward Malnick in the Sunday Telegraph (paywall), saying: In the case of the surrender act, we don\u2019t know whether or not for instance, the European Union has been consulted on on the surrender act, or European Commission lawyers. But a turbo-charged version of the same allegation has made the Mail on Sunday splash. In his story, the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Glen Owen writes: Downing Street has launched a major investigation into alleged links between foreign governments and the MPs behind the \u2018Surrender Act\u2019 which could force Boris Johnson to delay Brexit, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Sources said No 10 took the unprecedented action after officials received intelligence that the MPs, including former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, had received help drafting the Bill from members of the French government and the European Union ... Last night, a senior No 10 source said: \u2018The government is working on extensive investigations into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn [who tabled the Bill] and their involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities. Governments have proper rules for drafting legislation, but nobody knows what organisations are pulling these strings. \u2018We will demand the disclosure of all details of their personal communications with other states. The drafting of primary legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated.\u2019 The Mail on Sunday does not produce evidence to back up this claim. But the main point is that there is nothing unusual about British politicians discussing Brexit with their EU counterparts. The leading Tory Brexiters Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith had their own meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier this year, but no one started talking about \u201ccollusion\u201d. And, given that the Benn Act requires the PM to request an article 50 extension under certain conditions, it would be surprising if those behind it did not make some inquiries as to what length extension might be acceptable to the EU. The act settled on three months. Johnson has escalated his criticism of the Benn Act, calling it not just the \u201csurrender\u201d act but the \u201cabject capitulation act\u201d. The term surrender act has been condemned on the grounds that, by depicting the act\u2019s backers as people collaborating with an enemy, it could incite violence against them. But in his Sunday Telegraph interview (paywall) Johnson was unrepentant about the phrase. He said: I won\u2019t be bullied off use of that term. It seems to me a perfectly humdrum political metaphor. Actually, when you read the the text of the Benn Act, the \u2018abject capitulation act\u2019 might be just as good a term for it, because it would attempt to force the prime minister of the UK to write a letter requesting to stay in the EU, and it would ... allow the EU to decide how long we would stay on in the EU. If that isn\u2019t an attempt of the wholesale destruction of a country\u2019s negotiating position, I don\u2019t know what is. So I think my language was really quite moderate. As explained before, Johnson\u2019s account of what the act does is not correct. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh says if any surrendering is involved, it is not to the EU, but to parliament. (And, remember: Brexit was supposed to be about restoring the sovereignty of parliament.) Johnson has used an interview with the Sunday Telegraph to announce plans to build 40 \u201cnew\u201d hospitals over the next decade. As Edward Malnick reports in his write-up (paywall): Speaking as the Conservative party\u2019s annual conference gets under way in Manchester, Mr Johnson insists that spending on the NHS is \u201cabsolutely central\u201d to his vision of a \u201cunited society and a united country\u201d. He cites the \u201cconsiderable\u201d weekly savings he insists will result from Brexit as he unveils a hospital-building plan beginning with a \u00a32.7 billion cash injection for six hospitals over the next five years. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller rural hospitals, will be completed over the second half of the next decade. As Malnick explains, the government\u2019s definition of a \u201cnew\u201d hospital includes a refurbished hospital. In total, the government is preparing to spend \u00a313 billion constructing what it classes as new hospitals, which officials said would involve either entirely new buildings or the gutting of existing structures to replace facilities with state-of-the-art equivalents. Johnson has suggested that the supreme court judgment on prorogation strengthens the case for submitting supreme court justices to US-style confirmation hearings in parliament. Last week Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, floated this idea in the Commons. Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph (paywall): It will take a while to be worked through. But I think, if judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability. The lessons of America are relevant, Johnson is whipping up fears of rioting and deaths on the streets if Brexit is not delivered by 31 October so that he can try to invoke emergency powers and avoid extending the UK\u2019s EU membership beyond that date, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, claimed on Saturday. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has told the Mail on Sunday that the government is considering what it might be able to do to over-ride the Benn Act. The paper says: In his interview with this newspaper, Mr Raab hinted that EU law could \u2013 ironically \u2013 be used to veto the Benn Act He said: \u2018The Surrender Act \u2013 which requires basically us to roll over to the most punitive conditions that Brussels could inflict on us \u2013 is a shoddy bit of legislation. The way it was put together was pretty ramshackle. It didn\u2019t have the scrutiny that you have with a Government Bill.\u2019 Mr Raab confirmed that ministers were examining whether they could deploy EU legislation under Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty \u2013 which enshrines Theresa May\u2019s delayed leaving date of October 31 \u2013 to over-ride the Benn Act. He said \u2018EU law has direct effect, that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re leaving. \u2018There are multiple bits of legislation that will play out.\u2019 Johnson has apologised to the Queen for embarrassing her by requiring her to approve the unlawful suspension of parliament, the Sunday Times reports. In his story (paywall) Tim Shipman says Johnson has angered the Queen. Shipman writes: The supreme court rebuke has led to a breakdown of trust between Buckingham Palace and Downing Street. A Whitehall source said: \u201cThey are not impressed by what is going on \u2014 at the very highest levels of the family.\u201d A royal source confirmed that the Queen\u2019s senior advisers are \u201cfed up\u201d. A palace official revealed that the prime minister is now as distrusted as David Cameron, who is \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d after revealing details of his conversations with the Queen while promoting his memoir. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell which of them they are crosser with, Cameron or Boris,\u201d the source said. The Sunday Times is reporting that Jennifer Arcuri told friends she has an affair with Boris Johnson when he was London mayor. Their relationship is under scrutiny because her firm received sponsorship from a mayoral fund and she got access to overseas trade missions. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, and David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary, are among the guests on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. 9am: The Andrew Marr Show starts. Boris Johnson is the main interviewee. 2pm: Pamela Hall, president of the national convention, opens the conference. 2.10pm: James Cleverly, the party chairman, speaks. 2.20pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, and Aloc Sharma, the international development secretary, speak in a session on building a safe and prosperous Britain. 3.05pm: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, speaks. 3.15pm: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Steve Barclary, the Brexit secretary, speak in a session on delivering Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will focusing almost exclusively on the Conservative conference. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Name-calling played a significant role in the 2016 US election campaign. Remember \u201ccrooked\u201d Hillary? \u201cLittle\u201d Marco (Rubio)? \u201cLyin\u2019\u201d Ted Cruz? There\u2019s little doubt that the insistent repetition of these denigratory tags were effective over time in belittling Donald Trump\u2019s adversaries. More of the same can be expected in the upcoming elections in the UK, with the term \u201csurrender\u201d featuring prominently (\u2018Surrender bill\u2019 is a strategic phrase. It is being used to whip up anger, 27 September). For Boris Johnson to slip more easily into the Churchillian mould that he fancies for himself, he needs to shape reality in such a way as to create an enemy. The surrender meme will serve his purpose by casting in a negative, threatening light those he for the moment continues to call \u201cour friends and partners\u201d. Now is perhaps an opportune moment to impress on the electorate the extent to which the EU and its predecessors have succeeded in the mission that Europe\u2019s postwar leaders set themselves: ensuring peace in Europe for the generations to come. Faced with the near certainty of a bellicose campaign by Johnson and his advisers, may I propose a counter-slogan: \u201cWe\u2019re not at war. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d Bernard Besserglik Pantin, France \u2022 So Boris Johnson thinks the way to stop death threats to our MPs is to do what those making the threats want and \u201cget Brexit done\u201d (Johnson refuses to say sorry for Jo Cox remarks and sticks to his rhetoric, 27 September)? Is this the same government whose official policy is never to negotiate with terrorists and never to give in to blackmail demands? Because that is exactly what these MPs are facing, or will face in the weeks ahead, largely as a result of his words and actions.

      "body": "<p>Margaret Thatcher knew what she wanted to do when she came to power in 1979. She planned to tackle inflation, cut taxes, roll back the state, and give employers the right to manage by reducing the power of trade unions.</p> <p>By the time Thatcher left office in 1990 inflation was still a headache for the government and there had been no real change in the size of the state. But by the mid-1980s, a combination of mass unemployment, the defeat of the miners in their year-long strike and a raft of tougher labour laws had fundamentally changed the balance of power in the workplace.</p> <p>This was not unique to Britain. Indeed, one of the starkest changes in political economy over the past 40 years has been the victory across the developed world of capital in its struggle with labour for a share of the spoils.</p> <p>At its simplest, the annual economic output of a country can be divided into two parts: the slice that goes to workers in the form of wages and salaries, and the bit that goes to the owners of capital in the shape of profits and dividends.</p> <p>Back in 1980, labour\u2019s share of the pie in developed countries stood at more than 61%, but it has been pretty much downhill all the way ever since. Income from employment as a share of gross domestic product is now below 55%.</p> <p>The free-market thinkers that inspired Thatcher said that raising the share of national income going to capital was long overdue. By the 1970s, it was said, decades of full employment had allowed trade unions to get an excessive share of national output, leaving too little left over for firms to spend on new plant and machinery. The theory was that a rising profit share would lead to higher investment, faster productivity and more well-paid jobs.</p> <p>Suffice it to say, this has not happened. In countries such as the US and the UK, the stock of fixed capital is lower than it was in the mid-1980s, according to <a href=\"https://unctad.org/en/pages/PublicationWebflyer.aspx?publicationid=2526\">last week\u2019s report</a> by the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60c4c9d54e65347d2cc7b9c8a07b655c4b6606fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c4c9d54e65347d2cc7b9c8a07b655c4b6606fd/185_336_2376_1426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail in 1983\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail in 1983. By the mid-1980s balance of power in the workplace had changed due to her policies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Jordan/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour\u2019s falling income share is correlated with declining trade union membership and a much smaller proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements. But it has certainly not been correlated with rising investment.</p> <p>Why has labour\u2019s share been falling? As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/25/global-recession-a-serious-danger-in-2020-says-un\">Unctad</a> report notes, \u201cthe proximate cause has been wage repression, which has prevented wages from keeping pace with the cost of living and increases in productivity.</p> <p>\u201cThe deeper, more fundamental factors have included decreasing unionisation rates, the erosion of social security, growing market concentration and the spread of outsourcing through global value chains.\u201d</p> <p>Life has become more difficult for workers, who have been faced with a loss of bargaining power and the proliferation of precarious jobs, but a lot easier for employers. In practice, the much-vaunted flexible labour market means that only when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/sep/11/unexpected-rise-uk-pay-growth-jobless-total-40-year-low\">unemployment falls to exceptionally low levels </a>does it become possible for workers to seize the whip hand. For the rest of the time, the economic model of the past four decades means a growing share of household income is financed by borrowing, while the increase in the profit share has either been saved or channelled into buying assets.</p> <p>John McDonnell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/john-mcdonnell-pledges-shorter-working-week-and-no-loss-of-pay\">speech to last week\u2019s Labour conference </a>posed a challenge to this flawed model, although its impact was drowned out by the party\u2019s debate on its Brexit stance happening on the same day. To the extent that there was any commentary, it was that Labour was intent on turning the clock back to the 1970s.</p> <p>To the extent that McDonnell wants to make it a more even fight between capital and labour so that workers earn a bigger share of what they produce, this is true. But there was nothing revolutionary about either of the two big economic themes of his speech.</p> <p>The first was that the state must be prepared to invest if the private sector is unable or reluctant to do so. Capital is plentiful, interest rates are at historic lows, Britain\u2019s infrastructure is badly in need of modernisation. Yet, businesses would rather sit on piles of cash or use profits to buy back shares rather than seize the plentiful investment opportunities. The fact that this tendency long predates Brexit suggests a need for the state to take the initiative in the hope that public investment will encourage private investment.</p> <p>McDonnell\u2019s second theme was the need to raise labour\u2019s share of national income in a variety of ways: by raising the national living wage to a minimum of \u00a310 an hour, a shorter working week with no loss of pay, and by rolling back the trade union legislation introduced by the Conservatives since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election in 1979.</p> <p>At root, the Conservative changes were all about making it harder for unions to take effective strike action. That was because Thatcher and her ministers recognised that the right to strike was easily the most potent weapon at labour\u2019s disposal. Unions don\u2019t really like strikes, especially long ones that make it harder for their members to pay the mortgage and feed their families. But they know that often the only way to get a deal out of an intransigent employer is to threaten to walk out.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has no intention of reversing Thatcher\u2019s employment labour laws, although when it comes to Brexit, the prime minister is the one saying he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-fuels-speculation-could-ignore-brexit-delay-law\">wants to keep no deal</a> \u2013 the equivalent of strike action \u2013 on the table. Labour\u2019s approach is like that of a trade unionist who reassures the employer from the outset of negotiations that there is no possibility of a strike. Truly, these are weird times.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Margaret Thatcher knew what she wanted to do when she came to power in 1979. She planned to tackle inflation, cut taxes, roll back the state, and give employers the right to manage by reducing the power of trade unions. By the time Thatcher left office in 1990 inflation was still a headache for the government and there had been no real change in the size of the state. But by the mid-1980s, a combination of mass unemployment, the defeat of the miners in their year-long strike and a raft of tougher labour laws had fundamentally changed the balance of power in the workplace. This was not unique to Britain. Indeed, one of the starkest changes in political economy over the past 40 years has been the victory across the developed world of capital in its struggle with labour for a share of the spoils. At its simplest, the annual economic output of a country can be divided into two parts: the slice that goes to workers in the form of wages and salaries, and the bit that goes to the owners of capital in the shape of profits and dividends. Back in 1980, labour\u2019s share of the pie in developed countries stood at more than 61%, but it has been pretty much downhill all the way ever since. Income from employment as a share of gross domestic product is now below 55%. The free-market thinkers that inspired Thatcher said that raising the share of national income going to capital was long overdue. By the 1970s, it was said, decades of full employment had allowed trade unions to get an excessive share of national output, leaving too little left over for firms to spend on new plant and machinery. The theory was that a rising profit share would lead to higher investment, faster productivity and more well-paid jobs. Suffice it to say, this has not happened. In countries such as the US and the UK, the stock of fixed capital is lower than it was in the mid-1980s, according to last week\u2019s report by the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad). Labour\u2019s falling income share is correlated with declining trade union membership and a much smaller proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements. But it has certainly not been correlated with rising investment. Why has labour\u2019s share been falling? As the Unctad report notes, \u201cthe proximate cause has been wage repression, which has prevented wages from keeping pace with the cost of living and increases in productivity. \u201cThe deeper, more fundamental factors have included decreasing unionisation rates, the erosion of social security, growing market concentration and the spread of outsourcing through global value chains.\u201d Life has become more difficult for workers, who have been faced with a loss of bargaining power and the proliferation of precarious jobs, but a lot easier for employers. In practice, the much-vaunted flexible labour market means that only when unemployment falls to exceptionally low levels does it become possible for workers to seize the whip hand. For the rest of the time, the economic model of the past four decades means a growing share of household income is financed by borrowing, while the increase in the profit share has either been saved or channelled into buying assets. John McDonnell\u2019s speech to last week\u2019s Labour conference posed a challenge to this flawed model, although its impact was drowned out by the party\u2019s debate on its Brexit stance happening on the same day. To the extent that there was any commentary, it was that Labour was intent on turning the clock back to the 1970s. To the extent that McDonnell wants to make it a more even fight between capital and labour so that workers earn a bigger share of what they produce, this is true. But there was nothing revolutionary about either of the two big economic themes of his speech. The first was that the state must be prepared to invest if the private sector is unable or reluctant to do so. Capital is plentiful, interest rates are at historic lows, Britain\u2019s infrastructure is badly in need of modernisation. Yet, businesses would rather sit on piles of cash or use profits to buy back shares rather than seize the plentiful investment opportunities. The fact that this tendency long predates Brexit suggests a need for the state to take the initiative in the hope that public investment will encourage private investment. McDonnell\u2019s second theme was the need to raise labour\u2019s share of national income in a variety of ways: by raising the national living wage to a minimum of \u00a310 an hour, a shorter working week with no loss of pay, and by rolling back the trade union legislation introduced by the Conservatives since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election in 1979. At root, the Conservative changes were all about making it harder for unions to take effective strike action. That was because Thatcher and her ministers recognised that the right to strike was easily the most potent weapon at labour\u2019s disposal. Unions don\u2019t really like strikes, especially long ones that make it harder for their members to pay the mortgage and feed their families. But they know that often the only way to get a deal out of an intransigent employer is to threaten to walk out. Boris Johnson has no intention of reversing Thatcher\u2019s employment labour laws, although when it comes to Brexit, the prime minister is the one saying he wants to keep no deal \u2013 the equivalent of strike action \u2013 on the table. Labour\u2019s approach is like that of a trade unionist who reassures the employer from the outset of negotiations that there is no possibility of a strike. Truly, these are weird times.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods. This has also been referred to by government ministers as an \"Australia-style deal\". Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe if there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a bullish performance, Johnson said repeatedly that the public are weary of Brexit and just want to get it done \u2013 the slogan of this year\u2019s autumn conference.</p> \n<p>He said there was still a chance of reaching a deal with the EU but that efforts were not helped by the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for a Brexit extension if he has not struck a deal by 19 October.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cObviously the chances of a deal or no deal depend very much on the common sense of our friends and partners.

      "bodyText": "Tom Watson has accused a \u201chard-left faction\u201d of jeopardising Labour\u2019s electoral chances by forcing MPs to waste time and effort on local selection battles, after Margaret Hodge became the second MP to face reselection. Hodge has vowed to campaign to remain Labour\u2019s candidate for Barking, after local members voted for her to face an open selection in the \u201ctrigger ballot\u201d process. Watson, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said on Sunday: \u201cOur professional organisers, constituency activists and MPs are spending an extraordinary amount of time on internal selections when they could be preparing for an imminent general election. \u201cI know the Jon Lansman-led hard-left faction on Labour\u2019s NEC are committed to full reselections but they risk Labour\u2019s chances of election success against Boris Johnson with their dogmatic behaviour.\u201d Hodge, a veteran MP and prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cI am obviously disappointed. My priority remains serving the people of Barking, as I have done for the last 25 years. At a vital time for the country, with a general election looming, we should be focusing our efforts on holding Boris Johnson and the Tories to account. \u201cI will work to secure the full backing of Barking Labour party, so I can continue to play my part as their MP in doing that.\u201d Labour sources insisted Hodge had not been targeted because of her role in criticising the party\u2019s response to antisemitism \u2013 and that many of those in Barking who supported an open selection were not from the left of the party. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to suggest this has anything to do with antisemitism. Many members wish to hold democratic selections so they can have a say in who represents them,\u201d said a party source. It has become easier for Labour members to force an open contest since the threshold was lowered at last year\u2019s party conference. In Barking, five out of 11 local branches supported an open selection. Momentum, the grassroots campaign group set up by Lansman to support Corbyn\u2019s leadership, would like to see all MPs face an open contest before each general election, believing it helps to hold MPs accountable and would bring new talent to Westminster. A Momentum spokesperson said: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to beat Boris Johnson and get Labour elected we need to open the door to a new generation of MPs drawn from Labour\u2019s half a million members. Inspiring candidates who know their communities and are committed to delivering a transformational policy agenda are a crucial part of Labour\u2019s plan to win, and Momentum will continue to support members in getting them selected.\u201d Lansman insisted \u201cthe left\u201d had had nothing to do with the trigger process in Barking, claiming it was driven by \u201cmembers on the right\u201d. Hodge has served as MP for Barking in east London since 1994 and a number of Labour MPs rallied behind her at the weekend. Stephen Doughty called her a \u201cbrilliant constituency MP\u201d and Tulip Siddiq said she was an \u201camazing feminist\u201d. The Hull North MP, Diana Johnson, who is widely respected at Westminster for campaigning on the contaminated blood scandal, is also facing an open selection. Hodge has led criticism of the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints, confronting Corbyn directly about it and making a strongly worded speech about her experiences of antisemitism in a Commons debate. She beat the British National party in the 2010 general election and, in the same year, became the first woman to be elected chair of the public accounts committee. Mike Katz, the national chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: \u201cMargaret Hodge has been a steadfast campaigner against racism, fascism and intolerance throughout her political life. \u201cShe saw off the BNP in Barking and has over the last few years been determined in her opposition to antisemitism within the Labour party. This is a shameful moment for a party which claims to embody the values of equality and diversity.\u201d The timetable for the trigger ballot process is set by the NEC, on which Corbyn\u2019s allies have a clear majority \u2013 though Lansman failed in a last-minute bid to abolish Watson\u2019s job just before last week\u2019s conference, because of objections by the chair, Wendy Nichols. Even MPs with little prospect of being deselected complain the process of rallying support among local members is time-consuming, with a general election potentially just months or weeks away. Thangam Debbonaire, the Bristol West MP, tweeted: \u201cThe sheer mass of work, time and energy spent trying to win on trigger ballots, or, if triggered, on the three-month open selection is all work, time and energy I think most people want us to be spending doing our jobs \u2013 challenging govt, developing Labour policy and trying to win general election.\u201d",

The committee wanted a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners, and for Twitter and Facebook to be forced to take legal responsibility for incitements to violence. The government wants to do it. But it has passed no new law because the referendum has condemned ministers and the rest of us to waste our lives debating Brexit to the exclusion of all that matters. To put it another way: we cannot be protected from the tensions caused by Brexit because of Brexit. Over the past decade Cameron, May and Johnson created the conditions for perpetual grievance with a referendum whose result could never be honoured. Johnson has gone further and is fanning rage to inspire his base. His predecessors cut budgets for the law enforcement that might have deterred criminals and failed to adopt protective measures. Let this be the Tories\u2019 epitaph. Here lies the \u201cparty of law and order\u201d. It died invoking mob rule. Here lies the \u201cnatural party of government\u201d. It left an ungovernable Britain. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

He says his publishers were a bit miffed: threatening to murder the prime minister was clearly not how they had agreed to start the publicity campaign for his forthcoming children\u2019s novel, <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em>, and Pullman had to publicly retract his words after there were complaints. \u201cBut,\u201d the 72-year-old author adds, his tone brightening, while one of his dogs clambers on to his lap and the other maintains a vigil beside the biscuits, \u201cthe upshot was I gained 2,000 followers on Twitter!\u201d</p> <p>Pullman creates magical realms in his award-winning fiction, writing it in his 16th-century farmhouse in a village outside Oxford, where he lives with his wife and his ukuleles and cockapoos and overflowing shelves. But if I expected to meet someone otherworldly, I was wrong. Pullman, who has two sons and several grandchildren, is very much of <em>this</em> world, and can talk in detail about the shadowy machinations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a> as well as the designs of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">Victoria Beckham</a> and the woodworking videos he sometimes gets hooked watching on YouTube. His observation of the government is not one-sided: he tells me that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>, as education secretary, once invited him to discuss literacy. Pullman told him that \u201cthe basics\u201d weren\u2019t grammar and spelling, as Gove believed, \u201cbecause everybody who\u2019s got a word processor knows you correct those at the last minute,\u201d but rather nursery rhymes, songs, a love of language itself. Nothing came of it, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give him credit: he was very courteous and he listened, and there was a civil servant making notes. And Gove cracked a joke about me being \u2018at the heart of the Magisterium now\u2019, so he had plainly read my books.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a decent joke, given that the Magisterium is the shadowy, authoritarian body that governs the country in Pullman\u2019s two trilogies: <em>His Dark Materials</em>, which began in 1995, and now <em>The</em> <em>Book of Dust</em>, of which <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em> is the second part. His best-known character, Lyra, is the heroine of all of them. The first trilogy took her from age 11 to early teens. The second trilogy began with her as a baby, in a prequel, but now leaps forward to Lyra\u2019s early 20s, when she is finally an undergraduate at Oxford, like Pullman was. Naturally, she is once again doing battle with power, sniffing out corruption and fighting it as David to the Magisterium\u2019s Goliath.</p> <p>It is set in an unreal, almost British past, yet this book feels more consciously pegged to our present than the others. There are references to refugees landing on Greek islands and a character named Nur Huda el-Wahabi, after a schoolgirl who died in Grenfell Tower. (Her teacher won a bid in the <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/pullman-name-character-nur-huda-el-wahabi-after-bids-top-32k-576121\" title=\"\">Authors for Grenfell Tower auction</a> to name a character in his next book and Pullman was very keen). Halfway through the book, Lyra explains what \u201cbullshitting\u201d really is, and, shortly afterwards, a character from the Magisterium is heard elsewhere telling someone that, \u201cWe should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once the people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if people such as Gove, Johnson and Trump, with their \u201cfake news\u201d, \u201chad enough of experts\u201d and Brexiteering narratives were on his mind when he wrote it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca4114883e2335bc386625447290841f01e47d3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca4114883e2335bc386625447290841f01e47d3a/9_320_1363_817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The prime minister doesn\u2019t mind who he hurts.

He believes the EU referendum was \u201ca terrible thing, a terrible mistake. Parliament is now not sovereign any more. It\u2019s the will of the people that\u2019s apparently sovereign, and this is terribly dangerous because the will of the people can easily be manipulated, as we saw in Germany. Dictators <em>love</em> referendums.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The will of the people can easily be manipulated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He lives in a Tory stronghold, where he has to vote Lib Dem, because a vote for Labour would be wasted, so he strongly believes in electoral reform. In any case, the thing that raises our current politics \u201cfrom farce to tragedy is the lack of opposition from the Labour party. People say they elected the wrong Miliband. I think they elected the wrong Ed actually. Ed Balls would have been a marvellous leader. So that was a big mistake, and then saddling themselves with an electoral system that weighs it so much in favour of the trade unions. That\u2019s populism again. If party leaders were elected simply and solely by MPs, we\u2019d get a much better choice of leaders. But it\u2019s also open to corruption of the Tory sort, where they\u2019ve managed to franchise the choice of their leadership out to elderly members of bowls clubs. That\u2019s all right, they deserve a vote too \u2013 but <em>all</em> of the vote?\u201d</p> <p>Did he ever believe in Corbyn?</p> <p>\u201cCorbyn is most at home on the back of a lorry with a microphone in his hand. He\u2019s one of nature\u2019s backbench rebels. He\u2019s not at home in committee rooms making deals, agreeing with, making compromises. He\u2019s not formed, by nature, to be the leader of a party, let alone a prime minister, and it\u2019s an absolute tragedy that he\u2019s now locked into it.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll take that as a no, then. As for the prime minister: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a psychopath. Or he\u2019s a sociopath. He\u2019s born without the normal human reactions of shame, embarrassment, you know, all those things\u2026 He\u2019s without them. He doesn\u2019t mind who he hurts. He doesn\u2019t mind whether he destroys the truth or not. In those respects, of course, he\u2019s learned a lot from Trump; that you can go into a high office of state and throw your weight around and break things, and nobody minds, or nobody manages to stop you. And the opposition is so helpless, so useless.\u201d</p> <p>If Johnson does hold an election, Pullman suspects he will pitch it as \u201cpeople versus parliament \u2013 and he\u2019ll be on the side of the people. I mean, it\u2019s just a joke \u2013 but he could do it and he could win and it\u2019s terribly dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702ed81b07f2206aa12718f5429b9762a0d1aa1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702ed81b07f2206aa12718f5429b9762a0d1aa1b/1081_117_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove giving a thumbs-up during the British Conservative party leadership campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion\u2019. Pictured: Michael Gove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I mention that the first trilogy of Lyra books, in which children are taken away into camps and mistreated, stripped of their daemons (their animal souls), also feels prescient now, looking at the American border with Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Pullman says. \u201cGosh, I\u2019m a prophet and I don\u2019t know it. We\u2019re living in very interesting times and there\u2019s going to be a big crisis of some sort, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p> <p>A TV production of <em>His Dark Materials</em> is coming soon to the BBC and HBO, starring James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Pullman seems reasonably interested when I bring it up, but points out that it\u2019s hardly the first production of it. There were the stage plays at the National Theatre in 2003, then the audiobook, which he found \u201ca bit disconcerting\u201d because so many of the cast were from <em>The Archers</em>. Then the Hollywood film of the trilogy, which got cancelled after the first one, which was sad, because he loves Nicole Kidman and wanted to see her reach the stage of her character\u2019s trajectory where she is \u201cbeing overpowered by the love for Lyra that she couldn\u2019t help feeling\u201d. (He had written to Kidman himself to ask her to be in it. \u201cBut if the letter hadn\u2019t worked, I was going to cross out her name and write \u2018Dear Cate Blanchett\u2019 instead.\u201d)</p> <p>Disconcertingly, the new show\u2019s American executive producer has issued a statement denying that Pullman\u2019s stories are anti-religion, which is hardly accurate, but clearly something deemed necessary to assuage the Bible Belt, which raged about the movie and its anti-Christian devilry. I bring this up and Pullman sighs, gutturally.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica is an entirely different place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe kind of fooled ourselves into thinking we can understand them.\u201d</p> <p>Interestingly, though, the new book finds Lyra losing her way with magic and becoming something of a down-hearted rationalist. This takes us to the heart of Pullman\u2019s paradox: that his books seek to undo the institution of Christianity while he remains steeped in its liturgical beauty; and that he respects science so deeply that he uses it to furnish his impossible, imaginary worlds. <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em> ends, after 687 pages, with the words \u201cTo be continued.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I am spared to write the third book, all will be made clear, I hope,\u201d he says, half joking, half not. After years of prostate trouble and surgery, and his wife\u2019s own medical issues, he says that, \u201cNeither of us is in very good health, and travelling anywhere or going out for long evenings are not really possible any more. But I don\u2019t mind that a bit. I don\u2019t want to travel anywhere.\u201d Indeed, he researched some of the faraway locations in his new book, such as Istanbul, by strolling down the roads on Google Street View. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s summoning all his strength to put on a brave face for the interview, but he does seem on excellent form today, making the tea, showing me round, giving me a lift in their car back to Oxford station.</p> <p>And, of course, there\u2019s always Twitter, where he remains as lively as ever. \u201cI got into terrible trouble a year or two ago because I said, in all innocence, \u2018Look what is this quarrel between feminists and trans people? What\u2019s the argument about?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The prime minister is without the normal human reactions of shame and embarrassment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He claims, rather mischievously, that he still doesn\u2019t understand the debate about whether gender can be overthrown biologically or socially, but I suggest it\u2019s a relevant topic to his books, in which almost all children are born with a daemon of the opposite sex, who represents the other part of them, perhaps their soul. The daemon changes animal until puberty, when it takes a fixed form and the child finds out who they really are. It does make me think about the question of trans children and blocking puberty. He turns very thoughtful about this.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had a child, boy or girl, who felt passionately from an early age, <em>manifestly</em> that they were in the wrong body, I hope I would be understanding and as kind as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do is hasten them away to an endocrinologist. I know that if you want to transition, it is physically more plausible, or persuasive, if you do it before puberty, but is a child before puberty capable of\u2026 I mean the answer is, we don\u2019t know, do we? We don\u2019t know. The only thing we can do is to be as kind as possible.\u201d</p> <p>A former teacher, Pullman is hugely interested in what we tell children and how we raise them. He is a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelrosen\" title=\"\">Michael Rosen</a>, and believes that <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/some-kids-i-taught-and-what-they-taught-me-9781509840298.html\" title=\"\">Kate Clanchy\u2019s book </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/some-kids-i-taught-and-what-they-taught-me-9781509840298.html\" title=\"\">Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me</a></em> \u201cshould be in every single staff room\u201d.</p> <p>He stopped teaching before the national curriculum even came in, \u201cso I\u2019m really speaking like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells when I talk about education now.\u201d As for the literacy regime in primary schools today: \u201cTo regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion of everything that\u2019s right and true. Fronted adverbials? Nonsense. It drives me <em>mad</em> to think about them teaching that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"908ec280ccd1819d94ded467fa18757ad52bea07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/908ec280ccd1819d94ded467fa18757ad52bea07/0_1151_4890_2932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Pullman standing with his hands in his pockets in his garden, smiling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re living in very interesting times and there\u2019s going to be a big crisis of some sort\u2019: Philip Pullman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Hardy/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has seen SATs tests where they say, \u201cSpend 15 minutes making your plan and 45 minutes writing the story.\u201d \u201cWhen I used to speak to classes, I would say yes you must make a plan when you write the story, but write the story first and make the plan afterwards, because that way the plan will be exactly like the story and you\u2019ll get more marks.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not joking \u2013 this is how he does it himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing it backwards. I call it doing it the right way.\u201d</p> <p>We discuss the growing obsession in academy schools with strictness. He says that when he was at school, his teachers had been in the war, so weren\u2019t going to be scared by a bunch of kids. \u201cThe French teacher had been on the Arctic convoys; the geography teacher had driven tanks in the desert. The physics teacher, he was a brute, he\u2019d flown Catalina seaplanes across the Atlantic.\u201d When Pullman himself came to teach, he lacked their sense of authority, \u201cso the only thing I could do to keep them in order was to tell them stories.\u201d He also observed that every class already had a king and a queen who the other children looked up to, so if you sussed out who they were, and focussed on them for the first few weeks, the rest of the class would follow.</p> <p>We go outside to look at the decorative boxes he\u2019s been making in his carpentry workshop, only to discover that the two cockapoos, Coco and Mixie, who look like designer doggies, but behave like feral beasts, have escaped. Some minutes later, after Pullman has set off down his acres of land to look for them, I find them in the next-door neighbours\u2019 garden, having the time of their lives. We haul them back into the house and discover that they have also eaten the biscuits, leaving a trail of fallen books behind them.</p> <p><em>The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two by Philip Pullman is published on 3 October by Penguin at \u00a320.

But it\u2019s also open to corruption of the Tory sort, where they\u2019ve managed to franchise the choice of their leadership out to elderly members of bowls clubs. That\u2019s all right, they deserve a vote too \u2013 but all of the vote?\u201d Did he ever believe in Corbyn? \u201cCorbyn is most at home on the back of a lorry with a microphone in his hand. He\u2019s one of nature\u2019s backbench rebels. He\u2019s not at home in committee rooms making deals, agreeing with, making compromises. He\u2019s not formed, by nature, to be the leader of a party, let alone a prime minister, and it\u2019s an absolute tragedy that he\u2019s now locked into it.\u201d I\u2019ll take that as a no, then. As for the prime minister: \u201cWell, he\u2019s a psychopath. Or he\u2019s a sociopath. He\u2019s born without the normal human reactions of shame, embarrassment, you know, all those things\u2026 He\u2019s without them. He doesn\u2019t mind who he hurts. He doesn\u2019t mind whether he destroys the truth or not. In those respects, of course, he\u2019s learned a lot from Trump; that you can go into a high office of state and throw your weight around and break things, and nobody minds, or nobody manages to stop you. And the opposition is so helpless, so useless.\u201d If Johnson does hold an election, Pullman suspects he will pitch it as \u201cpeople versus parliament \u2013 and he\u2019ll be on the side of the people. I mean, it\u2019s just a joke \u2013 but he could do it and he could win and it\u2019s terribly dangerous.\u201d I mention that the first trilogy of Lyra books, in which children are taken away into camps and mistreated, stripped of their daemons (their animal souls), also feels prescient now, looking at the American border with Mexico. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Pullman says. \u201cGosh, I\u2019m a prophet and I don\u2019t know it. We\u2019re living in very interesting times and there\u2019s going to be a big crisis of some sort, isn\u2019t there?\u201d A TV production of His Dark Materials is coming soon to the BBC and HBO, starring James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Pullman seems reasonably interested when I bring it up, but points out that it\u2019s hardly the first production of it. There were the stage plays at the National Theatre in 2003, then the audiobook, which he found \u201ca bit disconcerting\u201d because so many of the cast were from The Archers. Then the Hollywood film of the trilogy, which got cancelled after the first one, which was sad, because he loves Nicole Kidman and wanted to see her reach the stage of her character\u2019s trajectory where she is \u201cbeing overpowered by the love for Lyra that she couldn\u2019t help feeling\u201d. (He had written to Kidman himself to ask her to be in it. \u201cBut if the letter hadn\u2019t worked, I was going to cross out her name and write \u2018Dear Cate Blanchett\u2019 instead.\u201d) Disconcertingly, the new show\u2019s American executive producer has issued a statement denying that Pullman\u2019s stories are anti-religion, which is hardly accurate, but clearly something deemed necessary to assuage the Bible Belt, which raged about the movie and its anti-Christian devilry. I bring this up and Pullman sighs, gutturally. \u201cAmerica is an entirely different place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe kind of fooled ourselves into thinking we can understand them.\u201d Interestingly, though, the new book finds Lyra losing her way with magic and becoming something of a down-hearted rationalist. This takes us to the heart of Pullman\u2019s paradox: that his books seek to undo the institution of Christianity while he remains steeped in its liturgical beauty; and that he respects science so deeply that he uses it to furnish his impossible, imaginary worlds. The Secret Commonwealth ends, after 687 pages, with the words \u201cTo be continued.\u201d \u201cIf I am spared to write the third book, all will be made clear, I hope,\u201d he says, half joking, half not. After years of prostate trouble and surgery, and his wife\u2019s own medical issues, he says that, \u201cNeither of us is in very good health, and travelling anywhere or going out for long evenings are not really possible any more. But I don\u2019t mind that a bit. I don\u2019t want to travel anywhere.\u201d Indeed, he researched some of the faraway locations in his new book, such as Istanbul, by strolling down the roads on Google Street View. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s summoning all his strength to put on a brave face for the interview, but he does seem on excellent form today, making the tea, showing me round, giving me a lift in their car back to Oxford station. And, of course, there\u2019s always Twitter, where he remains as lively as ever. \u201cI got into terrible trouble a year or two ago because I said, in all innocence, \u2018Look what is this quarrel between feminists and trans people? What\u2019s the argument about?\u2019\u201d He claims, rather mischievously, that he still doesn\u2019t understand the debate about whether gender can be overthrown biologically or socially, but I suggest it\u2019s a relevant topic to his books, in which almost all children are born with a daemon of the opposite sex, who represents the other part of them, perhaps their soul. The daemon changes animal until puberty, when it takes a fixed form and the child finds out who they really are. It does make me think about the question of trans children and blocking puberty. He turns very thoughtful about this. \u201cIf I had a child, boy or girl, who felt passionately from an early age, manifestly that they were in the wrong body, I hope I would be understanding and as kind as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do is hasten them away to an endocrinologist. I know that if you want to transition, it is physically more plausible, or persuasive, if you do it before puberty, but is a child before puberty capable of\u2026 I mean the answer is, we don\u2019t know, do we? We don\u2019t know. The only thing we can do is to be as kind as possible.\u201d A former teacher, Pullman is hugely interested in what we tell children and how we raise them. He is a fan of Michael Rosen, and believes that Kate Clanchy\u2019s book Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me \u201cshould be in every single staff room\u201d. He stopped teaching before the national curriculum even came in, \u201cso I\u2019m really speaking like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells when I talk about education now.\u201d As for the literacy regime in primary schools today: \u201cTo regard the basics as being spelling properly, and not ending a sentence with a preposition, is a monstrous perversion of everything that\u2019s right and true. Fronted adverbials? Nonsense. It drives me mad to think about them teaching that.\u201d He has seen SATs tests where they say, \u201cSpend 15 minutes making your plan and 45 minutes writing the story.\u201d \u201cWhen I used to speak to classes, I would say yes you must make a plan when you write the story, but write the story first and make the plan afterwards, because that way the plan will be exactly like the story and you\u2019ll get more marks.\u201d He\u2019s not joking \u2013 this is how he does it himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing it backwards. I call it doing it the right way.\u201d We discuss the growing obsession in academy schools with strictness. He says that when he was at school, his teachers had been in the war, so weren\u2019t going to be scared by a bunch of kids. \u201cThe French teacher had been on the Arctic convoys; the geography teacher had driven tanks in the desert. The physics teacher, he was a brute, he\u2019d flown Catalina seaplanes across the Atlantic.\u201d When Pullman himself came to teach, he lacked their sense of authority, \u201cso the only thing I could do to keep them in order was to tell them stories.\u201d He also observed that every class already had a king and a queen who the other children looked up to, so if you sussed out who they were, and focussed on them for the first few weeks, the rest of the class would follow. We go outside to look at the decorative boxes he\u2019s been making in his carpentry workshop, only to discover that the two cockapoos, Coco and Mixie, who look like designer doggies, but behave like feral beasts, have escaped. Some minutes later, after Pullman has set off down his acres of land to look for them, I find them in the next-door neighbours\u2019 garden, having the time of their lives. We haul them back into the house and discover that they have also eaten the biscuits, leaving a trail of fallen books behind them.
