Asked if he blamed MPs for the abuse they were getting, he has said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop.</p> \n   <p>It is not surprising some people are angry about it. I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum.

At least two of his claims were seriously misleading. Here are the key points </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson declined to apologise to the family of Jo Cox for his comments about her last night.</strong> His own sister, Rachel, said that what he said about Cox was \u201cparticularly tasteless\u201d. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8cb10b8f081108db9bd33a#block-5d8cb10b8f081108db9bd33a\">1.56pm.)</a> But, when he was asked by BBC\u2019s Look North if he had a message for the Cox family, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Look, I want to make a very, very important point. There\u2019s a big big difference between a problem that I think is growing and that we need to deal with, which is the threat that MPs are facing, particularly female MPs [and it being important for MPs to be able to use words like surrender.]</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked again if he was sorry for his language in any way, Johnson said he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the threats that MPs face\u201d. But that was an expression of regret about something happening, not an apology for something for which he accepted some responsibility.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected the suggestion that some of the language he had used last night might have contributed to MPs facing threats. </strong>When this was put to him, he said: \u201cI dispute that.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his right to call the Benn Act the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.</strong> In one interview he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you look at the language I was using, it\u2019s important to be able to use a simple English word like surrender in a parliamentary context to describe a bill that gives the power to the rest of the EU to keep us locked in the EU by their own decision and to decide how long we should be there.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He falsely claimed that the Benn Act would give the EU the power to decide how long the UK stayed in the EU.</strong> In another interview he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[The act] would take away the power of this government, and the power of this country to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU and that\u2019s really quite an extraordinary thing. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a claim that Johnson has made frequently, but it is not true. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that he had not talked about \u201cbetrayal\u201d in the Commons - even though he said <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-09-25/debates/AD2A07E5-9741-4EBA-997A-97776F80AA38/PrimeMinisterSUpdate\">in his opening statement:</a> \u201cWe will not betray the people who sent us here; we will not.\u201d </strong>When it was put to him that he had used words like betrayal, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t think I did say anything about a betrayal.

Political parties make a huge amount of money from their party conferences, because members and lobbyists have to pay to attend (you can see the Tory charges <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://conservativepartyconference.com/files/pc2019/Pricing_Structure_v.pdf\">here - pdf)</a> and so it was always going to go ahead, regardless of what the supreme court decided on prorogation.</p> \n  <p>But the timetable may have to be rearranged. Boris Johnson was due to speak around lunchtime on Wednesday. Now he will be due in the Commons at that point, for PMQs, and so his speech is likely to be moved. For him to boycott the Commons and send, say, Dominic Raab in his place as a PMQs stand-in would be grossly disrespectful to parliament - although, on those grounds, the idea might appeal to Dominic Cummings. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs he expects Boris Johnson to be in the house on Wednesday (see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8cc02f8f081108db9bd3cf#block-5d8cc02f8f081108db9bd3cf\">2.45pm)</a>, but in the current circumstances, that could easily change.</p> \n  <p>What is also not clear is whether or not the opposition, aka the \u201crebel alliance\u201d, will try to seize control of the Commons timetable next week to pass more anti-no-deal Brexit legislation. </p> \n  <p>Yesterday Labour whips offered the government a non-aggression pact, saying that as long as the Commons sat on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, they would be happy to debate non-contentious business (meaning there would be not need for a three-line whip, and most MPs would be able to go to Manchester). <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/conservative-conference-manchester-cancellation-fears-16976862\">The conference is said to be worth \u00a330m to the Manchester economy,</a> and Labour did not want to take the blame for the city losing out. The government whips did not take up the offer, pushed for a recess instead, and lost the vote.</p> \n  <p>The business now tabled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8cb8f08f08fbb0c171bebd#block-5d8cb8f08f08fbb0c171bebd\"> 2.13pm)</a> is non-contentious and in normal circumstances there would be no need for a three-line whip. But does the non-aggression offer still hold? Probably not.

Jeremy Corbyn referred to it directly in his statement. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/26/boris-johnsons-brexit-rhetoric-condemned-as-mps-tell-of-death-threats-politics-live?page=with:block-5d8ca6668f081108db9bd2a2#block-5d8ca6668f081108db9bd2a2\"> 12.59pm.)</a> For the record, here is Sherriff\u2019s question, and Johnson\u2019s answer, in full.</p> \n  <p>Sherriff asked:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament that was passed by this house. I am sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to the use of offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language about legislation that we do not like.</p> \n   <p>We stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [Jo Cox]. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. Let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2013 surrender act, betrayal, traitor \u2013 and I, for one, am sick of it. We must moderate our language, and that has to come from the prime minister first, so I should be interested in hearing his opinion. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life. The reality is that this is a bill ...</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>At that point there was so much uproar that the Speaker had to intervene. When Johnson got to speak again, he continued:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, let me just explain why I call it the surrender act. That is because it would oblige us to stay in the EU for month after month, at a cost of a billion pounds per month. It would take away from this country the ability to decide how long that extension would be, and it would give that power to the EU. It would absolutely undermine our ability to continue to negotiate properly in Brussels; it takes away the fundamental ability of a country to walk away from the negotiations, and I am afraid that is exactly what it does. If I may say so respectfully to opposition members who are getting very agitated about this, the best way to get rid of the surrender act is not to have voted for it in the first place, to repeal it, and to vote for the deal that we are going to do. That is the way forward.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>If you want to read the all the exchanges, the Hansard is available <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-09-25/debates/AD2A07E5-9741-4EBA-997A-97776F80AA38/PrimeMinisterSUpdate\">here.</a> But it is a long read; the exchanges lasted for more than three hours.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T12:34:41.394Z\">at 1.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d8ca8738f08fbb0c171bddd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-26T12:03:42.095Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>David Gauke,</strong> the former Tory justice secretary, who now sits as an independent having had the whip removed over a Brexit rebellion, says at best what Boris Johnson said last night could be described as \u201cdeeply insensitive\u201d.

I was thinking about how Jo would respond to it last night. She would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it. And thought about how in this moment, you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Cox urged politicians of both sides of the Brexit debate to tone down the rhetoric used and stop portraying each other as good or evil. \u201cWe just have to have a more nuanced understanding to remember our common our common humanity,\u201d Cox said.</p> \n  <p>He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cI was genuinely shocked by the the willingness to descend to vitriol, because I think it does long lasting harm. To have this debate descend into this bear pit of polarisation, I think it\u2019s dangerous for our country.\u201d</p> \n   <p>There is a willingness to jump out and decry the other side when they use language like \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018traitor\u2019 or \u2018betrayal\u2019. And I think that is inflammatory language. But as inflammatory are those people who have used the language of it being a \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018dictatorship\u2019 and \u2018fascism\u2019. </p> \n   <p>I think both of those approaches are unacceptable. It is not just bad behaviour by one side of the debate. This is something which is infected our politics, and it\u2019s this vicious cycle where language gets more extreme, response gets more extreme, it all gets hyped up ... It creates an atmosphere where I think violence and attacks are more likely.</p> \n   <p>You can disagree passionately with people. But you don\u2019t have to impugn their motives, whether you are a hard Brexiteer or a hard remainer, actually, what you have in common is a desire to do what you think is best for the country. </p> \n   <p>What isn\u2019t acceptable is to demonize each other to build a culture of hatred to the other to create this tribal identity.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The prime minister faced widespread criticism over his refusal to apologise for his provocative comments; including those he made about the murdered MP, Jo Cox. Some of the staunchest criticism came from Johnson\u2019s own sister, Rachel, who accused him of deploying \u201chighly reprehensible language\u201d. But Johnson insisted he would continue to use the rhetoric of war when referring to Brexit. The prime minister said he had every right to call the Benn Act the \u201csurrender bill\u201d, despite MPs\u2019 complaints such action was emboldening those who might harm them and their families. Nigel Farage sided with Johnson on the issue. The prime minister\u2019s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, suggested that only carrying out Brexit would calm tensions, as MPs complained of facing death threats. Cummings shrugged off the concerns of such one MP, telling him: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d And he legitimised the \u201canger\u201d being directed at MPs, saying it was not surprising because the Brexit process was still dragging on. A man was arrested trying to smash windows at Jess Phillips\u2019 constituency office, the Labour MP said. The man was shouting that she was a fascist and her staff had to be locked inside, Phillips told LBC radio. She also complained about the prime minister\u2019s rhetoric. MPs refused to schedule a mini-recess for the Tory party conference. A No 10 spokesman later insisted the conference would go ahead. Opposition parties agreed to explore ways to censure Johnson in parliament. And they agreed to renew efforts to block the UK leaving the European Union without a deal. And you can read yet more from my colleague, Rowena Mason, who has the full story: Cummings has also said serious threats of violence have been seen on both sides, adding that the \u201csituation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result\u201d of the 2016 referendum. People on all sides have said things that veered between unwise and very unpleasant, and sometimes criminal. That is true of people of the leave side and that\u2019s true of people on the remain side. People have been running around during the referendum campaign saying I was a Nazi, they run around for three years afterwards saying I am a criminal, and now a criminal Nazi. And there are also a bunch of people on the Leave side who have said terrible things about remainers. I also think there is a very important distinction between, on the one hand, a robust political discussion and debate, and threats of violence. Threats of violence are a completely different matter. They should be treated in a completely different matter; everyone should take those extremely seriously. I know people on both sides of leave and remain who have had serious threats like that and it is obviously bad. In the end, the situation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result. According to the Press Association, Cummings added: I don\u2019t think anyone is going to listen to reason because a lot of people (MPs) become really badly disconnected from what people in the real world and England outside central London thinks. Dominic Cummings has been addressing the language used in the Brexit debate and the threats sent to some MPs this evening. The Press Association reports that he has said it is \u201cnot surprising\u201d people are angry with parliamentarians. He\u2019s appearing at an event marking the launch of a new book by the Vote Leave supporter and businessman, Stuart Wheeler. Asked if he blamed MPs for the abuse they were getting, he has said: The MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop. It is not surprising some people are angry about it. I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum. How does that compute for them? To me, it says that, fundamentally, a lot of people in parliament are more out of touch with the country now than they were in summer 2016. If you are a bunch of politicians and say that we swear we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, we don\u2019t want to respect that vote, what do you expect to happen? Asked directly if he believed MPs have themselves to blame for the abuse they are receiving, Cummings said: \u201cThat\u2019s the way you\u2019re putting it. I am using my language.\u201d Major also offers some pretty strong criticism of Johnson and his cabinet over their approach to Brexit and their use of language: Like many in my party, who have been expelled for voting with their conscience, I am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government\u2019s present position is an aberration. Most Conservatives are not a Brexit party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray. We do not believe we have the right to ignore the voices of millions of others, whose opinions differ from our own. And we abhor the language of division and hate \u2013 and words such as \u201csaboteur\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d, \u201cenemy\u201d, \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201cbetrayal\u201d have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so. I hope that the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet. Boris Johnson may use the privy council to bypass the legal requirement on him to seek a three-month Brexit delay if he cannot get a deal, the former prime minister John Major has suggested. In a speech to the Centre for European Reform thinktank this evening, Major plans to say: My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the [Benn] Act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving HM the Queen. I should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget. Major is referring to the difference between an order in council, which needs the approval of the monarch, and an order of council, which does not. Johnson has repeatedly made the apparently contradictory claims that he will, at once, abide by the law and refuse to ask for a delay. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has criticised the prime minister over his inflammatory language, making reference as he did so to the arrest at the constituency offices of his party colleague, Jess Phillips: Footage has emerged of the senior No 10 aide responding to an MP\u2019s concerns about death threats with the words: \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East and a shadow minister, confronted Dominic Cummings in Westminster today. Footage of the incident, posted online by the BBC, showed Turner criticising the prime minister\u2019s inflammatory tone and telling Cummings: \u201cI\u2019ve had death threats overnight; \u2018should be dead\u2019.\u201d Cummings responds: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d Speaking to the Press Association about the exchange later, Turner said: My wife is in Hull with my three-year-old daughter while I\u2019m in Westminster \u2013 I take threats seriously. I saw Dominic Cummings in Portcullis House and I raised with him that the language adopted by the prime minister and others yesterday is inflammatory and causing MPs to receive death threats. Mr Cummings responded to me: \u2018Back a deal, then\u2019. I then approached him and said, how is it possible for me to be criticised for not backing a deal? I\u2019ve tried three times to back the former prime minister\u2019s deal but it wasn\u2019t good enough for me to support. The PM should be in Brussels negotiating a deal to bring back to parliament so people like me can support it. I\u2019m desperate to support a deal but it must protect jobs and workers\u2019 rights. Turner has said he\u2019s \u201ctruly worried\u201d about his family\u2019s safety, having previously had a person arrive at his house in Hull to confront him. The reason I was provoked into making an impassioned plea for him to stop allowing the tone of the debate to be as it is, is because I am truly worried about my family,\u201d he said. I\u2019ve had previous experiences of attacks on the house and the family and you can\u2019t decide when you see these threats whether it is a serious death threat or whether it is just someone firing off at the keyboard when they\u2019ve had too much to drink. I don\u2019t know and it worries me. Boris Johnson has recorded a series of regional TV interviews today, and the BBC has released some of the transcripts. At least two of his claims were seriously misleading. Here are the key points Johnson declined to apologise to the family of Jo Cox for his comments about her last night. His own sister, Rachel, said that what he said about Cox was \u201cparticularly tasteless\u201d. (See 1.56pm.) But, when he was asked by BBC\u2019s Look North if he had a message for the Cox family, he replied: Look, I want to make a very, very important point. There\u2019s a big big difference between a problem that I think is growing and that we need to deal with, which is the threat that MPs are facing, particularly female MPs [and it being important for MPs to be able to use words like surrender.] Asked again if he was sorry for his language in any way, Johnson said he was \u201cdeeply sorry for the threats that MPs face\u201d. But that was an expression of regret about something happening, not an apology for something for which he accepted some responsibility. He rejected the suggestion that some of the language he had used last night might have contributed to MPs facing threats. When this was put to him, he said: \u201cI dispute that.\u201d He defended his right to call the Benn Act the \u201csurrender bill\u201d. In one interview he said: If you look at the language I was using, it\u2019s important to be able to use a simple English word like surrender in a parliamentary context to describe a bill that gives the power to the rest of the EU to keep us locked in the EU by their own decision and to decide how long we should be there. He falsely claimed that the Benn Act would give the EU the power to decide how long the UK stayed in the EU. In another interview he said: [The act] would take away the power of this government, and the power of this country to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU and that\u2019s really quite an extraordinary thing. This is a claim that Johnson has made frequently, but it is not true. The act says, if the PM fails to pass a Brexit deal by 19 October, and if MPs have not voted for no deal, he must request a three-month extension. But it does not say the UK has to accept any length of extension it is offered by the EU. If the EU did offer a longer or shorter extension, under the legislation the PM could either accept it, or refer it to the Commons for MPs to decide. So the UK would have a choice. He claimed that he had not talked about \u201cbetrayal\u201d in the Commons - even though he said in his opening statement: \u201cWe will not betray the people who sent us here; we will not.\u201d When it was put to him that he had used words like betrayal, he said: I don\u2019t think I did say anything about a betrayal. What I worry about is if we don\u2019t get Brexit done, then people will feel very badly let down. He claimed that some of the things opposition MPs were shouting at him in the Commons last night were \u201cfar harsher\u201d than what he said. He said there was a need for \u201ctempers ... to come down\u201d in the Commons. In response to another question about his language, he said: You\u2019re right, tempers need to come down, and people need to come together because it\u2019s only by getting Brexit done that you\u2019ll lance the boil, as it were, of the current anxiety and we will be able to get on with the domestic agenda. He said he accepted the need to \u201creach out across the House of Commons\u201d to get Brexit done. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. The opposition parties are going to meet again on Monday to consider \u201call parliamentary mechanisms to stop a no-deal [Brexit]\u201d, the Labour party has said. In a statement about this afternoon\u2019s talks, Labour said the parties agreed that stopping a no-deal Brexit was a priority and that the language used by the PM was unacceptable. The parties agreed that \u201cany election without a lock preventing no deal would not get through parliament\u201d. And Labour made it clear that \u201cit wants an election as soon there\u2019s a lock against no deal\u201d. The meeting was attended by Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Valerie Vaz and Shami Chakrabarti from Labour, Ian Blackford from the SNP, Jo Swinson from the Lib Dems, Anna Soubry from the Independent Group for Change, Caroline Lucas from the Green and Liz Saville Roberts from Plaid Cymru. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected the final paragraph. It was Liz Saville Roberts representing Plaid Cymru, not Leanne Wood (the former Plaid leader). The original mistake was in the Labour briefing. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader, also told Sky News that at the meeting with other opposition party leaders it was agreed that she would investigate what might be done to impeach or censure Boris Johnson in the Commons. She said: How do we bring it back to the chamber here in this place that the truth matters and conduct matters and the sort of words that you use in politics, those matter too. So I hope that we will find a way of censuring the prime minister. That\u2019s what I raised with the leaders of the opposition parties today. And we will be looking together at how to take that forward. Opposition party leaders have finished their meeting where they discussed what more might be done to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Jeremy Corbyn spoke with the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson, the Independent Group for Change\u2019s Anna Soubry and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts. According to the Press Association, Swinson left the talks early to speak to police about a threat made against one of her young children. After the meeting Saville Roberts said they had spoken about how to ensure that Boris Johnson complied with the Benn Act, which will require the PM to request a Brexit extension if no deal has been agreed by 19 October. She said: We have got to get the Benn Act extension and we have to make sure that actually happens. There are a lot of pressures on, but that overrides everything. Here is the Labour MP Jess Phillips talking about the man who tried to break into her constituency office. The government motion saying the conference recess should go ahead next week was backed by 275 Conservative MPs, nine DUP MPs and five independents. Three of them were Tories who lost the whip after rebelling over Brexit earlier this month (Steve Brine, Greg Clark and Caroline Nokes), another was the Tory Charlie Elphicke, who is suspended over a court case, and the other was the former Labour MP Ian Austin. Fifteen independent MPs joined the opposition parties and voted against the government. They included seven of the 21 Tories who had the whip withdrawn over Brexit earlier this month: Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Anne Milton and Antoinette Sandbach. Another was Amber Rudd, who resigned the whip herself in solidarity with the 21. Another 10 of the 21 who lost the whip did not vote. They were Richard Benyon, Alistair Burt, Philip Hammond, Stephen Hammond, Richard Harrington, Margot James, Sir Oliver Letwin, Sir Nicholas Soames, Rory Stewart and Ed Vaizey. The other member the group of 21 rebels was Sam Gyimah. He is now a Liberal Democrat, and voted against the motion with his new party. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, has revealed that a man has been arrested after trying to \u201ckick the door\u201d of her constituency office while reportedly shouting that she was a fascist. She told LBC Radio: I\u2019ve only just heard about it myself but my staff had to be locked into my office while the man tried to smash the windows and kick the door, I believe. I don\u2019t know what I can say because the man has been arrested. According to HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, Boris Johnson is planning to go ahead with his speech to the Tory conference on Wednesday \u2013 even though PMQs is scheduled. If Johnson does skip PMQs, that would be seen as a gross discourtesy to the Commons. Earlier I speculated that he might send Dominic Raab in his place (see 3.13pm), but given the state of relations between No 10 and the Commons he might even palm MPs off with Kevin Foster, the junior Welsh Office minister and interim Cabinet Office minister who responded to the UQ about Johnson\u2019s language today. From the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason Here are various accounts of an incident in the voting lobbies this afternoon. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Tory MP Nadine Dorries, a Boris Johnson supporter From Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips UPDATE: Here is another witness, the Tory MP Claire Perry The Conservative party is expected to clarify later what impact the decision not to have a mini-recess next week will have on its party conference. James Cleverly, the chairman, has already said it is not going to be cancelled. Political parties make a huge amount of money from their party conferences, because members and lobbyists have to pay to attend (you can see the Tory charges here - pdf) and so it was always going to go ahead, regardless of what the supreme court decided on prorogation. But the timetable may have to be rearranged. Boris Johnson was due to speak around lunchtime on Wednesday. Now he will be due in the Commons at that point, for PMQs, and so his speech is likely to be moved. For him to boycott the Commons and send, say, Dominic Raab in his place as a PMQs stand-in would be grossly disrespectful to parliament - although, on those grounds, the idea might appeal to Dominic Cummings. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs he expects Boris Johnson to be in the house on Wednesday (see 2.45pm), but in the current circumstances, that could easily change. What is also not clear is whether or not the opposition, aka the \u201crebel alliance\u201d, will try to seize control of the Commons timetable next week to pass more anti-no-deal Brexit legislation. Yesterday Labour whips offered the government a non-aggression pact, saying that as long as the Commons sat on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, they would be happy to debate non-contentious business (meaning there would be not need for a three-line whip, and most MPs would be able to go to Manchester). The conference is said to be worth \u00a330m to the Manchester economy, and Labour did not want to take the blame for the city losing out. The government whips did not take up the offer, pushed for a recess instead, and lost the vote. The business now tabled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday (see 2.13pm) is non-contentious and in normal circumstances there would be no need for a three-line whip. But does the non-aggression offer still hold? Probably not. That offer was made before Boris Johnson spent three hours in the Commons disrespecting the memory of Jo Cox and using language seen as \u201cinciting hatred towards MPs\u201d. (See 10.50am.) As my colleague Rowena Mason reports, opposition parties are meeting now to discuss what they will do next week. There is no reason to think they won\u2019t want to do all they can disrupt next week for the government. If the opposition does try to use next week to pass emergency legislation to firm up the Benn Act, then the government will want its MPs in London on a three-line whip. If that is the case, the Tory conference can still go ahead, but a lot of fringe events might look a bit empty. Jacob Rees-Mogg has told MPs that he expects Sajid Javid to be in the Commons on Tuesday for Treasury questions, and Boris Johnson to be there on Wednesday, for PMQs, the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul reports. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, asks whether Rees-Mogg can arrange for Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to apologise to the Commons for calling it \u201cdead\u201d. She says Rees-Mogg himself should also apologise to the doctor he criticised, David Nicholl. She asks Rees-Mogg to explain why he reportedly called the supreme court judgment at cabinet a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. And she asks how long a prorogation would need to be before a Queen\u2019s speech. Rees-Mogg says he would not describe parliament as dead himself. He would describe it as addled, like the 1614 parliament. He says he is happy to repeat the apology to Nicholl he has already given. On the \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d comment, Rees-Mogg says cabinet minutes are revealed after 30 years. He tells Vaz: \u201cJust because newspapers print gossip from cabinet meetings does not make it fact.\u201d (Actually, the 30-year rule is becoming a 20-year rule.) On prorogation, he says it does not take much time at all to get the Commons ready for the state opening of parliament. But quite a lot of changes have to be made in the Lords, he says. And he says before the ceremony the \u201cunsightly barriers\u201d outside the Houses of Parliament which are there for security purposes have to be removed. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, delivers a business statement for next week. On Monday MPs will hold debates on Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. On Tuesday they will vote on various statutory instruments. On Wednesday MPs will debate the second reading of the domestic abuse bill. And on Thursday there will be a general debate on women\u2019s mental health, and on MoJ spending. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, is making a point of order. He says the Commons library has confirmed to him today that the soonest an election could take place would be Tuesday 5 November. This would be after the 31 October deadline for Brexit, he says. He asks the Speaker, John Bercow, to confirm this. Burgon says he think it is important for the public to understand that, even if Labour backed an election now, it could not take place before the PM\u2019s deadline for Brexit. Bercow confirms that this is his understanding of the rules. Boris Johnson has suffered another Commons defeat. MPs have voted down the government motion for a mini-recess next week during the Tory conference by 306 votes to 289 \u2013 a majority of 17. The BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has posted a good thread on Twitter about the latest thinking within the EU as to what will happen with Brexit. She says EU sources think the chances of a deal at the October summit are now \u201cpretty much nil\u201d. Here are the first two tweets, but it is worth reading the whole thing (which you can do by clicking on the first post). MPs are now voting on whether to have a mini-recess for the Tory conference. There has been no debate. After a statement on climate change, they went straight into a vote on a government business motion saying the house should rise today and return next Thursday. The Tory conference in Manchester starts on Sunday, and is due to finish on Wednesday. Dismissing concerns that incendiary language can contribute to the culture leading to MPs getting death threats and Jo Cox being murdered as \u201chumbug\u201d (see 1.15pm) was probably the most provocative thing that Boris Johnson said last night. But another jaw-dropping moment came when he said: \u201cThe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, and indeed to bring this country together, would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d Cox, of course, was passionately anti-Brexit. She was killed by a far-right terrorist motivated by hatred for people he referred to as \u201ccollaborators\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d. Rachel Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s sister, has joined those condemning the PM for his language, and on Sky she singled out this comment for particular criticism. She said: I do think it was particularly tasteless for those grieving a mother, MP and friend to say the best way to honour her memory is to deliver the thing she and her family campaigned against. I think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u201cBritain first\u201d, of the far right tendency, which you could argue is being whipped up by this sort of language. In an interview with Sky, Rachel Johnson also criticised her brother\u2019s language generally. My brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4m votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible language to use. Although close to her brother, Rachel Johnson has never agreed with him on Brexit. She voted remain, joined the Lib Dems after the referendum, and then switched to Change UK, who adopted her as a candidate during the European elections. Like all the Change UK candidates, she failed to get elected. Here is a fuller version of what the Labour MP Jess Phillips said when she asked her urgent question about Boris Johnson\u2019s language. (See 12.11pm.) She said: The use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as the surrender bill, such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division. I get it, it works, it is working. It is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country. When I hear of my friend Jo Cox\u2019s murder and the way that it has made me and my colleagues feel, and feel scared, described as humbug (see 1.15pm), I actually don\u2019t feel anger towards the prime minister, I feel pity for those of you who have to toe his line. The people opposite me know how appalling it was to describe the murder of my friend as mere humbug. I want to ask the prime minister to apologise and to tell him that the bravest, strongest thing to say is sorry - it will make him look good, it will not upset the people who want Brexit in this country if he acts for once like a statesman. Calling me names, putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend makes me cross and angry, it makes me scared even, but I will not react, the prime minister wants me to react so I join in the chaos that keeps this hatred and fear on our streets. I simply ask the minister to request the prime minister, who\u2019s notable by his bravery today, I ask him to ask the prime minister to meet with me in private with his advisers and some of his colleagues, and my friends from Jo\u2019s family so we can explain our grief and try to make him understand why it is so abhorrent that he has chosen a strategy to divide rather than to lead. Boris Johnson said many provocative things during his long statement to the Commons last night, but his most incendiary answer was probably the one he gave in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff. Jeremy Corbyn referred to it directly in his statement. (See 12.59pm.) For the record, here is Sherriff\u2019s question, and Johnson\u2019s answer, in full. Sherriff asked: I genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament that was passed by this house. I am sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to the use of offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language about legislation that we do not like. We stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [Jo Cox]. Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. Let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words \u2013 surrender act, betrayal, traitor \u2013 and I, for one, am sick of it. We must moderate our language, and that has to come from the prime minister first, so I should be interested in hearing his opinion. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself. Johnson replied: I have to say that I have never heard such humbug in all my life. The reality is that this is a bill ... At that point there was so much uproar that the Speaker had to intervene. When Johnson got to speak again, he continued: Mr Speaker, let me just explain why I call it the surrender act. That is because it would oblige us to stay in the EU for month after month, at a cost of a billion pounds per month. It would take away from this country the ability to decide how long that extension would be, and it would give that power to the EU. It would absolutely undermine our ability to continue to negotiate properly in Brussels; it takes away the fundamental ability of a country to walk away from the negotiations, and I am afraid that is exactly what it does. If I may say so respectfully to opposition members who are getting very agitated about this, the best way to get rid of the surrender act is not to have voted for it in the first place, to repeal it, and to vote for the deal that we are going to do. That is the way forward. If you want to read the all the exchanges, the Hansard is available here. But it is a long read; the exchanges lasted for more than three hours. David Gauke, the former Tory justice secretary, who now sits as an independent having had the whip removed over a Brexit rebellion, says at best what Boris Johnson said last night could be described as \u201cdeeply insensitive\u201d. But Gauke says what he is concerned about is that the government is deliberately pursuing a strategy intended to entrench division. He asks the minister to confirm that this is not government policy. Foster says the Tories will go into the next election committed to uniting the country. Here is an extract from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s statement at the start of this UQ. (See 12.24pm.) Corbyn said: It\u2019s extremely disappointing that the prime minister has not respected this house by attending here today. The prime minister\u2019s language and demeanour yesterday was frankly nothing short of disgraceful. Three years ago our colleague, our member, Jo Cox, was murdered by a far-right activist shouting: \u2018Britain First, this is for Britain.\u2019 The language that politicians use matters and has real consequences. To dismiss concerns from members about the death threats they receive and to dismiss concerns that the language by the prime minister is being repeated in those death threats is reprehensible. To dismiss those concerns in an abusive way as he did is completely unacceptable ... I\u2019ve written to all members of the parliamentary Labour party expressing my solidarity to my friends and set out the conduct expected of all colleagues. No side of this house, as you\u2019ve said Mr Speaker, has a monopoly of virtue. Inappropriate language has been used by all sides. But we all have a duty to keep our debates political and not to descend into personal abuse. Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff says she asked Boris Johnson to moderate his language last night. She says she accepts that in the past she has heckled ministers loudly. She says she was horrified to see this tweet from the Tory MP Simon Clarke after her intervention last night. She says she would not refer to Clarke as honourable. She asks the Cabinet Office minster Kevin Foster if the government supports this. Foster says that the government wants MPs to moderate their language, but he does not comment on Clarke\u2019s tweet. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge tells MPs that, when she came into the Commons last night, she felt as if she was attending a meeting of the Bullingdon Club. The Lib Dem MP Luciana Berger says, as someone who has seen six people convicted for hate crimes directed at her, she wants Boris Johnson to tone down his inflammatory language. Kevin Foster tells Berger that her party campaigned on the slogan \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d. More on the 1922 Committee meeting. This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, tells the Commons that he never saw David Cameron use the sort of language Boris Johnson did yesterday. He says talking about \u201csurrender\u201d implies we are at war with Europe. But we are not at war with Europe and we are not at war with each other, he says. He says this language is intended to cause division. Some people say this strategy will work. I say this strategy will not work because the British people are better than this. Justine Greening, a former Tory cabinet minister who now sits as an independent, having had the whip removed, tells the Commons she was shocked by the language Boris Johnson used yesterday. She says she thinks there is a \u201cdeliberate race to the bottom\u201d in British politics now, that disadvantages MPs who are not prepared to go along with it. Here is more from what Boris Johnson told Conservative backbenchers at his private meeting with the 1922 Committee. From my colleague Rowena Mason From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From Mail Online\u2019s David Wilcock Jeremy Corbyn is speaking on this topic for Labour. He says it is \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that Boris Johnson is not here himself to answer the UQ. Johnson\u2019s language last night was \u201cnothing short of disgraceful\u201d, Corbyn says. He says the way Johnson dismissed concerns about the murder of Jo Cox and the role language can play in inciting attacks like that was \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Corbyn says Johnson was trying to \u201centrench divisions\u201d. He urges the PM to apologise. Johnson\u2019s language \u201cfell well below the standards expected by the people of this country\u201d, Corbyn says. Corbyn says Boris Johnson should apologise for his \u201creprehensible\u201d comments about threats to MPs yesterday. The Tory MP Maria Miller questions the appropriateness of Jess Phillips raising this point. She says that during last night\u2019s statement Phillips herself was one of the Labour MPs shouting the loudest at Johnson. Foster is responding to Phillips. He says he does not consider anyone in the Commons as a traitor. He says, as the minister responsible for the government\u2019s \u201cdefending democracy\u201d programme, he would be happy to meet Phillips. He repeats the points he made earlier about how the government is trying to increase security for election candidates. Ultimately it is for everyone to think about the language they use, he says. He says the government wants to respond with \u201ccalm dignity\u201d and to create a safe environment for all. He does not say whether the PM himself will be willing to meet Phillips, and he does not comment on Johnson\u2019s language. Jess Phillips is speaking now. She says the language used by Boris Johnson last night was \u201cclearly designed to inflate hatred\u201d. She says she was appalled to hear him describe a reference to the murder of Jo Cox as \u201chumbug\u201d. Johnson should apologise, she says. She asks the minister Kevin Foster whether the PM will be willing to meet her, and some of Cox\u2019s friends and families, so that they can tell him how hurt they were by his language. John Bercow, the Speaker, is making a statement in the Commons. He says in light of the \u201cappalling atmosphere in the chamber yesterday and the toxicity that it can spawn or exacerbate in the country at large\u201d he has granted an urgent question. The Labour MP Jess Phillips wants a statement on whether the PM will reflect on the language used by MPs. She wanted Boris Johnson to answer, but instead the junior Cabinet Office minister Kevin Foster is replying. Foster says the government understands the importance of language. He says it is going to make intimidating election candidates an offence. And he says the police have been reviewing security for MPs. He does not say anything about the language used by Boris Johnson yesterday. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, will travel to Brussels on Friday for a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Downing Street has said. But the PM\u2019s spokesman has also said that although progress has been made in negotiations with Brussels, \u201cthere are significant obstacles remaining to concluding a deal\u201d. From my colleague Matthew Weaver From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth The European commission has joined those reprimanding Boris Johnson for the language he used in the Commons last night about his opponent. This is what the commission\u2019s spokeswoman, Mina Andreeva, said on the subject. We would remind everybody that respect is a fundamental value in all democracies. It is the responsibility of each and every politician to uphold our values. History has shown us what happens when they are not respected. Boris Johnson is addressing the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee. These are from some of the journalists doorstepping the meeting. In the Commons, in response to an urgent question, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has admitted that the government has made further breaches of the court ruling banning arms sales to Saudia Arabia that could be used in Yemen, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports. Jo Cox\u2019s sister, Kim Leadbeater, has joined Cox\u2019s husband (see 7.45am) in expressing alarm about the language used by Boris Johnson in the Commons last night. Leadbeater told Sky News: I watched parliament TV for four hours last night and I was mesmerised and dumbstruck by the scenes that I saw before me. I think the prime minister needs to think very carefully about the language he uses. I think everybody has to think really carefully about the language they use. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has defended Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to use terms such as surrender and betrayal in the Brexit context. The argument against such language is that it is inflammatory because it frames Brexit, an issue that is supposed to be about a trading relationships with friendly countries, in terms of warfare, with the EU depicted as an enemy power. The Tory MP Simon Hoare has called for a change of tone from Boris Johnson. Hoare, who voted remain in 2016, told the Commons: There needs to a change in the mood music emanating from No 10 because as a Tory party we obey the rule of law and the fact that is in question in this place should bring shame on all of us. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Matthew Weaver. One consequence of Boris Johnson\u2019s extraordinary provocative and divisive performance in the Commons last night is that it has made it much, much harder to see how any opposition MPs could vote with him for a Brexit deal in the next few weeks. It is hard to know whether he is even at all serious about trying to get an agreement through the Commons. This has just been confirmed in the chamber by Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy, one of the opposition MPs who has been trying to drum up support for a cross-party deal. Condemning Johnson\u2019s \u201chorrendous, divisive language\u201d, she said: For those of us who do want to work cross-party to achieve a deal, this is making it much, much more difficult. The Labour MP Paula Sherriff has accused the prime minister of inciting hatred against MPs. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme she said she was horrified by Boris Johnson\u2019s dismissal of her concerns about threats to MPs as \u201chumbug\u201d. Sherriff said: We talk about it in the tearooms. People are really frightened and for him to treat it almost like a joke, was absolutely horrific and demeans the office of prime minister. I believe the prime minister is inciting hatred towards MPs. I understand the importance of saying that, but I know that feeling is shared by many of us. She said one MP had contacted her since last night saying the rhetoric used meant she would not stand at the next election. But Sherriff said she herself was determined to continue as an MP. She said: \u201cI will not let these bullies win and I include the prime minister in that.\u201d She said she feared that another MP could be killed and insisted she was \u201cnot scaremongering\u201d. She also called on MPs from all sides of the house to tone down their rhetoric: \u201cWe all need to reflect on our language and our behaviour. The bad behaviour is not exclusive to Conservative MPs.\u201d But she singled out the Treasury minister Simon Clarke for accusing her of making a \u201ctoxic\u201d intervention in her angry question to the prime minister. Sherriff described Clarke\u2019s tweet as abhorrent. \u201cIt makes me sick,\u201d she said. She said she had had threats of rape, murder and mutilation earlier this year. The abuse comes every day, thankfully the death threats don\u2019t. Last night the overwhelming majority of the communications I received were supportive, including from many Conservative supporters. But equally I received some horrific abuse last night much of it misogynistic. We urgently need to dial down the rhetoric. Labour MPs remain furious about Johnson\u2019s comments about Jo Cox, but many are now citing her memory to try to mend divisions. Duddridge refuses to be drawn on what circumstances the government would seek an extension to the 31 October Brexit deadline. He again repeats that the government will obey the law. Hilary Benn says the government\u2019s claims about obeying the law and not seeking an extension are not compatible. How can those things be reconciled, Benn asks. Duddridge says the PM really doesn\u2019t want an extension. The government is breaking every sinew to get a deal. The government will obey the law, he says again. The Brexit minister James Duddridge insists the government \u201cwill obey the law\u201d. But asked how the prime minister can avoid asking for an extension under the Benn Act \u2013 or European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 \u2013 he says: \u201cThat is a hypothetical question I don\u2019t want to be drawn into ...\u201d Duddridge says the government will use \u201cevery bit of wriggle room\u201d to get a deal. Four urgent questions have been granted today covering: the Benn Act, Hong Kong, arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the prime minister\u2019s language and role. The Speaker, John Bercow, has appealed to MPs to stop using toxic language. Opening today\u2019s session in the Commons, Bercow says: There is a widespread sense across the house, and beyond, that yesterday the house did itself no credit. There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I\u2019ve known in my 22 years in the house. On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words were uttered. The culture was toxic. He says he has been approached by two senior MPs from either side of the house for a formal consideration of political conduct. Pending consideration of that, he has granted a urgent question about the language used across the house. Bercow says it is not a partisan issue. It is about something bigger than party affiliation, he says. Bercow says: \u201cPlease lower the decibel level and treat each other as opponents rather than enemies.\u201d UPDATE: Here is the Labour MP Harriet Harman welcoming Bercow\u2019s comments. Harman and Ken Clarke have been calling for a Speaker\u2019s conference on threats to MP. They are the mother and father of the house respectively (ie, the longest-serving female and male MPs). The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has claimed it is parliament\u2019s refusal to deliver Brexit that is fuelling anger in the country. Speaking to Sky News, he said opposition MPs were equally to blame for intemperate language in the Commons. I think this is the pot calling the kettle black. Last night I watched when Labour MPs lined up, they were shouting that he was a liar, he was a cheat. It wasn\u2019t about Boris Johnson, it was about the issue. The issue which they want to dance away from which is causing this is that when you promise the British people you will act on the result of the vote that they were given in 2016 and parliament goes on saying no, this is the fuel that feeds the anger and therefore it has to be resolved. Si\u00e2n Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, and a member of the London assembly\u2019s oversight committee condemned Cleverly\u2019s suggestion that Johnson would ignore any summons over the Arcuri questions. Speaking to the Guardian she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can really predict which laws the prime minister is going to obey. He has left himself basically in contempt of parliament. But we would expect him to comply with the law. \u201cSeeing the prime minister last night suggesting that he won\u2019t behave in a way that is appropriate is really disturbing. The prime minister\u2019s one job is to effectively uphold the law and the fact that we have got one who is not doing that on a regular basis is very very disturbing. And that people are prepared to justify that is even more disturbing.\u201d Berry challenged Cleverly\u2019s assertion that ministers could ignore the assembly. She pointed out that it did have the legal power to compel the prime minister to appear. We very rarely use our powers of summons. On the Garden Bridge we informally invited Boris Johnson, first in a letter, and then we sent a proper summons because we needed to hear from him. We had to get advice on whether we could do that to a former mayor, but we could, so we did. And we would again. Earlier this week the London assembly wrote to Johnson giving him 14 days to respond to the allegations about Jennifer Arcuri. The letter from Len Duvall chair of the assembly\u2019s oversight committee, said: I read with concern the allegations set out in the Sunday Times yesterday that, when you held the office of mayor of London, you failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in relation to the awarding of public funds to Jennifer Arcuri. As you will know, the London assembly is responsible for holding to account the office of the mayor of London. Accordingly, I now write to ask that you provide, within 14 days of receipt of this letter: \u2013 Details and a timeline of all contact with Jennifer Arcuri during your period of office as mayor of London, including personal, social and professional. \u2013 And an explanation of how that alleged personal relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA and other parts of the GLA family. James Cleverly suggested Johnson would ignore any request by the London assembly to appear before it to answer questions about his conduct as mayor of London over the tech businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. The assembly has given him 14 days to explain why sponsorship and favours were granted to Arcuri, a close friend of Johnson, without any declaration of interest being made. Members of the assembly have suggested they could also summons Johnson to answer questions about Arcuri, as they did over the failed Garden Bridge project. Asked whether Johnson would appear before the London assembly, the Tory chairman told Today: \u201cThe London assembly\u2019s job is to scrutinise the mayor of London. When I was on the London assembly it was quite common for government ministers to refuse to appear.\u201d When it was put to him that the assembly had the legal power to summons members of the government, Cleverly said: \u201cThat is not my understanding.\u201d The Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, has defended the prime minister\u2019s language in the Commons. Speaking on Today he said he couldn\u2019t see how the \u201chighly charged\u201d atmosphere in the house would calm down until Brexit was resolved. Cleverly tried to claim the prime minister had not used the language of \u201cbetrayal\u201d before being corrected. He also claimed language on all sides had been intemperate and violent. When Johnson accused the Labour MP Paula Sherriff of talking \u201chumbug\u201d, Cleverly claimed Johnson was responding to accusations that were untrue. The rhetoric could be de-escalated if both sides calmed down and compromised, Cleverly said. Asked whether Johnson would seek an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit as set out in the Benn Act, Cleverly insisted that Johnson would obey the law. We will obey the law, Cleverly said, but he refused to say whether the PM would abide by the Benn Act. We will leave by 31 October, Cleverly said. Luciana Berger, who joined the Liberal Democrats after leaving Labour, will give up her Liverpool constituency to fight for a London seat once held by Margaret Thatcher, PA reports. The campaigner against antisemitism will contest the seat of Finchley and Golders Green in north London, a constituency with a sizeable Jewish community, at the next election. The Lib Dems came third in 2017, 21,000 off the Conservative victor, Mike Freer, in a seat formerly held by ex-prime minister Mrs Thatcher for more than 30 years, albeit under a slightly different make-up. Berger quit the Labour party in February, walking out with six other colleagues, and went on to form Change UK. The constituency voted 70% to remain and Berger will be hoping her party\u2019s recently approved policy of revoking article 50 if it wins a majority at the next election will make her a serious contender. Her Jewish background could also play a factor in attracting voters who rejected Labour over concerns of growing antisemitism in the party. Golders Green is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the capital, with kosher bakeries and a visible Hasidic presence on its high streets and in the adjacent Temple Fortune. Nicholas Soames, one of the 21 rebels to have lost the Tory whip, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the language of the prime minister and said it made the prospect of getting a Brexit deal through the Commons more difficult. But the grandson of Winston Churchill stopped short of calling on Johnson to resign. He said: It sounds rather pathetic, the one won\u2019t stand and call for his resignation after his behaviour. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful. It is just going to further destabilise an already a very febrile and very fragile situation. Soames accused the prime minister of launching a \u201crant\u201d against the Labour party and Jeremy Corbyn. He said: I have never felt such a poisonous atmosphere. I deeply regret it and I apologise for it ... I was absolutely appalled by the whole language and tone of the House yesterday starting off for the attorney general\u2019s, in my view, disrespect to the supreme court, and not a word of contrition, or humility from the prime minister. He urged Johnson to calm tempers and try to build a compromise. I have grown up in a House where I believe the job of the prime minister, even under very difficult circumstances, is to try to bring the country together. And what the prime minister did yesterday, was to drive it further apart. I want Boris Johnson to start behaving like a prime minister and what he did yesterday makes what he has to do so much harder, which is to reach out across the House of Commons to build a compromise to get a deal. He needs to calm the thing down. I\u2019m afraid the country is being set up for a general election, which will be \u2018parliament and the judges against the people\u2019. Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo, has condemned the \u201csloppy language\u201d of Boris Johnson and the \u201cgrowing inferno of rhetoric\u201d in the House of Commons. The prime minister was widely condemned last night when he said the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox was to get Brexit done. In a notably restrained reaction on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Cox, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the language Johnson used, but noted that the prime minister\u2019s remarks were said \u201cin the on heat the moment\u201d. Cox said: I\u2019m sure on reflection, it\u2019s something that he would probably wish he hadn\u2019t said. I think it was sloppy language and the wrong thing to say, but I but I don\u2019t think that he is an evil man. What isn\u2019t legitimate is to co-opt her memory or her beliefs for things that she didn\u2019t believe in or didn\u2019t say. I was thinking about how Jo would respond to it last night. She would have tried to take a generosity of spirit to it. And thought about how in this moment, you can step back from this growing inferno of rhetoric. Cox urged politicians of both sides of the Brexit debate to tone down the rhetoric used and stop portraying each other as good or evil. \u201cWe just have to have a more nuanced understanding to remember our common our common humanity,\u201d Cox said. He added: \u201cI was genuinely shocked by the the willingness to descend to vitriol, because I think it does long lasting harm. To have this debate descend into this bear pit of polarisation, I think it\u2019s dangerous for our country.\u201d There is a willingness to jump out and decry the other side when they use language like \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018traitor\u2019 or \u2018betrayal\u2019. And I think that is inflammatory language. But as inflammatory are those people who have used the language of it being a \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018dictatorship\u2019 and \u2018fascism\u2019. I think both of those approaches are unacceptable. It is not just bad behaviour by one side of the debate. This is something which is infected our politics, and it\u2019s this vicious cycle where language gets more extreme, response gets more extreme, it all gets hyped up ... It creates an atmosphere where I think violence and attacks are more likely. You can disagree passionately with people. But you don\u2019t have to impugn their motives, whether you are a hard Brexiteer or a hard remainer, actually, what you have in common is a desire to do what you think is best for the country. What isn\u2019t acceptable is to demonize each other to build a culture of hatred to the other to create this tribal identity. Whatever happens with Brexit, the country is going to have to come together again. And we have to remember that, otherwise, we\u2019ll be building a toxic legacy. How the papers covered it The furious and dramatic scenes in Westminster dominate the front pages on Thursday as papers report on Boris Johnson\u2019s return to the House of Commons after his decision to suspend parliament was found to be unlawful. A few moments from last night\u2019s political television... And of course, Robert Peston\u2019s interview with Boris Johnson. A lot of senior political journalists tweeting their shock at the tone of debate in parliament yesterday. This is from Julian King, the European commissioner for security. Luciana Berger has issued a letter to her constituents on Twitter telling them she would be stepping down as MP for Liverpool Wavertree, where she has served for almost 10 years, due to the challenges of \u201cbalancing personal and professional responsibilities\u201d, particularly with young children. She will be relocating to London after the next election and be standing as the Liberal Democrat Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Finchley and Golders Green. The Conservatives have also tabled a motion to be voted on this morning, to support shutting down parliament for three days next week to accommodate their party conference, despite the supreme court verdict. Outrage as Boris Johnson dismisses dangers of inflammatory language as \u2018humbug\u2019 Here is the moment that has so many people so furious. Yesterday Labour MP Paula Sherriff attacked the prime minister for repeatedly calling the act put through parliament by Hilary Benn to take no-deal Brexit off the table the \u201csurrender bill\u201d and asked him not to use \u201coffensive, dangerous, inflammatory language for legislation we do not like.\u201d Recalling the memory of her friend Cox, she said many MPs had received death threats. \u201cAnd let me tell the prime minister \u2013 they often quote his words, \u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal,\u2019 \u2018traitor\u2019: we must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first.\u201d Johnson replied that he had never heard such \u201chumbug\u201d in all his life. He caused further outrage when telling Labour\u2019s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox\u2019s seat following the MP\u2019s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that \u201cthe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done\u201d. MPs (and it should be noted, mostly female MPs) responded by sharing death threats they have received, some of which directly quote Johnson. Some did so in the chamber yesterday, others on Twitter overnight. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. We return to the political fray after a day in which an unrepentant Boris Johnson sparked a furious backlash for repeating criticism of the supreme court judgment, and rejecting MPs\u2019 pleas to moderate his \u201cinflammatory\u201d language. As you\u2019ll no doubt recall, Johnson faced parliament yesterday after flying back early from New York when the Supreme Court ruled his suspension unlawful. But Johnson was unrepentant as he addressed MPs and went on the attack, accusing Jeremy Corbyn of trying to thwart Brexit and running scared of an election. He also caused outrage by claiming the best way to honour the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. There was much criticism of Johnson\u2019s language, yesterday, with MPs, particularly female MPs, imploring Johnson to be stop using words like \u201csurrender\u201d, \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d in relation to Brexit, with the MPs saying these words had been used in death threats issued to them and their families. Johnson caused outrage by dismissing these concerns as \u201chumbug\u201d. Yesterday and overnight, MPs were tweeting out some of the threats, including death threats, they have received, which directly quoted Boris Johnson. So, what happens now? Parliament will sit again today where there will be a \u201cgeneral debate on the principles of democracy and the rights of the electorate\u201d. And Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would be making an \u201cexciting announcement\u201d in the Commons. So, we\u2019ll all be on the edge of our seats for that \u2013 or lazily reclined across three seats, as the case may be. As always, you can get in touch with me as I steer us through the early hours: I\u2019m here on Twitter and my email is kate.lyons@theguardian.com Let\u2019s go.",

The Guardian spoke to female MPs about the intimidation they face, including Paula Sherriff \u2013 whose speech about Cox and the threats she receives was dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d by the prime minister in the House of Commons.</p> <h2><strong>Paula Sherriff, Labour MP for Dewsbury</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>\u2018I have had so many, too many, threats to detail\u2019</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c1c471907ac7fa85917f0f76aa3aecff9344496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c1c471907ac7fa85917f0f76aa3aecff9344496/549_731_5053_3032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Sherriff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paula Sherriff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Tree/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have had so many, too many, threats to detail. Threats on my life. Rape threats. Since I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/no-apologies-labour-fury-as-boris-johnson-goes-on-the-attack\">confronted the prime minister on language,</a> we have already had to report two or three to the police. You just can\u2019t take any chances.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse is virtually constant, certainly on social media. It does peak and trough according to what\u2019s going on in parliament. It started with the referendum. Brexit really seems to have empowered some people who feel this sort of language, and these sorts of threats, have become legitimised.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be tough. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear, we are very resilient. I reject those saying we are snowflakes and weak. Quite the opposite. We are very, very tough. To be a female MP, certainly in a marginal seat, isn\u2019t easy. The vast majority of us accept robust debate comes as part of our role, as well as constructive criticism. Unfortunately, so many cross the line with threats of violence, and sexual violence, and some are really offensive. I have had so many just this afternoon. One said \u2018you fat twat\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be wearing. You try to balance it against the good work you are doing and the supportive messages. You try to remember these people are quite sad really, keyboard warriors who take to the computer and start sending these toxic rants.</p> <p>\u201cI think you become a little bit inured to it. You must, because when I tell people outside politics that I probably had over 1,000 messages overnight, and maybe 200 were really, really offensive, people respond: \u2018Oh my God\u2019. Genuinely, I am quite matter-of-fact about it.</p> <p>\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t shock me in the way it might have done three years ago when I did sometimes cry when I saw them. But now I rarely do. Now, it makes me feel angry, and it makes me feel really sad about where we are as a society, because I don\u2019t want the widespread feeling that it\u2019s just OK to abuse your MP, or indeed anybody in public office.</p> <p>\u201cI do fear with an election looming, it could get worse. I think everybody does. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessphillips/status/1176953499411763200\">Jess Phillips tweeted </a>that she is not worried about an election, she is worried that somebody will kill her.

But if you are also female and from an ethnic minority background, the abuse has a different angle. And that has become worse since the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not just a \u2018traitor\u2019, you are a \u2018coloured traitor\u2019. It\u2019s not just about \u2018betraying\u2019 the country, it\u2019s about \u2018betraying the country that gave you a safe home\u2019. And then the old chestnut \u2018go home\u2019; \u2018If you\u2019re not going to deliver Brexit, go home\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe language people use matters. It matters that in the chamber the language [is] of traitors, of surrendering, of betrayal. But the language outside [the chamber], such as \u2018letterboxes\u2019, about painting the referendum as a proxy vote on immigration, that matters as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse comes in all forms. It\u2019s not just from the general public, it\u2019s from the media as well. One article was headlined: \u2018Where do her loyalties really lie?\u2019 I was born in London, I\u2019m a politician in London, I grew up in London. What do you mean where do my loyalties really lie?</p> <p>\u201cThe abuse is on Twitter, in emails and in letters. I have had death threats, and they have been reported to the police.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that I am a lot more careful now than I was when I first started. That has a lot to do with the fact that Jo [Cox] was murdered. I think all of us were a little bit complacent before.</p> <p>\u201cWill an election make it any worse? Whether it\u2019s an election, or a campaign, it\u2019s about the tone that people from all sides take, especially at the top. The tone that the prime minister takes. It\u2019s about the general conduct. I think at election time, yes, of course, there is heightened emotion. There is more scrutiny of politicians. I think things are so tense at the moment, that can an election make it get any worse?

      "body": "<p>After the previous night\u2019s toxic debate in which Boris Johnson had set yet another new low for standards in public life \u2013 hard to believe, but even sociopaths can have a talent to surprise \u2013 the Speaker first called for calm and respect from MPs from all sides. He then allowed an urgent question from Jess Phillips on the language and role of the prime minister in creating a safe environment in the country and parliament. Good luck with that.</p> <p>The Incredible Sulk was keen to oblige. By doubling down on his complete and utter contempt for parliament and everyone in it by not bothering to turn up and sending the most junior, most instantly forgettable, minister he could find to take the flak on his behalf. Kevin Foster is so anonymous, he even needs a post-it note attached to his bedside table to remind himself that he is a gofer in the Cabinet Office with responsibility for almost nothing. And even that he does not do very well.</p> <p>Phillips was her usual forthright self. Yes, she got heated at times but she wasn\u2019t a traitor, she wasn\u2019t at war. She was an MP whose efforts to do her best for her constituents were rewarded with death threats in language that had been more or less copied verbatim from the Sulk\u2019s own speeches. Johnson was the real architect of division.</p> <p>She got that it was a deliberate tactic. Johnson was copying the Donald Trump playbook. What worked for one narcissist might work for another. Divert attention from his own failures, stir up hatred, split the country with \u2018People v Parliament\u2019 crap and take no personal responsibility for anything.</p> <p>She accepted the Sulk wasn\u2019t going to apologise \u2013 it was asking too much to break the habit of a lifetime \u2013 but just maybe there were a few Tory MPs with enough decency to do so on his behalf. There weren\u2019t. For the others, she only felt pity that they were too craven to speak out.</p> <p>One of whom was Foster, who was anxiously riffling through his briefing notes, searching for a credible response. Having failed to find anything, he started to ad-lib. The government would be introducing a \u2018Be Nice to One Another Day\u2019 in 2022. And ... um ... if Labour MPs started doing what the government wanted then the death threats would probably stop. A threat to stop the threats. Genius. It was all the fault of the opposition for having been stupid enough to believe in a parliamentary democracy. Classic Dom.</p> <p>Other attack lines soon emerged. Maria Miller also insisted that Labour only had itself to blame for the Sulk\u2019s behaviour. The real victim in all this weren\u2019t MPs receiving death threats, it was Boris himself. He had been pushed to the edge by an opposition that was totally unreasonably blocking his plans to completely screw over the country with a no-deal Brexit. Sulk sad. Sulk angry. Sulk bullied.</p> <p>Bernard Jenkin went further still. All female Labour MPs had to do to stop the abuse was to stop droning on about Jo Cox.

      "bodyText": "After the previous night\u2019s toxic debate in which Boris Johnson had set yet another new low for standards in public life \u2013 hard to believe, but even sociopaths can have a talent to surprise \u2013 the Speaker first called for calm and respect from MPs from all sides. He then allowed an urgent question from Jess Phillips on the language and role of the prime minister in creating a safe environment in the country and parliament. Good luck with that. The Incredible Sulk was keen to oblige. By doubling down on his complete and utter contempt for parliament and everyone in it by not bothering to turn up and sending the most junior, most instantly forgettable, minister he could find to take the flak on his behalf. Kevin Foster is so anonymous, he even needs a post-it note attached to his bedside table to remind himself that he is a gofer in the Cabinet Office with responsibility for almost nothing. And even that he does not do very well. Phillips was her usual forthright self. Yes, she got heated at times but she wasn\u2019t a traitor, she wasn\u2019t at war. She was an MP whose efforts to do her best for her constituents were rewarded with death threats in language that had been more or less copied verbatim from the Sulk\u2019s own speeches. Johnson was the real architect of division. She got that it was a deliberate tactic. Johnson was copying the Donald Trump playbook. What worked for one narcissist might work for another. Divert attention from his own failures, stir up hatred, split the country with \u2018People v Parliament\u2019 crap and take no personal responsibility for anything. She accepted the Sulk wasn\u2019t going to apologise \u2013 it was asking too much to break the habit of a lifetime \u2013 but just maybe there were a few Tory MPs with enough decency to do so on his behalf. There weren\u2019t. For the others, she only felt pity that they were too craven to speak out. One of whom was Foster, who was anxiously riffling through his briefing notes, searching for a credible response. Having failed to find anything, he started to ad-lib. The government would be introducing a \u2018Be Nice to One Another Day\u2019 in 2022. And ... um ... if Labour MPs started doing what the government wanted then the death threats would probably stop. A threat to stop the threats. Genius. It was all the fault of the opposition for having been stupid enough to believe in a parliamentary democracy. Classic Dom. Other attack lines soon emerged. Maria Miller also insisted that Labour only had itself to blame for the Sulk\u2019s behaviour. The real victim in all this weren\u2019t MPs receiving death threats, it was Boris himself. He had been pushed to the edge by an opposition that was totally unreasonably blocking his plans to completely screw over the country with a no-deal Brexit. Sulk sad. Sulk angry. Sulk bullied. Bernard Jenkin went further still. All female Labour MPs had to do to stop the abuse was to stop droning on about Jo Cox. Couldn\u2019t they just get over the fact that one of their friends had died? Hell, it was more than three years ago. Just move on. Shit happened. Time for women to man up. At which point, the Commons threatened to boil over again. Just as Classic Dom and the Sulk had hoped. Foster just looked rather bemused and stared at the clock. Number 10\u2019s contempt for parliament had also been on show earlier in the day when James Duddridge, another minor jobsworth of limited talent and charm, rather than the Brexit secretary had been pushed out to answer an urgent question on whether the government intended to request an extension if no deal was reached by 31 October.

      "bodyText": "Part of the fury among MPs about Boris Johnson\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric is that it appears to be a deliberate, election-driven strategy. Labour MPs are incandescent at the idea that the best way to honour Jo Cox is to get Brexit done and the prime minister\u2019s dismissive attitude towards concerns about their safety. But the situation is made worse by the suspicion that it is neither careless nor casual \u2013 but rather a concerted effort to whip up anger in the country against MPs in order to motivate pro-Brexit voters to back him at the polls. Johnson\u2019s language about a \u201csurrender bill\u201d is calculated to cast his opponents as people colluding with foreign powers to block Brexit. It was not a flippant, one-off comment, as the prime minister has used the words at least eight times in the House of Commons. He also told Conservative MPs that he was determined to continue using those words. Labour MPs are wise to this but fear that it is already \u201ccutting through\u201d to voters, as electoral strategists say, not just through the traditional media but clipped versions of Johnson\u2019s speeches spreading through social media. Thousands of comments below the prime minister\u2019s Facebook posts congratulate him for his approach to Brexit, while pro-Brexit commentators and even some far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins amplify his message. The rhetoric is also spreading throughout the media via anonymous \u201csenior government source\u201d quotes distributed variously to political journalists. Using outlandish, eye-catching metaphors, these sources try to make the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d enter the public consciousness in the same way that the Vote Leave slogans about \u201ctaking back control\u201d and spending \u201c\u00a3350m on the NHS\u201d. This is the hallmark of Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave architect who is now Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has also highlighted its similarities with the language of rightwing populist demagogues such as Donald Trump. \u201cHe is whipping up division with language that\u2019s indistinguishable from the far right,\u201d the Labour leader said in his conference speech this week. After Wednesday night\u2019s fractious debate over Johnson\u2019s inflammatory language, several MPs say death threats and abuse got worse overnight.

      "bodyText": "The plea from the Labour MP Paula Sherriff for Boris Johnson and others to tone down their political rhetoric has returned the focus to the daily threats of violence faced by public figures. Are threats to public figures on the rise? Earlier this year, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told parliamentarians the number of threats to MPs had risen significantly. In the first five months of 2019, MPs reported 152 crimes to the police, who also received reports of another 600 incidents involving MPs. This is a 90% rise on the same period last year and the Met has predicted that if the trend continues, more than 450 crimes will be reported by the end of the year. In 2018, the number of crimes reported by MPs more than doubled from 151 in 2017 to 342. Dick said female MPs and MPs from ethnic minorities were disproportionately targeted, and about 10 MPs accounted for 29% of reports. How can the threats be dealt with? A range of charges can be used to tackle threats of violence, including making a threat to kill, sending malicious communications, or harassment. Threatening to kill is at the most serious end of such offending, carrying a potential 10-year prison sentence, but the charge is rarely used. Earlier this year, the Met commander Adrian Usher, told MPs: \u201cIt is a notoriously difficult offence to prove because it contains an element of intent, and as soon as we get into intent as a point to prove, my own experience in the courts is that that is very difficult.\u201d More commonly, offenders are convicted of harassment or malicious communications. Has any action been taken? There have been a number of successful prosecutions. Robert Vidler was jailed for 18 weeks after being convicted in August on three counts of sending menacing or obscene messages and five counts of harassment. He sent voicemails to several MPs saying he knew where they lived and their movements, and threatening to kill them. He sent Nick Boles, the independent MP for Grantham, a voicemail threatening to cut his throat \u201cif you fuck up Brexit\u201d. David Stuart, who was convicted in May on two counts of sending a threatening communication, received a 36-week prison sentence suspended for two years. He had sent threatening emails to Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, and Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and the leader of the Independent Group for Change. Jarod Kirkman was jailed for 42 weeks after being convicted in April on six counts of sending threatening messages to MPs. He sent the online communications to Heidi Allen, the independent MP for South Cambridgeshire, and David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, who are both remain campaigners. Using email addresses such as \u201cMP@deadpoliticianwalking.com\u201d and \u201cPutin@fsb.ru\u201d, with subject lines of \u201cBrexit traitor\u201d and \u201cBrexit loser\u201d, in one message to Allen he said, \u201cYour days are fucking numbered bitch\u201d, and to David Lammy he wrote: \u201cFuck off and die in the jungle.\u201d Does the language mirror that used in political debate? In some cases, yes. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson said during a speech in Yorkshire that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than agree to extend the Brexit deadline. On Wednesday, the Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted a picture of a death threat she had received. The letter stated: \u201cIt was rather prophetic that Boris Johnson should say: \u2018I would rather be found dead in a ditch\u2019. That is what will happen to those who do not deliver Brexit.\u201d Sheriff, in her condemnation of the prime minister\u2019s language, detailed how daily death threats to her and fellow MPs \u201coften quote his [Johnson\u2019s] words \u2013 \u2018Surrender Act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019 \u2013 and I for one am sick of it\u201d. When asked for his name in court, Jo Cox\u2019s killer, Thomas Mair, said: \u201cMy name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\u201d He also wrote about \u201ccollaborators\u201d. The far-right extremist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, reportedly wrote on his official Telegram account that \u201c21 Tory traitors decided to side with Corbyn and the Labour traitors and try and block the Brexit that the majority of people voted for\u201d.",

A backlash is growing over the prime minister\u2019s language in the Commons on Wednesday after the acrimonious resumption of business, following the supreme court\u2019s ruling the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was unlawful. There was uproar in the Commons on Wednesday as Johnson repeatedly berated MPs, rejected calls to temper his \u201cdangerous and inflammatory\u201d language and said the best way to honour the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox \u2013 an ardent remainer \u2013 was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.

And the prime minister appeared to point-blank refuse to go to Brussels to get an article 50 extension if there was no deal by the end of October, as now required by law. Here are some of the key exchanges.</p> <h2>On the prime minister\u2019s language</h2> <p><strong>Paula </strong><strong>Sherriff (Labour, Dewsbury):</strong> \u201cI genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. And I\u2019m sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [the murdered MP Jo Cox] with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day. And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, and I for one am sick of it. And it has to come from the prime minister first. So I would be interested in hearing his opinion, he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fd0f5a1e4c513c3255c9cf60f9fd4d6eeb5a22c/325_0_1858_1114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The MP Paula Sherriff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The MP Paula Sherriff said the PM should not resort to using \u2018offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language\u2019 to describe legislation he did not like.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Boris Johnson (prime minister, Conservative, Uxbridge and South Ruislip</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cI think Mr Speaker, I have to tell you Mr Speaker, I have to say Mr Speaker, that I have never heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d</p> <h2>On honouring Jo Cox\u2019s memory</h2> <p><strong>Tracy Brabin (Labour, Batley and Spen \u2013 Jo Cox\u2019s former constituency)</strong>: \u201cHearing from the prime minister, words like \u2018the humiliation act\u2019, \u2018the surrender act\u2019, the capitulation act\u2019, all of these words are suggesting that because we disagree with him we are traitors, we are not patriots. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, this may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest that he is the establishment and we are still people. As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, going forward, will he moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when going about our jobs.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson:</strong> \u201cCan I say that the surest fire way \u2026 I think the \u2026 Of course there will be an attempt to obfuscate the effect of this act, but it does \u2026 the capitulation act or the surrender act, or whatever you want to call it. It does, it does, I\u2019m sorry but it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate. But what I will say is the best way to honour the memory and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d</p> <h2>On populist rhetoric</h2> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas (Green, Brighton Pavillion</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cThe tone of the prime minister\u2019s speech was truly shocking, and if he recognises that tensions are inflamed, it is up to him not to stoke them further by whipping up hatred, treating parliament with contempt and dividing our country still further. This populist rhetoric is not only unfitting for a prime minister; it is genuinely and seriously dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"589d4d0768e6c7d434d98ee117a112b5d96ce831\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/589d4d0768e6c7d434d98ee117a112b5d96ce831/0_1118_3632_2178/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Cox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Referring to the murdered MP Jo Cox, Paula Sherriff said many MPs were subjected to death threats and abuse every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>On the phrase \u2018surrender act\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Ian Blackford (SNP, Ross, Skye and Lochaber</strong><strong>): </strong>\u201cI hear the prime minister talking about a surrender act. How despicable that, when he refers to members of this house who are doing their duty to protect our constituents, he uses language such as \u2018surrender\u2019. That language is not suitable for the prime minister of any country.\u201d</p> <h2>On MPs\u2019 families receiving death threats</h2> <p><strong>Anna Soubry (Independent Group for Change, Broxtowe</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker, I, too, am very sad that the prime minister has left, because I had hoped to raise this point of order to give him the opportunity to perhaps correct the record and reflect on his language and conduct in this house tonight. It gives me no pleasure to say that I am 62, I have been around and I have seen quite a lot of stuff in my life. It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears. I am not alone tonight; there are others who I believe have left the estate, such has been their distress.</p> <p>\u201cI merely say to everybody in this place, but most notably to those who hold the highest of offices in this the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, that the language that is used is incredibly important. Whatever side of the debate people are on, we have evidence that when they use words such as \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018capitulation\u2019, or others use the words \u2018traitor\u2019 and \u2018treason\u2019, there is a direct consequence. It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04947f508e5bf6eb4207f9649235ff88eac9623f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04947f508e5bf6eb4207f9649235ff88eac9623f/365_0_2195_1317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Swinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said she had reported a death threat against her child to the police.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jo Swinson (</strong><strong>Liberal Democrat leader, East Dunbartonshire):</strong> \u201cI fear that the public watching today will perhaps take the view that this house does not take sufficiently seriously threats of violence. Earlier today, we had the attorney general joke about wife beating. When asked whether they would bring forward the domestic abuse bill now that parliament has resumed, we had the government dismiss those requests, and we have had the comments that were made by the honourable member for Dewsbury [Paula Sherriff] recalling Jo Cox MP and the threats that MPs face on a daily basis \u2013 I may add that, today, I have reported to the police a threat against my child \u2013 and that was dismissed as humbug. This is a disgraceful state of affairs, and we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better.\u201d</p> <h2>On the distress caused to Jo Cox\u2019s family</h2> <p><strong>Lucy Powell (Labour, Manchester Central</strong><strong>):</strong> \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that some of these points have been made already, but I just wanted to remind the house that Jo\u2019s murder did not happen in a vacuum. It happened in a context \u2013 a context that is not dissimilar to the context we find ourselves in today. I have heard from Jo\u2019s family this evening, and they have been very distressed by watching this place today. I know others have said it, but it has come from one side of the house: the language of \u2018surrender\u2019, of \u2018betrayal\u2019 and of \u2018capitulation\u2019. This is the kind of language and the context that led to the murder of an MP leaving her surgery of an evening in a small market town by somebody from the far right, and we cannot forget that context when we conduct ourselves. I just wanted to put that on the record.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/boris-johnson-urged-to-calm-commons-inferno-of-rhetoric\">Boris Johnson urged to calm Commons 'inferno of rhetoric'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>John Bercow (Speaker): </strong>\u201cThat point is duly noted. It is a very serious point. I do not want to add to it, but suffice it to say that although I do not know the Cox family anything \u200blike as well as the honourable lady or many other members here present, I do know members of the family.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday night\u2019s statement by Boris Johnson led to heated exchanges in the House of Commons around his use of inflammatory language. During the course of the debate the prime minister used the word \u201csurrender\u201d 13 times and said: \u201cWe will not betray the people who sent us here.\u201d Many MPs picked up on Johnson\u2019s language, saying it was irresponsible and unfitting. And the prime minister appeared to point-blank refuse to go to Brussels to get an article 50 extension if there was no deal by the end of October, as now required by law. Here are some of the key exchanges. On the prime minister\u2019s language Paula Sherriff (Labour, Dewsbury): \u201cI genuinely do not seek to stifle robust debate, but this evening the prime minister has continually used pejorative language to describe an act of parliament passed by this house. And I\u2019m sure you would agree, Mr Speaker, that we should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like. \u201cAnd we stand here, Mr Speaker, under the shield of our departed friend [the murdered MP Jo Cox] with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day. And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words, \u2018surrender\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, and I for one am sick of it. And it has to come from the prime minister first. So I would be interested in hearing his opinion, he should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\u201d Boris Johnson (prime minister, Conservative, Uxbridge and South Ruislip): \u201cI think Mr Speaker, I have to tell you Mr Speaker, I have to say Mr Speaker, that I have never heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d On honouring Jo Cox\u2019s memory Tracy Brabin (Labour, Batley and Spen \u2013 Jo Cox\u2019s former constituency): \u201cHearing from the prime minister, words like \u2018the humiliation act\u2019, \u2018the surrender act\u2019, the capitulation act\u2019, all of these words are suggesting that because we disagree with him we are traitors, we are not patriots. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, this may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest that he is the establishment and we are still people. As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, going forward, will he moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when going about our jobs.\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cCan I say that the surest fire way \u2026 I think the \u2026 Of course there will be an attempt to obfuscate the effect of this act, but it does \u2026 the capitulation act or the surrender act, or whatever you want to call it. It does, it does, I\u2019m sorry but it greatly enfeebles this government\u2019s ability to negotiate. But what I will say is the best way to honour the memory and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d On populist rhetoric Caroline Lucas (Green, Brighton Pavillion): \u201cThe tone of the prime minister\u2019s speech was truly shocking, and if he recognises that tensions are inflamed, it is up to him not to stoke them further by whipping up hatred, treating parliament with contempt and dividing our country still further. This populist rhetoric is not only unfitting for a prime minister; it is genuinely and seriously dangerous.\u201d On the phrase \u2018surrender act\u2019 Ian Blackford (SNP, Ross, Skye and Lochaber): \u201cI hear the prime minister talking about a surrender act. How despicable that, when he refers to members of this house who are doing their duty to protect our constituents, he uses language such as \u2018surrender\u2019. That language is not suitable for the prime minister of any country.\u201d On MPs\u2019 families receiving death threats Anna Soubry (Independent Group for Change, Broxtowe): \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker, I, too, am very sad that the prime minister has left, because I had hoped to raise this point of order to give him the opportunity to perhaps correct the record and reflect on his language and conduct in this house tonight. It gives me no pleasure to say that I am 62, I have been around and I have seen quite a lot of stuff in my life. It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears. I am not alone tonight; there are others who I believe have left the estate, such has been their distress. \u201cI merely say to everybody in this place, but most notably to those who hold the highest of offices in this the most peculiar and extraordinary of political times, that the language that is used is incredibly important. Whatever side of the debate people are on, we have evidence that when they use words such as \u2018surrender\u2019 or \u2018capitulation\u2019, or others use the words \u2018traitor\u2019 and \u2018treason\u2019, there is a direct consequence. It means my mother receives a threat to her safety. It means my partner receives a death threat.\u201d Jo Swinson (Liberal Democrat leader, East Dunbartonshire): \u201cI fear that the public watching today will perhaps take the view that this house does not take sufficiently seriously threats of violence. Earlier today, we had the attorney general joke about wife beating. When asked whether they would bring forward the domestic abuse bill now that parliament has resumed, we had the government dismiss those requests, and we have had the comments that were made by the honourable member for Dewsbury [Paula Sherriff] recalling Jo Cox MP and the threats that MPs face on a daily basis \u2013 I may add that, today, I have reported to the police a threat against my child \u2013 and that was dismissed as humbug. This is a disgraceful state of affairs, and we must be able to find a way to conduct ourselves better.\u201d On the distress caused to Jo Cox\u2019s family Lucy Powell (Labour, Manchester Central): \u201cOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that some of these points have been made already, but I just wanted to remind the house that Jo\u2019s murder did not happen in a vacuum. It happened in a context \u2013 a context that is not dissimilar to the context we find ourselves in today. I have heard from Jo\u2019s family this evening, and they have been very distressed by watching this place today. I know others have said it, but it has come from one side of the house: the language of \u2018surrender\u2019, of \u2018betrayal\u2019 and of \u2018capitulation\u2019. This is the kind of language and the context that led to the murder of an MP leaving her surgery of an evening in a small market town by somebody from the far right, and we cannot forget that context when we conduct ourselves. I just wanted to put that on the record.\u201d John Bercow (Speaker): \u201cThat point is duly noted. It is a very serious point. I do not want to add to it, but suffice it to say that although I do not know the Cox family anything like as well as the honourable lady or many other members here present, I do know members of the family. I have a strong empathy with the objectives of the Jo Cox Foundation, and indeed I am in touch with the family from time to time, including currently in relation to upcoming events, so I am not unsighted on the issues. I do not think any of us in this chamber will ever forget or entirely overcome our horror, revulsion and distress at what happened to a wonderful human being and the most dedicated of public servants. She was murdered for what she believed, for the values she held, and for her effectiveness in campaigning for them. We do not in any circumstances ever want to witness a repeat of that.\u201d On seeking an extension to article 50 Ian Murray (Labour, Edinburgh South): \u201cThe problem that the prime minister has is that nobody in this house trusts him. He has been asked five times this evening if he would abide by all the provisions of the European Union [Withdrawal] [No. 2] Act, and he refuses to answer the question. So for the sixth and final time: if he does not get a deal or a no deal through this house by 19 October, will he seek an extension to 31 January from the European Union?\u201d Boris Johnson: \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cPrivate schools help hoard wealth, power and opportunity for the few.\u201d This comment by an anonymous Labour party source a few weeks ago states the problem in a nutshell. Private schools are out of reach (average fees nearly \u00a318,000 a year) for the great majority of people; their spend per pupil is at least three times more than that of state schools \u2013 a grotesque resources gap; and they constitute a highly effective service industry, which not only almost guarantees places at top universities but also provides a network of invaluable connections \u2013 together a passport to life\u2019s glittering prizes, with two old Etonian PMs in the last three years the most visible symbol. They are indeed enablers of wealth hoarding, of power hoarding, of opportunity hoarding. They are, in short, an affront to any notion of a just or inclusive society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ec9e624-fb4c-47a5-a6f9-f3f36fb6bf53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pN36jVSp1x0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such was the case put forward in our book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\" title=\"\">Engines of Privilege</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\" title=\"\">, published in February</a>, a work in many ways born out of long years of frustration at the prevailing political inertness on the issue. We had no expectation that seven months later the Labour party would vote at its conference to integrate the private sector into the state sector. In criticising Labour\u2019s position, the headmaster of Eton, Simon Henderson, this week acknowledged the public mood was shifting on the question, and that a battle lay ahead for the future of private education.</p> \n<p>It is a good moment, with the issue suddenly near the top of the non-Brexit agenda, to ask why over the last three-quarters of a century we have made so little progress in tackling what is, in many ways, a very British problem \u2013 given that in no other western society are private schools so deeply entrenched or so corrosive in their effects. There have been three potential turning points, but all failed to deliver change: the Tory education minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/03/rab-butler-1944-revolutionise-education-act-tim-brighouse\" title=\"\">Rab Butler</a> deftly ensured during the war that the private school issue was excluded from the otherwise historic 1944 Education Act. After the second world war, any reforming zeal on Clement Attlee\u2019s part was emasculated by his umbilical attachment to his old school, Haileybury. And during the 1960s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/11/jeremy-corbyn-harold-wilson-labour-europe-referendum\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>\u2019s Labour government initiated a royal commission on the public schools (as they were still absurdly called), whose mouse of a report in July 1968 achieved precisely nothing. The report did, however, prompt a flurry of letters to the Guardian. On 25 July, the letters page featured a pocket cartoon by the paper\u2019s brilliant resident cartoonist, Abu. It showed a rather cross-looking man scribbling a letter \u2013 \u201cSir, with reference to your leader on the public school system\u2019s divisive influence on our society \u2026\u201d \u2013 and above him a calendar. The date was 25 July 2068.</p> \n<p>It is now nearer to 2068 than 1968, and nothing of real substance has been achieved. But after four decades of virtual permafrost, things are hotting up again.

Although the private school issue is ultimately about what kind of society we are, it tends in everyday practice to be treated as a narrowly educational matter. At any one time, from the perspective of, say, the education secretary, or the Department for Education, what is happening to the 93% of children not at private schools understandably takes priority. Historically, the key figure here is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/16/politics.comment\" title=\"\">Anthony Crosland</a>, Labour\u2019s great postwar intellectual. \u201cI have never been able to understand,\u201d he famously asserted in 1956 in his influential work <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/19/tonyslegacytotony\" title=\"\">The Future of Socialism</a></em>, \u201cwhy socialists have been so obsessed with the question of the grammar schools, and so indifferent to the much more glaring injustice of the independent schools.\u201d Yet as education secretary in the 1960s, he pushed the private school issue into the long grass.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7827dd5fff323201ae2f19f7b26a5e3bf5ade811\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7827dd5fff323201ae2f19f7b26a5e3bf5ade811/0_0_5080_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls from a private school in Gloucestershire \u2026 \" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls at a private school in Gloucestershire \u2026 \u2018We don\u2019t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government,\u2019 say private school headteachers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is also what we call the \u201cdifferent planet\u201d problem. In London and the south-east, as well as in such affluent cities as Edinburgh, Oxford and York, private schools may be thick on the ground and the subject of endless fraught conversations. Elsewhere, in large parts of Britain, they are rarer and do not impinge on most people\u2019s daily lives or consciousness. Physical location, similarly, matters in the sense that many of the leading private schools, especially boarding schools, are tucked away in the countryside or semi-countryside \u2013 out of sight, out of mind.</p> \n<p>Also unhelpful has been what seems to be an intense reluctance on the part of the vast majority of state school leaders to put their heads above the parapet and speak out on the private school issue. During our public encounters with private school heads after the publication of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\" title=\"\">Engines of Privilege</a></em>, nothing has been more irritating than their line of: \u201cWe don\u2019t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government.\u201d Admittedly, it has been a state school teacher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/holly-rigby\" title=\"\">Holly Rigby</a>, one of the driving forces behind LAPS, who has pointed out the demotivating effects of private school privilege. But on the whole the private school leaders are correct: their state school counterparts remain the dog that fails to bark. Is this because they don\u2019t want to be seen as overly political? Because to privilege the private school issue might somehow be viewed as denigrating the state school system? Or, perhaps most likely, because they have a large amount on their plate and just want to get on with it, without casting unproductively envious eyes elsewhere? Yet because of the yawning resources gap they are in effect operating with one hand tied behind their backs, not helped by the debilitating flow of state-trained teachers from state schools into private schools. </p> \n<p>This is especially the case given the very effective PR machine that the private sector has at its disposal. The wider economic benefits conferred, all the wonderful partnerships with state schools, the many bursaries open to poor children, the sanctity of parental choice, the irretrievable damage that any reform would do to \u201cthe fabric of education in this country\u201d \u2013 the daily drumbeat continues from the Independent Schools Council and other seldom accountable industry bodies, complete with a sophisticated and shameless line in \u201cthe problem lies elsewhere\u201d, as we have found in our public encounters. And since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/22/labour-delegates-vote-in-favour-of-abolishing-private-schools\" title=\"\">Sunday\u2019s vote at the Labour conference</a>, the drumbeat has turned into a frenzy, accompanied by a palpable closing of the ranks on the part of powerful allies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>On the moral question of whether it is right for parents to pay for education and thereby buy advantage for their children, we could detect little movement</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet in some of our private meetings with private school leaders since our book was published, we have found them surprisingly willing to move away from a stubbornly defensive mode and to discuss constructively how the sector can actually do what it claims it wants to do, namely to transform the composition of their schools away from social exclusivity and towards social diversity. Have the schools got the financial resources to do this, through a vastly expanded bursaries programme, off their own bat? Or would such a scheme have to rely on state-funded places? And would this involve the state determining who gets the places and a lessening of independent governance? On all this they are more open-minded than we had expected \u2013 even if they have not yet fully confronted all the issues that would arise. Though on the essential moral question of whether in a good society it is right for parents to pay vast sums for education and thereby buy positional advantage for their children, we could detect little or no movement.</p> \n<p>The media, mostly, do not help. In researching our book, we were struck by the almost complete absence of detailed investigation of the private school sector\u2019s claims and practices. Tellingly, it was not the press, largely hostile to private school reform, that engaged in such work but the select committee on education, which in November 2017 forced the admission that although private schools subsidise up to a third of places (on a far from transparent basis), a mere 1% of places are fully funded. The suspected gaming of the system \u2013 whether through identifying special needs (to buy more exam time) that for some reason seem to be more prevalent in the private sector than in state schools, or spending liberally on exam challenges, or maximising informal contacts with top universities \u2013 is especially ripe for investigation. The press is lazily culpable of buying into the sector\u2019s propaganda. \u201cPrivate education is no longer the preserve of the privileged,\u201d insisted the Daily Mail earlier this year in a double-page spread about parents \u201cdigging deep\u201d for the sake of giving their children a better education. Yet analysis of government surveys of family resources and spending shows definitively that the few middle-income families with children at private school spend more \u2013 not less \u2013 on their holidays and other recreational activities than similar families with children at state schools. The only realistic conclusion is that for the most part they are able to draw on a significant degree of non-income family wealth.</p> \n<p>What about the politicians? From Margaret Thatcher onwards, the pursuit of greater equality of opportunity (as opposed to equality of outcome) has been proclaimed as lying somewhere near the very heart of the Tory creed. Yet with painfully few exceptions, notably the odd fluttering from Michael Gove, politicians of the right have stubbornly refused to face the stark incompatibility between equality of opportunity and a flourishing fee-paying sector. When this summer we asked a sympathetic Tory backbencher if she could recommend a similarly sympathetic colleague for us to talk to, she could only name one. \u201cThey all educate their children privately\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t actually care about equality of opportunity\u201d are the two most commonly wielded explanations whenever we\u2019ve discussed this with others. But perhaps one day those politicians will take the issue seriously, and at last grapple with the competing demands of liberty and equity.</p> \n<p>The greater responsibility, given their larger commitment to the values of fairness and inclusivity, lies with Labour politicians. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one you\u2019ve taken on there,\u201d Gordon Brown wryly remarked to us in 2014 \u2013 testimony to the fatalism about the private school issue that had gripped his party even before the coming of New Labour. Too complicated, too invidious, too emotive, altogether too hot to handle. Such, despite the simplicity of the fundamental argument about unfairness, were the default assumptions for all those years, and which are only now starting to change. There persists a great vulnerability, namely the exposure to the charge of hypocrisy against any Labour politician who has been privately educated or, still worse, chosen as a parent to go private. In our view, such politicians, whose general dislike of private education is at odds with their own decision as parents, should be exempt from accusations of hypocrisy unless (which is clearly not the case yet) they are actively imposing denial of choice on parents generally. This is a difficult area, with no clear-cut right or wrong. It has hobbled the left over the issue, with Boris Johnson\u2019s gleefully reported charge on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/sep/23/head-of-eton-hits-back-at-labour-plans-to-abolish-private-schools\" title=\"\">Monday of \u201cunbelievable hypocrisy\u201d</a> merely an opening salvo.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\">Britain\u2019s private school problem: it\u2019s time to talk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Which brings us finally to left-leaning readers and voters. Some, like us, will have been privately educated and are uneasily aware of the advantages we came to enjoy as a result.

      "bodyText": "\u201cPrivate schools help hoard wealth, power and opportunity for the few.\u201d This comment by an anonymous Labour party source a few weeks ago states the problem in a nutshell. Private schools are out of reach (average fees nearly \u00a318,000 a year) for the great majority of people; their spend per pupil is at least three times more than that of state schools \u2013 a grotesque resources gap; and they constitute a highly effective service industry, which not only almost guarantees places at top universities but also provides a network of invaluable connections \u2013 together a passport to life\u2019s glittering prizes, with two old Etonian PMs in the last three years the most visible symbol. They are indeed enablers of wealth hoarding, of power hoarding, of opportunity hoarding. They are, in short, an affront to any notion of a just or inclusive society. Such was the case put forward in our book Engines of Privilege, published in February, a work in many ways born out of long years of frustration at the prevailing political inertness on the issue. We had no expectation that seven months later the Labour party would vote at its conference to integrate the private sector into the state sector. In criticising Labour\u2019s position, the headmaster of Eton, Simon Henderson, this week acknowledged the public mood was shifting on the question, and that a battle lay ahead for the future of private education. It is a good moment, with the issue suddenly near the top of the non-Brexit agenda, to ask why over the last three-quarters of a century we have made so little progress in tackling what is, in many ways, a very British problem \u2013 given that in no other western society are private schools so deeply entrenched or so corrosive in their effects. There have been three potential turning points, but all failed to deliver change: the Tory education minister Rab Butler deftly ensured during the war that the private school issue was excluded from the otherwise historic 1944 Education Act. After the second world war, any reforming zeal on Clement Attlee\u2019s part was emasculated by his umbilical attachment to his old school, Haileybury. And during the 1960s, Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government initiated a royal commission on the public schools (as they were still absurdly called), whose mouse of a report in July 1968 achieved precisely nothing. The report did, however, prompt a flurry of letters to the Guardian. On 25 July, the letters page featured a pocket cartoon by the paper\u2019s brilliant resident cartoonist, Abu. It showed a rather cross-looking man scribbling a letter \u2013 \u201cSir, with reference to your leader on the public school system\u2019s divisive influence on our society \u2026\u201d \u2013 and above him a calendar. The date was 25 July 2068. It is now nearer to 2068 than 1968, and nothing of real substance has been achieved. But after four decades of virtual permafrost, things are hotting up again. Books (including Melissa Benn\u2019s Life Lessons and Robert Verkaik\u2019s Posh Boys, as well as our own) are starting to confront the issue. Private School Policy Reform (PSPR, of which we are among the founders) is a newly established and politically independent website-cum-thinktank. Labour Against Private Schools (LAPS) is a new and energetic pressure group. And, of course, Labour itself has now voted in favour of radical change. Yet whatever happens politically this autumn and beyond, we as a society are unlikely to make any serious progress on the issue unless we understand why we have so comprehensively failed to do so in the past. Some of the reasons are obvious enough. Although the private school issue is ultimately about what kind of society we are, it tends in everyday practice to be treated as a narrowly educational matter. At any one time, from the perspective of, say, the education secretary, or the Department for Education, what is happening to the 93% of children not at private schools understandably takes priority. Historically, the key figure here is Anthony Crosland, Labour\u2019s great postwar intellectual. \u201cI have never been able to understand,\u201d he famously asserted in 1956 in his influential work The Future of Socialism, \u201cwhy socialists have been so obsessed with the question of the grammar schools, and so indifferent to the much more glaring injustice of the independent schools.\u201d Yet as education secretary in the 1960s, he pushed the private school issue into the long grass. There is also what we call the \u201cdifferent planet\u201d problem. In London and the south-east, as well as in such affluent cities as Edinburgh, Oxford and York, private schools may be thick on the ground and the subject of endless fraught conversations. Elsewhere, in large parts of Britain, they are rarer and do not impinge on most people\u2019s daily lives or consciousness. Physical location, similarly, matters in the sense that many of the leading private schools, especially boarding schools, are tucked away in the countryside or semi-countryside \u2013 out of sight, out of mind. Also unhelpful has been what seems to be an intense reluctance on the part of the vast majority of state school leaders to put their heads above the parapet and speak out on the private school issue. During our public encounters with private school heads after the publication of Engines of Privilege, nothing has been more irritating than their line of: \u201cWe don\u2019t hear the state schools complaining about us. What they complain about is the lack of funding from government.\u201d Admittedly, it has been a state school teacher, Holly Rigby, one of the driving forces behind LAPS, who has pointed out the demotivating effects of private school privilege. But on the whole the private school leaders are correct: their state school counterparts remain the dog that fails to bark. Is this because they don\u2019t want to be seen as overly political? Because to privilege the private school issue might somehow be viewed as denigrating the state school system? Or, perhaps most likely, because they have a large amount on their plate and just want to get on with it, without casting unproductively envious eyes elsewhere? Yet because of the yawning resources gap they are in effect operating with one hand tied behind their backs, not helped by the debilitating flow of state-trained teachers from state schools into private schools. This is especially the case given the very effective PR machine that the private sector has at its disposal. The wider economic benefits conferred, all the wonderful partnerships with state schools, the many bursaries open to poor children, the sanctity of parental choice, the irretrievable damage that any reform would do to \u201cthe fabric of education in this country\u201d \u2013 the daily drumbeat continues from the Independent Schools Council and other seldom accountable industry bodies, complete with a sophisticated and shameless line in \u201cthe problem lies elsewhere\u201d, as we have found in our public encounters. And since Sunday\u2019s vote at the Labour conference, the drumbeat has turned into a frenzy, accompanied by a palpable closing of the ranks on the part of powerful allies. Yet in some of our private meetings with private school leaders since our book was published, we have found them surprisingly willing to move away from a stubbornly defensive mode and to discuss constructively how the sector can actually do what it claims it wants to do, namely to transform the composition of their schools away from social exclusivity and towards social diversity. Have the schools got the financial resources to do this, through a vastly expanded bursaries programme, off their own bat? Or would such a scheme have to rely on state-funded places? And would this involve the state determining who gets the places and a lessening of independent governance? On all this they are more open-minded than we had expected \u2013 even if they have not yet fully confronted all the issues that would arise. Though on the essential moral question of whether in a good society it is right for parents to pay vast sums for education and thereby buy positional advantage for their children, we could detect little or no movement. The media, mostly, do not help. In researching our book, we were struck by the almost complete absence of detailed investigation of the private school sector\u2019s claims and practices. Tellingly, it was not the press, largely hostile to private school reform, that engaged in such work but the select committee on education, which in November 2017 forced the admission that although private schools subsidise up to a third of places (on a far from transparent basis), a mere 1% of places are fully funded. The suspected gaming of the system \u2013 whether through identifying special needs (to buy more exam time) that for some reason seem to be more prevalent in the private sector than in state schools, or spending liberally on exam challenges, or maximising informal contacts with top universities \u2013 is especially ripe for investigation. The press is lazily culpable of buying into the sector\u2019s propaganda. \u201cPrivate education is no longer the preserve of the privileged,\u201d insisted the Daily Mail earlier this year in a double-page spread about parents \u201cdigging deep\u201d for the sake of giving their children a better education. Yet analysis of government surveys of family resources and spending shows definitively that the few middle-income families with children at private school spend more \u2013 not less \u2013 on their holidays and other recreational activities than similar families with children at state schools. The only realistic conclusion is that for the most part they are able to draw on a significant degree of non-income family wealth. What about the politicians? From Margaret Thatcher onwards, the pursuit of greater equality of opportunity (as opposed to equality of outcome) has been proclaimed as lying somewhere near the very heart of the Tory creed. Yet with painfully few exceptions, notably the odd fluttering from Michael Gove, politicians of the right have stubbornly refused to face the stark incompatibility between equality of opportunity and a flourishing fee-paying sector. When this summer we asked a sympathetic Tory backbencher if she could recommend a similarly sympathetic colleague for us to talk to, she could only name one. \u201cThey all educate their children privately\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t actually care about equality of opportunity\u201d are the two most commonly wielded explanations whenever we\u2019ve discussed this with others. But perhaps one day those politicians will take the issue seriously, and at last grapple with the competing demands of liberty and equity. The greater responsibility, given their larger commitment to the values of fairness and inclusivity, lies with Labour politicians. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one you\u2019ve taken on there,\u201d Gordon Brown wryly remarked to us in 2014 \u2013 testimony to the fatalism about the private school issue that had gripped his party even before the coming of New Labour. Too complicated, too invidious, too emotive, altogether too hot to handle. Such, despite the simplicity of the fundamental argument about unfairness, were the default assumptions for all those years, and which are only now starting to change. There persists a great vulnerability, namely the exposure to the charge of hypocrisy against any Labour politician who has been privately educated or, still worse, chosen as a parent to go private. In our view, such politicians, whose general dislike of private education is at odds with their own decision as parents, should be exempt from accusations of hypocrisy unless (which is clearly not the case yet) they are actively imposing denial of choice on parents generally. This is a difficult area, with no clear-cut right or wrong. It has hobbled the left over the issue, with Boris Johnson\u2019s gleefully reported charge on Monday of \u201cunbelievable hypocrisy\u201d merely an opening salvo. Which brings us finally to left-leaning readers and voters. Some, like us, will have been privately educated and are uneasily aware of the advantages we came to enjoy as a result. Others have been, or are, parents of children who attend private school, and are in all likelihood even more uneasily aware of the gap between values and practice. Yet we all have to live in the world as it is, not as we might wish it to be, and parents will always do what they see as best for their children. But rather than pretend the issue does not exist, however tempting that might be, it would be far better for such parents to support a change to the existing dispensation and a move towards ending \u2013 whether abruptly or incrementally is an important but second-order question \u2013 our horrible and infinitely damaging educational apartheid. A mature democracy should be capable of discussing the private school issue in a calm and considered way that transcends personal circumstances. The debate, in short, badly needs to up its game. We have at No 10 an over-entitled PM; but proper entitlement would be to give all of our children, from whatever background, a fair deal. \u2022 Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem by Francis Green and David Kynaston is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "The furious and dramatic scenes in Westminster dominate the front pages on Thursday as papers report on Boris Johnson\u2019s return to the House of Commons after his decision to suspend parliament was found to be unlawful. The Mirror\u2019s splash today is \u201cMan with no shame\u201d, claiming that Johnson has hit a \u201cnew low\u201d after invoking the name of murdered MP Jo Cox to argue that Brexit must be delivered. \u201cBoris Johnson was hauled back into the Commons yesterday after his supreme court slapdown but failed to show any remorse.\u201d The paper also said the \u201cPM refuses to say sorry for his lies\u201d and that his \u201cvile Jo Cox jibe leaves MPs in tears\u201d. The Guardian says there were \u201cgasps as PM uses memory of Jo Cox to bolster Brexit case\u201d, in its story, which ran under the headline: \u201cMPs\u2019 fury as Johnson claims to speak for Britain on Brexit\u201d. The paper also says that \u201cto the fury of opposition MPs he dismissed fears that his use of language such as \u2018surrender\u2019 and \u2018betrayal\u2019 was dangerous in a heightened political climate as \u2018humbug\u2019\u201d. The Daily Mail has a very different take, citing a survey it has conducted that found 64% of people who voted for Labour at the last election wanted an early vote and that the majority think \u201cthe Establishment is determined to stop Brexit\u201d. \u201cPoll: give us election now\u201d, is the splash headline. \u201cJeremy Corbyn faces a mass revolt by millions of Labour supporters over his refusal to agree to a snap election,\u201d says the paper, citing another response in the survey, which found that the majority of those who voted Labour at the last election wanted an early election. The Express writes: \u201cFurious Boris: Brexit rebels face \u2018day of reckoning\u2019\u201d, painting a picture of a defiant Johnson, who the papers says \u201cdared remainer MPs to topple him\u201d in a \u201ctempestuous day at Westminster\u201d. The Times says: \u201cCommons hits boiling point\u201d. The paper describes the scenes in parliament yesterday as \u201cbitter\u201d, \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cvitriolic\u201d and focuses on calls for Johnson to temper his language, noting that the prime minister \u201cdismissed as \u2018humbug\u2019 claims that his words were being cited in death threats received by MPs\u201d. The paper also reported Johnson\u2019s comments \u201cthat the \u2018best way\u2019 to honour Jo Cox, who was murdered during the 2016 referendum, was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. For the second day in a row, the Telegraph\u2019s headline is simply a direct quote from the prime minister: \u201c\u2018Parliament must stand aside or face its days of reckoning\u2019,\u201d it says following Wednesday\u2019s \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s be in doubt, there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit\u2019.\u201d The paper reports that Johnson accused rivals of \u201ccowardice in refusing an election\u201d. \u201cIn a speech that was greeted with loud applause from the Tory benches, Mr Johnson accused his opponents of attempting to \u2018sabotage\u2019 Brexit,\u201d it says. The i\u2019s splash headline is the same as the Times\u2019s effort \u2013 \u201cCommons hits boiling point\u201d \u2013 with the paper saying \u201cTempers inflamed after Attorney General dismisses Parliament as \u2018dead\u2019 and PM is accused of using \u2018dangerous\u2019 language\u201d.

Many papers also feature a small story or picture from the duke and duchess of Sussex\u2019s trip to South Africa with their infant son Archie. The Sun splashes on the royals: \u201cLittle one meets Tutu\u201d, and a small story on politics: \u201cPM flays \u2018scared\u2019 Corb on election\u201d. The New Statesman has a striking cover, which features a cartoon of Boris Johnson with his Pinocchio nose snapped off under the headline: \u201cThe great disgrace\u201d.",
