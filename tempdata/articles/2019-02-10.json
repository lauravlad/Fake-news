How do I plan to fill such a yawning chasm? Funny story: I don\u2019t know yet. I cannot rule out the possibility that it\u2019ll just be two hours of Richard E Grant GIFs. But we\u2019ll be OK.

And, let me tell you, this is going to be something special. For years the Baftas have been written off as the Oscars\u2019 poor cousin, but that ends today.<br><br>Who\u2019s hosting the Baftas? Joanna Lumley. Who\u2019s hosting the Oscars? Nobody. How long will the Baftas last? A brief two hours. How long will the Oscars last? Probably upwards of a week. What\u2019s the time delay between the Baftas ceremony and broadcast? Two hours, so you may as well skip the show and look up the results online. What\u2019s the time delay between the Oscars ceremony and the broadcast? There isn\u2019t one, so you have to watch the whole thing as it happens, like a schmo. See? The Baftas are the clear winner.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s how tonight will work: in a moment, Scarlett Conlon and Leah Harper will take you through the various red carpet looks. Then at 6.45pm I\u2019ll be back until the BBC broadcast begins at 9pm. And then I\u2019ll liveblog that. Essentially, if you like reading reports of awkward award-show banter, this is where you\u2019ll want to be.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-08T17:07:16.243Z\">at 5.07pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Oh well, whatever, it\u2019s done now. Well done to Roma and The Favourite. Well done to you. Most of all, well done to me. I played a blinder tonight. Oscars soon! Goodnight! Hang on. They just showed the film not in the English language win \u2013 and the costume design win \u2013 in the Unimportant Final Montage, even though they were both shown in the main chunk of the broadcast. What a massive cock-up. And nice to see Vice win in the most editing category. Joanna Lumley ends by telling a story about some plants, and then we get to see a supercut of all the dozens of awards they couldn\u2019t fit into the broadcast because of all the clips. Spider-Man won! Isn\u2019t that great? Schoonmaker thanks Scorsese, Powell and Pressburger. She thanks Cate Blanchett. She repeats over and over again how fortunate she is to work with Martin Scorsese, which is doing herself down somewhat. Nevertheless, every cutaway to the audience shows a crowd utterly enraptured. This woman is legendary, and everyone realises that. Even better, she talks for so long that there\u2019s no chance those bloody acrobats will return. Thank you Thelma. All the clips tonight have lasted long enough to feel like the entire history of cinema. But this one actually is the history of cinema, because Thelma Schoonmaker is the history of cinema. Anyway, Thelma Schoonmaker is getting the Fellowship, and it\u2019s frankly bizarre that it took this long. There\u2019s a VT of Martin Scorsese singing Schoonmaker\u2019s praises now, and also the praises of her late husband, Michael Powell. And now, clips. Good clips, too. Schoonmaker clips. Ah, Prince William presented Cate Blanchett, who is presenting the Fellowship. Presentception. Finally, the Fellowship. Prince William presents, and manages to say barely anything using far too many words. Truly, he is a kindred spirit. Oh! Roma wins best film! This is interesting. It\u2019s a black-and-white Netflix film presented in a foreign language. That must have made it an underdog, surely. And The Favourite reached audiences that most films rarely manage. Still, it is beautiful, and it\u2019s on Netflix. You can actually go and watch it now. And you really should. And now for best film. It\u2019s either The Favourite or Roma, isn\u2019t it? This one was announced after I started liveblogging, so I honestly don\u2019t know which one wins. Actual tension! Imagine! Colman tries to read her acceptance speech, but she\u2019s too nervous to get it out. This woman is an absolute bloody treasure, isn\u2019t she? She\u2019s like Mum of the World. Olivia Colman wins. Can you imagine the scenes if she hadn\u2019t? This is her home turf and she\u2019s a national treasure here. As a result, she\u2019s clapped almost all the way to the podium. High praise. Gary Oldman gets to present best actress now. His presentation lasts for exactly 14 words, and the world drops to its knees in gratitude. Rami Malek wins. And, well, hmm. Bohemian Rhapsody is a terrible film, and Bryan Singer\u2019s involvement has tainted it even further, and Malek\u2019s performance was basically just a Bane impression in some granny teeth. But they clapped him all the way to the stage, so what do I know? Margot Robbie is here to present best actor, and wins my heart for not telling us what the dictionary definition of \u201cactor\u201d is. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wins for Roma. It\u2019s a wonderfully deserved victory, but try telling that to the Bafta audience, because it only manages about three claps before it sinks back into the drowsy fug that\u2019s come to define it tonight. Salma Hayek\u2019s here to present best director. She\u2019s so engrossed in her speech that she\u2019s failed to realise the enormous lizard crawling across her dress. There\u2019s a lesson to be learned here: lizards are evil, and they deserve to be destroyed. The Favourite wins again \u2013 this time for costumes. This is something of a sweep for The Favourite, which is odd because it\u2019s a really weird film. It\u2019s such a deeply strange film to win so many awards. And my dad went to see it. What the hell is going on? Eddie Marsan and Cynthia Erivo present best costume design. Marsan slags off Brexit. I make an unspoken vow to stay off Twitter for a week because that\u2019s all that anyone\u2019s going to be bloody going on about now, isn\u2019t it? Well, what do you know? Roma won. And the crowd couldn\u2019t even keep up their applause for thatm either, so god knows what\u2019s going on tonight. At this rate, I\u2019m half expecting to see a shot of everyone in the audience in a carbon monoxide coma any second now. Best film not in the English language now. Or, to give it its full title, Roma presents Roma in the best film not in the English language award, starring Roma. Oh, the winner just apologised to his children for not really being present in their lives, and now I\u2019m sad. Cancel the recount. My heart couldn\u2019t take it. Black Panther wins! Even though one of Black Panther\u2019s visual effects involved making Lupita Nyong\u2019o skid along the ground in the driver\u2019s seat of an exploded car. Were the winners responsible for that bit? I\u2019d like to request a recount if that\u2019s the case. Visual effects now, presented by three stars of Rocket Man, a music biopic that\u2019s already better than Bohemian Rhapsody even though it isn\u2019t out yet. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when I won\u2019t have Bohemian Rhapsody to punch any more. Start taking drugs, probably. Beast wins! Sadly the applause for Michael Pearce and Lauren Dark dies out after about three seconds, which means they have to walk to the stage in total silence. It\u2019s a deeply weird moment, but fitting for such a lifeless night. The film deserved a much better reception. But enough moping, because here\u2019s outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer. And because this is a category for newcomers, every nominee gets a verbal description. These clips are going to last for a long time. If you have to go and put the bins out, now\u2019s your chance. Although, seeing them all one after the other like this, these last 12 months have been brutal, haven\u2019t they? 2016-level brutal. And now for the in memoriam segment where, among others, we get a proper chance to say goodbye to Liam Neeson\u2019s career. See? I told you I\u2019d remember. Roma wins, because of course it did. It\u2019s a Netflix film, and anything that can look this beautiful on a tiny phone screen deserves everything it gets. Now for cinematography. Presenter Will Poulter just got the biggest laugh of the night for saying, \u201cThat was a joke,\u201d which goes to show how badly everyone else is tanking on stage. Ah, no, Mahershala Ali won it instead. Deserved \u2013 or sort of deserved, given the weird reception that Green Book had \u2013 but poor old Richard E Grant. I only hope his disappointment will be as intense as his enthusiasm, purely because it might be quite entertaining to watch. Best supporting actor now. Also known as the Richard E Grant award. If he\u2019s going to win any award this year, it has to be a Bafta, right? It HAS to. The Favourite wins AGAIN. Deborah Davis thanks Bafta for giving her a prize for her first screenplay, which seems like a pretty watertight way to make an enemy of all the world\u2019s unsuccessful screenplays. Or at least it would be, were she not so charming about it all. Now for original screenplay. Michelle Rodriguez presents, without smiling once. This is what happens when you smile too much on the red carpet. Perhaps that One Direction guy was on to something all along. A Star is Born wins, and Bradley Cooper accepts. He\u2019s gracious but perfunctory, and seems to have toned down the bizarre tan he had at the Oscars luncheon last week. Best music now. Andy Serkis says \u201cA film without music is like Queen without Freddie Mercury or Britain without Europe\u201d. Queen, of course, continued without Freddie Mercury, which makes this the best insult of the entire night. BlackKklansman wins! Spike Lee reads all his thank yous from his BlackBerry. Either that or he\u2019s really deep into a game of Flappy Birds. It isn\u2019t made particularly clear. Best adapted screenplay now. In the clips, they play the part of A Star Is Born where Sam Elliott goes \u201cHRRRRRRMMMPH HRRRRM HRRRM HRRRRRMPH,\u201d which is my favourite bit. Letitia Wright wins! Magnificent. She\u2019s hesitant, talking about her depression and her faith and the importance of Bafta in her life. And she obliquely referenced Thanos, too. This kid\u2019s going places. So far, about 80% of this broadcast is clips. We\u2019re already a quarter of the way through the show, and most of it has been clips. Which is great for a liveblogger. Lots of opportunities to urinate. I couldn\u2019t be happier. Regina King and Luke Evans are here to present the Rising Star award. They say nothing of interest, but this is a tremendous nominee list. You\u2019d be happy if any of them won, wouldn\u2019t you? Weisz is brilliant, isn\u2019t she? She seems genuinely thrilled and touched to win this prize. So thrilled and touched that I can\u2019t think of anything mean to say. I am sorry to let you down so egregiously. Rachel Weisz wins for The Favourite. This is going to be the Foregone Conclusion Baftas, isn\u2019t it? Mary J Blige and Ellen Page are here to present the trophy for best supporting actress. They\u2019ve gone for \u201cdictionary definition of the word \u2018supporting\u2019, and then some platitudes\u201d. A classic combination. The Favourite wins! Melissa McCarthy is here to present Outstanding British film. This is a very strong category (apart from Bohemian Rhapsody), and it\u2019s one of the only places to acknowledge You Were Never Really Here, which definitely isn\u2019t going to win. BURN! Literally everything Lumley says is met with total deafening, all-encompassing silence. The fact that she hasn\u2019t physically withered up into a pile of sand in the face of such genuinely terrible material makes her 20 times better than any of us. Long may she continue. In life, that is. Not in this monologue \u2013 this monologue is causing me pain. More red hot monologue action now. BURN! Actors often have chauffeurs. BURN! Bradley Cooper has a strong work ethic. BURN! The Favourite is called The Favourite. BURN! The word \u201cmess\u201d rhymes with the word \u201cdress\u201d. BURN! The word \u201cCannes\u201d rhymes with the word \u201cKlan\u201d. The monologue has now given way to a recap of every single film nominated this year, or every film released this year, or every film released ever. It\u2019s dragging a bit, is what I\u2019m trying to say. Now for a searing satirical monologue, in which \u2026 wait. Did Joanna Lumley just imply that she would definitely write a bunch of homophobic tweets if she had a Twitter account? Let\u2019s assume so. Cancel her! Richard E Grant thanks each acrobat as they leave the stage. Of course he does. This acrobatty stuff is all very odd. The only reason why anyone watches acrobatics is because there\u2019s a very real chance that someone will fall and hurt themselves. It only works live. But this show is conspicuously prerecorded, which makes me think that Bafta is trolling us all. Lumley dresses up as a spaceman and everyone\u2019s very excited. Then, in a horrifying replay of last year, we get a Cirque du Soleil thing that refuses to end. Also: they are all dressed as astronauts. This was all worked out back when everyone thought First Man was going to sweep the awards, wasn\u2019t it? The show begins with Joanna Lumley saying \u201cbollocks\u201d, which is immediately endearing. Then there\u2019s a montage of her dressing up as all the nominated films. She also does a pretty convincing Freddie Mercury impression, just to show Rami Malek that he isn\u2019t as special as he thinks he is. But of course, before the ceremony begins, here\u2019s a highlights package of the red carpet. They include Amy Adams saying that the Baftas are her favourite awards. GIVE HER THE BEST ACTRESS AWARD RIGHT THIS INSTANT. Finally \u2013 FINALLY \u2013 we get to find out who will win the Baftas. The Baftas are just about to start. Strap in gang. Ten minutes until the Baftas start on BBC One. Also, it was a phantom pregnancy. I\u2019m taking that as a win. If I\u2019ve gone quiet, by the way, it\u2019s because Call the Midwife is on. I\u2019m 70% sure that there\u2019s a pregnant man on tonight\u2019s episode. I\u2019m going to be bold here, and predict that the Baftas will have below-average viewing figures tonight. Usually, on the night of the Baftas, my Twitter feed is full of people arguing over the winners as they\u2019re announced. This year: nothing. Just one guy tweeting out the winners into a tornado of absolute apathy. And this makes me think that nobody cares about the Baftas this year, which makes me think that nobody will watch them. Either that or everyone hates Twitter now. It\u2019s probably that, isn\u2019t it? Alexa, show me a video by someone who didn\u2019t have to spend his Sunday liveblogging something that had already happened. Or, for that matter, Hadley Freeman\u2019s interview with Richard E Grant, where she comes closer than anyone else to outright asking him if he\u2019s faking all his enthusiasm in the hope that people will notice him. While we all pretend that no one knows who the winners are yet, why not read Peter Bradshaw\u2019s insightful article on what should win \u2013 and what will win? I missed this in all the excitement: Rami Malek doling out high-fives on the red carpet. How many high-fives were there? As many as the number of times I\u2019ll punch myself in the face if Bohemian Rhapsody wins anything significant tonight. FYI: I\u2019m planning to a do a \u201cLiam Neeson\u2019s career\u201d joke during the in memoriam section. I\u2019m telling you all now in case I forget in the heat of the moment. Also doing wonderfully on the red carpet was Michelle Rodriguez, who posed for selfies with everyone and managed to maintain her smile throughout. See? Magnificent. For reference of how difficult that is, here\u2019s a video of one of the One Direction dimwits struggling hard. Another addition to the monochrome club: Olivia Colman opted for an Emilia Wickstead gown with a short train. \u201cI felt Olivia should look stately and regal,\u201d said the actor\u2019s stylist, Mary Fellowes. How apt. And that\u2019s all from the fashion desk. Stay tuned for all the action inside! Further Kate and Wills information. Prince William claims to have watched every film nominated for a Bafta this year. Someone please, PLEASE, ask him what he made of Dogman? A newly brunette Cate Blanchett has opted for a long version of a Christopher Kane dress in black, decorated with giant colourful gemstones. Twitter \u2013 not to mention everyone else \u2013 is very much here for it. Wills and Kate have popped over the road to the Royal Albert Hall to join in all the fun. This is standard red-carpet fare for him, but tonight she\u2019s upped the ante from past years, looking positively fairytale ready (Cinder-eady?) in floor-length white, complete with an asymmetric garland and sequinned slippers. Incidentally, I\u2019d like to use this platform to officially lobby Bafta and the BBC to resurrect the hour-long pre-award red carpet show. Not because I enjoy red carpet shows, but because they\u2019re always hilarious. These awards always happen in London at the beginning of February, and the weather is always atrocious, and seeing the great and good of Hollywood miserably traipse around in tiny outfits is one of the few true pleasures I have in life. There are my children, and there\u2019s Cate Blanchett being pelted with frozen drizzle, and that\u2019s it. Similarly, the revelation that Richard E Grant possesses a functional working knowledge of Dermot O\u2019Leary\u2019s career has just nudged him closer to that knighthood. Tomorrow morning, you will awaken to an avalanche of red carpet galleries, all squabbling about who did the red carpet best tonight. STOP SQUABBLING NOW. The competition has already been won by Claire Foy, who defied the laws of physics to sign an autograph while posing for a selfie. This woman is remarkable. I only wish I was being sarcastic. Bradley Cooper, who\u2019s up for four awards for his directorial debut, A Star Is Born, is keeping things classic in a Celine suit. He\u2019s already on to his next film as director, he told Edith Bowman on the red carpet, but kept schtum about the details. Right, I\u2019ve figured out a strategy for the next two hours. In lieu of an official red carpet broadcast, I\u2019ll be relaying some of Bafta\u2019s red carpet tweets, which is a much better idea than you think. See, here\u2019s Salma Hayek lightly chiding a photographer: Octavia Spencer loves sequin detailing. Last year it livened up her black gown. This year, she\u2019s gone for a similar look but in red. It s a brave woman who opts to match the carpet, but she\u2019s nailed it. It\u2019s tulle frills galore for The Favourite actor Rachel Weisz \u2013 cue Twitter adoration all round. She\u2019s up against her co-star Emma Stone and being very sweet about it, dubbing the actor an \u201chonorary Brit\u201d on the red carpet. And now here\u2019s where things get tricky. At this point, the timeline cleaves in two. In the real world, the world in which you currently exist, the Bafta red carpet is over and the ceremony begins. In this timeline, a slow trickle of results will creep out online, to be debated and dissected. This will all happen on a separate part of the Guardian website. However, you have chosen the liveblog timeline, which semi-officially denies any of the events of the real world and will only acknowledge them once the ceremony is broadcast on BBC One at 9pm. \u201cBut why would I follow a liveblog of an event I already know everything about?\u201d you ask. Simple. It\u2019s because I\u2019m doing the liveblogging, and you feel sorry for me. Also the speeches might be quite OK or something. Now, 9pm is more than two hours away. How do I plan to fill such a yawning chasm? Funny story: I don\u2019t know yet. I cannot rule out the possibility that it\u2019ll just be two hours of Richard E Grant GIFs. But we\u2019ll be OK. Stick with me, kids. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Rami Malek has arrived and there is a white suit and black bow tie and shirt situation happening. We like. Don\u2019t stop him now \u2013 he\u2019s knocking it out of the park in the style stakes. The full list of winners will be updated through the night as they\u2019re announced. Go here for updates as the awards are handed out. Is it a velvet suit? A sequinned harness? No, it\u2019s a matchy-matchy patterned shirt and suit jacket for the red carpet\u2019s current darling, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. It\u2019s shiny and we like it. Magpies assemble! Thandie Newton\u2019s gown appears to have removable micro-straps that have been on and off during her stroll down the red carpet. Transitional chic, natch. Claire Foy has left her crown behind tonight and kept it simple and chic, taking a leaf out of the After Eight style book in a green bandeau with black trim. She\u2019s up for her role in Neil Armstrong biopic First Man. Viola Davis clearly got the bow memo: she\u2019s wearing a custom Armani Priv\u00e9 black silk velvet gown with a white bow at the neckline, and nominated for best actress for her role in Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows. Glenn Close has eschewed a trouser suit \u2013 which she has made her own this awards season \u2013 for a beautiful embellished floor-length peplum gown in black. She\u2019s a hot favourite to win for The Wife, and what a look to win it in if so. She\u2019s cut quite the fashion figure on this year\u2019s awards scene so far in Miu Miu and Chanel, and tonight Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Lucy Boynton has pulled out the stops \u2013 and why not? She\u2019s gone for a bow-bedecked tulle number with a pleated ikat print skirt \u2013 it\u2019s a proper fun red-carpet look. She may be a newbie, but she\u2019s rocking the red carpet like a pro. Barry Jenkins is back at the Baftas. This time the director is nominated for best adapted screenplay for If Beale Street Could Talk \u2013 and looking very chic in classic black tux. And we\u2019re off! Amy Adams is one of the first to arrive on the red carpet, wearing a floor-length belted maroon dress with brooch detail. She\u2019s nominated for best supporting actress for her role as Lynne Cheney in Vice, and told Dermot O\u2019Leary that the Baftas are her fave awards. Already a winner in our books. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the 2019 Bafta awards. And, let me tell you, this is going to be something special. For years the Baftas have been written off as the Oscars\u2019 poor cousin, but that ends today. Who\u2019s hosting the Baftas? Joanna Lumley. Who\u2019s hosting the Oscars? Nobody. How long will the Baftas last? A brief two hours. How long will the Oscars last? Probably upwards of a week. What\u2019s the time delay between the Baftas ceremony and broadcast? Two hours, so you may as well skip the show and look up the results online. What\u2019s the time delay between the Oscars ceremony and the broadcast? There isn\u2019t one, so you have to watch the whole thing as it happens, like a schmo. See? The Baftas are the clear winner. Here\u2019s how tonight will work: in a moment, Scarlett Conlon and Leah Harper will take you through the various red carpet looks. Then at 6.45pm I\u2019ll be back until the BBC broadcast begins at 9pm. And then I\u2019ll liveblog that. Essentially, if you like reading reports of awkward award-show banter, this is where you\u2019ll want to be.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has effectively ruled out Labour\u2019s ideas for a compromise Brexit plan, shutting off another potential route to a deal as business groups warned that with less than 50 days to go the departure process was entering the \u201cemergency zone\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s formal response to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal, in a letter to the Labour leader, stressed her objections to keeping the UK in some form of customs union, saying this would prevent the UK making its own trade deals. But in an apparent renewed bid to win over wavering Labour MPs, May made a concession on environmental and workers\u2019 rights, discounting Corbyn\u2019s idea of automatic alignment with EU standards but suggesting instead a Commons vote every time these change. The letter comes amid a growing presumption that while May remains officially committed to putting a revised Brexit plan to MPs as soon as possible, in practice this is unlikely to happen before the end of February, if not later. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said on Sunday that if no finalised deal were put to the Commons by 27 February, MPs would again be given an amendable motion to consider, allowing them to block a no-deal departure or make other interventions. \u201cIf the meaningful vote has not happened, so in other words things have not concluded, then parliament would have that further opportunity by no later than 27 February,\u201d he told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. May remains officially committed to getting the EU to agree to significant changes to the Irish border backstop as a way of winning over the DUP and agitated Tory backbenchers who helped bring about the heavy defeat of her plan. But with the PM\u2019s meetings in Brussels last week yielding no real hope of this, there had been speculation she might embrace suggestions from Corbyn, who last week outlined five commitments Labour needed for it to back a deal, including joining a customs union. In her letter May argued that her own Brexit plan \u201cexplicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union\u201d in terms of avoiding tariffs, while allowing \u201cdevelopment of the UK\u2019s independent trade policy beyond our economic partnership with the EU\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals?\u201d May accepted a customs union could potentially have delivered her a Commons majority but at the serious risk of splitting her party. This was reinforced when Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, indicated she would resign if this happened. She told Sky\u2019s Sophie Ridge on Sunday show: \u201cI absolutely do not think that should be our policy.\u201d In other parts of her letter May was more conciliatory, notably on environmental and workers\u2019 rights. Here, she rejected Corbyn\u2019s idea of \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d \u2013 automatically keeping the UK in step with EU standards \u2013 saying this should be a UK decision. But she added: \u201cIn the interests of building support across the house we are also prepared to commit to asking parliament whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU changes its standards in these areas.\u201d If, as seems inevitable, May has no revised deal to put to MPs before Thursday, the government is committed to tabling another amendable motion, as happened in late January, when MPs passed up chances to extend the Brexit deadline or rule out no deal. Thursday had been billed as a crunch moment, but those behind a series of amendments that failed to pass at the end of January have said they want to delay again. With the deadline fast approaching, business leaders have called for quicker action. The head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the UK was \u201cin the emergency zone of Brexit now\u201d and the confusion would not just affect jobs and investment, but harm the UK as a long-term business destination. \u201cI think that the bigger thing that is going on is that there is also a real recalibration, if you like, of what the UK is like as a place to invest,\u201d Fairbairn told Ridge. Fairbairn said firms would welcome proposals such as that by Labour: \u201cThe issue now is time, and we are heading towards that cliff edge, so we need that deal.\u201d US firms have also started warning of the risks of no deal, with companies including Lockheed Martin, Expedia and food firm McCormick issuing formal stock market notices about consequences including higher costs and business uncertainty.",

      "body": "<p>So in the end, there were no great surprises at this year\u2019s Baftas, and it was a great night for The Favourite, which in the most extraordinary way fuses trad Brit period theatricality with high auteur cinema. Olivia Colman\u2019s Bafta as best actress is the most glorious achievement so far in this performer\u2019s remarkable career. Her portrayal of Queen Anne was simultaneously hilarious, scary, eerie and poignant. She may have changed the course of history studies. It was only on rewatching The Favourite that I realised when I first encountered this monarch\u2019s reputation: as a student, reading Pope\u2019s The Rape of the Lock: \u201cGreat Anna, whom three realms obey, Dost sometimes counsel take \u2013 and sometimes tea!\u201d When are we getting an Alexander Pope biopic with Toby Jones incidentally?</p> \n<p>Rachel Weisz\u2019s best supporting actress Bafta for her performance in The Favourite was richly deserved, and I am happy to concede I called this one wrong when making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/08/baftas-2019-film-predictions-roma-bohemian-rhapsody\">my own predictions</a>, favouring Emma Stone\u2019s performance as the aristocrat who faces off with Weisz in a duel for the monarch\u2019s affections and patronage.

      "bodyText": "So in the end, there were no great surprises at this year\u2019s Baftas, and it was a great night for The Favourite, which in the most extraordinary way fuses trad Brit period theatricality with high auteur cinema. Olivia Colman\u2019s Bafta as best actress is the most glorious achievement so far in this performer\u2019s remarkable career. Her portrayal of Queen Anne was simultaneously hilarious, scary, eerie and poignant. She may have changed the course of history studies. It was only on rewatching The Favourite that I realised when I first encountered this monarch\u2019s reputation: as a student, reading Pope\u2019s The Rape of the Lock: \u201cGreat Anna, whom three realms obey, Dost sometimes counsel take \u2013 and sometimes tea!\u201d When are we getting an Alexander Pope biopic with Toby Jones incidentally? Rachel Weisz\u2019s best supporting actress Bafta for her performance in The Favourite was richly deserved, and I am happy to concede I called this one wrong when making my own predictions, favouring Emma Stone\u2019s performance as the aristocrat who faces off with Weisz in a duel for the monarch\u2019s affections and patronage. It might have been nice to see them win it jointly, but this is a great win for Weisz and her portrayal of sly, feline realpolitik-meets-sexual-dysfunction. But in a way, Roma ran The Favourite even by getting best film, along with best director for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, best film not in the English language, and best cinematography \u2013 for Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s own very remarkable camerawork. These awards, shared out as they were among Roma and The Favourite, seem to be a very just division of the spoils. Surely now Netflix will roll out a new theatrical distribution for Roma, so that people all over the UK and Ireland will have the chance to see this glorious film on the big screen and not just on their TVs, smartphones and tablets?

So many times people have done that but then the local MP retires but if say, a Rhodes scholar and a partner in a major management consulting firm who has worked around the world for the good and great turns up, the party usually says we will give him a go.\u201d</p> <p>But Falinski does concede the party has failed to implement a basic corporate human resources functions to actively identify, recruit and provide professional development for good candidates, and if they are no good, to find a way of replacing them.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a hard conversation to say to a member of 20 years that your capacity will run out in three to six years\u2019 time and we need a succession plan,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He believes the only way to fight independent challengers is for the party to continue to improve<strong> </strong>and also explain issues.</p> <h2>Trend or blip?</h2> <p>Sheppard says the appeal for voters has been the rise of independents who have proven they can get things happening from the crossbench. They have pushed issues forward such as the banking royal commission and a national integrity commission, and forced major parties to consider removing children from Nauru.</p> <p>\u201cThey are popular, smart, articulate and if there is a sizeable contingent they can get stuff done without the factional intrigue, without having to bow to tight party discipline and the electorate have felt starved of this,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Whether they are a trend or a blip, they are acting in contrast to business as usual in the major parties.

      "bodyText": "The Perfect Storm is the true story of a fishing boat, the Andrea Gail, that headed out for tuna off Massachusetts and was hit by a violent natural event caused by the combination of two massive weather fronts. The perfect storm is also the metaphor most often used to describe the conditions facing Scott Morrison and his government at the coming federal election. Dr Jill Sheppard is an investigator for the Australian National University\u2019s Australian Electoral Study (AES), a major post-election review that has been tracking voter sentiment since 1987. She is also author of the ANU poll and focuses on why people participate in politics and the opinions they hold. \u201cWhat we have in 2019 is a perfect storm,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere we are seeing independents get prominence, they fill a gap that major parties aren\u2019t filling. \u201cThe major parties are in state of disalignment. As much as left and right in Liberals, there is a coalition of factions not only for different policies but different leaders.\u201d After the 2016 election, the AES found key measures, including satisfaction with democracy, trust in government and loyalty to major parties, at record lows. Like the Andrea Gail, the good ship Coalition is facing two approaching fronts: the rise of the high-profile independent and mounting concern about climate change policy as Australia tackles a drought and associated water shortages. It\u2019s the climate, stupid The Australian electorate has come a long way in its views since rural and regional independents Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie carved out their agreements to support Julia Gillard\u2019s government in the 43rd parliament. The anger Windsor and Oakeshott faced in parts of their conservative electorates at the time has subsided, as voters have seen the fruits of those agreements. At the heart of that agenda was action on climate change, connectivity via the national broadband network and infrastructure investment, all of which remain at the centre of national debate. In 2019, voters are prepared to look again at independents after a decade of climate policy failure. This has interlinked like-minded independents with outside players, including tech billionaires, the next generation of corporate giants, political disrupters such as GetUp and assorted community groups determined to drag governments by the scruff of the neck. The difference too is that Turnbull\u2019s national energy guarantee (Neg) brought business, farmers and the community together but was opposed by a vocal minority in the Liberal party room. This highlighted the contrast between the public and parliament, and now the Coalition is in danger of being left behind as cashed-up forces are ready to help independents to enter and force change, including Turnbull\u2019s son Alex and the Atlassian co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes. While conservative seats have had six years of the Coalition finding reasons not to act on climate change, independents are offering a starkly different policy position \u2013 testing which side of the Liberal party is most in line with their constituents. Field evidence, including surveys by the Lowy Institute, the Australia Institute and private companies, find that most Australians want decisive action on climate. The 2018 Lowy Institute poll, for example, finds that 59% of Australians say \u201cglobal warming is a serious and pressing problem\u201d about which \u201cwe should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs\u201d. Lowy describes it as a \u201cdramatic reversal\u201d on 2013 when Tony Abbott prosecuted the carbon tax scare campaign. One environmental philanthropist, who asked not to be named, says all his donations this year will go to funding \u201cquality candidates who are committed to climate action\u201d. He says it will be a six-figure sum and he knows of other like-minded philanthropists who are doing the same. The rise and rise of independents There are currently seven independent or minor party MPs in a federal house of representatives of 150. Cathy McGowan (Indi), Andrew Wilkie (Denison), Rebekha Sharkie (Centre Alliance), Kerryn Phelps (Wentworth), Bob Katter (Katter\u2019s Australia party) and the Greens\u2019 Adam Bandt have all won elections. Julia Banks (Chisholm) was a Liberal who defected after Malcolm Turnbull was toppled. In May, McGowan is retiring, hoping to hand the baton on to health researcher and midwife Helen Haines. Banks will challenge health minister and the Peter Dutton leadership co-conspirator Greg Hunt in Flinders. Former Olympian Zali Steggall is the most high-profile challenger of several independents pushing Abbott in Warringah. Former Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive and former Liberal member Oliver Yates will challenge treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong. Oakeshott is having his second go at Cowper, albeit with a much longer run than his previous surprise announcement at the start of the 2016 campaign. The Nationals are facing challenges from two local councillors \u2013 Jason Modica and Ray Kingston \u2013 in Mallee, where Andrew Broad is retiring after the \u201csugar baby\u201d scandal. There are nascent community groups springing up in rural seats, such as the Voices for Farrer movement in Liberal frontbencher Sussan Ley\u2019s seat on the New South Wales southern border. Former Liberal leader John Hewson believes the anti-Liberal sentiment is driving the rise of independents. \u201cThe background to this is the drift against big parties and as it drifts away, we are getting better quality independents standing,\u201d Hewson says. \u201cThere is a range of sentiments but the centre is always going to win politics in Australia. What Abbott and his cronies don\u2019t understand is that you will never win as a hard right or hard left candidate. \u201cThere is the likelihood of a balance of power among the independents because some will get up and that will make a difference to the complexion of government.\u201d The crucial primary vote While the publicity surrounding them is intensifying, there remains a deep caution about the independents\u2019 capacity to win a ground campaign against major parties.

It found the lowest recorded primary vote for a winning Coalition candidate was 42.7% for Rowan Ramsay in the South Australian seat of Grey in 2016 against Nick Xenophon Team (now Centre Alliance) candidate Andrea Broadfoot (she is running again this year). Apart from that contest, it\u2019s safe to say that if a sitting MP gets a primary vote above 45%, the MP wins but if an independent can push the MP below 45%, the independent wins \u2013 albeit by sometimes tiny margins. Previously successful independents have combined a well-organised campaign, good local community support and an unpopular sitting MP and/or a federal government on the nose. These elements are not uniform among the big-name races in 2019. Oliver Yates, for example, has a strong track record on climate change and has spoken to forums in the seat but has no formal community organisation. Yet when former Liberal state member John Pesutto lost his seat in the Victorian election, the former attorney general blamed the federal government\u2019s stance on climate change. Banks owns a family home in the seat of Flinders but has been working as the member for Chisholm. While Banks and Yates have presented themselves to their electorates, in Warringah the community rallied to find a candidate. Voices of Warringah, Vote Tony Out and other groups have come together into a well cashed-up and organised machine to stand behind a quality candidate, with help from progressive campaigning tools from GetUp. But Dr Peter Brent, an adjunct fellow at Swinburne University, thinks the belief that Steggall will romp home is wishful thinking. \u201cI guess you would have to have a heart of stone not to want Abbott tossed out of Warringah and I must admit, when Zali Steggall announced, like many I thought she does tick all boxes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean she will necessary win. Most people in Warringah are voting on front-of-mind issues and most don\u2019t want Labor. They will probably hold their nose and vote for Abbott.\u201d Brent does believe, however, that Oakeshott can capitalise on the retirement of Nationals MP Luke Hartsuyker in Cowper, possibly replicating Wilkie and Bandt, who won when there was no existing sitting member contesting. Sheppard also hoses down the conclusions we should draw. Commentators have assumed the conditions mean a landslide for Bill Shorten even as polls tighten. However, she believes the rash of independent candidates and the climate focus simply make the competition more unpredictable. \u201cA hung parliament is not out of the equation at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a frustration with major parties and a contempt for their leaders. It seems after every election, we chart historically unpopular leaders and yet there seems to be no one on the horizon who can fix it. \u201cYet there are not many voters who view themselves as ideologically independent, it is more that they view themselves as not fitting into either major parties.\u201d In another world, they would be Liberal candidates Sometimes called Liberal-Lite, the independents challenging in conservative seats have impressive CVs. Yates is an ex-Macquarie banker, Steggall is a barrister and elite athlete, Haines was a director of the Rural Health Academic Network and has a PhD in medical science. Kerryn Phelps is a medical doctor and former president of the Australian Medical Association. Hewson says the major parties\u2019 preselection processes are failing because the current candidates should be attracted and chosen as the next ministers. \u201cInstead we are seeing higher qualified substantial people standing than you see getting preselected because the skills to get preselected and rise to become a minister in a major party are not the same as outside it,\u201d he says. The Liberal MP for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, rejects Hewson\u2019s argument, referencing the preselection of the energy minister, Angus Taylor, in Hume, who was a former partner at global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. \u201cI think there is a perception out there that to get preselected you need to join when 16 years and 1 day, toil on polling booths and then when you are in your 30s you are rewarded with a seat as payback without the capability to represent the community,\u201d says Falinski. \u201cI out and out reject that. So many times people have done that but then the local MP retires but if say, a Rhodes scholar and a partner in a major management consulting firm who has worked around the world for the good and great turns up, the party usually says we will give him a go.\u201d But Falinski does concede the party has failed to implement a basic corporate human resources functions to actively identify, recruit and provide professional development for good candidates, and if they are no good, to find a way of replacing them. \u201cIt is a hard conversation to say to a member of 20 years that your capacity will run out in three to six years\u2019 time and we need a succession plan,\u201d he says. He believes the only way to fight independent challengers is for the party to continue to improve and also explain issues. Trend or blip? Sheppard says the appeal for voters has been the rise of independents who have proven they can get things happening from the crossbench. They have pushed issues forward such as the banking royal commission and a national integrity commission, and forced major parties to consider removing children from Nauru. \u201cThey are popular, smart, articulate and if there is a sizeable contingent they can get stuff done without the factional intrigue, without having to bow to tight party discipline and the electorate have felt starved of this,\u201d she says. Whether they are a trend or a blip, they are acting in contrast to business as usual in the major parties. For example, McGowan\u2019s decision to retire after two terms shows a capacity to not treat the job as a lifetime sinecure. Independents are no longer just saying yes or no to major party legislation. They are drafting their own legislation, mustering their numbers and brokering peace deals on unresolved issues between the main parties. Yet Sheppard does not see the current rise of independents as a long-term trend; rather they are filling a void that the parties cannot currently fill. The big parties will have to decide which direction to take. \u201cIn Australia, due to the political system, the centrifugal pull is towards major parties and the independents will lose their usefulness when their positions are replicated by the major parties,\u201d she says. \u201cApart from Katter \u2026 I don\u2019t think he will ever be replicated by a major party.\u201d And she warns that a Labor government that fails to produce results could also result in Labor-style independents breaking away, if a future Labor government is on the nose. Falinski remains sanguine about competition from independents, saying more choice in all seats is a good thing. \u201cI\u2019m a Liberal so I believe choice is a good thing; so I can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d he says. \u201cThe advantage of Liberal democracies is freedom and fairness and political campaigns allow us to distill the hopes and concerns of voters. \u201cSo if [discontent] builds up and organisations like banks or political parties are failing, democracy provides a safety outlet and gives parties the chance to say we can\u2019t ignore it anymore, we need to respond. \u201cThat might be a chance to change positions on some issues that aren\u2019t working or change our communication or explanations that isn\u2019t working. That is, not spinning better but looking at it in a different way.\u201d",

Timing the period between consecutive deliveries will be too distracting and impractical; maybe there could be the introduction of an \u2018Over Clock\u2019 on the electronic scoreboards? This ensures the change of ends is done at a quick rate, and the first ball of the next set is bowled at a decent rate. \u2018Violations\u2019 could be handed out to the skipper in case of delays not caused by the batsman or external factors, with fines (and even bans) being handed down after repeated offences. Maybe, this could bring an end to the over-rate crisis the sport is seeing nowadays! Thoughts?\u201d</p> <p>Similar things have been mooted, but it might be a bit tricky to enforce. Rows about who is causing delays - the fielding team or the batting - would rage, plus plenty of other things I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t thought of. But over rates/pace of play is one of those things I feel like I should care about but really don\u2019t that much, so maybe it\u2019s best for someone else to tackle this one. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c606704e4b04a6f567dcbb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-10T18:02:50.417Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>19th over: West Indies 57-2 (Bravo 0, Hope 0) </strong>Root arranges most of the England team around the bat but Darren Bravo survives the hat-trick ball.

      "bodyText": "Farewell, then. A cracking day of Test cricket, and hopefully there will be another tomorrow. We\u2019ll be here as ever, a comforting presence in a world of doubt. Thanks for reading, and goodnight. And here\u2019s the day\u2019s report from Vic Marks out in St Lucia. If you want a look at the full scorecard, you\u2019re in luck. A good day for England, then. They were skittled with indecent haste in the morning but Wood and Moeen bowled them to a very handsome lead and that last sessions was negotiated nicely. West Indies have looked slightly purposeless, which is inevitable to a point with the series already won and Jason Holder watching from the sidelines. 10th over: England 19-0 (Burns 10, Jennings 8) Time for one more over, and Roach is going to bowl it. Burns edges, but it bounces a couple of feet in front of second slip and they dash a single. Roach does his best to tempt Jennings into using his bat, but no dice, even if the last ball was certainly a nibble. Still, hats off to these two for gritting out these ten overs. 9th over: England 18-0 (Burns 9, Jennings 8) Burns pushes steadily betwixt mid-wicket and mid-on, but finds enough space for them to run through for three. Jennings then leaves the rest alone: the cruel might say that he looks pretty good when he\u2019s not trying to hit the ball, but happily we are not that cruel. 8th over: England 15-0 (Burns 6, Jennings 8) You don\u2019t really get nightwatchmen for openers, do you? Presumably because you\u2019d have to have two of them, and of course sending in one player who can\u2019t bat to bat in place of a batsman is fine, but two is clearly absolutely ludicrous. Bad over from Gabriel, not making Jennings play at much and he gladly leaves all but one ball. 7th over: England 15-0 (Burns 6, Jennings 8) While Burns\u2019s technique does occasionally resemble a drunk man trying to get through a revolving door, the way he pushes at the ball make his defensive shots very satisfying when he gets them right. We\u2019re treated to an over of them there. 6th over: England 15-0 (Burns 6, Jennings 8) Jennings keeps driving and it\u2019s making me anxious. He misses a full ball with one of those shots that make him look like his joints need a decent oiling, before leaving a few outside off. That\u2019s the spirit, Keats. 5th over: England 14-0 (Burns 5, Jennings 8) An early change, as Keemo Paul lines up to replace Roach. Burns, with all those many moving parts to his technique whirling all over the place, tucks a couple through mid-wicket before a carbon copy of that earlier pearler from Roach beats his outside edge. Meanwhile, this has nothing to do with cricket but we should protect Olivia Colman at all costs. 4th over: England 11-0 (Burns 2, Jennings 8) Gabriel jags one past a leaping Jennings, then cuts him in half with another stonker, before a convincing shot is played, the England opener late-cutting very nicely through gully for four. Good idea. Let\u2019s pitch them a completely untried form of the game around an arbitrary but round number because we think women and kids are too thick to understand a format that works perfectly well. 3rd over: England 4-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 2) Both edges of Jennings\u2019s bat - outside first, then inside - save him from the deadest of lbws in consecutive balls. He reaches for a drive but manages not to give the slips catching practice. Progress. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 2) Big Shan Gabriel bustles in from the other end, and sends down a spicy over to Jennings, who pleasingly resists the urge to play inexpertly outside off, collects one single and avoids a couple of other nasty ones. 1st over: England 3-0 (Burns 1, Jennings 1) Roach sends an absolutely unplayable one to Burns that is quick, seams away and keeps a bit low: somehow it missed both edge and off stump. Both openers get off the mark with tucks off their hips, and Roach throws in a no-ball to help them along. They\u2019re back out for this ticklish evening spell. 16 wickets have gone already today: will there be any more in the next 45-odd minutes? Well then. We\u2019ve got about 20 overs left in the day, so you wouldn\u2019t be confident about England keeping m/any wickets intact, but they\u2019re in a particularly strong position thanks to Wood and, in a more low-key way, Moeen Ali. Here\u2019s Wood for a late burst, and Gabriel lashes his loosener in front of point for four. Then next ball he cleans him up comprehensively with a phenomenal yorker. 47th over: West Indies 150-9 (Roach 16, Gabriel 0) Two more runs from the over as Roach drives out to deep cover. Meanwhile, who remembers Lowgold? Some gentle, whimsical, loosely cricket-themed indie: they named their debut album \u2018Just Backward Of Square.\u2019 WHAT A CATCH! WHAT AN EM-EFFING CATCH! Joseph goes for the huge hoik but only sends it high, high, high into the air. Broad is at mid-off and backpedals rapidly, at no point looking like he will even get close to taking the steepling catch, but at the very last he throws back his right arm and plucks the thing from the air. Remarkable stuff. 46th over: West Indies 147-8 (Roach 13, Joseph 2) Joseph doesn\u2019t play the rest of the over especially convincingly, not least a massive inside edge from an inswinger that goes down to fine leg. They dash back for the second run and Joseph only just makes it home, surviving a trip upstairs for the run-out. It was Broad! What a ball it was, by the way: pitching on off from a wide angle, straightening a bit and would have hit that very same stump. Broad thinks he has Dowrich lbw, the umpire doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s right... 45th over: West Indies 141-7 (Dowrich 34, Roach 13) Root scrambles to stop a Roach drive in the covers and does so, but seems to jar his shoulder in the process. He doesn\u2019t complain too much but could be a problem. Mo tries round the wicket and Roach uses the angle (if we\u2019re being charitable) to slash a drive just backward of point and Stokes can\u2019t catch it before it reaches the boundary. 44th over: West Indies 135-7 (Dowrich 33, Roach 8) Broad continues. Wonder whether Wood will get another brief spell before stumps. Dowrich flicks one very fine past Bairstow for a boundary: a lovely shot, and indicative of how he\u2019s played. 43rd over: West Indies 131-7 (Dowrich 29, Roach 8) Mo beats Roach\u2019s edge by a gnat\u2019s eyelash. Single from the over, before they have a drink. As a spectator you always want things to move on at a pace, but both teams might be relatively content with this slow spell. 42nd over: West Indies 130-7 (Dowrich 28, Roach 8) It\u2019s been a fairly quiet few overs: two runs from the last four and just a single from that one, another that Broad lands on/around off stump at a decent length six times. 41st over: West Indies 129-7 (Dowrich 27, Roach 8) Dowrich gets into a bit of a muddle and is beaten, in his ground but Bairstow flips the bail and they go upstairs to see if his foot was raised. It wasn\u2019t: but only just. Actually it might have been a hair off the ground, but there was no way the third umpire could say for certain so not out the only decision he could make. 40th over: West Indies 128-7 (Dowrich 26, Roach 8) Beaut from Broad, beating Roach\u2019s edge with one that bounced and nipped away, before Roach ducks into a short ball which smacks his helmet\u2019s peak full-on. He\u2019s fine, the lid is changed, and Broad closes out the over with a repeat of the first ball. 39th over: West Indies 128-7 (Dowrich 26, Roach 8) Moeen really isn\u2019t spinning it more than a fraction, but does still keeping beating the bat with flight, drift, dip, whatever. Not that time though: Dowrich drives very nicely wide of mid-off and to the boundary. 38th over: West Indies 121-7 (Dowrich 21, Roach 6) Wood is done, and interestingly it\u2019s Broad who replaces him: Stokes hasn\u2019t bowled yet, which you assume has something to do with that heel injury that nearly kept him out of the Test. Broad opens with a wide short one which seems to hit a dodgy patch in the pitch and loops high over Bairstow\u2019s head and to the boundary for five wides. Unusually, Broad takes the whole thing in good humour. Roach plays a lovely classical drive through the covers, not timed perfectly and Wood makes an unwelcome trudge out towards the fence to save one run. 37th over: West Indies 113-7 (Dowrich 21, Roach 3) Mo beats Roach\u2019s edge with a drifter. Dowrich twists his body around and plays a perfect reverse-sweep for four. The camera cuts to a slightly paunchy chap in the crowd who does a spot of belly dancing. All human life. 36th over: West Indies 107-7 (Dowrich 16, Roach 2) Wood is back, and Dowrich slightly naively takes a single first up which exposes Roach to Wood\u2019s pace. Actually the bowler does pretty well, clipping an attempted yorker in front of mid-wicket for a couple, then wears a shorter one but manages to keep gloves and bat out the way. 35th over: West Indies 104-7 (Dowrich 15, Roach 0) Another tight one from Moeen: just one from it, meaning his nine overs have gone for 12. Mo\u2019s back on, and Keemo Paul sees that as his cue to charge down the pitch. Unfortunately, he charges right past the ball and Bairstow neatly completes the formalities. 34th over: West Indies 103-6 (Dowrich 14, Paul 9) Lovely shot by Dowrich, lifting up on his tippy-toes and flicking a ball on middle-off through square leg and it eventually reaches the ropes. Then Paul jabs a nicely-timed cut in front of point for a boundary of his own. That was Wood\u2019s seventh over, admittedly interrupted by tea: would be surprised if he\u2019s back, but that has been a sensational spell - 7-2-34-4. 33rd over: West Indies 94-6 (Dowrich 9, Paul 5) \u201cI see the couple of months of internet giggling at the clownish ineptitude of Wood\u2019s bowling has gone the way of all such things as he smilingly gets on with it and unhistrionically takes a decent side apart,\u201d writes Robert Wilson. \u201cI\u2019m expecting the usual hormonal storms of online love and admiration for Grumpy Jimmy\u2019s performance. He\u2019s been exceptionally mulish and huffy today. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lesson here about economy of effort and emotional maturity but I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it.\u201d In fairness Anderson has been grumpy for his whole career and has 572 Test wickets to show for it, so it does seem slightly pointless asking him to cheer up at this stage. Three runs from the over, all to Dowrich, two tucked to mid-wicket and a single dabbed in front of point. 32nd over: West Indies 91-6 (Dowrich 6, Paul 5) Paul, as before, is having a go at pretty much anything. Burns makes a fantastic diving stop from one of his more reserved shots, before he heaves a slower, fuller one from outside off that ends up near deep mid-wicket. 31st over: West Indies 89-6 (Dowrich 5, Paul 4) Broad bowls a textbook, line and length over that Dowrich is happy to defend. Varying approaches from these two batsmen then. Differing batting for different...needs. 30th over: West Indies 89-6 (Dowrich 5, Paul 4) Keemo Paul is the new man, and woof! He larrups a back of a length ball from Wood, cross-batted, over mid-on for four. And then throws everything at a short one which is called wide, and flies past Bairstow to the boundary. This is absolutely smashing fun. Me oh my what a spell this is. Wood follows a nasty shorty with a slightly fuller one that Bravo drives at without much conviction, and edges to Root at first slip. Superb bowling. 29th over: West Indies 79-5 (Bravo 6, Dowrich 5) Stewpot Broad gets another bowl, replacing Mo. Dowrich is presented with a buffet ball of a wide half-volley, which he spanks to the cover fence and rightly admires for a few seconds. Meanwhile, Sky have just cut to a shot of Trevor Bayliss without his floppy hat on. Barely recognised him. Bayliss is hatless: repeat, Bayliss is hatless. 28th over: West Indies 75-5 (Bravo 6, Dowrich 1) Wood tickles the hairs on the back of Dowrich\u2019s neck with a steamer of a short ball the new man does well to get out the road of. He then shrewdly gets off strike with a single. The players are back out: Shane Dowrich is the new bat, and there are five balls remaining from the over Wood started before tea. Just a note for the \u2018England are idiots for not picking Wood earlier\u2019 crew: in his previous four Tests he took 2, 2, 0 and 1 wickets - 5-324 at 64.8. Sure, he\u2019s good, has been brilliant in this spell and there are various caveats in those figures, but let\u2019s not pretend England were ignoring peak Courtney Walsh here. The guys on Sky have been saying \u201cWhy oh why wasn\u2019t Wood playing from the start of this series?\u201d but unless I\u2019ve missed something I didn\u2019t hear many people clamouring for him before the first Test. Well then. England bowled really well in that session: Anderson and Broad beat the bat a lot but didn\u2019t get their reward, before Moeen and Wood took over and grabbed five brilliant wickets in 54 balls for 17 runs. Another for Wood! That had been coming, as Hetmyer jabs at another rapid ball outside off and edges to first slip, where Root juggles a high catch but holds on at the second try. 27th over: West Indies 74-4 (Bravo 6, Hetmyer 8) Three from another reasonably quiet over: there really isn\u2019t much/any spin here, but Mo\u2019s figures read 8-4-11-2, so he\u2019s at the very worst holding down an end. 26th over: West Indies 71-4 (Bravo 4, Hetmyer 7) Hetmyer, as we\u2019ve come to expect and love, reasons \u201cEff this for a game of soldiers\u201d and tries to flay Wood through the covers, which gets a thick edge that flies just above gully. Next ball is an edge too, this time Hetmyer edging away like a tailender, but that one somehow falls about three feet short of first slipper. Hetmyer picks up another couple with something close to a proper shot, a mistimed cut in front of point, then Bravo plays an actual proper shot with a well-timed dab in roughly the same direction, this time to the boundary. John Starbuck takes up the invitation from over 20: \u201cO B Jato\u2019s suggestion sounds worth investigating, but to do so you\u2019d need a proper academic study, to ascertain where the time-wasting actually happens. There could be a lot of extraneous factors, including the weather, length of bowlers\u2019 run-ups, number of spinners and so on. Two or three years\u2019 work there, mainly watching cricket, so there ought to be a fair few volunteers, who could also add how bored, or not, they felt.\u201d 25th over: West Indies 59-4 (Bravo 0, Hetmyer 0) \u201cVery nice Mo-zer,\u201d says J.Bairstow from behind the stumps. After those very nice balls Mo gets away with a couple of honkers - one a long-hop, the other a full-toss - both of which are hit straight to Buttler in the covers. 24th over: West Indies 59-4 (Bravo 0, Hetmyer 0) Hetmyer watches the hat-trick ball go past, wide of off, but then Wood sends a 91mph-er whistling just by his edge, before he desperately gropes at another rapid one that Bairstow takes above his head. Incidentally, good to see that while he\u2019s changed his run-up, Wood is still falling over in his follow-through: twice in that over alone. 23rd over: West Indies 59-4 (Bravo 0, Hetmyer 0) \u201cGood to see Mark Wood looking good (apologies to Dr Seuss),\u201d writes Seth Levine. After the chaos of the 22nd and 19th overs, Bravo calms things down by playing out a maiden. 22nd over: West Indies 59-4 (Bravo 0, Hetmyer 0) What an over! Some wheels from Wood too: all six balls are clocked in the 141-145 range, which is high 80s/90mph in old money. West Indies are 2-4 in the last 25 minutes. Two in two for Wood now! He sends down a rapid one that jumps outside off, but Roston Chase plays a loose shot he need not have done and fences one to Burns again. Now then: here\u2019s Mark Wood, with a lengthened run-up so he no longer does that backward-forward step thing at his mark. He\u2019s quick, and it works! Hope drives the fifth ball loosely to gully, where Burns safely pouches. 21st over: West Indies 59-2 (Bravo 0, Hope 1) An over of little incident, save for Hope getting off the mark with a single and a brief hint of a chance as Hope drives towards cover. 20th over: West Indies 58-2 (Bravo 0, Hope 0) Anderson round the wicket to Bravo, and smacks him on the hand to the point that he requires attention from the physio. He gets a few squirts on his left index finger from a spray bottle that looks like the one we spray the cat with when he\u2019s been naughty. He\u2019s deemed fit to continue, though. Bravo, not the cat. OB Jato writes: \u201cWith the Australian Open going on a few weeks ago, my eyes fell upon the \u2018shot clock\u2019 introduced in the major tennis tournaments to prevent wastage of time between the playing of points. Some claim it has taken a bit of the soul out of the game, but it still makes for compelling viewing, without any apparent dip in the quality of mental strategies being put in place during the rallies. \u201cCricket could do with something similar amidst a long-standing crisis of poor over rates in Test matches. Timing the period between consecutive deliveries will be too distracting and impractical; maybe there could be the introduction of an \u2018Over Clock\u2019 on the electronic scoreboards? This ensures the change of ends is done at a quick rate, and the first ball of the next set is bowled at a decent rate. \u2018Violations\u2019 could be handed out to the skipper in case of delays not caused by the batsman or external factors, with fines (and even bans) being handed down after repeated offences. Maybe, this could bring an end to the over-rate crisis the sport is seeing nowadays! Thoughts?\u201d Similar things have been mooted, but it might be a bit tricky to enforce. Rows about who is causing delays - the fielding team or the batting - would rage, plus plenty of other things I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t thought of. But over rates/pace of play is one of those things I feel like I should care about but really don\u2019t that much, so maybe it\u2019s best for someone else to tackle this one. 19th over: West Indies 57-2 (Bravo 0, Hope 0) Root arranges most of the England team around the bat but Darren Bravo survives the hat-trick ball. But after their day so far England will greedily take a two-wicket maiden and two fresh bats at the crease. It was hitting the top of leg, and Moeen Ali is on a hat-trick! The very next ball, Moeen traps Campbell (the batsman crossed while Brathwaite\u2019s shot was threatening satellites), the finger goes up but he goes upstairs. There were a couple of noises.... Out of absolutely nowhere, having patiently scored 12 runs from 50 balls, Brathwaite lumbers down the pitch and tries to cart Mo over cow corner, gets nothing like enough on it and Anderson takes a good catch running round from long on. 18th over: West Indies 57-0 (Brathwaite 12, Campbell 41) Anderson strays onto the DANGER ZONE, that strip of pitch down the middle onto which bowlers shall not tread, and receives an official warning. Two more of them and Anderson will be forbidden from bowling. Meanwhile Campbell merrily clomps down the middle of the track when taking a single and nothing is said. Batsman\u2019s game, this. 17th over: West Indies 53-0 (Brathwaite 11, Campbell 38) Quiet start to the post-drinks part of the day. Maybe the players drank too much too quickly and had to let the Gatorade settle. One run from an over of non-spinning spin by Mo. Hello all, and thanks Tanya. Emails to me from now, if you please: Nick.Miller.casual@theGuardian.com, or if you prefer tweeting @NickMiller79. And that\u2019s drinks here at the Darren Sammy stadium. Thank you very much for your company, good cheer and biscuit advice - Nick Miller will be your guide for the rest of the day. 16th over: West Indies 51-0 (Brathwaite 10, Campbell 33) Anderson gets the other end, with the wind against him this time. Can Campbell resist...? Anderson raps him on the pad, then Campbell catches one slightly over-pitched... and with a clop through the covers that\u2019s over the boundary. And the fifty opening partnership! The fourth of the series. Urgent missive from John Starbuck: \u201cGood advice about M &amp; S digestives (10th over). I concur; to which I\u2019d add: be careful when purchasing Granny Wild\u2019s ginger biscuits. These are large, tasty and crunchy but also intensely vulnerable. If I\u2019m shopping by car, they go into the boot separately from the other groceries, because they crumble as soon as you put them in a shopping bag. Not good travellers at all.\u201d 15th over: West Indies 46-0 (Brathwaite 10, Campbell 33) Campbell sweeps Moeen for four, then Brathwaite has a go for a single. KEaton Jennings has disappeared from short leg. It feels like we\u2019re waiting for something to happen here.. 14th over: West Indies 41-0 (Brathwaite 9, Campbell 29) Broad again. Short ones into the ribs, a fuller length, out-swingers. A cracking over, but no breakthrough. West Indies live on. Broad face reads : utter frustration Mark and Diane are salivating in Stechelberg : \u201cWhat we wouldn\u2019t give for a big packet of Bourbons right now. Whatever is great about living in Switzerland it is not their biscuits\u2026\u2026absolute pants.Have a dunk for us.\u201d I will! 13th over: West Indies 40-0 (Brathwaite 9, Campbell 28) Joe Root decides a bowling change is in order and brings on Moeen Ali to replace Anderson. Jennings takes up his usual position under the helmet. A good over and that\u2019s two maidens on the trot - which will rile Campbell in the mood he\u2019s in. Will he scratch the itch? 12th over: West Indies 40-0 (Brathwaite 9, Campbell 28) A mixed-up maiden from Broad. Peter Rowntree has biscuits on his mind. \u201cI would put Bourbons above Custard creams , but where do you put the humble Jammy Dodger in this list? I don\u2019t like the Jammy Dodgers with jam and cream, but the ones with just the jam I would put above the bourbons. Superb bowling from Kemar Roach this morning, he has become such a great bowler.\u201d Peter you\u2019re right on Roach - magnificent - but I\u2019m not really a fan of Jammy Dodgers, though the ones with faces are a staple of children\u2019s parties. One word of advice - don\u2019t swap macvities digestives for M and S ones - a false economy. 11th over: West Indies 40-0 (Brathwaite 9, Campbell 28) Hee! Hee!. Campbell lofts Anderson straight back down the ground for four, holding his perfect pose for a few seconds just for Jimmy -that\u2019s a great high elbow there John. Anderson responds with a wobbled-seam beauty last ball. 10th over: West Indies 33-0 (Brathwaite 7, Campbell 23) Campbell\u2019s a muscular chap, he has a thrash at Broad through the covers and then a couple more singles.Whether he has the concentration to go with the bling and go on to score his first half-century of the series, I guess we shall find out. 9th over: West Indies 28-0 (Brathwaite 6, Campbell 19) Anderson\u2019s back, but he has Brathwaite not Campbell to bowl at, a far calmer character. Nevertheless, Brathwaite can\u2019t resist a swing first ball. A maiden. No! Ooops, the umpire miscounted his pebbles. No, it is still a maiden. 8th over: West Indies 28-0 (Brathwaite 6, Campbell 19) Another lbw appeal, more scampered runs, more angry bowlers, Campbell with ants in his pants. 7th over: West Indies 20-0 (Brathwaite 6, Campbell 12) Anderson comes in for bit of a battering, and takes it as well as you might expect. First Campbell hits him for four, then six. Then Anderson hurls a ball at the stump which Campbell hits back at him. Then the review, which is given out, then reversed by the third umpire. Anderson chunters back to his fielding position. A fuming Anderson marches back to his mark given out by the onfield umpire... 6th over: West Indies 9-0 (Brathwaite 6, Campbell 2) A beautiful final ball from Broad\u2019s over - a leg-cutter that squares Brathwaite up. Kim Thonger has an inspired thought for a new member of the ECB\u2019s backup crew. \u201c I wonder perhaps could \u2018Failing\u2019 Chris Grayling be usefully employed as an England defensive batting coach? He seems extremely adept at dead-batting every journalistic intrusion with soft hands and lingering around forever in situations where everyone, including I suspect his teammates, simply wants him back in the pavilion? If he could impart these skills to the England top order they might very well drive all future opponents\u2019 fast bowling attack completely utterly barking and generally unfit for purpose?\u201d There\u2019s a joke about non-existent ferries and THE NEW COMPETITION in there somewhere. 5th over: West Indies 8-0 (Brathwaite 6, Campbell 2) Brathwaite guides Anderson past the slips down to the boundary, next ball a near-run-out when Campbell starts running from the non-striker\u2019s end, is sent back by Brathwaite, slips, and would have been out if Denly\u2019s throw had hit. Timothy Beecroft has thoughts about Mark Nicholas: \u201cSurely you don\u2019t believe that Mark Nicholas\u2019s wife makes him tea? What do you think the parlourmaid and butler are for?\u201d 4th over: West Indies 4-0 (Brathwaite 2, Campbell 2) Broad resumes after lunch, with a breeze blowing the umpire\u2019s shirt. He gets immediate encouragement with some extra zing, as Campbell plays and misses, an old dog poking his nose at a cat now too fast to catch. (BTW: that was the 30th time Bairstow had been bowled in Tests) Oh Mike, not you as well. The players are back on the pitch as I finish my bourbon - a far superior biscuit to its crumbly cousin the custard cream. Fire-crackingly good bowling by West Indies puts the game in the balance - apologies about the driving seat reference earlier by the way, don\u2019t know what I was thinking of. The rather brilliant Nasser Hussain is on the ground: \u201cThat was a brilliant session, that first hour was as watchable Test cricket as I\u2019ve seen for a long time. Top-drawer Test-match cricket. High-quality fast bowling that tested the technique and the ticker.\u201d \u201cOn this occasion you can put the collapse down to the bowling and the captaincy of Brathwaite.\u201d 3rd over: West Indies 2-0 (Brathwaite 2, Campbell 0) I\u2019m really curious to know whether cricket commentators, particularly Mark Nicholas, speak in the same way at home as they do at work. \u2018By Jingo, darling, that is some cup of tea.\u201d Anyway, that was a fairly uneventful over to finish off an eventful, fascinating, session. The players march off for lunch, Atherton ponders why there is no short leg when Keaton Jennings is in the team - give the poor man a job he can do! 2nd over: West Indies 2-0 (Brathwaite 2, Campbell 0) Broad gets one to whip off the pitch, and square up Campbell, before passing by the outside of his bat. Campbell then completely fluffs a sweep. A few fluffy clouds look down and West Indies will have one mroe over to face before lunch. 1st over: West Indies 1-0 (Brathwaite 1, Campbell 0) Anderson to see if he can extract the same venom as West Indies\u2019 bowlers this morning. By the third ball, Campbell is fumbling at one that dances across the outside edge . And Root and Anderson have a battle of wills over the fielding positions. Well that was a rapid downhill descent in the second hour - 231 for 4 overnight became 277 all out.. I didn\u2019t even have time to describe Wood\u2019s penultimate ball from Roach which deserves a little glory all of its own - an inswinging yorker that bounced mini-fractions from Wood\u2019s toe and was kept at bay only by a desperate dig by his bat. Atherton is exhalting, rather than scolding: \u201cIt is a working total, I woudn\u2019t be too critical of England, the cricket West Indies played today was as good as anything we\u2019ve seen this series from them.\u201d He\u2019s right - largely, as Bairstow\u2019s painstaking 2 showed, England tried to play the long innings that everyone has been calling for. But the bowling was too good for them to cash in. An evil short ball gets Anderson on the glove and it billows to fourth slip . That\u2019s 4-48 for Roach and a lesson in high-class bowling by West Indies this morning. England out for 277 Wood has a swing, and gets a soaring top-edge which swirls and Joseph catches it on the sprint at the boundary. A cracking take. 101st over: England 275-8 (Wood 4, Broad 0) Joseph building on the superb impression he gave in the last Test. Bowling around about 85mph, with long-limbed accuracy and quiet intent. Cosmo writes @tjaldred I hate to be that that that person, but a reincarnation is already a second incarnation. [over 93] There are a lot of THAT PERSON about today. Shouldn\u2019t you all be walking off Sunday lunch? But maybe I\u2019ve fallen into a 1970s vortex Moeen pushes at Joseph, the ball kisses the angle of the outside edge and goes comfortably to Bravo at third slip. Impermanence now permanent. 100th over: England 274-7 (Wood 4, Moeen 13) As if to rub salt into the wound, Wood comes in and clips his first ball for an-all-run-four, thus in one-ball overtaking Bairstow\u2019s 33-ball vigil. Bairstow\u2019s long and painful innings goes the way it has been looking like going all morning, bowled neck, crop and all the rest. A real ta-da! ball by Roach. 99th over: England 270-6 (Bairstow 2, Moeen 13) Time for Alzarri Joseph who is immediately in the groove. Moeen pushes at one outside off-stump, feet solidly, um, unmoving. Then a couple of runs from a stretched bat poked towards cover. I\u2019m probably condemning him to a century, but this innings doesn\u2019t have the air of permanence. 98th over: England 266-6 (Bairstow 2, Moeen 8)A peculiar incident. Roach appeals for an lbw after a ball arrows into Bairstow\u2019s leg, it is turned down and in the meantime England run a single. West Indies then review somewhat optimistically...and perhaps missing Holder\u2019s immaculate judgement on reviews - but it was missing and they lose their second review. Braithwaite brings a fourth slip in for Moeen. 97th over: England 264-6 (Bairstow 2, Moeen 8) Moeen does what Moeen does. He leans far too far into a drive and plonks the ball in to the empty space where point might be. He wafts a few more. Meanwhile Bairstow, who it turns out was hit in the gentleman\u2019s department in the previous over, remains marooned on 2. 96th over: England 260-6 (Bairstow 2, Moeen 4) Moeen glides a delivery from Roach politely to the left of third slip for three. Meanwhile Bairstow tries to cut one that bounces, the batting spirits aren\u2019t with him this morning. James Walsh has some news: \u201cFor years, I ran the cricket &amp; Doctor Who podcast with a pal, which we promoted when tagline \u201cthe world\u2019s nichest podcast.\u201d The chat of the past few overs has made me wonder if we quit too soon... https://medium.com/@jamesofwalsh/the-cricket-and-doctor-who-podcast-2013-2018-a-secret-history-cb82e9337760\u201d James, you have many friends on here if my inbox is any reflection. 95th over: England 257-6 (Bairstow 2 ,Moeen 1) The ball before drinks. Bairstow, who has been tested by Paul all over, has a lapse of concentration and pulls out an ugly flap. He survives. They sup on energy liquid. Bairstow has 2 from 23 balls and hasn\u2019t looked completely convincing. 94th over: England 256-6 (Bairstow 2 Moeen 0, ) Still admiring that superb catch by Dowrich. Unlucky for Stokes who played really well for that 79, characteristic/uncharacteristic depending on whether you judge him on his career or the last year. He\u2019s probably done enough to put England in the driving seat. Stokes has an old fashioned heave and Dowrich, sprinting 30 yards from the stumps to square leg grabs the ball a hair\u2019s breadth from the ground. Superb! 93rd over: England 255-5 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 78) A crashing, four by Stokes dispatches Paul behind square. England suddenly pulling away a bit here. and Gabriel can\u2019t have many overs left Meanwhile, Phil Sawyer, has put me right about Dr Who. \u201cAfternoon, Tanya. I don\u2019t want to be that person, [oh you do!] but the Master was most definitely a 70s Dr Who villain, played by the legend that is Roger Delgado. He was resurrected in the 1980s, played by Anthony Ainley, but, like me nowadays, he was a shadow of his former self. Ah, Phil, I was watching Words and Pictures and playing with Snoopy in the 1970s, I bow to your superior knowledge. But I still can\u2019t believe THE Master had a second reincarnation.. 92nd over: England 250-5 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 73) Gabriel prods Stokes again, a repeated needleing elbow in the ribs. He has Stokes bent in two, then Stokes sweeps, rather magnificently, just for one, but it brings up the 250. Then a DROP! Bairstow chips the ball back to Gabriel who can\u2019t keep hold of it in his heavy-footed follow-through. The man looks weary as he pulls on his maroon cap. 91st over: England 249-5 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 73) Paul has Stokes in trouble, missing the outside edge of his bat by a whisper. England, frazzled? go for a quick single, but make it home. Then Bairstow shows immaculate/questionable judgement by leaving the last ball of the over. 90th over: England 246-5 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 70) Gabriel has pulled up his socks and hit the kind of bowling sweet spot to dream of . He sends one short into the pitch and it flies at Bairstow\u2019s throat, who weaves and ducks back, further, further, as the ball follows him, it clonks him on the grill and billows over the slip cordon for four. It\u2019s all rather vulgarly thrilling, like a punch up at a rugby match. Sky repeat it about 37 times. 89th over: England 242-5 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 70) Kemo Paul replaces Roach, and has a decent first over. On Sky, Atherton is worried that when Stokes is defending, his left shoulder comes too far round and he becomes too chest-on. Meanwhile, in OBO-land, Peter Salmon writes: Hi Tanya Your reference to Bairstow looking like The Master sent me to the Wikipedia page of Anthony Ainley, who played him, and which contains the following information: \u201cAinley was a keen sportsman. Initially he was a rugby player, he played at fly-half for the Old Cranleighans, Richmond and Middlesex.[7] Later he turned his attentions to cricket\u2014even abruptly citing Sophie Aldred (who played Ace) as his friend once he learned that she played the game. He appeared on many occasions for the Stage and London Theatres C.C. mainly as an opening batsman.[8] And, as you may be aware, your name is also Aldred. Thank you Peter! I am aware her name is Aldred because the lady in our local bookshop remembers my surname because she is a Dr Who fan. Come to think of it, I think The Master\u2019s most usual adversary was Peter Davidson who was also a cricket fan. Or at least his version of Dr Who was. 88th over: England 240-5 (Bairstow 2, Stokes 68) Gabriel and Stokes have quiet word with each other - not, I\u2019m guessing, their recommendations for a good read. Gabriel has his eye on Bairstow\u2019s stumps, which on a good day you or I might have a chance at knocking over in a bowling alley. A hearty appeal for lbw against him by Gabriel, saved by an inside edge. Testing times. 87th over: England 238-5 (Bairstow 1, Stokes 67) The first boundary of the day comes from Stokes who clips Roach stylishly-fine, like a final whisk of an egg-white before it turns into meringue. By the way, if you want to get in touch my email is tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com 86th over: England 234-5 (Bairstow 1, Stokes 63) It was a super delivery from Gabriel to dismiss Buttler, who tried to drive but unfortunately forgot to move his feet. No addition to his overnight score. Which brings in Bairstow, presumably in the position where he wants to bat, which may bring its own mental pressures. Gabriel tests him with an awkward bouncer which Bairstow avoids by diving onto one knee and twisting his head yoga-style. That beard makes his helmeted face look a bit like 1980s DR WHO? villain The Master. Buttler misses a full, straight one, doesn\u2019t get his leg to the ball. Bails a\u2019flying. 85th over: England 232-4 (Buttler 67, Stokes 63) Kemar Roach, Mr Breakthrough, gets a fresh start from the other end.He saves his best delivery till last, a sharply-rising bouncer that passes the top of Stokes\u2019s bat. There is a strange effect on the pitch, not sure why - artistic mowing? but it seems to be emitting rays of light like the sun. 84th over: England 232-4 (Buttler 67, Stokes 63) Brathwaite throws the ball to Gabriel who starts his 15-paced wide-legged run-up. The third ball is over-pitched and Stokes, upper arm densely inked, turns the ball off his toes to get the scoreboard ticking over. The players are on their way out to the middle in this gorgeous ground and beautiful island. As Nick Knight says, \u201cit is the first time West Indies have been under pressure in this series.\u201d Which is both true and quite a statement. Feeling a little sorry for Keaton Jennings, who has taken a bit of a pasting in the Sunday papers - and on twitter from Kevin Pietersen. A nice guy - hope things work out for him. Mark Butcher, in a pink open-necked shirt with matching pocket hankerchief, and Rob Key in regulation sportsman\u2019s sports-casual, are digesting the back feet of Stokes, Root and Buttler. The conclusion is that Root needs to go back and do some homework. Welcome back, this Sunday lunchtime, to an intriguing Third Test, the day after England rediscovered the beauty of being (relatively) boring. A fifth-wicket stand of 124 by Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler - with a late no-ball retrieve for Stokes - put England in a place they haven\u2019t been for a while: quiet control. Were West Indies a little lost without Jason Holder\u2019s leadership, catching and bowling? Probably. But England\u2019s first-century stand of the series, after the usual calamity with the top order, just gave them time to breathe and put the pressure on their opponents. There\u2019s been a little overnight rain but play is due to start on the button.",

      "bodyText": "Manchester City Ederson 8 Retained concentration, made sharp saves when required and hit precise long balls. Kyle Walker 7 Having re-established himself after recently being dropped, the defender was again solid. John Stones 7 Still receives the odd ear-wigging from his manager for slipshod play and it happened again here. Aymeric Laporte 7 Faultless display from Guardiola\u2019s favourite defender, now filling the Kompany-sized void with aplomb. Oleksandr Zinchenko 8 Pushed into central areas to make an extra midfielder and made the assist on Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 30-yard strike. Fernandinho 7 The midfield general was once more metronomic, giving City the balance that lets them thrive. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan 8 A fine strike for the German \u2013 preferred to David Silva \u2013 showed Guardiola made the correct selection. Raheem Sterling 9 Flying start as the winger opened the scoring, then struck City\u2019s sixth in a rampant display. Kevin De Bruyne 7 Told off early on by Guardiola for sloppy play despite his quick free-kick leading to Sterling\u2019s opener. Bernardo Silva 9 Hurt Chelsea with dart in behind to make Sterling\u2019s opener, then his cross was missed by Ag\u00fcero. Sergio Ag\u00fcero 10 A howler of a miss before a rocket, a half-volley and a penalty for a redemptive hat\u2011trick. Subs Jesus (for Ag\u00fcero, 65) 7; Mahrez (for De Bruyne, 68) 7; D Silva (for Fernandinho, 75) 8 Chelsea Kepa Arrizabalaga 6 Could do little about the first goal. Or the second. Third. Fourth. And fifth. But a match to forget. Antonio R\u00fcdiger 2 Part of a dismal rear-guard who did basics wrong: particularly culpable for Ag\u00fcero\u2019s first, not pressing. Marcos Alonso 2 Where was he for Sterling\u2019s finish? Still showed willing to rove forward but this was near-pointless. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta 2 Captain has to take responsibility for being unable to settle side after opener and gave away penalty. David Luiz 2 Made the odd clever pass but in defence, where he was really needed, the Brazilian was awful. Jorginho 3 Failed to head off Zinchenko when he passed to Ag\u00fcero for City\u2019s second and did little to impress. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 4 Made runs forward when he could but was unable to do anything material to halt the light blue wave. Ross Barkley 1 Roasted Hazard over the opener but then set up Ag\u00fcero\u2019s second with a hapless header. Lasted six minutes of second half. Eden Hazard 3 Was asleep for City\u2019s opener for which he rightly received a telling off; one scintillating run from near halfway was his highlight. Pedro 5 Danced in and around the area when he could but was fighting a battle lost too early by defence. Gonzalo Higua\u00edn 6 Had next to zero service but one chest-then-volley from 25 yards illustrated his class. Subs Kovacic (for Barkley, 52) 5; Loftus-Cheek (for Pedro, 65) 5; Emerson (for Alonso, 73) 5",

      "bodyText": "Olivia Colman\u2019s performance as the unstable, self-pitying and hilariously bad-mannered Queen Anne won her Bafta award success on Sunday evening \u2013 one of seven awards for the 18th-century comedy The Favourite. The film was easily the biggest winner at the glitzy Royal Albert Hall ceremony, picking up prizes including including best British film, best production design, best supporting actress, best original screenplay and best costume design. Colman followed up her success at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice awards by being named best actress \u2013 a category pundits predicted would feature a close race between her and Glenn Close, nominated for The Wife. \u201cWe are having an amazing night aren\u2019t we?\u201d said Colman in her speech, which met with a standing ovation. \u201cWe are going to get so pissed later.\u201d It caps a stratospheric rise for the actor who early in her career struggled for parts and was best known for comedy, becoming a regular in Mitchell and Webb television and radio sketches and Peep Show. Later came career-changing dramas such as Broadchurch and The Night Manager \u2013 up next: the middle-aged Elizabeth in Netflix\u2019s The Crown. Playing a queen does not guarantee Bafta success, but it unquestionably helps. Colman follows in the footsteps of Katharine Hepburn (Eleanor of Aquitaine), Judi Dench (Elizabeth I and Victoria), Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth I) and Helen Mirren (Elizabeth II) in winning for a royal turn. Both her co-stars, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, were nominated for best supporting actress, with Weisz winning out. Weisz paid tribute to her co-stars, saying: \u201cI salute you! Didn\u2019t we have an extraordinary time. Hats off, ladies.\u201d It was a terrific night for The Favourite but it lost out to the widely lauded tear-jerker Roma in the best film category. Roma\u2019s director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n was named best director, beating Yorgos Lanthimos, Spike Lee, Bradley Cooper and Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski. It also won best cinematography (by Cuar\u00f3n himself) and best film not in the English language. Cuar\u00f3n thanked Netflix for having the \u201cfaith and courage to get behind a black-and-white film about a domestic worker, subtitled from Spanish, and bring it to audiences around the world. \u201cTo see a film about an indigenous domestic worker embraced this way in an age when fear and anger propose to divide us means the world to me. \u201cReverting back to a world of separation and isolation is not a solution to anything. It is simply an excuse to hide our fear within our basest instincts.\u201d If there was an underlying theme of the evening \u2013 apart from the odd jibe about Brexit \u2013 then it was diversity in the industry. Or the lack of such. One of the biggest cheers went to The Favourite\u2019s production designers Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton when they dedicated their win to \u201cevery woman and working mother who keeps it together and makes it happen\u201d. And screenwriter Deborah Davis said: \u201cThank you for celebrating our female-dominated movie about women in power.\u201d The Favourite\u2019s costume designer, Sandy Powell, described it as a dream \u201cto design for three powerful female protagonists played by three powerful female actresses\u201d. Earlier in the evening, the film-maker Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, accepting the best documentary award for Free Solo, which follows rock climber Alex Honnold on a remarkable, heart-stopping free solo climb, thanked National Geographic for \u201chiring women and people of colour \u2026 because we do make the films better\u201d.

A ball was played by her Chicago Red Stars teammate Nikki Stanton looking for Kerr, the most advanced player on the pitch, who had run off the shoulder of the last defender. It was intercepted, and Victory looked to spark a counter attack. Kerr tucked her head and powered the legs \u2013 an 80m recovery run, eventually forcing Emily Gielnik wide and away from danger at the concession of a corner.</p> <p>For all her talent, it\u2019s her hard work, her humility and her quiet determination that makes Kerr such a formidable player, and asset to the game. The individual brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo; the team ethic of Carles Puyol.</p> <p>And for all this, it\u2019s terrifying to think that East Fremantle-born phenomenon is just 25. Greater accolades may yet beckon. Rumoured to have attracted heavy interest from the top leagues of Europe, this could be the last we see of Kerr in Australia.

      "bodyText": "What more is there to write about Sam Kerr? By the numbers, she\u2019s unstoppable. 69 goals in 96 W-League appearances, 16 goals for the season, a record 13 in the regular season \u2013 equaling the league\u2019s best-ever mark, set by her last campaign. She leads the league for chances created (45), for shots (62); she\u2019s even equal-second on assists. She scores, she sets up, she leads with the armband. But even in a game in which she\u2019s banged three goals and provided the assist for the fourth, there\u2019s so much more to Sam Kerr than just goals. In the 115th minute with the match seemingly secure at 4-2, Perth looked for one last piece of security. A ball was played by her Chicago Red Stars teammate Nikki Stanton looking for Kerr, the most advanced player on the pitch, who had run off the shoulder of the last defender. It was intercepted, and Victory looked to spark a counter attack. Kerr tucked her head and powered the legs \u2013 an 80m recovery run, eventually forcing Emily Gielnik wide and away from danger at the concession of a corner. For all her talent, it\u2019s her hard work, her humility and her quiet determination that makes Kerr such a formidable player, and asset to the game. The individual brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo; the team ethic of Carles Puyol. And for all this, it\u2019s terrifying to think that East Fremantle-born phenomenon is just 25. Greater accolades may yet beckon. Rumoured to have attracted heavy interest from the top leagues of Europe, this could be the last we see of Kerr in Australia. As the record top goalscorer in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League in the States, the likes of Lyon and the prospect of the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League may come knocking, especially with the forthcoming World Cup in France. All of which underlines the value of FFA\u2019s decision to hand Kerr a record W-League marquee contract this season. As Kerr\u2019s exploits go global in this increasingly digital age, so too does the reputation of the W-League. From humble beginnings just over a decade ago, the league is expanding and improving exponentially \u2013 a point illustrated by three of Kerr\u2019s teammates from Sunday\u2019s remarkable semi-final: Rachel Hill, Kim Carroll, and Leticia McKenna. In the 2008-09 season, seven overseas players made their way to play in Australia \u2013 this season all nine teams used their full complement of visa players, bringing that number to 36. But for Kerr, Hill might have been considered the standout, best-on-ground against Victory, with the US import at the heart of Glory\u2019s best moves, combining with Kerr with aplomb and terrorising Melbourne\u2019s backline with her pace. Not quite in the league of the Alex Morgans or Megan Rapinoes, Hill hasn\u2019t quite cracked the US national team, despite junior honours, but with two seasons under her belt in the NWSL, Hill is building a year-round professional career, cashing in on the complementary calendars of the W-League and the world\u2019s best domestic competition. And incrementally lifting the playing standard of women\u2019s football in Australia. With over 50 caps for the Matildas, Carroll is a vastly experienced campaigner and had a massive hand in Glory\u2019s win on Sunday, marshalling Perth\u2019s backline and bringing rugged physicality to the contest with Melbourne\u2019s twin \u201ctalls\u201d of Natasha Dowie and Gielnik. Aged 31, Carroll is a bridge back to the generation of talented Matildas who forged a path for professionalism well before the league\u2019s financials could equal the players\u2019 passion. So many of those players have been lost to the game, but thanks to a hugely improved collective bargaining agreement ahead of the W-League\u2019s 10th season, an enshrined minimum wage floor of around $12,500 has seen the amount of players on near-professional contracts grow to 200. Veterans are hanging in, and their wealth of experience is retained and passed on. Professional Footballers Australia, the players\u2019 union, is targeting \u201c60 at 60\u201d \u2013 60 players on salaries of $60,000 annually, ahead of major global tournaments like the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. It\u2019s here that Kerr\u2019s reported $300,000 marquee contract has a headline effect.

In 16-year-old McKenna, Glory\u2019s semi-final winning team also boasted one of the league\u2019s most promising young talents \u2013 a third component of the continued growth of the W-League and women\u2019s football in this country. Last season, 13 players aged 17 or younger made 56 appearances in the W-League \u2013 almost 3,000 minutes of professional game time, in addition to the week-in, week-out experiences of training alongside Matildas, former Matildas and an armada of foreign stars.

Two Southampton fans were seen making plane gestures on Saturday; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/10/chelsea-fans-banned-raheem-sterling-alleged-racist-abuse-manchester-city-football\" title=\"\">Chelsea suspended four fans over the abuse of Raheem Sterling</a>; West Ham have identified the solitary supporter heard shouting Islamophobic abuse at Salah; one Spurs fan was fined and banned for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/02/arsenal-tottenham-banana-skin-thrower-pierre-emerick-aubameyang\" title=\"\">throwing a banana at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in December</a>.

Colin Wing, one of the Chelsea fans who abused Sterling at Stamford Bridge, told the media about how as a consequence of that incident and the publicity it attracted he had lost his job and his season ticket. But it is also important not to exaggerate them and for all the negative headlines there is still much to celebrate in British football culture.</p> <p>Many thousands of match-goers will never have witnessed an incident of racial abuse. In the week after Sala\u2019s disappearance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/feb/02/cardiff-city-pay-tribute-to-emiliano-sala-at-game-against-bournemouth-video\" title=\"\">a \u201cmoment of silent reflection\u201d</a> was held before all top-flight matches, impeccably observed as such occasions almost always are.</p> <p>With these stories coinciding with the rancour that preceded and followed the Brexit vote, some might conclude the rules of basic, shared decency that hold our society together are being forgotten. However, I suspect most fans would report that even at football, where such ties are strenuously and repeatedly tested by the use of 22 men, a ball and an arbiter of questionable competence to provoke the wildest of emotional extremes, they are holding up rather well.</p>",

Since the Brexit vote some people may indeed feel emboldened to behave in a manner previously considered unacceptable but, however many stories we have seen this season, there do not appear to be lots of them. Two Southampton fans were seen making plane gestures on Saturday; Chelsea suspended four fans over the abuse of Raheem Sterling; West Ham have identified the solitary supporter heard shouting Islamophobic abuse at Salah; one Spurs fan was fined and banned for throwing a banana at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in December. For all the headlines these incidents generated, they remain the actions of eight people at four matches whose combined attendance was 191,885. It is important the repercussions of such behaviour are known to be swift and painful. Colin Wing, one of the Chelsea fans who abused Sterling at Stamford Bridge, told the media about how as a consequence of that incident and the publicity it attracted he had lost his job and his season ticket. But it is also important not to exaggerate them and for all the negative headlines there is still much to celebrate in British football culture. Many thousands of match-goers will never have witnessed an incident of racial abuse. In the week after Sala\u2019s disappearance a \u201cmoment of silent reflection\u201d was held before all top-flight matches, impeccably observed as such occasions almost always are. With these stories coinciding with the rancour that preceded and followed the Brexit vote, some might conclude the rules of basic, shared decency that hold our society together are being forgotten. However, I suspect most fans would report that even at football, where such ties are strenuously and repeatedly tested by the use of 22 men, a ball and an arbiter of questionable competence to provoke the wildest of emotional extremes, they are holding up rather well.",

      "bodyText": "Fresh details have emerged of the coup attempt against Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, with witnesses claiming foreign members of the terror group lost a two-day battle with his bodyguards before being rounded up and executed. A witness who spoke to the Guardian after being smuggled from the last hamlet in eastern Syria held by Isis, said the clash took place in al Keshma, a village next to Baghouz in September, three months earlier than regional intelligence officials believed it had taken place. \u201cI saw him with my own eyes,\u201d said Jumah Hamdi Hamdan, 53. \u201cHe was in Keshma and in September the Khawarij (infidels) tried to capture him. \u201cThe fighting was very intense, they had tunnels between houses. They were mainly Tunisians and there were many people killed.\u201d Hamdan said Baghdadi then moved to Baghouz, from where he fled to the desert in early January. This account was supported by senior regional officials, who say he probably remains there, as the remnants of the so-called caliphate he built disintegrates nearby. A senior military official from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led force battling Isis, said other members of Isis\u2019 foreign legion had joined the fight, including Algerians and Moroccans. \u201cIt was a really tough clash and they excommunicated the losers,\u201d said an SDF commander at the Baghouz frontline, who uses the nom de guerre Adnan Afrini. \u201cIt started in mid-September and it was a very serious attempt to kill or capture him. We don\u2019t think he is in the town now.\u201d Hamdan said Baghdadi and his guard force had been in the area for almost six months before fleeing. \u201cHe tried to keep a low profile and didn\u2019t travel through town with them but we all knew where they were. He used an old red Opal car.\u201d Isis has placed a bounty on the head of the main plotter, Abu Muath al-Jazairi, who is believed to be a veteran foreign fighter. Nemsha, along with much of Baghouz, stands in ruin as Kurdish forces and special forces from Britain, France and the US tighten the net on the last pocket the group holds \u2013 a small strip of land along the Euphrates river. Kurdish forces on the Baghouz frontline estimate the area is defended by about 400 hardcore Isis members, who do not intend to surrender. The SDF said it had captured 41 positions held by Isis. Isis leaders are believed to be holding western hostages who were captured by the organisation over the past five years and whom they intend to use as bargaining chips. British journalist John Cantlie is believed to be among them and Baghouz residents who have fled the town suggested caves on the outskirts were being used to hide him and other captives. Mortars fired by western special forces rained down on the holdouts through much of Sunday. Fighter jets soared above, leaving circular white streams that marked their orbits. The planes occasionally dropped powerful bombs that created huge plumes of smoke. Surveillance drones moved slowly beneath the jets. Aram Kochar, a Kurdish military official said Isis fighters were wary of the drones and were rarely seen on the streets, apart from at dusk or under cloud cover. \u201cThey\u2019re very committed and they don\u2019t plan on leaving,\u201d the official said from the rooftop of a forward base, about 700 metres from the nearest Isis position. \u201cWe took two houses yesterday and they took them back from us at night.\u201d On Saturday night, Kurdish forces launched the final phase of the operation to take Baghouz \u2013 a move that will allow them to lay claim to ousting Isis from all the Syrian lands it had held since capturing a swathe of the country in early 2013. During the peak of its powers, Isis had made the nearby border with Iraq redundant and controlled an area of land from eastern Aleppo to Mosul \u2013 roughly the size of Wales.

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has pulled out of the bidding for Patisserie Valerie, just two days after emerging as a surprise suitor for the stricken cake chain. Mike Ashley\u2019s sportswear group walked away from talks on Sunday, ending the prospect that Patisserie Valerie could join House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Sofa.com in the Sports Direct stable. The approach, made last Friday, was an unexpected twist in the battle to rescue Patisserie Valerie, which fell into administration in January after a \u00a340m black hole was uncovered in its finances. It is understood that Ashley made a late bid reportedly worth more than \u00a315m for Patisserie Valerie, but was told the offer was too low. According to the Financial Times, Sports Direct was unhappy about being shut out of the bidding process, saying it \u201cnot been allowed access to a data room, any financial information or meetings with management\u201d to allow it to improve its bid. Sports Direct argued it was \u201cat a serious disadvantage as a bidder\u201d if it was left to rely on financial information in the public arena, which it claimed was \u201cat best unreliable\u201d. It is understood Sports Direct was given access to the data room after tabling its first offer but the retailer nevertheless withdrew. Sports Direct had bid for Patisserie Holdings \u2013 the parent company of Patisserie Valerie as well as the Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker &amp; Spice and Flour Power City brands. The deadline for first-round bids was 1 February, a week before Ashley entered the fray. Administrators at KPMG, which is running the company, has closed 71 of Patisserie Valerie\u2019s nearly 200 stores and concessions, as it seeks a buyer for the company. Dozens of bids were received, either for the whole company or some of its stores. Around 900 jobs have been lost, with another 2,800 at risk if a buyer can\u2019t be found. Several parties are understood to be carrying out due diligence before submitting final-round bids to KPMG, but it is not clear when the bidding process will be concluded. Coffee chain Costa, which is now owned by Coca-Cola, and a number of other parties are thought to have tabled offers for a parcel of stores but it is not clear if any parties want Patisserie Valerie as a going concern. Patisserie Valerie blamed its financial plight on \u201cvery significant manipulation\u201d of its balance sheet and \u201cextensive\u201d misstatement of its accounts. It suspended finance chief Chris Marsh, who subsequently resigned after being arrested and bailed by police. The company was valued at \u00a3450m before the black hole was discovered.

      "body": "<p>Something strange happened 12 minutes into the first half of what was, all things considered, a pretty strange kind of game. First there was a hush around the Etihad, then a gurgling sound, followed by an oddly sensual purr in the stands as the big screens showed the first replays of Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s first goal in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">6-0 shellacking</a> of Chelsea</p> \n<p>Ag\u00fcero had just put Manchester City 2-0 up and in effect killed the game. The moment stood on its own, though. Football crowds don\u2019t often gasp. But then, they don\u2019t often get to see goals like this. Taking the ball in a deep inside-left position, Ag\u00fcero turned, jinked and shrugged away the attentions of Jorginho, a deep midfielder with all the gnarled defensive presence of a tea-sodden digestive biscuit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/manchester-city-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Sergio Ag\u00fcero hits hat-trick in Chelsea\u2019s humiliation by Manchester City</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The shot came without breaking stride, a right-foot spank that flew with a vicious certainty into the far top corner, and which seemed to defy physics as it did so, its trajectory totally flat, unhindered by gravity or drag. Had the net and the stand not been in its way Ag\u00fcero\u2019s shot would presumably still be flying at the same height and speed even now, arrowing over the hook of Cornwall, past the Bay of Biscay and off towards the south Atlantic</p> \n<p>It was the enduring image of the day; or at least one of them, on an afternoon dominated also by the sight of Maurizio Sarri gesturing wildly at a group of Chelsea players who often seemed to be facing the other way, the Italian\u2019s hands describing furious shapes in the air, at one moment puncturing an invisible water bed with a bread knife, at another performing the world\u2019s angriest silent disco dance.</p> \n<p>But then it wasn\u2019t hard to pick out Ag\u00fcero as the outstanding single figure on a day when Sarri\u2011ball met Sergio-ball with, as they say in movie outlines, hilarious consequences. Much will be written about his second hat-trick in eight days in the middle of a title chase. A neat close-range finish and a second\u2011half penalty took Ag\u00fcero to 160 goals in the Premier League, and out in front now as City\u2019s all time league top scorer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec415144-8a01-4474-89ef-b2c4da369a72\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Manchester City (86 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>24 Apr </b>Man Utd (a)<br><b>28 Apr&nbsp;</b>Burnley (a)<br><b>4 May&nbsp;</b>Leicester (h)<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Brighton (a)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Liverpool (85 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>21 Apr&nbsp;</b>Cardiff (a)&nbsp;<br><b>26 Apr&nbsp;</b>Huddersfield (h)<br><b>5 May&nbsp;</b>Newcastle (a)&nbsp;<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Wolves (h)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With Raheem Sterling also playing with a beautiful sense of certainty, City were irresistible here. Albeit against opponents so dreadful their performance could prove fatal for Sarri\u2019s attempts to buck the trend of disposable Chelsea managers.</p> \n<p>There is an element of overlap to these two elements. Zoom out a little and it is the diversification in Ag\u00fcero\u2019s game that really leaps out, and which shines a light on both the supreme quality of Pep Guardiola\u2019s coaching at this rarified level, and the clumsiness of Sarri, an arriviste among the A-listers, in his six months to date with Chelsea.</p> \n<p>It is no secret that Ag\u00fcero has changed under Guardiola, has found other gears and greater depths to his game.

      "bodyText": "Something strange happened 12 minutes into the first half of what was, all things considered, a pretty strange kind of game. First there was a hush around the Etihad, then a gurgling sound, followed by an oddly sensual purr in the stands as the big screens showed the first replays of Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s first goal in this 6-0 shellacking of Chelsea Ag\u00fcero had just put Manchester City 2-0 up and in effect killed the game. The moment stood on its own, though. Football crowds don\u2019t often gasp. But then, they don\u2019t often get to see goals like this. Taking the ball in a deep inside-left position, Ag\u00fcero turned, jinked and shrugged away the attentions of Jorginho, a deep midfielder with all the gnarled defensive presence of a tea-sodden digestive biscuit. The shot came without breaking stride, a right-foot spank that flew with a vicious certainty into the far top corner, and which seemed to defy physics as it did so, its trajectory totally flat, unhindered by gravity or drag. Had the net and the stand not been in its way Ag\u00fcero\u2019s shot would presumably still be flying at the same height and speed even now, arrowing over the hook of Cornwall, past the Bay of Biscay and off towards the south Atlantic It was the enduring image of the day; or at least one of them, on an afternoon dominated also by the sight of Maurizio Sarri gesturing wildly at a group of Chelsea players who often seemed to be facing the other way, the Italian\u2019s hands describing furious shapes in the air, at one moment puncturing an invisible water bed with a bread knife, at another performing the world\u2019s angriest silent disco dance. But then it wasn\u2019t hard to pick out Ag\u00fcero as the outstanding single figure on a day when Sarri\u2011ball met Sergio-ball with, as they say in movie outlines, hilarious consequences. Much will be written about his second hat-trick in eight days in the middle of a title chase. A neat close-range finish and a second\u2011half penalty took Ag\u00fcero to 160 goals in the Premier League, and out in front now as City\u2019s all time league top scorer. With Raheem Sterling also playing with a beautiful sense of certainty, City were irresistible here. Albeit against opponents so dreadful their performance could prove fatal for Sarri\u2019s attempts to buck the trend of disposable Chelsea managers. There is an element of overlap to these two elements. Zoom out a little and it is the diversification in Ag\u00fcero\u2019s game that really leaps out, and which shines a light on both the supreme quality of Pep Guardiola\u2019s coaching at this rarified level, and the clumsiness of Sarri, an arriviste among the A-listers, in his six months to date with Chelsea. It is no secret that Ag\u00fcero has changed under Guardiola, has found other gears and greater depths to his game. But then it has always been the model in kill-joy lazy thinking to dismiss Guardiola\u2019s success as a bought success. For all the millions spent, this is manager who gets his real kicks from coaching, from finding something more in the players he has. Guardiola will bridle at any suggestion he was ever less\u2011than\u2011sold on Ag\u00fcero as the key attacking part in his vision of his City team. But the fact is Ag\u00fcero has also expanded his palette, evolving from that comfortable status as a pure cutting edge and pre-existing hometown superstar, to a more rounded player now, perhaps even an all\u2011round attacker to match anyone in Europe. That second goal came from dropping deeper, filling the different spaces he finds now, alternating between No 10 and all-round playmaker and his established role as shark-like cutting edge.

The goals have been big goals, too, of late. Since November Ag\u00fcero has eight in four against Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and now Chelsea. Aged 30, seven seasons and three managers in his time at City, Ag\u00fcero has become the de facto on-field leader of this team.

But it is also true that a clash of personnel and systems still looks unsolved, unfixed and probably terminal now. As Ag\u00fcero came off on 64 minutes he walked close to Sarri, who half\u2011turned in a pained but gracious acknowledgement of what the league\u2019s outstanding central attacker had just done to his team.

The backing from James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, came as the Irish government dismissed the idea that it had influenced the demise of the \u00a313.8m deal with the startup firm Seaborne Freight.

Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the arrangement would \u201cjust confirm the view of many that this country is in a mess\u201d.

The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said the digital platforms inquiry, which delivered its preliminary report in December, reveals that the market power enjoyed by the digital behemoths is weakening Australian media. More than a quarter of traditional newspaper journalism jobs have disappeared, print advertising revenue has dried up, and for every $100 spent on online advertising, $47 goes to Google and $21 goes to Facebook. In the past three years, Google and Facebook are estimated to have captured 80% of the growth in digital advertising.

But society benefits from a strong and diverse range of media sources on top of the two public broadcasters, ABC and SBS. \u201cNews and journalism are different to many other commercial activities in that they benefit both the individual and also society as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cPlurality of editorial voices contribute to the public interest and we should not be in a position whereby we rely on one or even two news sources. \u201cGiven all this, it is also vital that media businesses are not disadvantaged through the exercise of market power or other mechanisms that make it difficult for them to compete on their merits.\u201d Sims said the new entrants to the market, such as Guardian Australia, Crikey, BuzzFeed and the Daily Mail, do not make up for the shrinking newsrooms of the old Fairfax Media, now a part of Nine, and News Corp Australia, because they typically operate very small newsrooms. The financial viability of these businesses is also not assured as demonstrated by BuzzFeed and Vice recently announcing redundancies in Australia, as well as worldwide. BuzzFeed\u2019s small news operation will be effectively wiped out by global cutbacks in the business which have targeted 11 editorial jobs in Australia. Sims said there were issues of privacy and data collection to be addressed in the inquiry\u2019s final report. The lack of transparency about how much data is collected about consumers was a major concern. The preliminary report recommended a powerful new authority to oversee the commercial activities of Google and Facebook. The new regulator would have the authority to inquire into all aspects of the digital platforms\u2019 business and subsidiaries and would have jurisdiction over any platform that earns $100m in revenue in Australia. \u201cVirtually no media regulation applies to digital platforms and this contributes to regulatory disparity between media sectors that would appear to provide the digital platforms with an unfair advantage in attracting advertising expenditure because they operate under fewer regulatory constraints and have lower regulatory compliance costs,\u201d Sims said. The competition regulator is also reviewing the Coalition\u2019s regional and small publishers \u201cjobs and innovation package\u201d which was part of the media reforms passed last year, tax offsets for the production of certain types of news and journalism and making personal subscriptions to news media tax deductible.

      "body": "<p>This Six Nations is starting to feel like a slasher flick, with England ticking off their victims one by one.

This was another pitiless performance.</p> <p>The idea France might surprise them, and everyone else, was shattered in the opening 60 seconds with a couple of nightmare tackles. Yoann Huget ran smack into both Vunipolas. He may as well have burst in on the Krays in the back room of the Blind Beggar. Then Guilhem Guirado was splattered by Courtney Lawes. Guirado coughed up the ball like he had been choking on it and someone had just whacked him on the back. Take that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/10/england-france-six-nations-2019-match-report-rugby\">Jonny May hat-trick spearheads England\u2019s crushing win over France</a> </p> </aside>  <p>France were reeling already. And here came Jonny May and Elliot Daly speeding down the left wing, which seemed, all of a sudden, to have opened up in front of them as the French defenders scrambled to make their ground.</p> <p>When Eddie Jones explained why he had picked Chris Ashton on the wing ahead of Jack Nowell he said it was because he had a feeling he would sneak the team an early try. Turned out that was a feint. It was not England\u2019s right that landed on France, but their left instead. Daly slipped out of a tackle from Camille Lopez during a lovely, jinking run and then threaded a grubber kick through for May to chase. All he had to do was tap it down.</p> <p>So just over a minute in, England were leading and there was already an irresistible feeling about which way the match was going, the result as inevitable as the black rain clouds coming over from behind the West Stand. The rain arrived midway through the half. It did not dampen England\u2019s play in any way.</p> <p>It was May\u2019s 20th try for England, which brought him level with Ashton in eighth place on their all-time list. Twenty minutes later, May overtook him, just like he did all those defenders. His second try was made by Owen Farrell, who ran a cunning switchback and then threw a sweet 15-yard pass that left May squaring off with France\u2019s young wing Damian Penaud. For a second they stood a yard apart, each watching the other and waiting for the draw. May twitched left, then right, and then set off on his left again. Penaud, who had been turned inside-out, turned the right way around just in time to watch him score.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bc376f9a8cfae36ac4c65137b2bf8e7910ae4dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bc376f9a8cfae36ac4c65137b2bf8e7910ae4dc/0_11_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny May scores his second try after bewitching Damian Penaud with is footwork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny May scores his second try after bewitching Damian Penaud with is footwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Crombie/INPHO/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The third, five minutes later, was the easiest of the lot. Morgan Parra spilled a high kick, Ashton gathered it, glanced up and then stabbed through a little chip for May to collect. So that was the hat-trick. It took him just under 30 minutes. It was not the fastest scored by an Englishman in the Six Nations \u2013 it was not long ago Jonathan Joseph took 17 minutes against Italy and Austin Healey scored one in 10 minutes against them too. But it was the first an Englishman had made in the first half of a match and the first for an Englishman against France since 1924.</p> <p>It won May the man-of-the-match award, though he did make one conspicuous mistake.

      "bodyText": "This Six Nations is starting to feel like a slasher flick, with England ticking off their victims one by one. They are taking bloody revenge on everyone who beat them in 2018, Ireland last weekend and now France. This was another pitiless performance. The idea France might surprise them, and everyone else, was shattered in the opening 60 seconds with a couple of nightmare tackles. Yoann Huget ran smack into both Vunipolas. He may as well have burst in on the Krays in the back room of the Blind Beggar. Then Guilhem Guirado was splattered by Courtney Lawes. Guirado coughed up the ball like he had been choking on it and someone had just whacked him on the back. Take that. France were reeling already. And here came Jonny May and Elliot Daly speeding down the left wing, which seemed, all of a sudden, to have opened up in front of them as the French defenders scrambled to make their ground. When Eddie Jones explained why he had picked Chris Ashton on the wing ahead of Jack Nowell he said it was because he had a feeling he would sneak the team an early try. Turned out that was a feint. It was not England\u2019s right that landed on France, but their left instead. Daly slipped out of a tackle from Camille Lopez during a lovely, jinking run and then threaded a grubber kick through for May to chase. All he had to do was tap it down. So just over a minute in, England were leading and there was already an irresistible feeling about which way the match was going, the result as inevitable as the black rain clouds coming over from behind the West Stand. The rain arrived midway through the half. It did not dampen England\u2019s play in any way. It was May\u2019s 20th try for England, which brought him level with Ashton in eighth place on their all-time list. Twenty minutes later, May overtook him, just like he did all those defenders. His second try was made by Owen Farrell, who ran a cunning switchback and then threw a sweet 15-yard pass that left May squaring off with France\u2019s young wing Damian Penaud. For a second they stood a yard apart, each watching the other and waiting for the draw. May twitched left, then right, and then set off on his left again. Penaud, who had been turned inside-out, turned the right way around just in time to watch him score. The third, five minutes later, was the easiest of the lot. Morgan Parra spilled a high kick, Ashton gathered it, glanced up and then stabbed through a little chip for May to collect. So that was the hat-trick. It took him just under 30 minutes. It was not the fastest scored by an Englishman in the Six Nations \u2013 it was not long ago Jonathan Joseph took 17 minutes against Italy and Austin Healey scored one in 10 minutes against them too. But it was the first an Englishman had made in the first half of a match and the first for an Englishman against France since 1924. It won May the man-of-the-match award, though he did make one conspicuous mistake. He missed a tackle on Huget in the run-up to France\u2019s try. England are such nit\u2011pickers these days that you guess that error will be almost as galling for him as the tries were gratifying, because May is one of the players who seems to have responded best to Jones\u2019s ruthless perfectionism. May used to seem like a bit of a headless chicken on the pitch, running this way and that, sideways and back, but he has grown into a ruthless finisher. He is a real roadrunner of a wing, now, always three steps ahead of whatever clunking traps Wile E Coyote has laid for him. \u201cJonny is one of the hardest working guys in our team,\u201d Jones said. He needs to be, Jones explained, because England have so much competition for places in the back three. Ashton was superb too, even if he could not catch a break.

But if May got all the glory Ashton\u2019s all-round contribution stood out too. England\u2019s back three were a class apart from France\u2019s but then Jacques Brunel had not done himself any favours when he decided to put a couple of centres, Penaud and Fickou, on the wings and a wing, Huget, at full-back.

The next 24 hours are crucial,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As jitters mount that the government might soon be inflicted with a second partial shutdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/jan/25/roger-stone-trump-russia-mueller-investigation-latest-live\">so soon</a> after the first, congressional negotiators were trying desperately to overcome two sticking points. The most divisive appeared to be Democratic demands that a cap be placed on the number of undocumented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration\">immigrants</a> held in federal detention centers.</p> <p>Democrats want to impose the limit as a way of reining in the detention and deportation activities of the federalImmigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, which has been enabled by Trump to take a more aggressive stance. \u201cThey are talking about cutting down on the number of [detention] beds which would force them to be released into the United States, it\u2019s an open border policy \u2026 that\u2019s not going to be supported by this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">administration</a>,\u201d said Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.</p> <p>Trump waded into the fray on Sunday morning with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1094631415357075461\">tweet</a> in which he said that \u201cout of the blue, [Democrats] want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!\u201d</p> <p>The other potential sticking point is the big picture issue of whether compromise can be reached on funding for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/us-mexico-border-trump-wall-dispatch\">border wall</a> or barrier. Trump instigated the first shutdown, the longest in US history, after Democrats refused to give him $5.7bn for a wall, with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, vowing to award <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-offers-1-toward-the-wall-then-changes-her-mind-1202528950/\">\u201cnot one penny\u201d</a> for a project she denounced as \u201cimmoral\u201d.</p> <p>Positions held by both main parties appeared to have softened, with negotiators reportedly coalescing around a compromise sum of about $2bn. That in turn raised another critical question: would Trump himself accept a funding amount that would be less than half his initial $5.7bn demand?</p> <p>In his Sunday morning tweet, Trump accused the Democrats of \u201coffering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall\u201d. But there are signs that he would be prepared to sign a funding bill that would keep the government open while giving him substantially less than his desired amount.</p> <p>Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that a shutdown was still \u201con the table\u201d. But he indicated that if the negotiators settled on a compromise sum the president would swallow it.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot take a shutdown off the table, you cannot take 5.7 off the table, and if you end up somewhere in the middle you will probably see the president say \u2018OK\u2019 and then go and find the rest of the money another way,\u201d Mulvaney said.</p> <p>He added that there were \u201cpots of money\u201d that Trump could dip into through his legal powers. Some of those funds, however, would only be open to him were he to declare a national <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/31/trump-border-wall-national-emergency-negotiations\">emergency</a> \u2013 an idea he continues to flirt with even though it would be highly contentious both for Democrats and increasingly for his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/11/politics/republicans-divided-trump-national-emergency/index.html\">own party</a>.</p> <p>Following a by-now familiar gameplan, Trump will take his case for a wall to his own people on Monday when he flies to El Paso, Texas, on the border with Mexico to address a rally of supporters. The event promises to be a feisty encounter \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/09/beto-orourke-join-anti-wall-march-el-paso-trump-holds-rally-it-one-mile-away/?utm_term=.0cdeb12cd6c5\">protest march</a> will pass nearby that will be joined by Beto O\u2019Rourke, the El Paso resident who came close to winning back a US Senate seat from Texas for the Democrats in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/09/beto-o-rourke-ted-cruz-texas-democrats-midterms\">November midterm elections</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bipartisan negotiators in Washington are running out of time to reach a deal over Donald Trump\u2019s demand for a border wall after talks stalled, raising the prospect of another government shutdown starting on Friday. Leaders from both main parties sitting on a 17-strong negotiating panel must reach a deal over the disputed border security issue by Monday if there is to be time for Congress to pass legislation and Trump to sign it before the latest deadline of 15 February. Should they fail to reach agreement within hours, federal agencies, already exhausted after the 35-day shutdown that ended last month having affected 800,000 federal employees, will yet again start to close from Friday at midnight. \u201cThe talks have stalled right now,\u201d Richard Shelby, Republican chairman of the senate appropriations committee, told Fox News Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can get off the dime later today or in the morning, because time\u2019s ticking away, but we\u2019ve got some problems.\u201d Shelby put the odds of a deal being reached against a second shutdown occurring at 50-50. \u201cI\u2019m not confident we\u2019re going to get there. The next 24 hours are crucial,\u201d he said. As jitters mount that the government might soon be inflicted with a second partial shutdown so soon after the first, congressional negotiators were trying desperately to overcome two sticking points. The most divisive appeared to be Democratic demands that a cap be placed on the number of undocumented immigrants held in federal detention centers. Democrats want to impose the limit as a way of reining in the detention and deportation activities of the federalImmigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, which has been enabled by Trump to take a more aggressive stance. \u201cThey are talking about cutting down on the number of [detention] beds which would force them to be released into the United States, it\u2019s an open border policy \u2026 that\u2019s not going to be supported by this administration,\u201d said Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. Trump waded into the fray on Sunday morning with a tweet in which he said that \u201cout of the blue, [Democrats] want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!\u201d The other potential sticking point is the big picture issue of whether compromise can be reached on funding for a border wall or barrier. Trump instigated the first shutdown, the longest in US history, after Democrats refused to give him $5.7bn for a wall, with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, vowing to award \u201cnot one penny\u201d for a project she denounced as \u201cimmoral\u201d. Positions held by both main parties appeared to have softened, with negotiators reportedly coalescing around a compromise sum of about $2bn. That in turn raised another critical question: would Trump himself accept a funding amount that would be less than half his initial $5.7bn demand? In his Sunday morning tweet, Trump accused the Democrats of \u201coffering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall\u201d. But there are signs that he would be prepared to sign a funding bill that would keep the government open while giving him substantially less than his desired amount. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that a shutdown was still \u201con the table\u201d. But he indicated that if the negotiators settled on a compromise sum the president would swallow it. \u201cYou cannot take a shutdown off the table, you cannot take 5.7 off the table, and if you end up somewhere in the middle you will probably see the president say \u2018OK\u2019 and then go and find the rest of the money another way,\u201d Mulvaney said. He added that there were \u201cpots of money\u201d that Trump could dip into through his legal powers. Some of those funds, however, would only be open to him were he to declare a national emergency \u2013 an idea he continues to flirt with even though it would be highly contentious both for Democrats and increasingly for his own party. Following a by-now familiar gameplan, Trump will take his case for a wall to his own people on Monday when he flies to El Paso, Texas, on the border with Mexico to address a rally of supporters. The event promises to be a feisty encounter \u2013 a protest march will pass nearby that will be joined by Beto O\u2019Rourke, the El Paso resident who came close to winning back a US Senate seat from Texas for the Democrats in the November midterm elections.",

      "bodyText": "It was so heartening to read Jonathan Freedland\u2019s vigorous call for a proactive coordinated campaign to persuade the public that Brexit has to be stopped (We can\u2019t wait for a people\u2019s vote to make the case against Brexit, 9 February). His logic is impeccable: the Labour demands for alignment with the single market, maintenance of workers\u2019 rights and direct influence on future EU trade deals are already secured by virtue of our EU membership. In my view, there is also a transcending factor. We have all benefited from being European citizens, socially, economically and politically. This concept of citizenship has directly secured the peace process in the island of Ireland. In total good faith after the British-Irish agreement of 1998, the Republic of Ireland removed its constitutional claim to the \u201csix counties\u201d. In Northern Ireland, we have struggled to maintain a power-sharing assembly with a commitment to keep channels open as good neighbours with the south and as members of the EU. It is not surprising that 56% of the Northern Irish voted in the referendum to remain in the EU. For the sake of a prosperous and peaceful future in the UK and Ireland, a second, fully informed, referendum is vital. There is no time to lose. Dr Brian Caul Coleraine, Northern Ireland \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is right, of course \u2013 the case for staying in the EU has to be based on the advantages it brings, not on \u201cproject fear\u201d. To this end, next weekend could the Guardian produce a small poster displaying some of those advantages. We could then put it in our windows and show how so many of us feel. Julia Messenger Cheltenham, Gloucestershire \u2022 Jonathan Freedland claims that Labour\u2019s demands replicate what we already have under EU membership. But Labour\u2019s demands do not include the EU \u201cbenefits\u201d of being banned from controlling immigration into Britain, or an 11-figure annual donation to subsidise roadbuilding in Greece, or the breeding of bulls to be tortured to death in bullfighting rings in Spain, or corruption in Romania. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire \u2022 Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz could conduct a naval war from Bordeaux in the early 1940s (until his U-boat pens were disabled by the Cockleshell Heroes). So natural adequate harbour capacity is not in doubt on the Garonne. Surely Bordeaux\u2019s wine shippers can find enough shipping and dock capacity within easy reach of Saint-\u00c9milion and the Haut-M\u00e9doc to get any amount of claret to the English channel ports without trudging all the way to Calais (Race to get French claret into Britain, 9 February)? Eric Potts St Albans, Hertfordshire \u2022 So Brexit government needs \u201ca horizon scanner \u2013 someone who is looking up and out into the working environment to spot early indications of approaching issues or emergencies\u201d (Civilians being hired to work in emergency command centre, 9 February). There were 750,000 of these rare individuals on the street outside the cabinet office not long ago. David Robjant Cople, Bedfordshire \u2022 The very poorest developing countries are not at risk from Brexit, even under a no-deal scenario (Brexit could put 1.7 million people around the globe into extreme poverty \u2013 study, theguardian.com, 4 February). Following a campaign by Traidcraft Exchange and others, the government committed in June 2017 to give equivalent market access to all least-developed countries, including Cambodia. Of much greater concern are those slightly less poor, but still economically vulnerable, countries that currently rely on free trade agreements with the EU for access to the UK market. They are now being pushed to sign up to new deals with the UK on worse terms. They are in effect being threatened with new high tariffs for their key exports (bananas for Ghana, grapes for Namibia, sugar for Swaziland) to get them to agree. This is wrong. The UK should offer these economically vulnerable countries unilateral market access. That way the UK can ensure millions of people in developing countries do not pay the price for a no-deal Brexit.

The country is Africa\u2019s most populous, and by some measures has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)\" title=\"\">largest economy</a> on the continent. Nigeria celebrated Mr Buhari\u2019s election in 2015 as not only a resounding rejection of the unpopular Goodluck Jonathan but also the first democratic transition since the return of civilian rule in 1999.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the highlight of Mr Buhari\u2019s presidency appears to have been the gaining of it. The <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/nigeria-s-tough-decision-former-dictator-or-alleged-kleptocrat\" title=\"\">economy struggles</a>, and his pledges to curb rampant corruption have been applied to political opponents. Insecurity remains a pressing issue: notably, Boko Haram appears to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/02/election-nigeria-boko-haram-refugees\" title=\"\">resurging</a> despite the government\u2019s repeated assurances that it has beaten the extremist group, and a spreading herder-farmer conflict has killed thousands. The president\u2019s extended absence overseas, for medical treatment, prompted such persistent rumours of his death and replacement by a body double that he felt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/nigeria-election-buhari-battles-body-double-rumours-and-economic-woe\" title=\"\">obliged</a> to tell voters: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/its-real-me-nigerian-president-denies-dying-and-being-replaced-by-clone\" title=\"\">It\u2019s the real me, I assure you</a>.\u201d</p> <p>A country with a median age of 18 faces, it would appear, an uninspiring choice between two septuagenarian political veterans. The slate of candidates is lengthy \u2013 helped by a 2018 <a href=\"https://guardian.ng/news/as-election-nears-many-young-nigerians-sceptical-of-change/\" title=\"\">reform</a> which lowered the age limit for presidential candidates to 35 from 40. But the only serious rival to Mr Buhari and his All Progressives Congress party is the business tycoon and former vice-president Atiku Abubakar of the People\u2019s Democratic party. Both men are Fulani Muslims from the north, and have chosen running mates from the south. Mr Buhari headed the military junta in the 1980s and now describes himself as a \u201cconverted democrat\u201d. But Mr Abubakar has won the backing of an influential bloc including former military heads of state. Supporters portray him as an energetic contrast to the ineffective incumbent; opponents highlight corruption allegations, including a 2010 US Senate report which <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FOREIGNCORRUPTIONREPORTFINAL710.pdf\" title=\"\">said</a> that he and one of his wives had wired $40m of \u201csuspect funds\u201d into American accounts. Mr Abubakar <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47046599?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/crx60q1k8ldt/nigerian-general-election-2019&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story\" title=\"\">denies</a> the claims.</p> <p>The concern is that this contest will not live up to 2015\u2019s standard. Suspicion has been heightened by Mr Buhari\u2019s suspension of the chief justice, who could preside in an election dispute. The judge will face <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/world/nigerias-leader-suspends-chief-justice-3-weeks-before-vote.html\" title=\"\">trial</a> on charges of failing to declare his assets \u2013 a first in the country. There are also complaints of intimidation and vote-buying on both sides. Irregularities would not have to be as blatant as in 2007 \u2013 when results were reportedly posted before polling stations opened \u2013 to provoke fury. Civic groups warn that irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric risks violence: deadly post-election unrest is a persistent problem which killed 800 in 2011. Some fear a fresh bout could trigger a wider destabilisation. State-level elections which follow could be even more critical, given the lucrative rewards of regional office.</p> <p>The perils are real if the result is close. If Mr Abubakar edges ahead, much will depend on whether Mr Buhari is as willing to go as his predecessor was, in turn influenced by the calculations of political \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47089372\" title=\"\">godfathers</a>\u201d who shifted to the challenger last time. Though diplomats are stressing the need for fair elections, there has been little pressure at higher levels. The US has been increasingly interested in counterterrorism and trade priorities, and less so in governance and democracy. The grudging <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2587564c-22fd-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf\" title=\"\">acceptance</a> of a dubious and contested election result in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has taken the sting out of international protests. The regional group Ecowas has proved to be one of the more assertive blocs in Africa, but is dominated by Nigeria.</p> <p>Yet there is hope as well as anxiety. The last election set an important precedent, and raised Nigerian voters\u2019 expectations. One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/01/nigeria-presidential-elections-hope-new-candidates\" title=\"\">columnist</a> noted that the media is \u201cseriously engaging with candidates outside the two largest political parties\u201d. In the long run, Nigerians deserve a better politics than the one revealed by this unedifying contest. For now, they deserve a fair and safe election and results that are respected by all parties. Every effort should be made to support that process, and the civil society groups which promote peace and democracy.</p>",

The judge will face trial on charges of failing to declare his assets \u2013 a first in the country. There are also complaints of intimidation and vote-buying on both sides. Irregularities would not have to be as blatant as in 2007 \u2013 when results were reportedly posted before polling stations opened \u2013 to provoke fury. Civic groups warn that irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric risks violence: deadly post-election unrest is a persistent problem which killed 800 in 2011. Some fear a fresh bout could trigger a wider destabilisation. State-level elections which follow could be even more critical, given the lucrative rewards of regional office. The perils are real if the result is close. If Mr Abubakar edges ahead, much will depend on whether Mr Buhari is as willing to go as his predecessor was, in turn influenced by the calculations of political \u201cgodfathers\u201d who shifted to the challenger last time. Though diplomats are stressing the need for fair elections, there has been little pressure at higher levels. The US has been increasingly interested in counterterrorism and trade priorities, and less so in governance and democracy. The grudging acceptance of a dubious and contested election result in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has taken the sting out of international protests. The regional group Ecowas has proved to be one of the more assertive blocs in Africa, but is dominated by Nigeria. Yet there is hope as well as anxiety. The last election set an important precedent, and raised Nigerian voters\u2019 expectations. One columnist noted that the media is \u201cseriously engaging with candidates outside the two largest political parties\u201d. In the long run, Nigerians deserve a better politics than the one revealed by this unedifying contest. For now, they deserve a fair and safe election and results that are respected by all parties. Every effort should be made to support that process, and the civil society groups which promote peace and democracy.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report: For Manchester City, it was a supreme way to round off an immaculate week. One by one they have been ticked off: first Arsenal, then Everton and, finally, a Chelsea side that looked in need of smelling salts before the match had even reached the midway stage of the first half. Three games, 11 goals, nine points, and more fool anyone who thought this might be the most difficult assignment. Much more here: And with that, I\u2019m done. It\u2019s been quite literally awesome. Bye! Pep Guardiola is chuffed. Yeah, good. Of course we were lucky that the first three times we attacked we scored two goals, but in general we make an incredible performance against a top team. On the title chase: Pressure doesn\u2019t exist. It never exists. We\u2019ll play like a team and if we win, perfect. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to try next season. It\u2019s a privilege, to be a football player or manager. They have to try their best. That is what I demand of them. So many things happen all over the world, to talk of pressure. Liverpool, Graeme Souness says, are going to have to win every single game to hold City at bay and this league. We can\u2019t get carried away, when City have lost to Newcastle, Leicester and Crystal Palace in the last couple of months, but this was a top-class, peak-level City performance. Raheem Sterling has a chat. It was a terrific performance from the team. Straight after the Everton game he was getting us ready for this game. It took a lot of preparation. It was just a win, another three points. We scored a lot of goals but the most important thing was to put in a good performance and get three points, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Sergio Aguero also speaks to Sky, but his English is still very poor and he doesn\u2019t say very much. Here\u2019s Sterling on Aguero: He\u2019s a player we depend on. Moments like the first goal, out of nothing he can put the ball in the top corner. Players like this you have to cherish them. It is 28 years since Chelsea last lost this badly: I\u2019ve just received an email from a bookmaker, headed: \u201cSARRIVEDERCI\u201d. Mike Dean hides the ball in the back of his shirt, hilariously pretending to Aguero that he has lost it before producing it in the end. The style with which he awarded City\u2019s penalty has also attracted attention: 90+4 mins: The final whistle goes, and Sarri heads straight down the tunnel. Lots of head-shakes but no handshakes for him today. 90+3 mins: Chelsea are now sixth, behind Arsenal on goals scored, having surrendered an apparently healthy goal difference advantage over the course of one afternoon. 90+1 mins: There will be about three minutes of further humiliation stoppage time. 89 mins: Sterling plays Zinchenko through, but he pulls up at the vital moment and the ball is swept away by a defender. It looks like cramp, rather than anything more troublesome. 87 mins: \u201cOf course, this doesn\u2019t bode well for Man City\u2019s chances of beating Chelsea in the final of the Carabao Cup,\u201d writes Andy Tuohy. \u201cI always think back to what happened to Liverpool in the FA Cup Semi after spanking Crystal Palace 9-0 in 1990. I think a sort of complacent hubris takes hold when a score is as convincing as this.\u201d Perhaps we\u2019ll all be calling Sarri a genius in a couple of weeks. But then, maybe we won\u2019t. 85 mins: \u201cIt must be hard for any Liverpool (and Chelsea) supporter to see City cruise to victory this easily with players like David Silva coming off the bench and Leroy Sane not even used at all,\u201d writes Konstantin Sauer. \u201cTheir squad depth is unbelievable.\u201d 82 mins: \u201cIf it stays like this, we can categorically say that City are slightly better than Bournemouth,\u201d says Matt Dony. City\u2019s next away game in the league is at Bournemouth, so we\u2019ll see precisely how much better they are then. There\u2019s a gorgeous pass here from David Silva, inside Loftus-Cheek and into the path of Zinchenko, scampering down the left flank, whose low cross is turned in by Sterling on the edge of the six-yard box! 78 mins: Emerson shoots low, under the wall but into Ederson\u2019s arms. 77 mins: Gundogan trips Loftus-Cheek, just before the Chelsea player got the chance to lose the ball on the edge of the City area. Now they have a decent shooting opportunity from the free kick. 76 mins: City make their final substitution, bringing David Silva on for Fernandinho. 75 mins: Instead they nearly concede another! City break, Sterling plays in Jesus, and just as he\u2019s about to shoot David Luiz shoves him in the back. It\u2019s cynical, it\u2019s a foul, and it should have been a penalty. Instead Kepa saves the shot and play continues. 74 mins: For a moment there it looked like Chelsea might get the ball into City\u2019s penalty area. But then they don\u2019t. 73 mins: Chelsea bring Emerson on, taking Alonso off. 71 mins: Mahrez is dispossessed on the byline and Chelsea break, move the ball to Loftus-Cheek in midfield, and his mishits a pass to Hazard out of play. Chelsea have achieved absolutely nothing for 20 minutes or so. 69 mins: Alonso earns himself a booking by steamrollering into Bernardo Silva. 69 mins: \u201cBy the time this match is over, I wonder if the massage chair-thingies in the Chelsea dressing room (see preamble photo) will have been sympathetically replaced with psychiatrist couches,\u201d writes Peter Oh. 68 mins: De Bruyne goes off now, Riyad Mahrez coming on. 67 mins: Fernandinho\u2019s long-range drive is saved by Kepa, and City finally draw level on shots, at 11-11. 66 mins: City play the ball up the right touchline, and Bernardo Silva controls it just magically. Worth the entrance fee on its own, that technique. 65 mins: City take off Aguero, as of today their all-time record league goalscorer, and bring on Jesus. Chelsea also make a change, bringing Loftus-Cheek on for Pedro. 64 mins: For the first time, this has the look of a game between a team that knows they are beaten and a team that knows they will win. 60 mins: City look ready for more. They have a three-on-two break, but Sterling\u2019s pass to Aguero on his left isn\u2019t great, and he should probably have gone to Gundogan to his right anyway. Aguero lashes a left-foot shot well wide. 59 mins: Saved! De Bruyne curls his shot past the wall but it\u2019s much too central to get past even a humbled, out-of-sorts Kepa, who pushes it away from danger. 58 mins: Aguero is fouled just outside the area, and City are surely about to have their eighth shot of the game. 57 mins: That is Aguero\u2019s 15th hat-trick for City and a record-equalling 11th in the Premier League. That\u2019s a perfect penalty, Aguero sending Kepa the wrong way and tucking the ball just inside the other post! 55 mins: Sterling runs into the area, past Azpilicueta, and both players try to get toe to ball first. Sterling toes ball, Azpilicueta toes player, and it\u2019s a penalty! 52 mins: Chelsea\u2019s first substitution sees Kovacic replace Barkley. This is the most predictable substitution in all football: the only thing Sarri enjoys more than replacing Barkley with Kovacic is replacing Kovacic with Barkley. 51 mins: Aguero heads against the bar! The corner is cleared but Walker hits a fine pass back to De Bruyne on the left. His cross is fabulous, and zings onto Aguero\u2019s head, seven yards out. 50 mins: Chelsea are bullied into giving the ball away in their own half, and Aguero picks out De Bruyne in the area, whose cross deflects behind. 47 mins: If Chelsea continue to play in this half as they did in the latter period of the first, this would be a uniquely encouraging humiliating defeat. They have so far restarted very brightly. 46 mins: They\u2019re off! After waiting a while for Kyle Walker, who ran out a couple of minutes after everybody else for some reason. The players are back out and ready for more! \u201cWhile Sarri deserves some blame for this, he\u2019s very much a modern manager in that he selects the squad to put on the field and that\u2019s about it,\u201d rages Joe Harvey. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have much if any input on transfers. Why isn\u2019t Chelsea\u2019s Director of Football/transfer committee under more fire? Who looks at this squad and decides, before the season, that a \u00a370m keeper is the answer, when two of the three players in the front line are on the wrong side of 30? Sarri\u2019s only inputs on this squad, I think, are Jorginho and Higuain (who despite my doubts looks quite good). Otherwise their recruitment isn\u2019t just poor, it\u2019s expensive and poor.\u201d 45+3 mins: A quite ludicrous half of football. City ripped through Chelsea at will in the first 25 minutes, scored four and missed a sitter. Chelsea attacked well in the final 22 minutes, created little and scored nothing. 45+1 mins: De Bruyne curls the ball into the penalty area from a free-kick on the right, but Aguero mistimes his diving header and gets nothing on it. And was offside. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there will be about two minutes. 42 mins: Chelsea continue to attack, and have been excellent in the second half(ish) of this first half. Sadly they conceded four times in the first half(ish), but still. 40 mins: De Bruyne puts his team in trouble with a hopeless pass infield, straight to a dark blue shirt, though City have enough players back to cope with Chelsea\u2019s ensuing attack. 38 mins: That, though, is a very fine shot from Higuain, who chests the ball into the air and then volleys from just outside the area. The ball was dipping towards goal until Ederson tipped it over the bar! 36 mins: Though to be fair Chelsea have had more shots so far. City have only had five: the four goals and Aguero\u2019s ridiculous miss. Chelsea have had seven, most of them blasted by Higuain straight into the nearest defender. 34 mins: Azpilicueta\u2019s low cross is cleared just before Alonso gets to it. The fact that both full-backs were in the final 20 yards of the pitch there illustrates Chelsea\u2019s attacking approach to this game, which has of course been woefully unsuccessful. 32 mins: \u201cDo you reckon David Luiz has got deja vu?\u201d writes JR. \u201cWhat an entertainer. Is it wrong that I am hoping he will begin weeping on the pitch before the half is over?\u201d A little mean, perhaps, but understandable. 30 mins: Chelsea attack again, Higuain\u2019s shot from Alonso\u2019s cross being deflected behind for a corner. 29 mins: Pedro has another shot, and Ederson makes another save. This one was much easier, though, the Spaniard\u2019s low shot from 15 yards going straight to him. 28 mins: A great chance for Chelsea, but Ederson saves! Higuain has the ball on the edge of the area, cutely backheels into Pedro\u2019s path and he shoots at the rapidly-advancing keeper! 27 mins: Three more goals and Chelsea would drop behind Arsenal in the league on goal difference. This is a horror show. Kepa should perhaps have done a bit better having got a good hand to Gundogan\u2019s shot from the edge of the area, but his wrist, like most of Chelsea\u2019s team, is just a bit flimsy. 21 mins: Chelsea have a shot! The ball falls to Barkley at the edge of the area, and he curls his effort well over the bar. This one comes gift-wrapped by the Chelsea defence! The ball is lifted into the area, headed away by David Luiz, incomprehensibly headed right back into the danger area by Barkley and half-volleyed in by Aguero, on the edge of the six-yard box. 17 mins: Hazard nicely dummies the ball to let it run to Alonso on the left, who expects the Belgian to keep running. He doesn\u2019t, so Alonso\u2019s pass runs straight out of play. He misses from two yards, and then scores from 25! Zinchenko breaks down the left, cuts inside, gets a couple of lucky bounces off Chelsea shins and eventually works the ball to Aguero, who curls a delicious shot into the far, top corner! 12 mins: David Luiz\u2019s excellent pass through midfield finds Hazard, who spins and sets off towards goal. He gets into the area but is then forced wide, and when he shoots he\u2019s off balance and hits a weak effort that\u2019s easily stopped. 8 mins: What a miss by Aguero! Incredible! De Bruyne\u2019s pull-back to Bernardo Silva is a bit behind the Portuguese player, who would have had an easy chance of his own had the pass been more accurate, but instead he controls, dances away from goal, keeps running, turns, heads to the byline and sends in a low cross, which finds Aguero just beyond the far post, with an open goal to aim at ... and he misses it! 7 mins: Chelsea have approached the game very ambitiously, trying to attack City, pressing them deep in the home side\u2019s half. Which is fine, except when they then completely fail to close them down in their own penalty area. Chelsea fall into a deep sleep as De Bruyne prepares for a free-kick, allowing the Belgian to pass to an untracked Bernardo Silva on the right, and he has time to get into the penalty area, measure his pass, and slide the ball across goal. He was probably aiming for Aguero but it breaks to Sterling at the far post, and he slams it into the net! 3 mins: Then the ball is lifted over the City defence, Higuain runs through unmarked, and is a foot or two short of reaching it. 2 mins: Hazard gets down the left nicely and slides the ball inside to Higuain, but his shot is blocked and when it is eventually returned to him, another shot is also blocked. \u201c\u2019Shower Slides\u2019, Simon, \u2018Shower Slides\u2019?\u201d boggles George Peel. \u201cIs that Metropolitan-speak for flip-flops?\u201d I think they\u2019re quite different to flip-flops, lacking the toe-dividing thong-type device, but I don\u2019t really know what the right name for them is. 1 min: They\u2019re off! Sergio Aguero gets the game started. Ready for action. Deep breath ... Sky inform us that Callum Hudson-Odoi was in the squad that travelled to Manchester, so his absence is simply down to Sarri not really fancying him. City\u2019s players eventually arrive, and out they come! The players are in the tunnel! Well, Chelsea\u2019s players are. A bit of managerial chatter. Firstly here\u2019s Pep Guardiola on approaching this game like a cup final: So the last part of the season, 11, 12 games to play. It\u2019s important against contenders at home especially to be solid as we have been these last two seasons and try to win. Against Chelsea, Arsenal, United, big teams, it\u2019s always a final. If you don\u2019t play these kind of games feeling like a final it\u2019s more complicated. And here\u2019s Maurizio Sarri on Chelsea\u2019s win over City in December: We defended very well. We played a very good match. But I have to say that we were lucky when we scored the first goal because we scored in a very difficult moment of the match for us. \u201cBit of a shame not to see Hudson-Odoi in Chelsea\u2019s squad today,\u201d says Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed watching him when he\u2019s been given a chance; he\u2019s got great skills, a lot of pace, and is attack-minded, all of which are things that Chelsea fans rightly crave. Kind of a surprise that Sarri doesn\u2019t seem to rate him, as he seems a natural fit. Do you know if he\u2019s injured, or just not fancied today?\u201d He has apparently been suffering from an unspecified illness this week, which would explain his absence (or handily deliver Sarri an excuse not to use him, depending). Here\u2019s a glimpse inside Chelsea\u2019s dressing room, featuring some very neat shower slides. Oleksandr Zinchenko is the unexpected name in the City line-up. He makes his fourth Premier League start of the season, but by some margin the most consequential (the others were against Brighton (h), Bournemouth (h) and Southampton (a)). His last league minutes came at the end of December, but he played both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Burton last month. The team sheets are in, and these were the names upon them: Man City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Laporte, Zinchenko, Gundogan, Fernandinho, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Danilo, Sane, Silva, Mahrez, Otamendi, Gabriel Jesus, Muric. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, Azpilicueta, Rudiger, Luiz, Alonso, Kante, Jorginho, Barkley, Pedro, Higuain, Hazard. Subs: Loftus-Cheek, Caballero, Kovacic, Giroud, Willian, Christensen, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Mike Dean. Hello world! So who, then, are Chelsea? Are they the team that triumphed 5-0 against Huddersfield in their last league game, or the one that crashed 4-0 at Bournemouth in the one before that? Are they the side that folded 2-0 at Arsenal in their last top-flight meeting with another member of the established top six, or the one that beat City 2-0 in the one before that? Can they, in short, provide another twist to the developing title-chase spaghetti-tangle? With another meeting with these opponents to follow in the Carabao Cup final later this month, will they be unusually motivated by a desire to prove their collective mettle and win their individual places for that match, or will that looming Wembley date or some kind of general ennui fatally distract them? City? Well, we know about them. \u201cIt\u2019s a final for us,\u201d says Pep Guardiola. \u201cWe have to play in that way.\u201d Today\u2019s match against Chelsea might in fact be, psychologically, more of a final than the one that will actually be a final. This is confusing. Over the next few hours City could return to the top of the table, Liverpool will once again find themselves with a game in hand, and Chelsea will answer several questions, one way or the other. Welcome!",

      "body": "<p>Audiences may come to this film expecting the conventional pleasures of a spy thriller \u2013 excitement, tension, suspense \u2013 along with the additional values associated with the very best of the genre: character nuance, emotional complexity, plausible human dilemma. The Operative utterly defeats all of these hopes, chiefly in being at all times extremely boring.</p> <p>The director is Israeli film-maker Yuval Adler, whose drama Bethlehem played in Berlin six years ago. He here presides over a stolid pace and frowningly concentrated line readings. But there is bafflingly little that\u2019s exciting or even all that interesting in the story being told, and the performances themselves are opaque and disengaged.</p> <p>Martin Freeman plays Thomas, a British Jewish man in Germany running a section of the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad. He has recruited a new operative, played by Diane Kruger with her usual crisp fluency in German and French, who is very suitable for the job because of her rootlessless \u2013 detached from her family, no romantic ties, no close friends. He gets her into Teheran as a teacher of English, despite the fact that she has no Farsi. (Wait - wouldn\u2019t a fake or indeed a real EFL teacher speak the local language? Wouldn\u2019t that draw attention?)</p> <p>Her task is to make contact with a local manager of an electronics firm, supplying hi-tech equipment to the Iranian military.

      "bodyText": "Audiences may come to this film expecting the conventional pleasures of a spy thriller \u2013 excitement, tension, suspense \u2013 along with the additional values associated with the very best of the genre: character nuance, emotional complexity, plausible human dilemma. The Operative utterly defeats all of these hopes, chiefly in being at all times extremely boring. The director is Israeli film-maker Yuval Adler, whose drama Bethlehem played in Berlin six years ago. He here presides over a stolid pace and frowningly concentrated line readings. But there is bafflingly little that\u2019s exciting or even all that interesting in the story being told, and the performances themselves are opaque and disengaged. Martin Freeman plays Thomas, a British Jewish man in Germany running a section of the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad. He has recruited a new operative, played by Diane Kruger with her usual crisp fluency in German and French, who is very suitable for the job because of her rootlessless \u2013 detached from her family, no romantic ties, no close friends. He gets her into Teheran as a teacher of English, despite the fact that she has no Farsi. (Wait - wouldn\u2019t a fake or indeed a real EFL teacher speak the local language? Wouldn\u2019t that draw attention?) Her task is to make contact with a local manager of an electronics firm, supplying hi-tech equipment to the Iranian military. Her job will be to assist in ensuring that this equipment is sabotaged or bugged. She is supposed merely to teach him English, but winds up having an affair with her victim in a way that her Mossad handlers did not expect; her intimacy is very important in the operative gaining access to this man\u2019s electronics firm. And what was supposed to happen if she didn\u2019t succeed in seducing him, or even inducing him to take English lessons? And then, while this situation continues, somehow dull and melodramatic simultaneously. she has to pose as someone else \u2013 a completely different cover identity! \u2013 a bogus archaeologist, driving specially sabotaged/bugged equipment over the border into Iran from Turkey, a chaotic yet anti-climactic episode which results in her being sexually molested. Eventually all this is to lead to a confrontation between Kruger\u2019s character and her employers \u2013 but this too is a dramatic non-event. The performances of Kruger and Freeman are very uncertain and unconvincing; this becomes even more of a problem because we are supposed to believe in some sort of friendship between them, or even more than friendship. The drama itself is revealed in flashback, as Thomas is himself debriefed by his own handlers, but this does not give any perspective on the story, or breathe any life into it. As for Kruger\u2019s spy, the only other person of great importance to her is supposedly her father \u2013 but exasperatingly, this relationship remains off camera.

City, to put it into context, have now scored twice or more in every Premier League home match this season, a feat no top-division team has managed in 15 successive games since Tottenham Hotspur from March to December 1965, with Bill Nicholson in the dugout and Jimmy Greaves terrorising opposition defences. Including the cup competitions the reigning champions have accumulated 33 goals from their last six home games. It feels like a statistic from another time, a sepia-tinted era of baggy shorts and boggy pitches.</p> \n<p>For Ag\u00fcero it was his 15th hat-trick in City\u2019s colours and perhaps it would be impertinent to dwell too long on the moment, at 1-0, when he also produced possibly the worst miss of all his years in English football. Two yards out, Ag\u00fcero might argue one would have to go back in time even further to find similar. No matter: his first goal came five minutes later and perhaps there was a measure of anger contained in his firecracker of a shot, 25 yards out, into the top corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s net. Missing a sitter, scoring a screamer \u2013 who cares if it was unorthodox when Ag\u00fcero has 25 goals in his last 16 starts for City at this ground?</p> \n<p>By the time Pep Guardiola\u2019s team were done they had moved back above Liverpool to the top of the table, albeit having played a game more, and it did not seem unreasonable to wonder whether this result might seriously endanger Maurizio\u2019s Sarri\u2019s position as Chelsea manager. Put it this way: Roman Abramovich has sacked good men for considerably less.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This was their fourth successive away defeat in all competitions and everyone connected with Chelsea, not just Abramovich, must be alarmed by their deterioration, particularly having just been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/30/bournemouth-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">whacked 4-0 at Bournemouth</a>. The final goal means Chelsea drop below Arsenal to sixth place on goals scored. Yes, there is the Carabao Cup final to come on 24 February and a chance to decorate an increasingly problematic season with some silverware. Just do not bet your mortgage on it: the opposition at Wembley will be \u2026 Manchester City. Maybe Guardiola will start David Silva next time, too.</p> \n<p>Chelsea have not managed an away goal since 30 December but their problems here owed more to chaotic defending and a collective meltdown after it all began, four minutes in, with Kevin De Bruyne slipping a free-kick behind the opposition defence to find Bernardo Silva completely free. Silva jinked into the penalty area and his low cross flicked off David Luiz to roll invitingly into Raheem Sterling\u2019s path. Sterling found a gap between Arrizabalaga and the goalkeeper\u2019s right-hand post and, after that, it was startling to see Chelsea\u2019s capitulation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f83c1b5b-00fd-449f-8b68-f04dfd8ad8db\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c1383Ay_Wj4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If nothing else, at least there were some encouraging signs for Sarri that Gonzalo Higua\u00edn can flourish as the new arrowhead to Chelsea\u2019s attack. No team, however, can expect to get away with defending as abjectly as Chelsea did during the period in the first half when most of the damage was inflicted. Chelsea conceded a goal on average every five minutes and, though an argument could be made that City pressured them into mistakes, that was not always the case.</p> \n<p>Ag\u00fcero\u2019s second goal was a case in point, originating from Ross Barkley trying to head the ball to his goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. It is an old Paul Gascoigne trick and, if it comes off, with so many opponents in close proximity, it looks good. If it does not, it can make the player who tried it look foolish in the extreme. Barkley got it horribly wrong and Ag\u00fcero pounced to get in front of Arrizabalaga and score with a swivelling left-footed shot.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec415144-8a01-4474-89ef-b2c4da369a72\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Manchester City (86 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>24 Apr </b>Man Utd (a)<br><b>28 Apr&nbsp;</b>Burnley (a)<br><b>4 May&nbsp;</b>Leicester (h)<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Brighton (a)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Liverpool (85 points)</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>21 Apr&nbsp;</b>Cardiff (a)&nbsp;<br><b>26 Apr&nbsp;</b>Huddersfield (h)<br><b>5 May&nbsp;</b>Newcastle (a)&nbsp;<br><b>12 May&nbsp;</b>Wolves (h)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If Chelsea had been fully prepared, they should not have been taken aback by the early onslaught. City have now scored 15 times in the opening 15-minute periods of their league matches this season and the next most impressive figure belongs to Arsenal, with seven. It was 3-0 after 19 minutes and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, a player who deserves far more acclaim than he actually receives, swiftly made it four, catching out Arrizabalaga with a 20-yard effort into the bottom corner.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/10/maurizio-sarri-concern-chelsea-manchester-city-future\">Maurizio Sarri admits concern over Chelsea but sidesteps query on future</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ag\u00fcero completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot 11 minutes into the second half, after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s foul on the elusive and merciless Sterling, and City\u2019s record scorer also headed one of De Bruyne\u2019s beautifully delivered crosses against the crossbar before making way for Gabriel Jesus.</p> \n<p>Oleksandr Zinchenko, drafted into City\u2019s defence and outstanding throughout, supplied the cross for Sterling to finish the scoring. It was the heaviest defeat Chelsea have suffered in the Abramovich era \u2013 the heaviest, indeed, since losing 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in 1991, back in the days of Gordon Durie, Kerry Dixon and Tony Dorigo \u2013 and, when Sarri went straight down the tunnel at the end without shaking Guardiola\u2019s hand, perhaps, to give him the benefit of the doubt, it was not a deliberate snub on the part of Chelsea\u2019s manager. His mind might have been filled by thoughts of what this defeat means for his job prospects.</p>",

City, to put it into context, have now scored twice or more in every Premier League home match this season, a feat no top-division team has managed in 15 successive games since Tottenham Hotspur from March to December 1965, with Bill Nicholson in the dugout and Jimmy Greaves terrorising opposition defences. Including the cup competitions the reigning champions have accumulated 33 goals from their last six home games. It feels like a statistic from another time, a sepia-tinted era of baggy shorts and boggy pitches. For Ag\u00fcero it was his 15th hat-trick in City\u2019s colours and perhaps it would be impertinent to dwell too long on the moment, at 1-0, when he also produced possibly the worst miss of all his years in English football. Two yards out, Ag\u00fcero might argue one would have to go back in time even further to find similar. No matter: his first goal came five minutes later and perhaps there was a measure of anger contained in his firecracker of a shot, 25 yards out, into the top corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s net. Missing a sitter, scoring a screamer \u2013 who cares if it was unorthodox when Ag\u00fcero has 25 goals in his last 16 starts for City at this ground? By the time Pep Guardiola\u2019s team were done they had moved back above Liverpool to the top of the table, albeit having played a game more, and it did not seem unreasonable to wonder whether this result might seriously endanger Maurizio\u2019s Sarri\u2019s position as Chelsea manager. Put it this way: Roman Abramovich has sacked good men for considerably less. This was their fourth successive away defeat in all competitions and everyone connected with Chelsea, not just Abramovich, must be alarmed by their deterioration, particularly having just been whacked 4-0 at Bournemouth. The final goal means Chelsea drop below Arsenal to sixth place on goals scored. Yes, there is the Carabao Cup final to come on 24 February and a chance to decorate an increasingly problematic season with some silverware. Just do not bet your mortgage on it: the opposition at Wembley will be \u2026 Manchester City. Maybe Guardiola will start David Silva next time, too. Chelsea have not managed an away goal since 30 December but their problems here owed more to chaotic defending and a collective meltdown after it all began, four minutes in, with Kevin De Bruyne slipping a free-kick behind the opposition defence to find Bernardo Silva completely free. Silva jinked into the penalty area and his low cross flicked off David Luiz to roll invitingly into Raheem Sterling\u2019s path. Sterling found a gap between Arrizabalaga and the goalkeeper\u2019s right-hand post and, after that, it was startling to see Chelsea\u2019s capitulation. If nothing else, at least there were some encouraging signs for Sarri that Gonzalo Higua\u00edn can flourish as the new arrowhead to Chelsea\u2019s attack. No team, however, can expect to get away with defending as abjectly as Chelsea did during the period in the first half when most of the damage was inflicted. Chelsea conceded a goal on average every five minutes and, though an argument could be made that City pressured them into mistakes, that was not always the case. Ag\u00fcero\u2019s second goal was a case in point, originating from Ross Barkley trying to head the ball to his goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. It is an old Paul Gascoigne trick and, if it comes off, with so many opponents in close proximity, it looks good. If it does not, it can make the player who tried it look foolish in the extreme. Barkley got it horribly wrong and Ag\u00fcero pounced to get in front of Arrizabalaga and score with a swivelling left-footed shot. If Chelsea had been fully prepared, they should not have been taken aback by the early onslaught. City have now scored 15 times in the opening 15-minute periods of their league matches this season and the next most impressive figure belongs to Arsenal, with seven. It was 3-0 after 19 minutes and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, a player who deserves far more acclaim than he actually receives, swiftly made it four, catching out Arrizabalaga with a 20-yard effort into the bottom corner. Ag\u00fcero completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot 11 minutes into the second half, after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s foul on the elusive and merciless Sterling, and City\u2019s record scorer also headed one of De Bruyne\u2019s beautifully delivered crosses against the crossbar before making way for Gabriel Jesus. Oleksandr Zinchenko, drafted into City\u2019s defence and outstanding throughout, supplied the cross for Sterling to finish the scoring. It was the heaviest defeat Chelsea have suffered in the Abramovich era \u2013 the heaviest, indeed, since losing 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in 1991, back in the days of Gordon Durie, Kerry Dixon and Tony Dorigo \u2013 and, when Sarri went straight down the tunnel at the end without shaking Guardiola\u2019s hand, perhaps, to give him the benefit of the doubt, it was not a deliberate snub on the part of Chelsea\u2019s manager. His mind might have been filled by thoughts of what this defeat means for his job prospects.",

Urbanisation and climate change are also significant factors.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf insect species losses cannot be halted, this will have catastrophic consequences for both the planet\u2019s ecosystems and for the survival of mankind,\u201d said Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Bayo, at the University of Sydney, Australia, who wrote the review with Kris Wyckhuys at the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.</p> \n<p>The 2.5% rate of annual loss over the last 25-30 years is \u201cshocking\u201d, S\u00e1nchez-Bayo told the Guardian: \u201cIt is very rapid. In 10 years you will have a quarter less, in 50 years only half left and in 100 years you will have none.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the biggest impacts of insect loss is on the many birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish that eat insects. \u201cIf this food source is taken away, all these animals starve to death,\u201d he said. Such cascading effects have already been seen in Puerto Rico, where a recent study revealed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/insect-collapse-we-are-destroying-our-life-support-systems\">98% fall in ground insects over 35 years</a>.</p> \n<p>The new analysis selected the 73 best studies done to date to assess the insect decline. Butterflies and moths are among the worst hit. For example, the number of widespread <a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/1402/\">butterfly species fell by 58% on farmed land</a> in England between 2000 and 2009. The UK has suffered the biggest recorded insect falls overall, though that is probably a result of being more intensely studied than most places.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b534077dca868f430ef6874d1ef170ec721293c0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b534077dca868f430ef6874d1ef170ec721293c0/0_0_2945_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surveying butterflies in Maine, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surveying butterflies in Maine, US.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Patrick Ouellette/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bees have also been seriously affected, with only <a href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-the-kansas-entomological-society/volume-88/issue-4/0022-8567-88.4.418/Bumble-Bees-Hymenoptera--Apidae-of-Oklahoma--Past-and/10.2317/0022-8567-88.4.418.short\">half of the bumblebee species found in Oklahoma</a> in the US in 1949 being present in 2013.

But there are also big gaps in knowledge, with very little known about many flies, ants, aphids, shield bugs and crickets.

It is increasingly obvious that the planet\u2019s ecology is breaking and there is a need for an intense and global effort to halt and reverse these dreadful trends.\u201d In his opinion, the review slightly overemphasises the role of pesticides and underplays global warming, though other unstudied factors such as light pollution might prove to be significant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d98ccdeee779ddc02db3acacae4976376d1a485\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d98ccdeee779ddc02db3acacae4976376d1a485/0_0_5976_3984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers look for the wormwood moonshiner beetle in Suffolk, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers look for the wormwood moonshiner beetle in Suffolk, UK.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Paul Ehrlich, at Stanford Universityin the US, has seen insects vanish first-hand, through his work on checkerspot butterflies on Stanford\u2019s Jasper Ridge reserve.

Urbanisation and climate change are also significant factors. \u201cIf insect species losses cannot be halted, this will have catastrophic consequences for both the planet\u2019s ecosystems and for the survival of mankind,\u201d said Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Bayo, at the University of Sydney, Australia, who wrote the review with Kris Wyckhuys at the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. The 2.5% rate of annual loss over the last 25-30 years is \u201cshocking\u201d, S\u00e1nchez-Bayo told the Guardian: \u201cIt is very rapid. In 10 years you will have a quarter less, in 50 years only half left and in 100 years you will have none.\u201d One of the biggest impacts of insect loss is on the many birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish that eat insects. \u201cIf this food source is taken away, all these animals starve to death,\u201d he said. Such cascading effects have already been seen in Puerto Rico, where a recent study revealed a 98% fall in ground insects over 35 years. The new analysis selected the 73 best studies done to date to assess the insect decline. Butterflies and moths are among the worst hit. For example, the number of widespread butterfly species fell by 58% on farmed land in England between 2000 and 2009. The UK has suffered the biggest recorded insect falls overall, though that is probably a result of being more intensely studied than most places. Bees have also been seriously affected, with only half of the bumblebee species found in Oklahoma in the US in 1949 being present in 2013. The number of honeybee colonies in the US was 6 million in 1947, but 3.5 million have been lost since. There are more than 350,000 species of beetle and many are thought to have declined, especially dung beetles. But there are also big gaps in knowledge, with very little known about many flies, ants, aphids, shield bugs and crickets. Experts say there is no reason to think they are faring any better than the studied species. A small number of adaptable species are increasing in number, but not nearly enough to outweigh the big losses. \u201cThere are always some species that take advantage of vacuum left by the extinction of other species,\u201d said Sanchez-Bayo. In the US, the common eastern bumblebee is increasing due to its tolerance of pesticides. Most of the studies analysed were done in western Europe and the US, with a few ranging from Australia to China and Brazil to South Africa, but very few exist elsewhere. \u201cThe main cause of the decline is agricultural intensification,\u201d S\u00e1nchez-Bayo said. \u201cThat means the elimination of all trees and shrubs that normally surround the fields, so there are plain, bare fields that are treated with synthetic fertilisers and pesticides.\u201d He said the demise of insects appears to have started at the dawn of the 20th century, accelerated during the 1950s and 1960s and reached \u201calarming proportions\u201d over the last two decades. He thinks new classes of insecticides introduced in the last 20 years, including neonicotinoids and fipronil, have been particularly damaging as they are used routinely and persist in the environment: \u201cThey sterilise the soil, killing all the grubs.\u201d This has effects even in nature reserves nearby; the 75% insect losses recorded in Germany were in protected areas. The world must change the way it produces food, S\u00e1nchez-Bayo said, noting that organic farms had more insects and that occasional pesticide use in the past did not cause the level of decline seen in recent decades. \u201cIndustrial-scale, intensive agriculture is the one that is killing the ecosystems,\u201d he said. In the tropics, where industrial agriculture is often not yet present, the rising temperatures due to climate change are thought to be a significant factor in the decline. The species there have adapted to very stable conditions and have little ability to change, as seen in Puerto Rico. S\u00e1nchez-Bayo said the unusually strong language used in the review was not alarmist. \u201cWe wanted to really wake people up\u201d and the reviewers and editor agreed, he said. \u201cWhen you consider 80% of biomass of insects has disappeared in 25-30 years, it is a big concern.\u201d Other scientists agree that it is becoming clear that insect losses are now a serious global problem. \u201cThe evidence all points in the same direction,\u201d said Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex in the UK. \u201cIt should be of huge concern to all of us, for insects are at the heart of every food web, they pollinate the large majority of plant species, keep the soil healthy, recycle nutrients, control pests, and much more. Love them or loathe them, we humans cannot survive without insects.\u201d Matt Shardlow, at the conservation charity Buglife, said: \u201cIt is gravely sobering to see this collation of evidence that demonstrates the pitiful state of the world\u2019s insect populations. It is increasingly obvious that the planet\u2019s ecology is breaking and there is a need for an intense and global effort to halt and reverse these dreadful trends.\u201d In his opinion, the review slightly overemphasises the role of pesticides and underplays global warming, though other unstudied factors such as light pollution might prove to be significant. Prof Paul Ehrlich, at Stanford Universityin the US, has seen insects vanish first-hand, through his work on checkerspot butterflies on Stanford\u2019s Jasper Ridge reserve. He first studied them in 1960 but they had all gone by 2000, largely due to climate change. Ehrlich praised the review, saying: \u201cIt is extraordinary to have gone through all those studies and analysed them as well as they have.\u201d He said the particularly large declines in aquatic insects were striking. \u201cBut they don\u2019t mention that it is human overpopulation and overconsumption that is driving all the things [eradicating insects], including climate change,\u201d he said. S\u00e1nchez-Bayo said he had recently witnessed an insect crash himself. A recent family holiday involved a 400-mile (700km) drive across rural Australia, but he had not once had to clean the windscreen, he said. \u201cYears ago you had to do this constantly.\u201d",

Valentine\u2019s Song is a catchy R&amp;B ballad from Halsey, Bryant and McKinnon, in which their trio of lascivious songstresses find their amorous holiday expectations (\u201csex, romance and sexy romance!\u201d) thwarted by the interruption of their family members and co-workers. The song gives Halsey a chance to shine, but it\u2019s Thompson, guesting on the hook as a honey-voiced crooner in the 90s mold, who walks away with it. Women of Congress is a Charlie\u2019s Angels-style action show starring Nancy \u201cMadame Clapback\u201d Pelosi, Alexandria \u201cI Say What I Meme\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, Maxine \u201cDon\u2019t Go Chasing\u201d Waters, Kyrsten \u201cKooky Arizona Lady\u201d Sinema, Ilhan \u201cGet the Hi-Job Done\u201d Omar, Annie \u201cRaise the Roof\u201d Kuster, Abigail \u201cSay My Name, Say My Name\u201d Spanberger, and Rashida \u201cImpeach the Motherf***er\u201d Tlaib. Alec Baldwin makes a brief \u2013 and entirely vocal \u2013 cameo as Trump. There\u2019s no real point to it! . Halsey performs her ballad, Without Me. Weekend Update opens with Michael Che holding court on the myriad racial controversies that erupted over the past week \u2013 the Virginia Democrats blackface scandal, Liam Neeson\u2019s past attempt at racist vigilantism, the deportation of British rapper 21 Savage (\u201c21 actually had to leave the UK as a kid, probably because crazy-ass Liam Neeson was looking for black dudes with a baseball bat.\u201d), and the Gucci \u201cSambo\u201d sweater. Melissa Villasenor, dressed like Lady Gaga, joins the Update desk, ostensibly to discuss her picks for the upcoming Grammy Awards. Instead, she uses her time to belt out Gaga\u2019s hit song Shallow (she\u2019s briefly joined by Mooney, in costume as Bradley Cooper\u2019s character from A Star is Born), which she knocks out of the park (per Che: \u201cThat was amazing \u2026 I\u2019m supposed to tell a joke after that?\u201d). In honor of Valentine\u2019s Day, the anchors welcome a trio of dating experts who turn out to be narcissistic monsters. First, they\u2019re joined by Nicos Slobkin (Day) and Brie Bacardi (Heidi Gardner), a toxically codependent \u201cInstagram couple\u201d who find themselves constantly on the verge of violent breakup, and later by Guy Who Just Bought a Boat, a yuppie d-bag \u201chere to teach you how to score some \u2019giney whilst keeping your tiny hiney on this side of the line-y\u201d. Another musical sketch, Sorority Scavenger Hunt stars Halsey, Villasenor and Cecily Strong as members of a sorority who assault the patrons of a karaoke bar in-between their rendition of 4 Non-Blondes What\u2019s Up. The premise promises ratcheting insanity, but it peters out quickly. Black History Presentation is a sincere tribute from the black members of the current cast to those that came before them, until they are hilariously interrupted by a clueless Kyle Mooney. In a unique (and instantly memorable) performance, Halsey sings the song Eastside while simultaneously painting a self-portrait on giant canvas below her \u2013 upside down no less! \u201cMaurice\u201d features Thompson as a buttoned-up husband and father who nonchalantly reveals to his family that he\u2019s become a successful model on a gay cam site. Thompson and Halsey (playing his son\u2019s curious and non-judgmental girlfriend) show off an especially easy rapport \u2013 the episode should have teamed them up a few more times. The final sketch of the night, Riverdale, finds the production of the popular teen series interrupted by a would-be method actor (Pete Davidson) tasked with playing a corpse. Davidson manages to actually lose himself in the character for a change (his over-the-top British accent isn\u2019t too shabby either). Overall, a solid episode, with Halsey a natural performer.",

Once again there was no stopping Eddie Jones\u2019s rampant team from securing a convincing bonus-point victory, an outcome that sets up a tasty Six Nations grand slam eliminator with a similarly unbeaten Wales in Cardiff on Saturday week.</p> <p>English optimism has a long history of dissolving across the Severn Bridge but a serious Wales performance will be required to diminish England\u2019s current confidence levels. The same collective pace, power and intent they showed in Ireland was evident on a blustery, occasionally damp afternoon, with Jonny May the main beneficiary. The Leicester wing\u2019s hat-trick of tries in the opening 29 minutes made him the first Englishman to achieve the feat against France since Jake Jacob in 1924.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/10/england-owen-farrell-enforcers-steamroller-france-six-nations-rugby-union\">England\u2019s Owen Farrell and his gang of enforcers steamroller France | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The home team were superior in all departments, kicking cleverly, hitting hard and finding acres of space in behind a slow-witted defence. \u201cVery painful,\u201d was the verdict of the French captain, Guilhem Guirado, and, from a Gallic perspective, he was not wrong. This was France's worst defeat to England since 1911. Jones was careful not to go overboard, clearly determined to keep his players\u2019 feet on the ground, but similarities with the plodding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/10/france-england-six-nations-match-report\" title=\"\">England team beaten 22-16 in Paris a year ago </a>are increasingly hard to find.</p> <p>Few players in world rugby are more improved than May, with Elliot Daly also enjoying a productive afternoon and Courtney Lawes further underlining the strength in depth at Jones\u2019s disposal. If there was a nagging sense that New Zealand, for example, might have stuck 50 or 60 points on their opponents, the fact England still have obvious room for improvement will concern all their rivals.</p> <p>The galloping advances the team are making under the leadership of Owen Farrell, who scored 17 points, including his side\u2019s sixth and final try, have not been so thrillingly obvious since England\u2019s heyday in the early 2000s, not least in 2001 when they went to Cardiff and won 44-15. No one would be silly enough to predict a similarly one-sided contest this time but even a scrappy away win would leave Italy and Scotland standing between a second grand slam in four years under Jones.</p> <p>The most immediate priority for their opponents will be to end England\u2019s remarkable record of early tries, which has now seen them score within three minutes of kick-off in their past five Tests. Inside 66 seconds May had his first try on the board, touching down Daly\u2019s intelligent left\u2011foot grubber after the Saracens-bound full-back had made swift ground following a midfield turnover.</p> <p>Almost every day is currently a May Day at Twickenham and before the half-hour mark the 28-year-old had extended his tally to 12 tries in his last 12 Tests. First, he showed dazzling footwork to outwit Damian Penaud to score in the left corner before successfully scooping up Chris Ashton\u2019s chip ahead to complete his hat-trick. May possesses a unique talent, but even the quicksilver ex-Wales wing Shane Williams would have been proud of this particular treble.</p> <p>Penaud did make slight amends with a 35th-minute try set up by Yoann Huget but when the classy Henry Slade dummied his way past Guirado to claim his side\u2019s bonus-point try just before half-time the game was effectively over. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/france-wales-six-nations-2019-match-report\" title=\"\">France squandered a 16-0 point half-time lead against Wales </a>in Paris, England were never going to surrender their 30-8 interval advantage here.</p> <p>A penalty try and a yellow card for Ga\u00ebl Fickou when a sprinting Ashton was tackled without the ball with the line beckoning merely added to French woe and the last half-hour was largely a question of how much damage England would ultimately inflict.

      "bodyText": "Those wanting to know if England\u2019s opening win in Dublin was a one-off now have their answer. Once again there was no stopping Eddie Jones\u2019s rampant team from securing a convincing bonus-point victory, an outcome that sets up a tasty Six Nations grand slam eliminator with a similarly unbeaten Wales in Cardiff on Saturday week. English optimism has a long history of dissolving across the Severn Bridge but a serious Wales performance will be required to diminish England\u2019s current confidence levels. The same collective pace, power and intent they showed in Ireland was evident on a blustery, occasionally damp afternoon, with Jonny May the main beneficiary. The Leicester wing\u2019s hat-trick of tries in the opening 29 minutes made him the first Englishman to achieve the feat against France since Jake Jacob in 1924. The home team were superior in all departments, kicking cleverly, hitting hard and finding acres of space in behind a slow-witted defence. \u201cVery painful,\u201d was the verdict of the French captain, Guilhem Guirado, and, from a Gallic perspective, he was not wrong. This was France's worst defeat to England since 1911. Jones was careful not to go overboard, clearly determined to keep his players\u2019 feet on the ground, but similarities with the plodding England team beaten 22-16 in Paris a year ago are increasingly hard to find. Few players in world rugby are more improved than May, with Elliot Daly also enjoying a productive afternoon and Courtney Lawes further underlining the strength in depth at Jones\u2019s disposal. If there was a nagging sense that New Zealand, for example, might have stuck 50 or 60 points on their opponents, the fact England still have obvious room for improvement will concern all their rivals. The galloping advances the team are making under the leadership of Owen Farrell, who scored 17 points, including his side\u2019s sixth and final try, have not been so thrillingly obvious since England\u2019s heyday in the early 2000s, not least in 2001 when they went to Cardiff and won 44-15. No one would be silly enough to predict a similarly one-sided contest this time but even a scrappy away win would leave Italy and Scotland standing between a second grand slam in four years under Jones. The most immediate priority for their opponents will be to end England\u2019s remarkable record of early tries, which has now seen them score within three minutes of kick-off in their past five Tests. Inside 66 seconds May had his first try on the board, touching down Daly\u2019s intelligent left\u2011foot grubber after the Saracens-bound full-back had made swift ground following a midfield turnover. Almost every day is currently a May Day at Twickenham and before the half-hour mark the 28-year-old had extended his tally to 12 tries in his last 12 Tests. First, he showed dazzling footwork to outwit Damian Penaud to score in the left corner before successfully scooping up Chris Ashton\u2019s chip ahead to complete his hat-trick. May possesses a unique talent, but even the quicksilver ex-Wales wing Shane Williams would have been proud of this particular treble. Penaud did make slight amends with a 35th-minute try set up by Yoann Huget but when the classy Henry Slade dummied his way past Guirado to claim his side\u2019s bonus-point try just before half-time the game was effectively over. While France squandered a 16-0 point half-time lead against Wales in Paris, England were never going to surrender their 30-8 interval advantage here. A penalty try and a yellow card for Ga\u00ebl Fickou when a sprinting Ashton was tackled without the ball with the line beckoning merely added to French woe and the last half-hour was largely a question of how much damage England would ultimately inflict. In the event there was only one more try, for Farrell after May, for the umpteenth time, had burned off the cover. If there was a slight debate as to whether the last defender, Antoine Dupont, was impeded by England\u2019s flier as he vainly tried to gather the rolling ball, there was no disputing Farrell\u2019s fitness or desire that ensured he was first to the rebound. Even a brief touchline scuffle sparked by Kyle Sinckler throwing an arm at Arthur Iturria did little to rouse the less than irresistible visitors. It was another of those days for France, who had travelled without much in the way of hope and ended up largely stripped of their dignity. They have now won three of their past 19 Tests and their head coach, Jacques Brunel, is edging into the kind of uneasy territory that cost his predecessor, Guy Nov\u00e8s, his job. Typing Brunel\u2019s name always reminds some of us of his near namesake Jean-Jacques Burnel, the bass guitarist of The Stranglers. Forty years on, sadly, we are also reaching the point where French rugby has no more heroes any more. On this evidence it will certainly rank among the more startling about-turns if this result is somehow reversed when the two sides meet again in their World Cup pool game in Yokohama this autumn. The final score was England\u2019s record margin of victory against Les Bleus in the Six Nations and will be particularly fondly remembered by the Wasps scrum-half, Dan Robson, who finally made it off the bench for the last 11 minutes to earn a long-awaited first cap as a replacement for Ben Youngs.

Theresa May, who has revealed herself to be an Olympic class can-kicker, now proposes to return to the Commons by 27 February, either with a new deal or an amendable motion that will allow MPs to revisit the many permutations of the Brexit conundrum.

On Friday\u2019s Newsnight, Farage\u2019s ally, Steven Woolfe MEP (formerly Ukip, now independent), made clear that the party had been registered with two purposes in mind: first, to field candidates in the European elections on 23 May if Britain has not left the EU; and second, to give preliminary structure to the new leave campaign that would be needed in the event of a public vote. How might this happen? Theresa May, who has revealed herself to be an Olympic class can-kicker, now proposes to return to the Commons by 27 February, either with a new deal or an amendable motion that will allow MPs to revisit the many permutations of the Brexit conundrum. As the Observer disclosed today, Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, supported by a group of Tory remainers, now propose that the Commons should be given the chance to back a deal \u2013 and then to put it to the electorate in a referendum. Though this is an idea in its germinal phase, it has the great merit of intellectual coherence. A public vote is not, as it is so often presented, merely one option among many \u2013 an alternative, say, to \u201cNorway plus\u201d, \u201cCanada-plus-plus\u201d, or no deal \u2013 but a means of settling the thus-far-insoluble contest between the many plans on offer. Indeed, the case for a plebiscite is much stronger than it was in 2016: three years ago, the public was voting about lies on the side of a bus in an emotionally charged shouting-match about nothing and everything. This time, they would be called upon to break a genuine parliamentary impasse about a specific and describable predicament. This would not be a re-run, but \u2013 at last \u2013 the real thing. Assuming that Theresa May has not cobbled together a sellable deal by the end of this month, the votes that will be held on 27 February are the most important facing this generation of MPs. In all conscience, they cannot possibly countenance the suggestion that the prime minister be permitted yet more time to negotiate \u2013 a final vote being held on 25 March after the European council. No self-respecting parliament can be expected to take such monumental decisions only four days before the official date of departure. So, two weeks from now, MPs must decide whether they do, indeed, value their contract with the electorate and their collective sense of dignity. They face that rarest of things: an authentically defining moment. Which means that this need not, after all, be the last pages of a dreary thriller. It could yet be high noon. \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Seventeen Australian residents are believed to be under house arrest, in prison or detained in China\u2019s secretive \u201cre-education\u201d centres in Xinjiang, the Guardian can reveal. The 17 cases \u2013 15 Australian permanent residents and two on spouse visas \u2013 have been collected by Nurgul Sawut, an advocate for Uighurs in Australia, through interviews with their family members. The individuals are believed to have been detained while on trips to China visiting relatives. Many have children or spouses who are Australian citizens. It is difficult to confirm their fates, given the secretive nature of the camps, but Sawut believes one of the group is in prison, four are under house arrest, and the remaining 12 are in detention centres. Advocates for Australia\u2019s 3,000-strong Uighur community are calling on the government in Canberra to secure the release of the detainees. Shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, has urged the government to investigate. At the same time, members of Australia\u2019s Uighur population have reported serious harassment by Chinese authorities on Australian soil, including intimidating phone calls and requests to send over personal data, with the threat of reprisals against family if they do not comply. The Uighur crackdown China is facing increasing international criticism for its sweeping crackdown on the human rights of Uighurs. Severe restrictions have been imposed on the expression of Uighur culture and the Muslim faith inside China, and an estimated one million Muslims, mostly Uighurs, are held in detention camps in Xinjiang. Authorities in Beijing call the camps \u201cvocational training centres\u201d, saying the detainees are taught language, culture and skills. But Uighurs who have been released from the camps report people being shackled and beaten. In August, the UN called for the immediate release of detainees. In 2018, Sawut presented the cases of nine Australian residents believed to be detained in China to Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat). Only one of those people has since been freed and returned to Australia. \u201cOur community members feel let down,\u201d Sawut said. \u201cThe language [the department] is using is very dire. The Australian government is basically saying we can\u2019t do anything right now. \u201cThey say \u2018We are talking to our Chinese counterparts\u2019. What does that mean exactly? When I met Dfat in December, I said \u2018that\u2019s not a good enough answer for us. As an Australian embassy you need to do more to locate these people, to tell us if they\u2019re alive or dead.\u2019\u201d The department said it was not aware of any other Australian citizens detained in China and would not comment on individual cases. Last October Dfat confirmed that three Australian citizens had been detained and then released from China\u2019s political re-education camps in Xinjiang province in the past year. Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s spokeswoman on foreign affairs, said her party was \u201cparticularly concerned\u201d by reports of Uighurs who were Australian residents being detained. She said: \u201cEngagement with China is very important to Australia but, as with any other country, it never means we abandon our values, or our sovereignty.\u201d In response to a list of questions about the detention of the 17 residents and the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra said: \u201cIt is a wish shared by people of all ethnic groups for Xinjiang to maintain enduring social stability, since it serves their fundamental interests. The series of measures implemented in Xinjiang are meant to improve stability, development, solidarity and people\u2019s livelihood, crack down on and prevent ethnic separatist activities and violent and terrorist crimes, safeguard national security, and protect people\u2019s life and property.\u201d The missing Dilmurat Tursun, 52, is among those missing. The Australian permanent resident had lived in Sydney since 2011. In 2017 he took a trip to China with his wife, Dilbar Abdurahaman. Once inside the country, family members say their passports were confiscated and pair were unable to return home. In 2018 Tursun disappeared. He is believed to have been taken into a detention centre. His wife is trapped in China under house arrest and lives in fear that she too will be taken to a camp. \u201cI feel desperate and a sense of hopelessness,\u201d said Abdurahaman\u2019s sister Zulfiyah Kurash. \u201cThe only crime we can think of [that led to his imprisonment] is that he came to Australia and has relatives here.\u201d Other Uighur Australians have spoken of their difficulty in getting politicians to take their situation seriously. Jurad Addukerin, 53, from Sydney, visited Canberra with some members of the World Uighur Congress in 2018 to meet MPs, but arrived during one of the Liberal party\u2019s leadership contests. \u201cI felt they were not very serious about this conversation, they said they were very busy because they were in the middle of this other thing,\u201d Addukerin said. \u201cI hope that since 3 million people are being detained illegally and may be facing genocide \u2026 that politicians should do more, should raise their voice about this issue, instead of not doing anything or saying anything.\u201d \u2018We cannot live free, even if we live here\u2019 Uighurs in Australia continue to detail harassment by the Chinese authorities. On Christmas Day, Rashida Abdughupur was at a picnic at Victor Harbour, south of Adelaide, with other members of the Uighur community when she received a video call through the messaging service WeChat. It was the Chinese police, who turned the phone around to show that they had Abdughupur\u2019s mother handcuffed at a police station, she said. They told Abdughupur they would take her mother to the camps unless she gave them information. Terrified, Abdughupur showed them her driver\u2019s licence, passport, visa and Medicare card, which shows her children\u2019s names. \u201cAfter that, the police said don\u2019t ring your mum, they deleted her account, so I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in the camp or not. I was just sitting there crying, I didn\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she said. More than a dozen Uighurs in Australia have told the Guardian of intimidation and harassment from the Chinese authorities. Ali*, 34, received a call from a family member in 2017, who told him she would be sent to the camps unless he sent copies of his children\u2019s birth certificates and passports, as well as where they went to school, where the family lived and where he and his wife worked. \u201cWe cannot live free, even if we are living in Australia,\u201d he said. Several Uighurs told the Guardian they had received calls purporting to be from the Chinese embassy in Canberra, or a Chinese consulate telling them to come in to collect a parcel or package. One person received 10 such calls over the course of a month, despite being an Australian citizen with no connection to China except that he was married to a Uighur woman. Another said he received four calls from a Canberra-based number telling him to come to the embassy, despite being an Australian citizen who had lived in Australia for 15 years. The Chinese embassy in Canberra said: \u201cThe Chinese Embassy in Australia has never made the phone calls you mentioned. Last year, the Chinese embassy, AFP and ACT Police urged members of the Chinese community to be aware of the scam calls targeting Chinese nationals.\u201d",

Violence is a disease, it\u2019s contagious, it spreads. When you think you\u2019re going to remove people that are infected, the disease remains because you haven\u2019t dealt with the source,\u201d Pinkney said.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/SC-01-2017-0004?journalCode=sc\">a study he published last year</a>, Pinkney looked into the links between drill music and gang violence. The study concluded that gang rivalry is an important narrative in some drill music and could act as a catalyst to causing others harm, but it\u2019s not something that should be looked at in isolation.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having a conversation about austerity, poverty and institutional racism. We\u2019re just saying drill music is the reason why young people are violent and continuing that narrative is quite dangerous,\u201d Pinkney said.</p> <p>Artists in the industry say the crackdown on drill music is a smokescreen for how little is being done on the ground to reduce youth violence.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the shittiest policing of all time. They\u2019ve given AM and Skengdo prison sentences as if they\u2019re the Al-Capone of our time. They\u2019re making YouTube videos, come on,\u201d said the rapper Drillminister.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re looking for excuses right now. The government can\u2019t explain the rise in knife crime, they don\u2019t have answers for the public. They can\u2019t say \u2018we\u2019ve messed up the schooling systems, we\u2019ve messed up communities, we\u2019ve cut police numbers, we\u2019ve affected family households, and wage incomes\u2019,\u201d he added.</p> <p>To highlight what he describes as the hypocrisy in recent criticism of drill music, Drillminister used quotes from MPs to create a track, called Political Drilling. A quote featured in a song came from Labour MP Jess Phillips, who had said: \u201cThe day that it becomes you are hurting us more than helping us, I won\u2019t knife you in the back \u2013 I\u2019ll knife you in the front.\u201d</p> <p>TK, the co-founder of Finesse Foreva, the independent record label that manages Skengdo &amp; AM, believes drill music\u2019s positives are all too often ignored.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/23/teeangers-carry-knives-not-drill-music\">What makes young people carry knives?

They\u2019re going to offices, they\u2019re meeting people, and they realise they don\u2019t have to have their guard up all the time,\u201d TK said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the opportunity to go into music, all you\u2019re doing is being stuck in the block.\u201d</p> <p>He said rappers are just being honest about their material reality. \u201cTaking down the video of drill rappers talking about what\u2019s really going on in London is basically sweeping it underneath the rugs.\u201d</p> <p>Gwenton Sloley, a former gang member who does community outreach through the organisation Crying Son, said that for some \u201cthe only safe space they\u2019re seeing in their community is the music studio.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of tarring drill music under the same brush, Sloley said more should be done to support drill rappers engaging with isolated young people.</p> <p>The crackdown on drill music doesn\u2019t mean the music genre is going away anytime soon, Drillminister said. \u201cIf anything it has unified the culture, we realise the power of our voice. They\u2019re trying to silence us, but we\u2019ll speak our truth.\u201d</p>",

Stafford Scott, a civil rights campaigner, said: \u201cThe real reason the police, the judiciary, and lawmakers can abuse their position and target these artists in this manner is because they don\u2019t have a clue how to stop the violence.\u201d He called for more research on why young people feel compelled to carry weapons and are now more inclined to use them. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on tackling the symptoms and not the root causes of black youth disaffection, which is caused by marginalisation, isolation, deprivation and lack of aspiration, borne out of a lack of opportunity, inspiration and hope,\u201d Scott added. Craig Pinkney, a criminologist at University College Birmingham, said he was initially heartened to see the head of Scotland Yard show public support for the idea that knife crime should be treated as a public health crisis, but that the recent bans against drill artists show these words have yet to translate into meaningful action. \u201cViolence is a public health issue. Violence is a disease, it\u2019s contagious, it spreads. When you think you\u2019re going to remove people that are infected, the disease remains because you haven\u2019t dealt with the source,\u201d Pinkney said. In a study he published last year, Pinkney looked into the links between drill music and gang violence. The study concluded that gang rivalry is an important narrative in some drill music and could act as a catalyst to causing others harm, but it\u2019s not something that should be looked at in isolation. \u201cWe\u2019re not having a conversation about austerity, poverty and institutional racism. We\u2019re just saying drill music is the reason why young people are violent and continuing that narrative is quite dangerous,\u201d Pinkney said. Artists in the industry say the crackdown on drill music is a smokescreen for how little is being done on the ground to reduce youth violence. \u201cThis is the shittiest policing of all time. They\u2019ve given AM and Skengdo prison sentences as if they\u2019re the Al-Capone of our time. They\u2019re making YouTube videos, come on,\u201d said the rapper Drillminister. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for excuses right now. The government can\u2019t explain the rise in knife crime, they don\u2019t have answers for the public. They can\u2019t say \u2018we\u2019ve messed up the schooling systems, we\u2019ve messed up communities, we\u2019ve cut police numbers, we\u2019ve affected family households, and wage incomes\u2019,\u201d he added. To highlight what he describes as the hypocrisy in recent criticism of drill music, Drillminister used quotes from MPs to create a track, called Political Drilling. A quote featured in a song came from Labour MP Jess Phillips, who had said: \u201cThe day that it becomes you are hurting us more than helping us, I won\u2019t knife you in the back \u2013 I\u2019ll knife you in the front.\u201d TK, the co-founder of Finesse Foreva, the independent record label that manages Skengdo &amp; AM, believes drill music\u2019s positives are all too often ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s actually sad. We\u2019re not rich. We\u2019re trying to help and take the person who has potential and put them in more positive surroundings and teach them how to be professional. They\u2019re going to offices, they\u2019re meeting people, and they realise they don\u2019t have to have their guard up all the time,\u201d TK said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the opportunity to go into music, all you\u2019re doing is being stuck in the block.\u201d He said rappers are just being honest about their material reality. \u201cTaking down the video of drill rappers talking about what\u2019s really going on in London is basically sweeping it underneath the rugs.\u201d Gwenton Sloley, a former gang member who does community outreach through the organisation Crying Son, said that for some \u201cthe only safe space they\u2019re seeing in their community is the music studio.\u201d Instead of tarring drill music under the same brush, Sloley said more should be done to support drill rappers engaging with isolated young people. The crackdown on drill music doesn\u2019t mean the music genre is going away anytime soon, Drillminister said. \u201cIf anything it has unified the culture, we realise the power of our voice. They\u2019re trying to silence us, but we\u2019ll speak our truth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Of all the widely ridiculed tech products, Apple\u2019s AirPods have experienced an extraordinary turnaround. Back in 2016, they were roundly mocked by the tech industry. Tiny wireless earbuds? It seemed like a recipe for disaster \u2013 streets would be littered with these lost headphones, which would clutter up city pavements like discarded gloves and babies\u2019 socks. \u201cIf only there were an invention that could keep those AirPods tethered together, like a string,\u201d wrote Ashley Esqueda from the tech website CNET on Twitter. \u201cThe beauty of the headphone cable is just like the beauty of a tampon string: it is there to help you keep track of a very important item,\u201d wrote Julia Carrie Wong in the Guardian. But fast-forward to 2019 and, somehow, the \u00a3159-a-pair little pods have transformed into a bona fide status symbol. Diana Ross has a pair, Kristen Stewart wears them and a woman in Virginia has even started a cottage industry by turning them into earrings for people (which does solve the problem of inevitably losing them). And so, the butt of the joke is not the AirPods themselves but the wealth and status of the people who wear them. Such as the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who wore his upside down. As one viral tweet joked, the world\u2019s Top 10 richest people are: 1. AirPod users; 2. The CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos; and 3. Bill Gates. One meme, of a man being knighted by a queen, featured the caption: \u201cAirPod users welcoming new members who received them for Christmas.\u201d All this has now become known as \u201cAirPod flexing\u201d \u2013 with the implication that showing off the headphones is gauche social signalling. But is it fair? \u201cThe thing is, AirPods aren\u2019t even the most expensive wireless headphones out there,\u201d says Katy Leeson, the managing director of the social media marketing agency Social Chain. That said, the jokes about them can\u2019t have hurt Apple \u2013 if anything, the people mocking the product have led to a sales bump. \u201cPeople who consume memes \u2013 millennials and so on \u2013 are really hard to reach through traditional advertising,\u201d one digital marketing executive said.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s report from Wembley. Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen speak: Son: After 2-1, I struggled a little bit. The game was finished when I scored. I was very confident when I was one on one. The keeper is very big but I was confident to score...It was a penalty. I was surprised to be given a yellow card. I was disappointed and angry but we have to take that/ Eriksen: [Hugo Lloris] did save us a few times. Saving the penalty gave us confidence. We are happy to have Hugo... I saw a stat that we have won the last three games in the last ten minutes and even today we did that. (On the title): anything is possible. Some Twitter interactions as we wait for reaction and reports. Paul Burkett\u200f: \u201cYou seem to be saying something about Puel and Vardy, but I can\u2019t quite get your meaning.\u201d The Boss: \u201cif the ticket prices were affordable, I\u2019d come to watch Tottenham game against Leicester even though I\u2019m a @LFC fan. It would give the kids an opportunity to watch a live prem game. But cost of tickets, plus transport costs mean I can\u2019t.\u201d The Last Man in Europe\u200f: \u201cas a West Brom fan, I think I\u2019m entitled to some schadenfreude over Barnes misses. A season long loan should mean just that.\u201d Snoop sheepy sheep\u200f: \u201cno words for Michael Oliver\u2019s performance John? You\u2019d have to be trying very hard not to see his clear preference for a Leicester result.\u201d A hug between Poch and Claude as the whistle sounds. This win, the fourth in a row, is a tribute to Spurs\u2019 resilience. They have ridden their luck but been clinical when it mattered, which is precisely what Leicester have failed to do. That Vardy penalty farrago was farcical, and betrayed some of the muddled thinking that is costing Leicester this season. Vardy beginning on the bench didn\u2019t help, either. 90+2 min: There have been four minutes added on, and that looked time enough for Leicester to get chance to equalise. As it turned out, the opposite was true. As Leicester pile forward, Ndidi slips on the ball in the style of Steven Gerrard in 2014. And Son does a Demba Ba, loping through and keeping calm to score. That\u2019s that, then. 89 min: Okazaki hustles Walter-Peters into conceding a corner. Maddison takes, Chilwell jumps to the front of the queue to head. Lloris is equal to the challenge, though; it was straight at him. 88 min: The final subs are made by both teams. Off comes Danny Rose as Kyle Walker-Peters comes on. No coincidence that Rose is the furthest player away. For Leicester, Okazaki replaces Harvey Barnes. 87 min: A Tottenham penalty claim as Rose falls to the floor when Maguire comes across to block off the shot. It was not a penalty but it wasn\u2019t a dive, either. 86 min: Sissoko is brought down by Tielemans hauling him to the floor. Tielemans gets a booking on his debut, which has otherwise been hugely impressive. 84 min: Corner to Leicester. But Maddison\u2019s attempts to create an angle by going short comes to nothing. Wasteful, given the circumstances. 83 min: Ooof. Iheanacho cuts inside, makes space to shoot and hits the side-netting. Tottenham really hanging on for dear life. 82 min: Leicester are pouring forward, with Chilwell pretty much playing as a left winger. The same goes for Ricardo on the other flank, who sets up a chance for Vardy, who spins and shoots but can\u2019t keep the ball down. 81 min: Pochetttino is looking to cling on to this one. That\u2019s how Spurs have been getting things done of late, by the narrowest of margins. 79 min: Another Spurs change. On comes Victor Wanyama into midfield as Llorente, who has had a poor game, in truth, goes off. 77 min: We are set for a grandstand finish. Can Leicester hand Spurs their first draw of the entire season? Leicester do deserve something from this game. Jamie Vardy - who else? - pops up to slide home from close range. Ricardo was his supplier. 74 min: Chilwell\u2019s cross is aimed at Jamie Vardy but is too high. Claude Puel is turning the Sunday sky blue with some of his caterwauling. 72 min: Leicester keep going forwards, with Claude no longer whispering, but roaring on his team. Ghezzal comes off, with Iheanacho coming on. He wasn\u2019t even in the matchday 18, the striker. That suggests Claude has been forced to rip up his plan. 70 min: Off comes Oliver Skipp, on comes Alderweireld. Skipp has done OK, but Tielemans had the run of midfield for much of the first half. 69 min: Spurs trying to take the sting out of what has been a tough afternoon for them. Toby Alderweireld is coming on, and is looking through his instructions on the iPad. 67 min: Harvey Barnes is a player of obvious talent but he has cost his team with his misses and perhaps cost Whispering Claude his job in the long run. 66 min: Again, Leicester really should have scored. Vardy\u2019s flick finds Barnes with just Lloris to beat, but he can\u2019t. The Frenchman has had a superb day, though Leicester do keep hitting the ball straight at him. 65 min: So harsh on Leicester. They should be level, even in front. As against Manchester United, their finishing has let them down, and decision-making, too. Eriksen cuts inside, waves that wand of a right foot and scores from outside the box. 61 min: By the way, James Maddison was going to take that penalty but then passed the responsibility to Vardy. It always seemed an odd thing to do for Vardy to come on and take but still. Claude Puel looks unamused, if he has perhaps been a tad vindicated. Vardy chooses to shoot bottom left and Lloris guesses right. A great save but a poor penalty. 59 min: On comes Vardy to take the penalty, with Gray making way. Maddison shaped to shoot and Verthongen barged him over. Or did he? Looked soft but we have all seen them given. 57 min: Son charges on, and runs out of ideas on the edge of the box. At the other end, Chiwell forces a save from Lloris. And Vardy is stripped and ready to come on. 55 min: Applause from Jamie Vardy as Gray pivots and gets a shot on goal. Vardy happy for his mate to do well, though maybe not too well. 54 min: Better atmosphere in this half. Seems like the highly expensive cooking lager they sell at the national stadium is doing its job. 52 min: Ironic cheers as Michael Oliver gives a foul by a Leicester player. The first so far: let us recall he did not give a penalty when Son flopped. On second viewing that now looks a bad decision. 50 min: Close for Leicester. Ricardo\u2019s cross and Gray has a clear header on goal. He can only head straight to Lloris. Would Vardy have done better? You betcha. Also, that was Gray\u2019s first touch in the opposing penalty box. Claude\u2019s experiment is not working. 48 min: More footage of Puel shouting very loudly indeed, and Poch can also be heard. Jamie Vardy is chewing gum, and carving his name into the seat in front of him. Puel may soon have to launch the board rubber at him. 46 min: Leicester begin with brio with Harvey Barnes again active. Had he been more precise with his first-half effort, then his team would have been leading. Talking of which, Llorente makes a mess of a header. It\u2019s not really happening for him. The teams are back out and Jamie Vardy will be sniggering on the sidelines for a little bit longer. No changes have been made. Email from Kari. \u201cIt\u2019s odd to see so many empty seats for a game between two entertaining teams. I know Wembley is big, but surely there are enough potential spectators in the greater London area to see a match like this. Is the price too prohibitive? If so, that\u2019s a rather silly way to lose money. Enjoy the second half!\u201d Think some of the empty seats are down to Tottenham not being allowed more than a set amount - 50,000, say - but also because the fans are pig sick of Wembley. Which is understandable as it\u2019s a pain in the neck to get to. Then again, so is White Hart Lane, but it\u2019s their pain in the neck, I suppose. A decent contest in which Leicester seem a little unlucky to be behind, though their marking for Sanchez\u2019s goal was slack. If they had a decent striker, they\u2019d be dangerous. But Jamie Vardy is on the bench cracking gags with Simmo and Morgs. 45+2 min: Tielemans hits the ball with real swazz to force Lloris into evasive action, and a corner. That comes to naught as Chilwell slices his shot wide. That concludes the half. 45+1: Two minutes added in this half. 45 min: Ricardo yelps out in shame as he hoiks the ball into the stands. Then, Chilwell is again sloppy in allowing himself to be robbed by Eriksen, whose pass is close to sublimity, but overhit and beyond the reach of Danny Rose on the opposite flank. 43 min: Chilwell\u2019s surge has Tottenham backpedalling again. He has been outstanding when coming forward. Less so in defence, where he lets Trippier get the ball on the overlap. Leicester, though, manage to regain their shape and stop Spurs on the edge of their box. 41 min: Lovely skill in midfield from Winks clears up some danger. But Leicester get it back. Tielemans goes on the run and looks to be felled but the referee doesn\u2019t give anything. Chilwell forces a corner off Trippier. The corner from Maddison is hit far too high. 39 min: Sissoko sees glory with a long-range shot. He blams it over and somewhere in the direction of the North Circular. 37 min: A Sissoko error gifts Leicester a corner but Maguire and Evans rather crash into each other; Sanchez had a tight hold of Jonny Evans. 36 min: Jamie Vardy and Danny Simpson are warming up on the sidelines, looking somewhat conspiratorial. 34 min: That was Sanchez\u2019s first goal for Spurs. And came a little against the run of play. Eriksen\u2019s cross finds Sanchez in the box, he had come up for a corner, and he stoops to head in. Leicester want an offside, but Sanchez was level. 31 min: Leicester are up for this. With Chilwell outstanding down the left. He creates space and a chance for Harvey Barnes, who takes his time over a shot and then makes a frightful mess of it. 29 min: Leicester corner. They can\u2019t make much of it, but then Verthongen becomes the third Spur to be booked when clattering Ben Chilwell, who was just too quick for him. From the free-kick, Ndidi should have hit the target, from barely six yards out, but thankfully for him, an offside flag was up. Spurs are wobbly. 26 min: Leicester are struggling to hold the ball up, with Gray not looking much of a target man. He does, though, force Sanchez and Verthongen into an error, with some chasing that reminds of Jamie Vardy. 24 min: Sanchez\u2019s probing pass is flicked by Eriksen into the path of Son, whose shot is blocked. At the other end, the excellent Tielemans is brought down. He has been a live wire and his passing has been superb. 22 min: Decent game, this. Both teams looking capable of scoring, but missing their top striker. In Claude\u2019s case, that\u2019s through choice. 20 min: Rose again involved but his cross is aimed just where Harry Kane would be. And Llorente isn\u2019t. Rose then picks up a booking for an injudicious tackle. 19 min: Rose is back on and in action almost immediately. He cuts inside and forces a fine save from Kasper Schmeichel. 17 min: Danny Rose is off the field receiving treatment. Oliver Skipp has stepped over to left-back. Looks like a calf problem. Rose come back on, though gingerly. 16 min: Son falls to the floor in the penalty area...no pen. In fact, he is booked for his troubles. That looked harsh as he had taken a rap to the shins. 14 min: Llorente and Eriksen try to link up but fail to read each other\u2019s wavelength. Looks like Spurs are going to have to grind through the gears. 12 min: Spurs try and settle after that series of scares. Claude Puel can heard shouting. Yes, shouting. 10 min: Leicester go close again! Harvey Barnes gets inside Trippier from another fine pass by Tielemans, but Spurs beat it away. They look ragged at the back, it has to be said. 8 min: Leicester go close! Maddison\u2019s free-kick finds Harry Maguire at the back post. A fierce header is palmed behind by Hugo Lloris. Jonny Evans climbs highest for the corner but nods over. 7 min: A first Leicester attack is set up by Tielemans\u2019 great pass, though Gray is stopped by Davinson Sanchez\u2019s intervention. 6 min: Son\u2019s surge ends when he falls to the floor. No free-kick given. 5 min: Another Tottenham attack, down Trippier\u2019s flank this time, and Son is edged out. Leicester yet to show much in the way of shape. 3 min: Tottenham on the attack. Danny Rose flies down the left flank, and on the other side, Kieran Trippier\u2019s shot is deflected behind. Ben Chilwell clears the resultant corner. 1 min: Jamie Vardy is sharing a joke with Danny Simpson and Wes Morgan on the bench. Something of the insolent schoolboy about that. With Tottenham taking the kick-off. Some decent noise at Wembley from the home fans. There\u2019s been a last-minute alteration for Leicester: Papy Mendy got injured in the warmup and in comes Wilfred Ndidi. Kelechi Iheanacho is added to the matchday 18. Here come the teams and the pre-match handshakes. The top tiers of Wembley do look a little empty, as in there is nobody sat up there at all. That is down to licensing issue, we believe. They have been paying tribute to Emiliano Sala at Wembley. Daniel Taylor points out here that not everybody is being quite so respectful. Poch is being polite about Leicester. I have been watching Leicester the last few games. They deserved much better against United. In the end they lost the game. They have a good player and a good squad. We need to fight and play well if we are to win the three points. Claude Puel talks about that de-selection of Jamie Vardy. I would like to develop other options than Jamie. I don\u2019t want to put all the pressure in Jamie. I think Demarai has the attributes to play in this position. It will be a good opportunity for him and us. David Hytner heard from Hugo Lloris this week. There\u2019s plenty of other football today and Alex Hess has the latest from the Etihad Campus. And for Youri Tielemans, it\u2019s a Leicester debut. Interesting stat here. Claude is definitely trying to change things up. Into the vault we go for an interview with a 17-year-old Tielemans from Paul Doyle. That Arsenal-Anderlecht game ended up 3-3; the comeback was sealed by Aleksandar Mitrovic, when the Gunners had been 3-0 up after 58 minutes. Another glance at that Leicester team and only one starter, Kasper Schmeichel, survives from their title-winners from 2016. There are four of them on the bench, but it\u2019s apparent that Claude has decided to make his own mark on the team, for better or for worse. And that may point to a few difficulties in the background. For Tottenham, Oliver Skipp gets his second ever Premier League start in the midfield. Toby Alderweireld is dropped to the bench. No Vardy, and Demarai Gray as a false nine: what can possibly go wrong? Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Sanchez, Vertonghen, Rose, Winks, Skipp, Sissoko, Eriksen, Son, Llorente. Subs: Alderweireld, Wanyama, Walker-Peters, Foyth, Gazzaniga, Aurier, Lucas Moura. Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Maguire, Evans, Chilwell, Mendy, Tielemans, Ghezzal, Maddison, Barnes, Gray. Subs: Simpson, Morgan, Vardy, Ward, Okazaki, Ndidi, Choudhury. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) \u201cWe\u2019re not fickle. We just don\u2019t like you,\u201d as the banner on Aston Villa\u2019s Holte End said. That was directed at David O\u2019Leary back in 2006. Leicester fans hold much the same view of Boring/Whispering Claude Puel. Only Magic Marco Silva is higher in the next manager to be sacked odds. For Tottenham fans, the opposite is true. They find themselves cheering on Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s Manchester United, in the hope the greying assassin gets the job instead of Mauricio Pochettino. Poch is doing a fine job again this season for homeless Spurs, and should be the man to lead them into life at the new stadium when they finally move there some time in 2034. No Kane, no Alli? No problem when you have Son Heung-min back and firing. A shame for Cousin Vinny Janssen, whose big moment has been and gone with a knee injury. Fernando Llorente struggles to score but he is putting everything he can into the cause. For Leicester, the word was that there might be no Jamie Vardy in the team and he\u2019s on the bench. He and Claude don\u2019t get on and he may or may not have told Paul Pogba last week that Puel is a \u201cf***ing k***head\u201d. There can only be one winner there. Wembley is the venue, and a Spurs win has to be expected.",

      "body": "<p>To say the scene was set for Jamie Vardy was one of the understatements of the season. Dropped to the Leicester bench by Claude Puel despite his fine scoring record against big-six opposition, the striker was introduced in the 59th minute with his team trailing to D\u00e1vinson S\u00e1nchez\u2019s first-half header but having just been awarded the softest of penalties.</p> \n<p>Surely Vardy would not run straight on to take the kick?

      "bodyText": "To say the scene was set for Jamie Vardy was one of the understatements of the season. Dropped to the Leicester bench by Claude Puel despite his fine scoring record against big-six opposition, the striker was introduced in the 59th minute with his team trailing to D\u00e1vinson S\u00e1nchez\u2019s first-half header but having just been awarded the softest of penalties. Surely Vardy would not run straight on to take the kick? He did and the Wembley crowd held its breath. In 51 previous Premier League appearances against the big six Vardy had scored 28 goals. Thirteen of them had come since the beginning of last season but, on this occasion, his sights were awry. Hugo Lloris, the game\u2019s outstanding performer, went the right way to save and that seemed even more important moments later when Christian Eriksen scored at the other end for 2-0.

The revolt against Maduro\u2019s regime is entering its fourth week, with the Venezuelan strongman showing no sign of relinquishing power despite a startling and largely unforeseen challenge from a previously obscure opposition leader called Juan Guaid\u00f3. An anticipated large-scale military abandonment of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir has not materialized despite Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 who is now recognized as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president by most western governments \u2013 repeatedly touting an amnesty for the armed forces. However, in an interview with Latin American journalists in Washington, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for western hemisphere affairs insisted Maduro\u2019s demise was a foregone conclusion. \u201cThe path we are going down is irreversible \u2026 The question is no longer if Maduro accepts this or not, it\u2019s how long it will take him to accept it,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone said. Claver-Carone, a conservative Cuban-American lawyer, renewed US calls for Venezuela\u2019s military top brass to ditch Maduro, claiming the White House would not \u201cpersecute\u201d those who backed \u201ca peaceful and democratic transition\u201d. \u201cWe are not in the business of revenge, nor are we seeking to settle scores.\u201d Maduro\u2019s domestic and international foes are adamant he is doomed. Colombia\u2019s foreign minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, last week branded Maduro\u2019s regime \u201can unburied corpse\u201d. But many observers believe Guaid\u00f3\u2019s opposition movement will be frustrated not to have seen more military defections. With a new round of opposition protests planned for Tuesday, Venezuela expert Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm admitted it was impossible to predict Maduro\u2019s fate. \u201cWe are living in maximum uncertainty. He could be gone tomorrow or he could be around for the next few months,\u201d said Na\u00edm, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former Venezuelan minister. And whatever happens to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir, it is not guaranteed his regime would fall with him, with some believing a rival Chavista could emerge as an internal challenger. \u201cOne scenario is that Maduro leaves, but the regime stays,\u201d Na\u00edm said, pointing to what he believed was a fierce and long-running behind-the-scenes struggle for control of Chavismo. \u201cIt is a battle of the socialist billionaires for survival.\u201d Nicmer Evans, a longtime Chavista who split with the movement in 2013, agreed that while Maduro was down, the political movement he inherited after Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 2013 death was not yet out. \u201cMaduro might kill [Chavismo] but it\u2019s still not dead. It\u2019s in critical condition. It\u2019s a wounded animal. It\u2019s in power, it can respond, it is capable of harming \u2013 but it is agonizing,\u201d Evans said. Maduro has been hit hard by sweeping US oil sanctions intended to asphyxiate his regime although Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil giant, PDVSA, is reportedly now asking customers to make payments into a newly opened account in Russia in order to sidestep those prohibitions. Another challenge is expected in the coming days with opposition leaders currently stockpiling US humanitarian aid on the Colombian border which they vow to bring into Venezuela. On Friday, Maduro insisted the aid convoy would not be allowed in, calling it a \u201ca rotten gift\u201d and an imperialist military provocation designed to destabilize his government. Speaking in Caracas on Sunday, Guaid\u00f3 urged the military to ignore Maduro\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d order to block the aid. \u201cToday we can save lives in Venezuela,\u201d he told reporters. Guaid\u00f3 echoed Claver-Carone\u2019s claim that time was running out for Maduro. \u201cEvery day that passes \u2026 is a victory for democracy that brings us closer to the freedom of Venezuela.\u201d",

But we knew we\u2019d get chances, and we did. And we should have won the game. When you go two-nil up you should win football games, but we\u2019ve got to move on. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a cup final in two weeks. We\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s capable of winning. But we\u2019re disappointed today. It\u2019s how the players react to this. This hurts them but I know they\u2019ve got a good mentality.\u201d Emma Hayes: \u201cWe started the game brightly, then we made a mistake. I think that affected the team emotionally, and we conceded another sloppy goal, and spent the rest of the half on the back foot. I had some strong words at half-time. I wanted a performance that reflected champions and I think I got that second half. \u201cI have to give credit to the whole team \u2013 I think another with 10 minutes, we\u2019d have won it. I think in the first half, City played like champions, not us. In the second half, we played like the champions.\u201d A great game ends in a draw that does neither side much good. City fail to pull away from Arsenal, while Chelsea\u2019s faint hopes of defending their title are surely over. Not that us neutrals mind: that was a very fun watch indeed, and fitting that Ji, the game\u2019s standout player throughout, should have a decisive impact on the result. City, 2-0 up and coasting, won\u2019t sleep easy tonight, not least because the usually lethal Parris had two glorious chances to extend their lead in the second half. But all in all, a draw is probably about right. hat\u2019s all from me. Cheerio! And that\u2019s that. 93 mins: A frantic end-to-end finale here \u2013 City commit forward, give it away cheaply, and Chelsea launch a counter that they can\u2019t quite turn into a chance. Either side could yet win this. Her again! Not exactly one for the highlight reel but it\u2019s a vital goal. The South Korean hits a free-kick 20 yards out, it clips a shoulder in the City wall and sails in past a helpless Bardsley. Two-two \u2013 and while it\u2019s a flukey goal, Ji deserves that. 85 mins: Chelsea look to be running out of ideas, repeatedly getting to the edge of the box but finding no way past a deep City defence. But then Cuthbert swings one in and, out of nothing, Kirby find the ball at her feet five yards out. She blams her strike low and hard, but it squirms wide via Bardsley\u2019s shins. 82 mins: Cuthbert\u2019s cross evades England by a matter of inches, Chelsea regather and work it back out to Cuthbert, who hits the byline and picks out Kirby on the penalty spot \u2013 but Kirby scuffs her volley badly wide. Really good chance. Chelsea have chucked Millie Bright up front now too. Kitchen sink time. 80mins: Change for City as Hemp comes on for Wullaert. 79 mins: A desperate scramble in the Man City box as Ji\u2019s goalbound shot is blocked by a prone Beattie, a followup is smothered and Bachmann\u2019s lofted third attempt sails over. 76 mins: Emma Hayes shuffles her back again, sending on Bachmann for Ingle. Nick Cushing responds by readying Lauren Hemp. 75 mins: Chelsea continue to attack with intent, Spence seeing a shot charged down on the edge of the box. Bright climbs to meet the resulting corner but can\u2019t direct her header on target. 72 mins: Another wonderful chance for Parris! In fact, it\u2019s pretty much the same chance, missed in pretty much the same way. Released through the inside right, she sprints clear, steadies herself, \u2026 and guides a low strike just wide of the far post. 69 mins: Bardsley follows the example of her opposite number by putting the wind up her fans with some perilous passing in her six-yard box. An alert Kirby can\u2019t quite capitalise. Nothing wrong with a good old-fashioned long clearance, guys. 65 mins: Normal service resumes \u2013 Chelsea probing forward, City sitting back in the backs-to-the-wall manner and whacking hopeful long balls in the vague direction of Parris whenever possible. Lindahl rushes out to cut out one such pass, arriving a split-second ahead of the striker. 63 mins: The first change for Chelsea, Carney making way for Fran Kirby. 59 mins: Parris misses a golden chance to all but wrap up the win, released on the counter after a seemingly endless period of Chelsea pressure. Parris is played clean through by a long ball over the top, outsprints her marker and, as Lindahl comes out to meet her, picks out the bottom-left corner. But her shot trickles just wide! 56 mins: Chelsea are turning the screw, pinning City into their own box. A couple of imprecise final balls mean they haven\u2019t yet translated this spell of pressure into a clear chance, but you feel there\u2019s one coming. This is a quietly terrific game. 54 mins: A great spin on halfway by Ji sets Chelsea off on another attack. Ingle picks out England making a great run forward but the striker can\u2019t quite keep her cut-back in play. She\u2019s been Chelsea\u2019s chief threat all afternoon and Ji duly provides the goal to get her side back into the match. Again it\u2019s England heavily involved, escaping into the area and seeing her shot charged down. The South Korean is first to react, drilling in from close range inside a crowded box. It\u2019s the goal we wanted. Game on. 47 mins: A manic start to the second half. Chelsea race out of the blocks quickly, England steaming clear and seeing her shot saved by Bardsley, before City take off down the other head, Parris squares for Weir and Lindahl \u2013 a liability through the first half \u2013 makes a truly magnificent save, clawing the ball on to the post despite being wrongfooted by the shot. The teams are back out \u2013 no chances for either side \u2013 and the second half is under way. A mighty fun half, that. Both teams have showed plenty of ambition going forward and no shortage of incompetence at the back. City set the tone in the opening minutes, when Stokes\u2019 careless backpass gave City the game\u2019s first clear chance. That same scenario played out a few more times at the other end, Lindahl invariably the guilty party, and Wullaert\u2019s crisply taken opener was also the result of a defensive mishap, Bright giving the ball away under little pressure. Stanway\u2019s goal was the half\u2019s standout moment \u2013 a wonderful guided drive \u2013 and at the other end Chelsea look dangerous whenever they get the tricky Ji on the ball. The problem for them now is that they essentially need three goals in the second half, a task that will leave them open to being picked off by a smart attack led by division\u2019s deadliest striker. Nikita Parris has been lurking on the fringes so far but will have been licking her lips at the chances being dished out by Chelsea\u2019s defence. 46 mins: Lindahl again! Another tippy-tappy attempt at playing it out from the back, another skewed pass from the keeper, and another clearcut City chance. This time it\u2019s Parris who is presented with the ball by the Chelsea keeper, but her early shot from a fast-narrowing angle can only find the side-netting. And that\u2019s half-time. 45 mins: A sloppy backpass from Houghton evades Bardsley and goes out for a corner. Chelsea don\u2019t make it count though, Bardsley eventually collecting. Then Ji \u2013 at the heart of all Chelsea\u2019s best moves \u2013 finds Blundell with a clever pass but the onrushing full-back miscontrols. 40 mins: Millie Bright prevents it becoming three with a last-ditch tackle on Parris, just as the striker is preparing to pull the trigger. Again the chance stemmed from a woeful pass from Lindahl, who\u2019d be well advised to go for a no-nonsense hoof next time. 39 mins: Stanway fires over from range after some alarmingly casual distribution from Lindahl gifts her the ball in a good position. 35 mins: Insight klaxon: the next goal here will be crucial. And it could go either way. Chelsea have regained their composure and are pressing forward with purpose, but City have already scored twice from quick breaks, and Parris \u2013 quiet so far \u2013 is always a threat. 30 mins: Chelsea need something before half-time to avoid this petering out into a routine win. And they duly show some spark: Ingle sprays wide to Carney, whose whipped cross is half cleared. Ji picks up the loose ball, wriggles into some nonexistent space with a wonderful bit of skill and fires a low shot just too close to Bardsley. That\u2019s more like it. Beautiful goal. Some terrific hold-up play from Scott, who collects a lofted pass with her back to goal and lays off to Stanway on the edge of the box. She dispatches a delightfully measured first-time finish, the ball steered just out of Lindahl\u2019s reach and in off the far post. Two-nil. 21 mins: Lindahl called into action as Beattie dives to meet Weir\u2019s floated free-kick with a powerful close-range. header. The City keeper palms it away instinctively \u2013 great save. Chelsea under the cosh here. 17 mins: Spence is carded for a heavy, angry tackle in midfield. Then Stanway find some space on the left and tests Lindahl from an angle. Corner. 15 mins: That goal has transformed the game. City are suddenly playing keep-ball in the Chelsea half, the visitors struggling to make it stick up front. And so, inevitably, City take the lead. Seconds after Weir wastes a good chance on the break, Wullaert nicks the ball in midfield, drives forward through and makes no mistake with her finish, rifling home to end a no-nonsense counter. That\u2019s a gutpunch to Chelsea, who have been all over City and should really be in front. 10 mins: Chelsea have started with real intent, full of crisp passing and barely giving City a touch. 8 mins: Beth England gathers the ball on halfway, turns smartly and storms to the edge of the box. She gets a shot away, low and hard, but it\u2019s straight at Bardsley. 6 mins: Parris, streaking clear on the counter, is hacked down by Brighton who receives a booking. Weir\u2019s left-foot free-kick is tame, though, gathered easily by Lindahl. 4 mins: Chelsea keep City hammed into their own half, Ji cutting out a wild clearance and winning a free-kick. The ball falls to Stokes, whose shoddy backpass presents England with a glorious chance. Bardsley is quick off her line to smother and saves the day. Lucky escape for City. 2 mins: Chelsea settle in with an extended spell of composed possession. Carney escapes down the left, spins her marker and wins a corner. Good start from the visitors. The teams are out. Game faces are fixed firmly on as the sides march on to the field under a grey Mancunian sky. Some perfunctory handshakes, a quick huddle for each team \u2026 and we\u2019re off. Emma Hayes: \u201cThere\u2019s no hiding, we have to win the game today. On some level, I prefer that. It will all be about a win, but we can\u2019t just throw all our bodies forward immediately. If we execute our plan, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t come away with three points today.\u201d Chelsea absolutely need to take the points today if they have any chance of defending their title. With five games to go, they are six points behind leaders City. Victory here would put them back in the picture and make it a three-horses race head into the final straight. A City win would all but consign Emma Hates\u2019 team to a trophyless campaign. Man City manager Nick Cushing on leading the table: \u201cI don\u2019t feel it is [a different mindset when you\u2019re top]. Ultimately it\u2019s about preparing for the next game, whether you\u2019re chasing or you\u2019re leading. We led in 2016 and we won the league and we led last year and we didn\u2019t. We\u2019ve been in both positions and I think the key thing for us is having been through that learning process. \u201cThe players have been through the process of winning it and being ecstatic and losing it and being really down. We\u2019re in a good mentality at the minute. \u201cFor us the main thing is to get the points in the bag. If you offered me games in hand or points, I\u2019d always take the points.\u201d Manchester City: Bardsley, Stokes, Beattie, Houghton, Bonner, Walsh, Scott, Weir, Wullaert, Stanway, Parris. Subs: Roebuck, Morgan, Campbell, Emslie, Hemp, Bremer, Beckie. Chelsea: Lindahl, Blundell, Bright, Ingle, Carney, Ji, England, Eriksson, Andersson, Cuthbert, Spence. Subs: Berger, Asante, Carter, Riley, Cooper, Bachmann, Kirby Preamble After seeing their WSL title snatched from them by Chelsea last season, Manchester City have responded with a dead-eyed determination to reclaim their throne. Fourteen games in, Nick Cushing\u2019s side sit atop the table, proudly unbeaten. And with second-placed Arsenal having been granted the weekend off, this afternoon marks a chance for Cushing\u2019s side to put some real daylight between them and their nearest rivals: a win here would put them four points clear, albeit having played two games more. And just to add extra spice, City knocked Chelsea out of the Continental Cup on Wednesday with a 2-0 victory on enemy territory. The result will have further raised the spirits of today\u2019s hosts \u2013 and given Emma Hayes\u2019 team some strong cause for payback. This fixture features all of the division\u2019s three top scorers: after 14 games, City\u2019s Nikita Parris \u2013 scorer of both in midweek \u2013 and Georgia Stanway lead the way with 12 and 10 respectively, Chelsea\u2019s Erin Cuthbert their closest challenger with six. Yet it also puts the two meanest defences up against each other, with the two teams having only conceded 17 between them. So it\u2019s a case of unstoppable force vs immovable object at both ends of the pitch. Kickoff: 1pm",

      "bodyText": "The Home Office is facing calls to release a report called Leftwing Activism and Extremism in the UK, which has been prepared by its extremism analysis unit (EAU). Jenny Jones, one of several politicians and activists whose inclusion on a domestic extremist database previously caused a furore, are among those expressing concerns about the report after its existence was revealed by a freedom of information request by the Guardian. Jones said: \u201cOver the past decade, the police have become more and more confused about their duty to facilitate peaceful protest and are prone to see any disruption as extremist. The Met police put me on their domestic extremist database for years, when I was a member of their own oversight body, the Police Authority and deputy mayor of London,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt is deeply worrying that the Home Office has a report that must include definitions of extremism that many people would see as far too broad, when protest and dissent are necessary within a democracy.\u201d An FOI request by the Guardian found that the Home Office\u2019s EAU \u2013 which was established by Theresa May in 2015 and has been involved in drawing up a blacklist of individuals and organisations with whom the government and public sector should not engage \u2013 has produced, or is planning to produce, more than 21 reports. Three have titles indicating they are focused on the far right, such as Impact of Far Right Ideology on Young People and Rightwing Extremism \u2013 UK Groups. Three others contained the word \u201cIslamist\u201d, including How Islamist Extremists Gain Legitimacy. Others appear to be focused on the impact or reaction to terror events of recent years, such as Manchester Attack One Week On \u2013 Reaction and London Bridge Attack Islamophobic Sentiments. The list also contained reports called UK Sikh Nationalism and Women and Girls in Extremism. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe work by the extremism analysis unit helps improve our understanding of all types of extremism and guide how we should respond.\u201d Detailing the work of the EAU when she was home secretary, May said the unit would \u201chelp us to develop a new engagement policy \u2013 which will set out clearly for the first time with which individuals and organisations the government and public sector should engage and should not engage\u201d. The EAU was also involved in developing a \u201ccounter-entryism\u201d strategy to tackle Islamist radicalisation and ensure there is no repeat of the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham schools across the public sector.",

Catalan independence leaders are keen for their day in court as a means to mobilise their grassroots supporters after months of inertia and as fractures grow within the movement.</p> \n<p>They have repeatedly sought to accuse the Spanish justice system of institutional bias and to claim that the accused are being punished for defending the right to self-determination.</p> \n<p>In a recent interview, Puigdemont told the Associated Press that the trial would be \u201cnot an act of justice but rather one of vengeance\u201d, while his handpicked successor, Quim Torra, has argued that no crime has been committed.</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialist government has been embarking on its own PR campaign to counter the claims of the pro-independence faction. The prime minister has consistently argued that a clear separation of powers exists in Spain, and that the judiciary is wholly independent of the government. The prime minister visited the European court of human rights in Strasbourg last Thursday to stress Spain\u2019s commitment to the rule of law.</p> \n<p>The S\u00e1nchez administration has pointed to a series of high-profile court cases as further evidence of a fully functioning and impartial legal system. The former deputy prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/23/former-imf-chief-gets-four-years-jail-after-corruption-trial-in-spain\">Rodrigo Rato</a> was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2017 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/09/former-caja-directors-accused-credit-card-misuse-bankia\">misusing corporate credit cards</a> while in charge of two leading Spanish banks at the height of the country\u2019s financial crisis.</p> \n<p>The brother-in-law of King Felipe is serving a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/spains-princess-cristina-acquitted-in-tax-trial\">six-year prison sentence</a> after being found guilty of charges including embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion. The king\u2019s sister, Princess Cristina, was cleared of helping her husband evade taxes at the end of the same trial two years ago.</p> \n<p>By far the most dramatic court case of recent years, however, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/court-finds-spain-ruling-party-pp-benefited-bribery-luis-barcenas\">the so-called G\u00fcrtel trial</a>. Spain\u2019s highest criminal court ruled in May last year that the People\u2019s party, which was then in government, had profited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. The judges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/fall-of-mariano-rajoy-gurtel-spain\">expressed doubts</a> over the credibility of the testimony offered by Rajoy the previous July, when he became the first serving Spanish prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/26/mariano-rajoy-becomes-first-serving-spanish-pm-to-testify-in-criminal-case\">to give evidence in a criminal trial</a>.</p> \n<p>The G\u00fcrtel verdict prompted S\u00e1nchez to bring a motion of no-confidence against Rajoy and his government. The vote that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/mariano-rajoy-ousted-as-spain-prime-minister\">removed Rajoy from office</a> and installed the socialist party as a minority government was successful only because it won the backing of the Basque Nationalist party \u2013 and the Catalan pro-independence parties of Puigdemont and Junqueras. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people gathered in Madrid on Sunday to protest against the government\u2019s handling of the Catalan question, as the country braced for the landmark trial of 12 separatist leaders this week. About 45,000 people joined the rally in Col\u00f3n square to vent their fury at what they see as the overly conciliatory stance adopted by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and to demand a snap general election. The demonstration was called by the conservative People\u2019s party and the centre-right Citizens party, and backed by the far-right Vox party. It also attracted some supporters of fascist and extreme-right groups. The protest came two days before the beginning of the trial of separatist leaders behind the failed bid for regional independence, an event that provoked Spain\u2019s worst political crisis since it returned to democracy after the death of Franco. The public proceedings at Spain\u2019s supreme court, which are expected to last three months and which will be broadcast on television, will focus on the independence referendum held in October 2017 and the regional parliament\u2019s subsequent unilateral declaration of independence. Nine of the defendants - who include the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament Carme Forcadell and two influential grassroots activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez \u2013 are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years. Other charges include sedition and the misuse of public funds. At the heart of the case will be the then Catalan government\u2019s decision to hold the referendum despite repeated warnings that it would violate the constitution, which stresses the \u201cindissoluble unity of the Spanish nation\u201d. Although Catalan pro-independence parties have never managed to win 50% of the vote in the regional parliament, and although polls consistently show Catalonia is roughly evenly split over the independence issue, the government of the then Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, chose to press ahead with the vote. Pro-independence parties managed to get a law paving the way for the referendum passed in the regional parliament in early September 2017, despite furious objections from opposition MPs who complained that usual procedures had been disregarded. Three weeks later, on 1 October, the Catalan government held the referendum, which was marred by violence from Spanish police officers who raided polling stations, charged crowds with batons and fired rubber bullets as they tried to stop the vote. According to the Catalan government, about 2.3 million of Catalonia\u2019s 5.3 million registered voters \u2013 43% \u2013 took part in the referendum, and around 90% of participants backed independence. The vote was largely boycotted by unionist Catalans. On 27 October, shortly after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to declare independence, the Spanish government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, won senate backing to sack Puigdemont and his cabinet and assume direct control of Catalonia. Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium days later, while Junqueras and seven other former Catalan ministers were remanded in custody. The president of the supreme court, Carlos Lesmes, has described the proceedings as \u201cthe most important trial that we\u2019ve held since democracy [returned]\u201d. Hundreds of witnesses are to be called, among them Rajoy, his former deputy, Soraya S\u00e1ez de Santamar\u00eda, the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, the former Catalan president Artur Mas and the current speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent. The court has ruled that Puigdemont will not be allowed to testify via videolink from Belgium. Other witnesses will include some of the Catalan voters and Spanish police officers injured on the day of the referendum. Both the Spanish and Catalan governments are acutely aware of the publicity and scrutiny the trial will bring. Catalan independence leaders are keen for their day in court as a means to mobilise their grassroots supporters after months of inertia and as fractures grow within the movement. They have repeatedly sought to accuse the Spanish justice system of institutional bias and to claim that the accused are being punished for defending the right to self-determination. In a recent interview, Puigdemont told the Associated Press that the trial would be \u201cnot an act of justice but rather one of vengeance\u201d, while his handpicked successor, Quim Torra, has argued that no crime has been committed. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialist government has been embarking on its own PR campaign to counter the claims of the pro-independence faction. The prime minister has consistently argued that a clear separation of powers exists in Spain, and that the judiciary is wholly independent of the government. The prime minister visited the European court of human rights in Strasbourg last Thursday to stress Spain\u2019s commitment to the rule of law. The S\u00e1nchez administration has pointed to a series of high-profile court cases as further evidence of a fully functioning and impartial legal system. The former deputy prime minister Rodrigo Rato was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2017 for misusing corporate credit cards while in charge of two leading Spanish banks at the height of the country\u2019s financial crisis. The brother-in-law of King Felipe is serving a six-year prison sentence after being found guilty of charges including embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion. The king\u2019s sister, Princess Cristina, was cleared of helping her husband evade taxes at the end of the same trial two years ago. By far the most dramatic court case of recent years, however, was the so-called G\u00fcrtel trial. Spain\u2019s highest criminal court ruled in May last year that the People\u2019s party, which was then in government, had profited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. The judges expressed doubts over the credibility of the testimony offered by Rajoy the previous July, when he became the first serving Spanish prime minister to give evidence in a criminal trial. The G\u00fcrtel verdict prompted S\u00e1nchez to bring a motion of no-confidence against Rajoy and his government. The vote that removed Rajoy from office and installed the socialist party as a minority government was successful only because it won the backing of the Basque Nationalist party \u2013 and the Catalan pro-independence parties of Puigdemont and Junqueras.",

All rights reserved. Used with permission</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that this hugely significant photograph isn\u2019t even one of Russell\u2019s best speaks volumes about his career. Over a prolific 10-year period that culminated in 1978, Russell shot the world\u2019s biggest rock stars, usually at their most candid. He had a ringside seat at what\u2019s often seen as rock\u2019s golden era. Russell wasn\u2019t just friends with Lennon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/yoko-ono\">Yoko Ono</a>, he knew their cat as well. And when pandemonium gripped 1969\u2019s Altamont free concert, where a fan was killed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/therollingstones\">the Rolling Stones</a> played, Russell was airlifted out with the band.</p> <p>Born in Mount Kisco, upstate New York, in 1945, Russell fell in love with rock\u2019n\u2019roll after seeing Elvis Presley do the snake hips on TV. But it was the 1966 thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/blowup\">Blow-Up</a>, about a photographer who swaggers around swinging London photographing models, that really turned his head. \u201cI asked my dad to borrow money to buy a camera and got a plane to London with just the clothes on my back. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I knew I loved all of the British bands, but photographing them seemed impossible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80d5872e2d0d74d4af97aafca4e6596f819d1cb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80d5872e2d0d74d4af97aafca4e6596f819d1cb5/0_0_2533_3750/675.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I almost fell to my death\u2019 \u2026 the Beatles over Savile Row in 1969.\" width=\"675\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I almost fell to my death\u2019 \u2026 the Beatles over Savile Row in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ethan Russell/\u00a9 Apple Corps Ltd/All rights reserved</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Russell immediately felt at home in the city, which was a far cry from the turmoil gripping America as the Vietnam war intensified. Still, he felt slightly underwhelmed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a scene,\u201d he says. \u201cIn San Francisco, where I had been a student, everyone was smoking dope, and music was driving people\u2019s lives. But London was a bit drab. One was like an Eden, the other this monstrous urban metropolis. London had its charms, but you had to know the right people.\u201d</p> <p>Convinced that a career as a rock photographer was no longer possible, Russell started taking pictures at a children\u2019s hospital. Then one day, he noticed something from the top of a double-decker bus. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick up my car after a service \u2013 and I see John Lennon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/john-lennons-phantom-v-the-story-of-the-psychedelic-beatle-mobile-253088/\">psychedelic Rolls Royce</a> whizz past. I was jumping up and down like a little kid.\u201d</p> <p>It was a sign of things to come. A journalist called <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/author/jonathan-cott/\">Jonathan Cott</a>, who was a friend of his flatmate, needed a photographer for an interview \u2013 and Russell got the nod. The interview turned out to be with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger\">Mick Jagger</a>, for a feature in Rolling Stone magazine. That\u2019s quite a first gig. \u201cThen Jon called me again,\u201d says Russell, \u201cand asked if I wanted to come and photograph John Lennon. The rest, as they say, is history.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, it almost wasn\u2019t. \u201cI remember thinking my photos of John were no good,\u201d says Russell. \u201cSo I called him up and said they were shit. He said, \u2018Come on by.\u2019 And I took them again. There were no barriers between us: he was so human, so warm, present and giving. He was John fucking Lennon!

He had shot the singer a few months earlier, running on stage during a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

      "bodyText": "\u2018George Harrison was miserable from frame one to frame 500,\u201d says Ethan Russell. \u201cHe was so over it. I don\u2019t think he did anything but scowl for three hours.\u201d The photographer is recalling the day he unknowingly took the last ever shot of the Beatles together. It was 22 August 1969, and they were all at John Lennon\u2019s countryside estate near Ascot. \u201cPaul was trying to hold it together,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe had his arms crossed like, \u2018Come on, lads!\u2019 But the concept of the Beatles just didn\u2019t sync with who they were any more. I could have asked them to smile, but it would have been totally fake and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. This marriage had come to an end \u2013 and boy does it show.\u201d The fact that this hugely significant photograph isn\u2019t even one of Russell\u2019s best speaks volumes about his career. Over a prolific 10-year period that culminated in 1978, Russell shot the world\u2019s biggest rock stars, usually at their most candid. He had a ringside seat at what\u2019s often seen as rock\u2019s golden era. Russell wasn\u2019t just friends with Lennon and Yoko Ono, he knew their cat as well. And when pandemonium gripped 1969\u2019s Altamont free concert, where a fan was killed as the Rolling Stones played, Russell was airlifted out with the band. Born in Mount Kisco, upstate New York, in 1945, Russell fell in love with rock\u2019n\u2019roll after seeing Elvis Presley do the snake hips on TV. But it was the 1966 thriller Blow-Up, about a photographer who swaggers around swinging London photographing models, that really turned his head. \u201cI asked my dad to borrow money to buy a camera and got a plane to London with just the clothes on my back. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I knew I loved all of the British bands, but photographing them seemed impossible.\u201d Russell immediately felt at home in the city, which was a far cry from the turmoil gripping America as the Vietnam war intensified. Still, he felt slightly underwhelmed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a scene,\u201d he says. \u201cIn San Francisco, where I had been a student, everyone was smoking dope, and music was driving people\u2019s lives. But London was a bit drab. One was like an Eden, the other this monstrous urban metropolis. London had its charms, but you had to know the right people.\u201d Convinced that a career as a rock photographer was no longer possible, Russell started taking pictures at a children\u2019s hospital. Then one day, he noticed something from the top of a double-decker bus. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick up my car after a service \u2013 and I see John Lennon\u2019s psychedelic Rolls Royce whizz past. I was jumping up and down like a little kid.\u201d It was a sign of things to come. A journalist called Jonathan Cott, who was a friend of his flatmate, needed a photographer for an interview \u2013 and Russell got the nod. The interview turned out to be with Mick Jagger, for a feature in Rolling Stone magazine. That\u2019s quite a first gig. \u201cThen Jon called me again,\u201d says Russell, \u201cand asked if I wanted to come and photograph John Lennon. The rest, as they say, is history.\u201d Actually, it almost wasn\u2019t. \u201cI remember thinking my photos of John were no good,\u201d says Russell. \u201cSo I called him up and said they were shit. He said, \u2018Come on by.\u2019 And I took them again. There were no barriers between us: he was so human, so warm, present and giving. He was John fucking Lennon! How could John Lennon be being so nice to me?\u201d The two hit it off: the fact they both had long hair, spectacles and a penchant for spliffs only strengthened their bond. The trust they shared is evident in a beautiful shot Russell took of John and Yoko in their garden, with a black cat playing on the Beatle\u2019s shoulder. It wasn\u2019t long after their first meeting, yet Lennon already felt comfortable enough to ask Russell to take some spontaneous pictures of him and his girlfriend, who was causing a lot of controversy. \u201cI drove down to the house and no one was there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe front door was open so I just walked in. Yoko came down first, in this black cape, and said she wanted to show me something. She had got this brown parcel in the post and inside it was a doll with long black hair. It was dusted with charcoal and had pins viciously stabbed into its torso. There was a note that said, \u2018Leave John alone!\u2019\u201d He pauses, clearly moved. \u201cLook, they had the greatest love story of the 20th century. At a time of enormous sexism and racism, they managed to block it all out and create their own universe. That\u2019s what I wanted to show with my photographs. It was just the three of us and the cat \u2013 that\u2019s as intimate as it gets.\u201d Russell had become \u201cJohn\u2019s guy\u201d and in 1969 was brought in to capture the Let It Be sessions, alongside a film crew. It was a tumultuous time: the Beatles had split by the time the album came out. \u201cThe atmosphere was very tense,\u201d says Russell. \u201cYears later, I bumped into Ringo, but he didn\u2019t recognise me. He said it was because he was stoned out of his mind throughout Let It Be. I don\u2019t blame him as those were difficult times.\u201d Russell was one of the lucky few who got to cram on to the roof above the Apple studio on Savile Row for the Beatles\u2019 last public performance. Russell\u2019s wide shot from behind has lost none of its power half a century on. \u201cI had to climb up a wall and almost fell to my death.

The photo shows they were mere mortals after all.\u201d Russell was no longer struggling for work. In fact, he was hired for the Rolling Stones\u2019 now legendary Let It Bleed tour, which culminated in Altamont. \u201cIt was like being in Vietnam,\u201d says Russell. \u201cWe were airlifted out and it was traumatic for everybody. Our lives really were in danger. The happy hippy days had ended.\u201d Russell prefers to remember the good times. Backstage at a sold-out Stones show at Madison Square Garden, he remembers seeing Jimi Hendrix jamming with then Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. Although he felt intimidated by Hendrix, Russell\u2019s photograph captures a more down-to-earth side of the star. Later that night, Russell also bumped into Janis Joplin. He had shot the singer a few months earlier, running on stage during a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. It\u2019s a striking shot, with Joplin looking right down the barrel of his camera. \u201cShe was phenomenal,\u201d says Russell. \u201cHer voice was a force of nature. How I got on stage, I have no idea. But I ran on and took that. When I look at it now, I see her thinking, \u2018Who the fuck is that?\u2019\u201d And now their paths had crossed again at Madison Square Garden. \u201cI would usually leave the venue with the Stones in their limo, but it was completely full. This other black limo pulled up and a woman with a husky voice said she could give me a ride back to the hotel. I got in and I was on the back seat with Janis. She was drunk and coming on to me. I didn\u2019t really like it as I was way too uptight back then. I was so nervous, I got her to drop me off at the nearest hotel and ran for a cab.\u201d Not long after their encounter, Joplin died of a heroin overdose. \u201cIt was sad. She just couldn\u2019t beat her demons.\u201d Russell, who lives in Marin County, California, thinks two of his greatest photos are also the cheekiest. One shows Keith Richards in front of an anti-drugs poster at a US airport. In 1969, says Russell, things weren\u2019t druggy at all. But by 1972, when the shot was taken, everything had changed. \u201cThe Stones were taking dangerous quantities. I thought getting Keith to stand there was hilarious. It was ironic. People ask if I ever was tempted to take drugs with them, but I never worked high or drunk. All the people who wanted to be just like Keith ended up dead.\u201d The other cheeky shot was taken for the Who\u2019s landmark 1971 album Who\u2019s Next. Pete Townshend, the band\u2019s guitarist, was driving the band home from a gig through the rain at 100mph. \u201cI was terrified by Peter\u2019s driving,\u201d says Russell, who suddenly noticed a monolith as they were passing Easington colliery in County Durham and sensed it might make the perfect shot. \u201cOnly Peter actually pissed against it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rest was just cans I filled with water and poured down its sides. We thought it would be fun to show the band taking a loo break. The sky was put in later to give the photo this other-worldly quality. Without it, it would just be a boring grey English sky.\u201d Russell pretty much gave up on photography towards the end of the 70s, depressed and disillusioned after hearing music referred to as \u201cproduct\u201d by a studio executive while working on a shoot with the singer Linda Ronstadt. \u201cThe minute that\u2019s the mindset,\u201d he says, \u201cthey want product photography \u2013 and something dies.

But that\u2019s probably not the case. He didn\u2019t aim for the treble 20: he closed his eyes, flung some darts and one of them happened to hit it.

He occupies a fruitful insider-outsider space, delving into domestic politics, such as internet privacy and Vice-President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/22/john-oliver-gay-rabbit-book-parody-outsells-mike-pence-original-amazon\" title=\"\">Mike Pence\u2019s pet rabbit</a>, but also zooming out for a global perspective. Last Week Tonight\u2019s much-admired 20-minute segments have focused on topics including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/china-blocks-hbo-after-john-oliver-parody-of-xi-jinping\" title=\"\">the Chinese president, Xi Jinping</a>; Facebook\u2019s dangerous role in Myanmar; elections in India, Mexico and Brazil; and, of course, \u201ca few whacks at the Brexit pi\u00f1ata\u201d. This is like water in the desert for those left parched by America\u2019s TV news networks, which were insular before Trump and now pay even less heed to the wider world. Is Oliver consciously plugging a gap?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re plugging any gap,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the gap still exists, but it is a problem. It\u2019s difficult, because this country is going through a lot right now, so it\u2019s hard to make the case to viewers: \u2018Hey, I know you\u2019re thinking about this one thing right now; I need you to think about the Mexican election.\u2019 That\u2019s a tough sell to the viewers and then, just in terms of how you tell that story, it\u2019s complicated, because the Mexican election did not get a lot of coverage here, even on CNN International.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OubM8bD9kck\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OubM8bD9kck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>John Oliver\u2019s segment on the rise of Xi Jinping.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the end of the previous season, Oliver and his team of writers, researchers and producers deftly put the US in a wider context as he discussed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/it-smells-dirty-scandals-loom-over-bolsonaro-after-first-month-in-office\" title=\"\">the rise of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil</a> and authoritarian leaders around the world. \u201cI guess the thing that was fascinating to me, just as a very broad thesis in that story, was: every time we look at these stories and speak to experts on the ground in those countries, what they\u2019ll usually say is: \u2018In America, you\u2019re lucky, because the institutions are holding up.\u2019 The truth is, they\u2019re holding up so far, but institutions in themselves don\u2019t hold themselves up. They\u2019re inanimate objects; it\u2019s people that hold them up. So your last best hope is that Americans will continue to fight back if ever they see a major institution under threat,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s always reassuring when you see pushback to aggressive behaviour from the US government, just like it was edifying to see pushback to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/drones-us-military\" title=\"\">America\u2019s drone programme</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">the NSA</a>, but it\u2019s coming so thick and fast in the Trump presidency. I guess my worry is: how sustainable is this? When do people just start getting exhausted of being outraged by objectively outrageous behaviour all the time? When does it just become the background to people\u2019s lives? Because, at that point, you\u2019ve lost something.\u201d</p> <p>Such is the Trump marathon. We are all in it together, supporters and detractors alike, surviving one mile and one tweet at a time. How does Oliver keep going? The show itself is cathartic, he says. Then there is his beloved Liverpool football club. \u201cAs the world slides further and further away, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/23/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-champions-league-roma-mo-salah-brexit\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp [the manager] is such an icon of positivity</a>. I love the idea of being on the receiving end of one of his hugs, but I\u2019m probably too repressed to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment, he is every inch the Briton again, contemplating his favourite forward. \u201cI honestly think that Mo Salah might be my lifeline,\u201d he says. \u201cIf he goes, I\u2019ll think: \u2018OK, burn everything to the ground.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>Last Week Tonight With John Oliver premieres in the UK on </em><em>18 February at 10.10pm on Sky Atlantic and Now TV</em></p>",

He occupies a fruitful insider-outsider space, delving into domestic politics, such as internet privacy and Vice-President Mike Pence\u2019s pet rabbit, but also zooming out for a global perspective. Last Week Tonight\u2019s much-admired 20-minute segments have focused on topics including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping; Facebook\u2019s dangerous role in Myanmar; elections in India, Mexico and Brazil; and, of course, \u201ca few whacks at the Brexit pi\u00f1ata\u201d. This is like water in the desert for those left parched by America\u2019s TV news networks, which were insular before Trump and now pay even less heed to the wider world. Is Oliver consciously plugging a gap? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re plugging any gap,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the gap still exists, but it is a problem. It\u2019s difficult, because this country is going through a lot right now, so it\u2019s hard to make the case to viewers: \u2018Hey, I know you\u2019re thinking about this one thing right now; I need you to think about the Mexican election.\u2019 That\u2019s a tough sell to the viewers and then, just in terms of how you tell that story, it\u2019s complicated, because the Mexican election did not get a lot of coverage here, even on CNN International.\u201d At the end of the previous season, Oliver and his team of writers, researchers and producers deftly put the US in a wider context as he discussed the rise of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and authoritarian leaders around the world. \u201cI guess the thing that was fascinating to me, just as a very broad thesis in that story, was: every time we look at these stories and speak to experts on the ground in those countries, what they\u2019ll usually say is: \u2018In America, you\u2019re lucky, because the institutions are holding up.\u2019 The truth is, they\u2019re holding up so far, but institutions in themselves don\u2019t hold themselves up. They\u2019re inanimate objects; it\u2019s people that hold them up. So your last best hope is that Americans will continue to fight back if ever they see a major institution under threat,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s always reassuring when you see pushback to aggressive behaviour from the US government, just like it was edifying to see pushback to America\u2019s drone programme or the NSA, but it\u2019s coming so thick and fast in the Trump presidency. I guess my worry is: how sustainable is this? When do people just start getting exhausted of being outraged by objectively outrageous behaviour all the time? When does it just become the background to people\u2019s lives? Because, at that point, you\u2019ve lost something.\u201d Such is the Trump marathon. We are all in it together, supporters and detractors alike, surviving one mile and one tweet at a time. How does Oliver keep going? The show itself is cathartic, he says. Then there is his beloved Liverpool football club. \u201cAs the world slides further and further away, J\u00fcrgen Klopp [the manager] is such an icon of positivity. I love the idea of being on the receiving end of one of his hugs, but I\u2019m probably too repressed to enjoy it.\u201d For a moment, he is every inch the Briton again, contemplating his favourite forward. \u201cI honestly think that Mo Salah might be my lifeline,\u201d he says. \u201cIf he goes, I\u2019ll think: \u2018OK, burn everything to the ground.\u2019\u201d Last Week Tonight With John Oliver premieres in the UK on 18 February at 10.10pm on Sky Atlantic and Now TV",

      "bodyText": "Sir Lynton Crosby offered to work on a campaign to cancel the 2022 Qatar World Cup and get it awarded to another country in return for \u00a35.5m, according to a leaked plan that gives a rare insight into the activities of one of the world\u2019s best-known political operatives. The detailed pitch document \u2013 \u201ca proposal for a campaign to expose the truth of the Qatar regime and bring about the termination of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar\u201d \u2013 was written in April last year and personally signed by Crosby. He said that if engaged, his lobbying firm, CTF Partners, would require \u00a3300,000 a month for 18 months to focus on efforts to delegitimise the Qatari government and put pressure on Fifa to \u201crestart the bidding process\u201d and award the World Cup to another country. As part of the pitch document, named \u201cProject Ball\u201d, Crosby said CTF Partners could set up full-time war rooms around the world to spread negative stories about Qatar in the mainstream media, run fake grassroots campaigns on social media, and lobby potentially friendly politicians, journalists and academics. The pitch offers a glimpse into the secretive services offered by the Australian political strategist. Following success in his homeland he helped run the last four Conservative general election campaigns. He was given a knighthood by the former prime minister David Cameron after helping to secure an unexpected Conservative-majority government in the 2015 general election. Crosby is also close to the foreign former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has repeatedly described Crosby\u2019s use of the \u201cdead cat\u201d media strategy to distract journalists. Johnson recently received a \u00a320,000 interest-free loan from Crosby\u2019s company, which has since been repaid. Crosby\u2019s potential client for Project Ball was a self-styled Qatari opposition leader based in London named Khalid Al-Hail, who says he fled the Gulf country after being detained and tortured. Al-Hail has faced repeated questions over his funding and the nature of his campaign activities in London, which include his businesses paying MPs and prominent football players to appear at anti-Qatar events. His events have often aligned with the foreign policy objectives of Qatar\u2019s regional enemies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Al-Hail has previously insisted the funding is from his personal wealth; he denies receiving money from governments. Crosby\u2019s lawyers said no contract with Al-Hail was ever entered into and none of the work outlined in the proposal was undertaken. They insisted that the proposed work was \u201chardly controversial\u201d given widespread criticism of the Qatar World Cup bid and human rights in the Gulf country. \u201cIt is legitimate for one party to use the services of people/entities such as our clients to put important information into the public domain in an effective manner,\u201d said the lawyers for Crosby. CTF Partners confirmed it provided Al-Hail with \u201ca minimal amount of media advice\u201d during July\u2019s state visit to London by the emir of Qatar. During this visit a PR company that had previously worked with Al-Hail made a disastrously farcical attempt to pay hundreds of actors to protest outside Downing Street during the emir\u2019s visit to see Theresa May. CTF said it had no role in organising the fake protests and ceased all involvement with Al-Hail \u201cupon hearing about such matters\u201d. Crosby did not respond to a request for comment on claims his company also provided PR support for the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman during his state visit to the UK last year. The pitch document was seen by the Guardian and the campaign group Spinwatch as part of an investigation into how the UK has become a major centre for global lobbying campaigns as part of the proxy war in the Middle East. In the document Crosby lays out a proposal to coalesce global criticism of Qatar into a single narrative and \u201cexpose and undermine the actions of the current regime\u201d in Doha, including linking the state\u2019s activities to terrorism in the minds of the public. \u201cCTF Partners has decades of experience in running campaigns that change or reinforce voter opinions and behaviour,\u201d Crosby said in the document. \u201cThat experience tells us that an integrated campaign, professionally run and deploying all the levers of influence available can be successful. We are confident that though challenging this is equally the case with putting pressure on Fifa to strip Qatar of its right to host the World Cup as for any other campaign that we have run.\u201d During the last year Crosby\u2019s company has donated gifts worth tens of thousands of pounds to Tory MPs. In November 2017 cabinet ministers and dozens of Tory MPs, including the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, gathered for CTF\u2019s annual Christmas party at the V&amp;A museum. Al-Hail, who has financed a series of lavish anti-Qatar events in London over the last 18 months featuring leading politicians and football players, has always insisted the events are funded with his personal wealth. He did not respond to requests for comment on this story. In the pitch document, Crosby told Al-Hail that, if engaged, CTF Partners would require \u00a3300,000 a month plus VAT to work to undermine the credibility of Qatar\u2019s government. This was on top of more than \u00a3100,000 to conduct research that would associate Doha with terrorism in the minds of the public. In addition, CTF Partners would put direct pressure on Fifa to reverse the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar by establishing campaign bases in London, Washington DC, Milan, Sydney and Canberra. \u201cWe would identify all potential \u2018allies\u2019 in the media, politics, industry, academia, and government and reach out to them guiding a deliberate attempt to inform and motivate them about the need to reconsider Qatar\u2019s hosting of the World Cup in 2022,\u201d the document said. Crosby said his company could also run online campaigns to put Qatar under pressure, using Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat to turn members of the public into campaigning tools. \u201cThe focus for our dedicated team would be to create activity and interaction, encouraging users to join an online community, sign up, share with their family and friends, like an activity or watch and participate in an event. These supporters can then be mobilised to communicate directly with key decision-makers at Fifa. Crosby\u2019s proposal also offered to monitor and provide \u201cmetrics\u201d to Al-Hail on the activities of members of the public who were willing to take online action against Qatar, in addition to running a global media campaign. \u201cNo false, misleading or unfair claim about Qatar or its World Cup should be allowed to be unchallenged,\u201d said Crosby. \u201cThe campaign should operate on the basis of rapid rebuttal \u2013 always ensuring a vacuum is not left to be filled by Qatar or any of the country\u2019s supporters. As with all other aspects of the campaign this would be the responsibility of a dedicated team.\u201d Qatar\u2019s World Cup bid has been repeatedly accused of bribing Fifa officials during the selection process - claims that have been vehemently denied - and criticised for disregarding the human rights of those building the infrastructure for the tournament. Crosby is not the first overseas individual to discuss anti-Qatar campaigns with Al-Hail. One of Al-Hail\u2019s previous attempts at organising an anti-Qatar event in London saw him employ the services of Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills, the chairman of the British Monarchist Society, who adopts an English accent for his work as a royal TV pundit but was later exposed as an Italian-American who grew up in upstate New York.",

Eight years ago they would do that in tribute to the consecutive promotions he brought them; this time the tunes were laced with ridicule, and the travails of his increasingly desperate Ipswich team were far from the only material at hand.</p> <p>It will take some turnaround in both teams\u2019 fortunes if this fixture is to be contested next season but the game itself, an ultimately routine win that slightly flattered Norwich but put them two points clear at the top of the Championship, will be remembered less vividly than the flashpoint that erupted in first-half stoppage time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/09/football-league-birmingham-hold-on-in-seven-goal-thriller-at-qpr\">Football League: Birmingham hold on in seven-goal thriller at QPR</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Norwich had flown out of the traps and taken an early lead, Onel Hern\u00e1ndez sweeping Mario Vrancic\u2019s header into the net within 82 seconds, but Ipswich were making a game of it by the time their midfielder, Jon Nolan, scythed Max Aarons down with a poor challenge in front of the dugouts.</p> <p>Players from both sides piled in and at first glance it was simply a case of derby-day passions overspilling. But Lambert took exception to Norwich\u2019s behaviour and his wrath sparked a ruck in front of the home bench that led to the seething Ipswich manager shaking off the attention of a steward before being ushered away by a police officer.</p> <p>The situation had barely calmed before Lambert and the Norwich head of performance, Chris Domogalla, were shown red cards by Peter Bankes. Domogalla had been an innocent party and the animus had seemingly been between Lambert and the hosts\u2019 assistant head coach, Edmund Riemer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand there and watch players run 30 yards to get people booked,\u201d Lambert said, explaining the initial cause of his aggravation. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not going to let somebody come into my technical area, I don\u2019t even know who it was, to provoke us. So I stand my ground, yeah. Do I regret it? No, I\u2019m certainly not going to have that.\u201d</p> <p>If nothing else it gave Lambert ammunition for his half-time team talk and Ipswich emerged fiercely, coming close to an equaliser through Alan Judge in the 65th minute. But they are nine points shy of safety for a reason and, within seconds of that near-miss, the game was put beyond them.</p> <p>Teemu Pukki\u2019s finish, slotted beyond Bartosz Bialkowski after Emi Buend\u00eda had played him through, oozed the composure of a striker scoring his 19th goal of the season and the Finland international repeated the trick via the same provider 10 minutes from time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f7506072a929945174eaef23953213dc5d77a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7506072a929945174eaef23953213dc5d77a0c/0_110_2300_1380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ipswich manager Paul Lambert is talked to by a policeman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ipswich manager Paul Lambert is talked to by a policeman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony O\u2019brien/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re really honest, we were too good today and for that it\u2019s a well-deserved win,\u201d said the Norwich manager, Daniel Farke. His side had been clinical, converting their three shots on target. But the off-pitch squabble continued into the post-match press conferences, Farke stressing his respect for Lambert but aiming a barb at some of his colleagues.</p> <p>\u201cNinety-five percent of Ipswich [took the defeat] really well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some of their staff, my feeling was they wanted to use today as their big stage to prove something. You can lose games but show some quality, show some style, show some class.\u201d</p> <p>Presumably words had been exchanged at full-time but Lambert\u2019s mood darkened further on hearing Farke\u2019s remarks. \u201cIs that what he said? I certainly won\u2019t have him talking about my own staff. Lack of class? Look at his own staff first before he comments on anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>Lambert also referenced the \u201cshort memories\u201d where his successes at Carrow Road are concerned. But the stark truth for Ipswich is impressive long-term recall is required to picture their last derby success, a decade ago this April, and on present evidence the wait is about to get significantly longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The most galling aspect of a torrid match for Paul Lambert may be that by the end it was the Norwich supporters singing his name. Eight years ago they would do that in tribute to the consecutive promotions he brought them; this time the tunes were laced with ridicule, and the travails of his increasingly desperate Ipswich team were far from the only material at hand. It will take some turnaround in both teams\u2019 fortunes if this fixture is to be contested next season but the game itself, an ultimately routine win that slightly flattered Norwich but put them two points clear at the top of the Championship, will be remembered less vividly than the flashpoint that erupted in first-half stoppage time. Norwich had flown out of the traps and taken an early lead, Onel Hern\u00e1ndez sweeping Mario Vrancic\u2019s header into the net within 82 seconds, but Ipswich were making a game of it by the time their midfielder, Jon Nolan, scythed Max Aarons down with a poor challenge in front of the dugouts. Players from both sides piled in and at first glance it was simply a case of derby-day passions overspilling. But Lambert took exception to Norwich\u2019s behaviour and his wrath sparked a ruck in front of the home bench that led to the seething Ipswich manager shaking off the attention of a steward before being ushered away by a police officer. The situation had barely calmed before Lambert and the Norwich head of performance, Chris Domogalla, were shown red cards by Peter Bankes. Domogalla had been an innocent party and the animus had seemingly been between Lambert and the hosts\u2019 assistant head coach, Edmund Riemer. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand there and watch players run 30 yards to get people booked,\u201d Lambert said, explaining the initial cause of his aggravation. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not going to let somebody come into my technical area, I don\u2019t even know who it was, to provoke us. So I stand my ground, yeah. Do I regret it? No, I\u2019m certainly not going to have that.\u201d If nothing else it gave Lambert ammunition for his half-time team talk and Ipswich emerged fiercely, coming close to an equaliser through Alan Judge in the 65th minute. But they are nine points shy of safety for a reason and, within seconds of that near-miss, the game was put beyond them. Teemu Pukki\u2019s finish, slotted beyond Bartosz Bialkowski after Emi Buend\u00eda had played him through, oozed the composure of a striker scoring his 19th goal of the season and the Finland international repeated the trick via the same provider 10 minutes from time. \u201cIf we\u2019re really honest, we were too good today and for that it\u2019s a well-deserved win,\u201d said the Norwich manager, Daniel Farke. His side had been clinical, converting their three shots on target. But the off-pitch squabble continued into the post-match press conferences, Farke stressing his respect for Lambert but aiming a barb at some of his colleagues. \u201cNinety-five percent of Ipswich [took the defeat] really well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some of their staff, my feeling was they wanted to use today as their big stage to prove something. You can lose games but show some quality, show some style, show some class.\u201d Presumably words had been exchanged at full-time but Lambert\u2019s mood darkened further on hearing Farke\u2019s remarks. \u201cIs that what he said? I certainly won\u2019t have him talking about my own staff. Lack of class? Look at his own staff first before he comments on anyone else.\u201d Lambert also referenced the \u201cshort memories\u201d where his successes at Carrow Road are concerned. But the stark truth for Ipswich is impressive long-term recall is required to picture their last derby success, a decade ago this April, and on present evidence the wait is about to get significantly longer.",

      "bodyText": "In 2016 the human rights organisation Amnesty International released a report ranking social media companies according to their performance on privacy and freedom of expression. In the heady, pre-Cambridge Analytica days, Facebook came first with a score of 73, and the Chinese gaming and investment company Tencent came last with 0. Amnesty said Tencent was the only firm one that had not stated it would refuse government requests to access data. Yet last week the company expanded its already voluminous investments in non-Chinese technology companies by ploughing a reported $150m (\u00a3116m) into the discussion forum and aggregator Reddit, which has nearly 600 million users. Tencent joins a long and diverse line of investors in the platform including the rapper Snoop Dogg, the actor Jared Leto and the Silicon Valley billionaire and Donald Trump supporter Peter Thiel. On the Reddit discussion threads (known as subreddits) that focus on China, along with the reliable smattering of jokes and political polemics, users expressed concern that certain subreddits contained discussions of the best ways to avoid the country\u2019s stringent censorship laws. Many pointed out the ultimate irony that Reddit is, itself, currently banned in China. Tencent also has a 10% stakeholding in the social media company Snap (owners of Snapchat), as well as Tesla and hundreds of other technology companies around the world. Outside China, Tencent and its own social platform WeChat are becoming increasingly well known. Tencent has offices around the world including US headquarters in Palo Alto in the heart of Silicon Valley. WeChat, which now has more than a billion users, is not only wildly popular within China, but its ease of use and the completeness of its services, which include payment and banking, make it the default social app for many Chinese speakers and immigrant communities across the globe. The Toronto Star recently reported on how the app was being used in Canadian elections to reach Chinese-speaking voters. It even attracted investigation into vote buying as WeChat users were, in one instance, reportedly offered free rides to polling stations if they were voting for particular candidates. The relationship between corporate China and western technology companies, particularly social platforms and search engines that profess free expression and privacy protection as core values, is often contradictory and increasingly alarming to free speech and human rights advocates. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, the investor and philanthropist George Soros described the Chinese president Xi Jinping as the \u201cmost dangerous opponent of open societies\u201d, particularly in terms of China\u2019s growing dominance in artificial intelligence. \u201cThe instruments of control developed by AI give inherent advantages to authoritarian societies,\u201d said Soros.

At a conference about digital media technology platforms at Columbia University last week, co-hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism (disclosure: I am the Tow Center director), journalists, policy experts and human rights activists discussed increasing censorship in the country and the spread of Chinese political influence through corporate activity outside it. Becky Davis, the bureau chief for Variety in China, helps to compile an annual survey of foreign correspondents there.

In her reporting on Chinese social media platforms, Chiu has covered the Communist party\u2019s attitude towards the explosion of new entertainment and news apps: \u201cThere are companies who are really trying to take advantage of the app culture in China, but the government is upping its ante to put pressure on companies to make sure, however big they become, they are still under the thumb of the state.\u201d Two weeks ago, Xi Jinping toured the People\u2019s Daily new media bureau.

When the Nobel peace prize-winner Liu Xiaobo died of cancer recently while on medical leave from an 11-year prison sentence, Chiu said any image of him in a WeChat message never reached its recipient \u2013 \u201ceven cartoonified images\u201d \u2013demonstrating how efficient AI already is at screening out dissent. Nobody expects the Communist party to extend its power directly through investments in companies like Reddit, but the normalisation of a repressive regime through its embrace of a type of state capitalism deserves wider attention. The creation of concentration camps for a million Uighurs in Xinjiang has not been enough to persuade any of the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs receiving funds from Chinese companies to refuse the cash. Neither is it apparently enough of a deterrent to stop the US companies investing in China to stop their plans to enter the market.

It has turned down NHS England\u2019s offer of \u00a3500m over five years for the use of its medicines.</p> <p>In financial results that will inflame the row, the company has posted a 40% increase in revenues for the last quarter of 2018, with records suggesting it has around \u00a32.3bn in the bank.

The price they want for Orkambi is simply unjust.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting Vertex bosses on Monday and will demand a fairer deal.

      "bodyText": "A pharmaceutical giant charging the NHS an unaffordable price for a life-changing drug has further angered campaigners after posting a huge increase in its revenues. Ministers are already under pressure to step in over the price of Orkambi, a cystic fibrosis drug that could extend the lives of thousands of children. Vertex, its manufacturer, has set a price of \u00a3104,000 per patient per year for the drug. It has turned down NHS England\u2019s offer of \u00a3500m over five years for the use of its medicines. In financial results that will inflame the row, the company has posted a 40% increase in revenues for the last quarter of 2018, with records suggesting it has around \u00a32.3bn in the bank. The results come as the company prepares to face a parliamentary inquiry over its demands. Talks with the NHS have been stalled since last summer. Vertex also reported that net income in the last quarter more than doubled, from $158m (\u00a3122m) to $337m. It said this jump in profits was \u201clargely driven by the strong growth in total CF [cystic fibrosis] product revenues\u201d. Campaigners have called on the government to use an obscure law to allow the drug to be produced more cheaply. Under the 1977 Patents Act the state can effectively override a patent in the national interest, but the provision has rarely been used. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder, primarily affecting the lungs. While treatments have helped more children survive into adulthood, half will die before the age of 32. Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThose living with cystic fibrosis who are currently denied this life-saving drug will be disgusted at these profits. This big pharma firm, by refusing to play fair with the NHS, is holding lives to ransom. The price they want for Orkambi is simply unjust. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Vertex bosses on Monday and will demand a fairer deal. If they refuse to budge, ministers should step in and use what means they have to ensure an affordable version of Orkambi is available for those who need it.\u201d There are more than 10,000 people with cystic fibrosis in the UK and it is thought at least half could benefit from being prescribed Orkambi. A deal for its use in Scotland is expected soon. Rebecca Hunt, a vice-president at the company, said: \u201cVertex confirms that we will be participating in the forthcoming public hearing of the health and social care committee on 7 March. Out of respect for the parliamentary process, we will not be providing further updates at this time.\u201d",

When his company, Terra Firma, took over EMI, it was still the home of blue-chip acts such as Queen, Kate Bush, David Bowie, Coldplay, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Like many private equity outfits, Terra Firma specialises in leveraged buyouts of underperforming companies, which it puts back in the black and sells on for profit. Hands was a master of the pre-crash universe. </p> <p>Over the past 15 years, Eamonn Forde has built a reputation as one of the music industry\u2019s most authoritative commentators. <em>The Final Days of EMI</em>, his first book, is an unsparing, follow-the-money inquest into the label\u2019s ill-starred encounter with Hands. It\u2019s primarily a business tale, but it says so much about 21st-century Britain and how we arrived where we are now.</p> <p>Forde\u2019s story starts in 1996, the year I began working at EMI. When I arrived, Robbie Williams was our big hope, but his debut album, <em>Life Thru a Lens</em>, was tanking. Staff were persuaded to attend his tiny London gigs until one of his singles, Angels, became a hit. It was a pleasant place to work, but play time was over. The young employees who turned up in sunglasses at 4pm to read the <em>Evening Standard</em> and watch music channel the Box for an hour before heading back to celebrity haunt the Met Bar were being sidelined. The suits were worming their way in, clutching their key performance indicators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What makes it more than a tale of suits squabbling is the awkward, capricious figure of Hands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With cool precision, Forde explains why EMI was the weakest of the big four major labels in America, music\u2019s biggest market. Although it had many of the world\u2019s best-known rock acts, EMI rarely released new material and, as the CD era was ending, back catalogue revenues were limited.

      "bodyText": "If the dismemberment of Britain\u2019s biggest music company in 2011 was a cultural tragedy, then private equity buccaneer Guy Hands wore the bloodied gloves. When his company, Terra Firma, took over EMI, it was still the home of blue-chip acts such as Queen, Kate Bush, David Bowie, Coldplay, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Like many private equity outfits, Terra Firma specialises in leveraged buyouts of underperforming companies, which it puts back in the black and sells on for profit. Hands was a master of the pre-crash universe. Over the past 15 years, Eamonn Forde has built a reputation as one of the music industry\u2019s most authoritative commentators. The Final Days of EMI, his first book, is an unsparing, follow-the-money inquest into the label\u2019s ill-starred encounter with Hands. It\u2019s primarily a business tale, but it says so much about 21st-century Britain and how we arrived where we are now. Forde\u2019s story starts in 1996, the year I began working at EMI. When I arrived, Robbie Williams was our big hope, but his debut album, Life Thru a Lens, was tanking. Staff were persuaded to attend his tiny London gigs until one of his singles, Angels, became a hit. It was a pleasant place to work, but play time was over. The young employees who turned up in sunglasses at 4pm to read the Evening Standard and watch music channel the Box for an hour before heading back to celebrity haunt the Met Bar were being sidelined. The suits were worming their way in, clutching their key performance indicators. With cool precision, Forde explains why EMI was the weakest of the big four major labels in America, music\u2019s biggest market. Although it had many of the world\u2019s best-known rock acts, EMI rarely released new material and, as the CD era was ending, back catalogue revenues were limited. It was far more exposed to risk than its rivals Universal, Sony and Warners, which attracted more globally successful pop and rap stars. And with downloads swiftly superseding physical product, all four companies were fighting over smaller shares every year. EMI\u2019s board was actively looking for a way out in 2007 when Hands\u2019s Terra Firma made a \u00a34.2bn bid, blowing any potential competition out of the water \u2013 the first of Hands\u2019s many mistakes. Terra Firma probably overpaid by \u00a31bn. Forde\u2019s extensive interviews with key players enliven The Final Days of EMI, preventing it from being derailed by endless statistics and legal detail. No, it wasn\u2019t Hands\u2019s fault that the crash happened so soon after he bought the company. But the takeover says so much about big finance\u2019s philistinism. Terra Firma butchered one of our great cultural assets because it assumed it was just another business, another set of figures on a spreadsheet. Hands and co failed to grasp that so much of a record label\u2019s value is dependent on its relationships with often awkward artists. And long before the end of Terra Firma\u2019s reign, nearly all of its big acts had walked away, appalled. What makes The Final Days of EMI more than a tale of suits squabbling is the awkward, capricious figure of Hands. If this story were a Greek tragedy he would, as Forde vividly illustrates, be both protagonist and antagonist. And his company\u2019s failure tells us much about our times. From downsizing to digital\u2019s displacement of analogue to the disposability of everything \u2013 all are now a fixture of our public life.

After a week of being kept awake, a 19th-century Chinese merchant who had been sentenced to death by sleep deprivation was begging for \u201cthe blessed opportunity of being strangled, guillotined, burned to death, drowned, garrotted, shot, quartered, blown up with gunpowder, or put to death in any conceivable way their humanity or ferocity could invent\u201d.</p> <p>If you want to know what it\u2019s like to suffer the horrors of sleep deprivation, try reducing the number of hours you sleep.

When I was diagnosed in the 1990s, if I explained to someone I had narcolepsy and was met by an astonished stare, I soon learned it was because they thought I had just told them I had necrophilia or nymphomania. Nowadays, most people know it is a disabling neurological condition in which sleep strikes with little or no warning repeatedly through the day. This is progress, but there are still those \u2013 particularly who have insomnia \u2013 under the misapprehension that narcolepsy is a restful consummation devoutly to be wished. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. This is because the sleep of narcolepsy is not healthy, restorative sleep, but is seriously disturbed, shot through by hallucination-like dreams. Sometimes the exquisite internally directed narratives are stunning. Often they are intensely stressful and disturbing. But they always interfere with the architecture of sleep. Just as sleep repeatedly interferes with my ability to stay awake during the day, wakefulness intrudes on my sleep at night so often that it\u2019s worth nothing. Narcolepsy is about being simultaneously overslept and sleep-deprived. It can be a confusing place to be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Few of us see snoring as a sleep disorder but it's hard to ignore if you're the other person in bed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Interfering with this general architecture is not good.

Anyone who\u2019s had children can testify to the psychological weathering that results from fractured sleep. It is pretty clear that the brain would rather not be disturbed.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are many ways to damage the architecture of sleep and most follow from the way we live. Obesity poses a problem for sleep quality, largely through the burden it places on the respiratory system. As one sleep specialist told me: \u201cWhen you are fat, you put your fat in your tongue and you reduce the size of your airway.\u201d</p> <p>By far the most common breathing-related sleep disorder is snoring, the noise resulting in an unhealthy number of partial or complete arousals during the night. When we fall asleep, most of the muscles around the body relax, including those at the back of the mouth. This would not normally be a problem, but it becomes one if the fleshy tissue in the throat closes in on itself in such a way that it blocks the airway. Few of us see snoring as a sleep disorder, let alone one that can have serious, even life-threatening consequences. Purrings, occasional gurgles and gentle buzzes during sleep might not seem like much of a concern, but when these become persistent snorts, whistles and stentorian raspings, snoring is harder to ignore, particularly if you are the other person in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dac49f274c330c005ff74465bee11dcd6f98c2ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dac49f274c330c005ff74465bee11dcd6f98c2ce/0_0_2873_1724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of man lying awake in bed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alec Doherty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Alec Doherty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pathological endpoint of snoring is sleep apnoea, where the airways shut completely and the incessant noise ceases for 10 seconds or more.

The <a href=\"https://britishsnoring.co.uk/stop_bang_questionnaire.php\" title=\"\">StopBang questionnaire </a>is useful in this regard: eight simple questions about snoring, tiredness, observed apnoeas, blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference and gender. It was devised by anaesthetists to screen prospective patients for erratic breathing during sleep that might cause complications during and after surgery. Do you snore loudly? Do you often feel tired or sleepy during the daytime? Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep? Do you have or are you being treated for high blood pressure? Is your body mass index greater than 35 kg/m2? Are you over 50? Is your neck circumference greater than 40cm? Are you male? If the answer is yes to three or more of these questions, there is a 90% chance that you have some degree of apnoea.</p> <p>There are lots of ways to tackle snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea. The most obvious is to lose weight. In Brazil, K\u00e1tia Guimar\u00e3es and colleagues have taken a series of exercises developed for speech therapy and demonstrated that they can reduce neck circumference, snoring intensity and the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea, with substantial improvements in the quality of sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. They are designed to tone the tongue, the soft palate and the facial muscles. They involve a toothbrush, a balloon, some guttural utterances, plenty of sucking and some side-to-side jaw movement. If it is too late for interventions like these, it is time to turn to your GP, who may prescribe the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. In essence it is a fan, a tube and a face mask. The mask is strapped to the patient\u2019s face at night and the fan blows air into the lungs, sufficient to keep the airways open but not so strong that the patient wakes or cannot exhale.</p> <p>There are other sleep disorders that involve partial arousal of the brain during deep sleep and these also damage its quality. Most people have had night terrors, talked or walked in their sleep, but for some these so-called parasomnias happen every night. There seems to be a genetic predisposition, often in combination with an environmental stress.</p> <p>Even without any of these recognised sleep disorders, there are many things that cause problems for the way the brain would like to rest. Light pollution (in cities and in the home) interferes with sleep quantity, but it probably affects sleep quality too. Sound pollution is not dissimilar, with even quiet noises having a demonstrable impact on sleep quality. Legal recreational highs, such as nicotine and alcohol, also affect the ability to sustain sleep.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have an anchor time, the same time, to get up every morning, even at weekends, so as to give my brain a clear routine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the brain could have its say, it would politely request that we all pay more attention to protecting not just the quantity but also the quality of our sleep. In my efforts to manage the many disabling symptoms of narcolepsy, I have learned I sleep best when I control as many of these variables a possible. I have become obsessive about access to natural light and careful of artificial wavelengths after the sun has set; I have an anchor time, the same time, to get up every morning (even at weekends) so as to give my brain a clear routine; I lost enough weight to stop snoring; I wear earplugs to shut out the city soundscape; I take medication to prevent the too-frequent dreaming of narcolepsy. As narcolepsy is an incurable disorder resulting from the loss of sleep-regulating neurons in the centre of the brain, there is a limit to what I can do.

It was reported on Sunday that police have investigated more than 30 cases of child rape since 2015 where victims evaded age checks on dating apps. Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said: \u201cI will be writing to these companies asking what measures they have in place to keep children safe from harm, including verifying their age.

The youngest victim was said to be eight years old. Last week a man who spent a night with a 12-year-old girl he thought was 19 and whom he had met on a popular adult dating app was jailed for two and a half years. Carl Hodgson, 28, who pleaded guilty to a number of charges, invited the child to his flat in Manchester city centre a few days after they first made contact via an app. The victim used a different name on her dating app profile and falsely stated she was 19, Manchester crown court was told. Social media companies are facing renewed demands from the government to protect children from harmful online content, amid growing concerns over suicide and self-harm among teenagers. Last month Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warned companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter that he would use the law to force them to act should they fail to remove inappropriate content. Grindr told the Sunday Times: \u201cAny account of sexual abuse or other illegal behaviour is troubling to us as well as a clear violation of our terms of service. Our team is constantly working to improve our digital and human screening tools to prevent and remove improper underage use of our app.\u201d Tinder said it used both automated and manual tools to moderate users, including scanning profiles for \u201cred flag\u201d images, and said it also depended on users to report profiles that may belong to a minor.

They took advantage of damage caused by stormy weather to stage a breakout, which visitors caught on film. It comes after a red panda cub called Amber was found in a garden less than a mile from the zoo after it escaped from its enclosure last month. The latest bid for freedom was made by chimps who used a branch as a makeshift ladder and scaled high walls surrounding their pen on Saturday. Visitors described seeing one of the escapees emerge from the bushes on to a path while others were sitting on top of their enclosure wall. In footage posted on social media, a child can be heard exclaiming: \u201cDon\u2019t escape, you bad little gorilla.\u201d Zookeeper Alyn Cairns said trees in the enclosure had been weakened by the storms, allowing the chimps to break them and use them as a ladder to escape.

      "body": "<p>This year marks a centenary of sorts. Back in 1919, with the first world war finally over, Britain woke up to a new reality. The days of being the world\u2019s pre-eminent economic power were in the past.</p> <p>In truth, the writing had been on the wall before 1914. The US and Germany had caught up with Britain before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/08/first-world-war-franz-ferdinand-sarajevo\">the assassination at Sarajevo</a> and were forging ahead in the new sectors that had sprung up around the turn of the 20th century. Even in industries where the UK had traditionally been strong, such as coal, rival countries were much faster to deploy new, productivity-raising technology.</p> <p>Even so, the aftermath of the first world war \u2013 a raging boom and a colossal bust in the space of just a couple of years \u2013 came as a shock. The staple industries of the 19th century \u2013 coal, textiles, shipbuilding \u2013 were all facing challenging times. Whereas the industrial north had been more prosperous than the rural south in Britain\u2019s mid-Victorian heyday, 100 years ago today\u2019s marked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/north-south-divide\">regional divide</a> was already emerging.</p> <p>Those responsible for running the British economy have been afflicted by two seemingly incompatible sentiments ever since: a sense that, even when the economy is going through a good patch, something bad is sure to happen; and a belief that somewhere there is a magic ingredient that will solve the economy\u2019s problems. In the 1920s, it was going back on the Gold Standard. In the 1930s it was coming off the Gold Standard. In the 1940s it was state control of the commanding heights of the economy. In the 1950s it was Keynesian demand management.</p> <p>And so it went on. William Keegan, my colleague on the Observer, has just published <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/nine-crises\">a memoir</a>* detailing the nine crises he has covered, and the many agreeable lunches he has eaten, in his illustrious journalistic career. Full of sharp insights and beautifully written, the book takes up the story from when Keegan arrived in Fleet Street in the early 1960s.</p> <p>This was the time when Britain\u2019s inferiority complex became acute. The US had emerged from the second world war as the west\u2019s unchallenged economic powerhouse and the UK grudgingly accepted that. Harder to swallow was that countries on the losing side in the war \u2013 Germany and Japan \u2013 and those that had been occupied \u2013 France and the Netherlands \u2013 all seemed to be doing better.</p> <p>While not agreeing with Keegan about everything \u2013 we are on opposite sides in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;q=Brexit+Guardian\">Brexit </a>debate - his book chronicles how Britain has responded to this challenge.</p> <p>There have been times when attempts were made to tackle the economy\u2019s deep structural problems. Harold Wilson\u2019s government in the 1960s created a department of employment and productivity because it knew the economy needed to be more efficient. The Thatcher government in the 1980s had a supply-side reform agenda that involved privatisation, deregulation and shifting the emphasis of industrial strategy from manufacturing to making the City a global financial centre. Labour\u2019s big idea under Tony Blair was \u201ceducation, education, education\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c08f5d16fca47a4b434e8d724a3bc460663c321\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c08f5d16fca47a4b434e8d724a3bc460663c321/0_7_1375_825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair (third from right) and shadow cabinet members.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under Tony Blair, Labour\u2019s big idea was \u2018education, education, education\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/EMPICS Sports Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why has there been no lasting economic renaissance? Well, for a start, as Keegan illustrates, some almighty macro-economic blunders have hindered supply-side reform: the failure of Wilson to devalue the pound as soon as he arrived in office in 1964; the monetarist experiment of the early 1980s and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism</a> in 1990 among them.</p> <p>But there\u2019s more to it than that. Getting the big picture right \u2013 interest rates, the level of the pound, tax and spending policy \u2013 matters a lot but it is not everything. A real transformation of the economy requires three things: an understanding of the problem; a set of policies to tackle the weaknesses identified and, crucially, a willingness to abandon strategies when they don\u2019t work and to stick them when there\u2019s a chance that they will.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite easy to say what\u2019s been going wrong. For decades Britain has imported more than it has exported, finance is too strong and manufacturing too weak, there has been a ready supply of new ideas but a failure to develop their commercial potential, and businesses have struggled to get long-term funding and workers with the appropriate skill levels.</p> <p>Tackling the weaknesses has proved harder because there are wildly divergent views about what should be done. Britain has had most things in the past century, from a command economy during the second world war to Thatcherism in the 1980s. There has been an appreciation that lessons can be learned from other countries. The issue has been deciding which one to learn from.</p> <p>But it is the lack of patience that has been the most marked trait of the past 100 years, the sense that there is a shortcut to success if only it can be found. At various times this has been a national plan, devaluation, money supply targets, joining the ERM and leaving the ERM. There have been governments that tried to \u201cdash for growth\u201d in the belief that Britain can burst through to a higher level of productivity, and there have been governments that thought they could cut their way to growth. Joining what was then the Common Market was seen as the answer in the 1960s and early 1970s.</p> <p>By the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/24/eu-referendum-brexit-live-europe-leave-remain-britain\">the 2016 referendum</a>, it was clear that Britain still had deep structural problems, but that those of the countries so admired in the 1960s were just as bad if not worse. There is now an opportunity, for remainers as well as leavers, to put things right. There is no guarantee the opportunity will be taken, of course.</p> <p>* <a href=\"https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/nine-crises\">Nine crises by William Keegan, published by Biteback</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>.</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "This year marks a centenary of sorts. Back in 1919, with the first world war finally over, Britain woke up to a new reality. The days of being the world\u2019s pre-eminent economic power were in the past. In truth, the writing had been on the wall before 1914. The US and Germany had caught up with Britain before the assassination at Sarajevo and were forging ahead in the new sectors that had sprung up around the turn of the 20th century. Even in industries where the UK had traditionally been strong, such as coal, rival countries were much faster to deploy new, productivity-raising technology. Even so, the aftermath of the first world war \u2013 a raging boom and a colossal bust in the space of just a couple of years \u2013 came as a shock. The staple industries of the 19th century \u2013 coal, textiles, shipbuilding \u2013 were all facing challenging times. Whereas the industrial north had been more prosperous than the rural south in Britain\u2019s mid-Victorian heyday, 100 years ago today\u2019s marked regional divide was already emerging. Those responsible for running the British economy have been afflicted by two seemingly incompatible sentiments ever since: a sense that, even when the economy is going through a good patch, something bad is sure to happen; and a belief that somewhere there is a magic ingredient that will solve the economy\u2019s problems. In the 1920s, it was going back on the Gold Standard. In the 1930s it was coming off the Gold Standard. In the 1940s it was state control of the commanding heights of the economy. In the 1950s it was Keynesian demand management. And so it went on. William Keegan, my colleague on the Observer, has just published a memoir* detailing the nine crises he has covered, and the many agreeable lunches he has eaten, in his illustrious journalistic career. Full of sharp insights and beautifully written, the book takes up the story from when Keegan arrived in Fleet Street in the early 1960s. This was the time when Britain\u2019s inferiority complex became acute. The US had emerged from the second world war as the west\u2019s unchallenged economic powerhouse and the UK grudgingly accepted that. Harder to swallow was that countries on the losing side in the war \u2013 Germany and Japan \u2013 and those that had been occupied \u2013 France and the Netherlands \u2013 all seemed to be doing better. While not agreeing with Keegan about everything \u2013 we are on opposite sides in the Brexit debate - his book chronicles how Britain has responded to this challenge. There have been times when attempts were made to tackle the economy\u2019s deep structural problems. Harold Wilson\u2019s government in the 1960s created a department of employment and productivity because it knew the economy needed to be more efficient. The Thatcher government in the 1980s had a supply-side reform agenda that involved privatisation, deregulation and shifting the emphasis of industrial strategy from manufacturing to making the City a global financial centre. Labour\u2019s big idea under Tony Blair was \u201ceducation, education, education\u201d. So why has there been no lasting economic renaissance? Well, for a start, as Keegan illustrates, some almighty macro-economic blunders have hindered supply-side reform: the failure of Wilson to devalue the pound as soon as he arrived in office in 1964; the monetarist experiment of the early 1980s and the decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1990 among them. But there\u2019s more to it than that. Getting the big picture right \u2013 interest rates, the level of the pound, tax and spending policy \u2013 matters a lot but it is not everything. A real transformation of the economy requires three things: an understanding of the problem; a set of policies to tackle the weaknesses identified and, crucially, a willingness to abandon strategies when they don\u2019t work and to stick them when there\u2019s a chance that they will. It\u2019s quite easy to say what\u2019s been going wrong. For decades Britain has imported more than it has exported, finance is too strong and manufacturing too weak, there has been a ready supply of new ideas but a failure to develop their commercial potential, and businesses have struggled to get long-term funding and workers with the appropriate skill levels. Tackling the weaknesses has proved harder because there are wildly divergent views about what should be done. Britain has had most things in the past century, from a command economy during the second world war to Thatcherism in the 1980s. There has been an appreciation that lessons can be learned from other countries. The issue has been deciding which one to learn from. But it is the lack of patience that has been the most marked trait of the past 100 years, the sense that there is a shortcut to success if only it can be found. At various times this has been a national plan, devaluation, money supply targets, joining the ERM and leaving the ERM. There have been governments that tried to \u201cdash for growth\u201d in the belief that Britain can burst through to a higher level of productivity, and there have been governments that thought they could cut their way to growth. Joining what was then the Common Market was seen as the answer in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the time of the 2016 referendum, it was clear that Britain still had deep structural problems, but that those of the countries so admired in the 1960s were just as bad if not worse. There is now an opportunity, for remainers as well as leavers, to put things right. There is no guarantee the opportunity will be taken, of course. * Nine crises by William Keegan, published by Biteback \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.",

Some 93% of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association membership voted to authorize a strike last month in the midst of new contract negotiations. \u201cThe current model isn\u2019t working for teachers, it isn\u2019t working for students,\u201d said Nik Arnoldi, a teacher at Escalante-Biggs Academy. Denver Public Schools officials responded to the strike vote by formally requesting the state of Colorado to intervene to avoid a strike, but the state declined. \u201cTo our teachers: We want and need you in our classrooms,\u201d said Susana Cordova, district superintendent, in a statement. \u201cWe want to work to reach an agreement and we welcome support from Governor [Jared] Polis and his administration to bring us both back to negotiate.\u201d A spokesperson for the district added: \u201cThe school district is committed to keeping schools open and on normal schedules during a strike to support our students and their education.\u201d Teachers in Oakland and Sacramento in California are also potentially heading toward strikes in coming weeks as part of a broader wave of actions that occurred in several states and cities in 2018. Those strikes led to significant victories for teachers in Oklahoma, West Virginia, Arizona, and, most recently, Los Angeles. The American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten, said these walkouts are part of a broader trend of teachers combatting decade-long systematic funding problems in public education. \u201cNo teacher wants to go on strike, but these actions are a direct response to the austerity politics that have left public schools low on the budget priority list in far too many states,\u201d said Weingarten. \u201cOur communities have made clear that they want safe, strong public schools, where kids can learn and where teachers can teach. When educators walk out, they\u2019re doing it to get what their kids need, and they\u2019re using the power of their collective voices to fight for the resources that are necessary to make schools better.\u201d The decline in teacher pay has been a significant public policy issue highlighted in these waves of strikes and protests. A report published by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) in September 2018 found teacher pay has eroded since the mid-1990\u2019s, with teacher pay penalties \u2013 the percentage by which public school teachers are paid less than comparable workers \u2013 growing to 18.7% in 2017. Several states with the highest teacher pay penalties \u2013 Arizona, Virginia, Colorado, and Oklahoma \u2013 saw teacher walkouts and protests highlighting this increasing pay gap. \u201cAcross the US, teachers and entire communities are saying enough is enough,\u201d said Dr Sylvia Allegretto, co-chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at UC Berkeley and lead author of the EPI report. In Sacramento, teachers are still fighting for resources they won in a November 2017 contract with the Sacramento Unified school district. A strike was narrowly avoided when the teachers union and city reached a contract deal days before a scheduled walkout, but the teachers union says the district has ignored the contract. \u201cThe contract we accomplished with the district not only dealt with economic issues but found resources to lower class sizes, add counselors, early intervention, school nurses, a lot of what they were working on in Los Angeles,\u201d said David Fisher, president of the Sacramento City Teachers Association. \u201cSince then it\u2019s been an issue with the implementation,\u201d he added. South of Sacramento, teachers in Oakland, California, voted to authorize a strike amid their contract negotiations. The Oakland Education Association announced on 4 February that 95% of union members voted to authorize a strike, which could occur anytime after 15 February. \u201cWe are fighting for smaller class sizes, living wage, stopping school closures and more student support,\u201d said Quinn Ranahan, a math teacher at Roots International Academy middle school, one of 24 schools in the Oakland Unified school district that are being considered for closure over the next five years. A spokesperson for the district said in an email: \u201cWe are eager to come to an agreement with our teachers union, one that pays teachers what they deserve and that allows them to thrive in the expensive Bay Area. That being said, we have serious budgetary limitations, so we need to come to an agreement that is also sustainable for the district..\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Kamala Harris speaks, she sure sounds like a progressive. In a speech on Tuesday, the US presidential candidate said: \u201cWe need our leaders to speak truths. We have an economy where the cost of health care, housing, and education are going up, but paychecks aren\u2019t growing fast enough to keep up.\u201d It\u2019s not just the economy that\u2019s broken in her view: Harris hits progressive notes on everything from the criminal justice system to climate change. These are the \u201ctruths\u201d she consistently promises to tell.</p> <p>This rhetoric is matched by her emerging policy platform. Since 2016, Harris has adopted a number of leftwing positions first popularized by Bernie Sanders during his presidential campaign. But, despite the fact that she has embraced these policies as her own, the timing of her leftward shift, combined with her failure to tie it to a consistent ideology, has left some progressives skeptical.</p> <p>During her appearance at a CNN town hall last month, Harris reaffirmed her commitment to Sanders\u2019 most defining policy goal: \u201cI feel very strongly about this, we need to have Medicare for All.\u201d But in the days after, she rolled back her commitment to \u201celiminate all\u201d private insurance, saying instead that she was open to a number of more incremental efforts, though single payer was the goal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/2020-presidential-election-democrats-poliices-identity\">Who should Democrats vote for in 2020?

At times, Harris\u2019s progressivism can feel as poll-tested as her campaign slogans. She likes to say that if something is \u201cworth fighting for, it\u2019s a fight worth having\u201d, by which she means (I think) that if an issue is important, leaders should commit to it regardless of the surety of victory or the political expediency of the cause. \u201cLet me be clear\u201d she often starts her sentences. \u201cI feel very strongly about this\u201d she preambles. But as any writer knows, telling isn\u2019t as good as showing. And Harris\u2019s record is a poor showing.</p> <p>In 2016, Harris didn\u2019t feel \u201cstrongly\u201d enough about Medicare for All to support the only candidate on the Democratic ticket who backed it, Bernie Sanders. Moreover, her policy adviser and sister, Maya Harris, also advised Hillary Clinton in 2016, when the former Senator and first lady famously insisted that single payer would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSMGrKSUgj4\">never, ever come to pass</a>\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels like Harris's politics are driven by the wind of popular opinion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Certainly people can and <em>should</em> evolve. Social mores shift. New information comes to light. Politicians such as Sanders expand the limits of political possibility. But without a more substantive articulation of <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> Harris and her team came to a new ideology, it feels like Harris\u2019s politics are driven less by a normative vision of the world than by the wind of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/the-radical-lefts-agenda-is-more-popular-than-the-gops.html\">popular opinion</a>.</p> <p>The gap between her professed ideals and her actions is most apparent when the focus is trained on Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html\">about which</a> there\u2019s been significant reporting and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/01/20/a-problem-for-kamala-harris-can-a-prosecutor-become-president-in-the-age-of-black-lives-matter/\">criticism</a>.

Don't be fooled by their progressive veneer | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not clear that Harris sees our economic and political system as flawed. Take for example Harris\u2019 response last week, when asked whether it\u2019s morally defensible to have multi-billionaires in a country where 1 in 5 children live in poverty. Yes, she affirmed, \u201cwe have had policies in this country ... that have disproportionately benefited the top 1% to the exclusion of working families\u201d. She added: \u201cWe have babies in America today that are on the verge of starving. We have families who cannot pay their bills.\u201d Harris is adept at speaking these truths. But blame the system that got us here? She wouldn\u2019t go so far as doing that. This betrays a lack of political imagination that extends far beyond Harris\u2019s approach to crime.</p> <p>Compare Harris\u2019s response to the answer given by New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Martin Luther King Jr Day. When asked by author Ta-Nehesi Coates if it was a \u201cmoral outcome\u201d to live in a world that allows for billionaires, Ocasio-Cortez replied without hesitation. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d It\u2019s not that all billionaires are immoral, she explained, but a \u201csystem\u201d that allows such extreme poverty when Americans\u2019 basic health needs aren\u2019t even being met is wrong. \u201cWhat kind of society do we want to live in?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere do we draw the line in excesses?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez clearly is driven by a positive vision of the future. But what drives Harris?</p> <p>Harris increasingly speaks in class terms. She seems to have taken the advice of a <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/new-study-dont-choose-populism-identity/\">Demos study</a> from early last year, which confirmed that the most effective messaging with \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters stresses the shared class interests of \u201cworking people\u201d of all races as distinct from the \u201cwealthy few\u201d, and to evoke racism as a tool elites used to keep working people divided. She now routinely hits populist themes, referencing the fact that 40% of Americans are $500 away from an economic emergency, and arguing \u201cthey\u2019re trying to divide us. They\u2019re trying to have us point fingers at each other\u201d.</p> <p>In these moments, Harris is at her best. But she hasn\u2019t yet internalized the bigger truth behind the messaging \u2013 that a concentration of obscene wealth in the hands of a few has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/opinion/ocasio-cortez-taxes.html\">undermined our democracy</a>.</p> <p>In her Oakland speech, Harris noted that \u201cAmerica\u2019s story has always been written by people who can see what<em> can </em>be unburdened by what<em> has </em>been\u201d. It\u2019s hard to see Harris as that person. Speaking truth is an important first step. But it\u2019s not a substitute for having the courage and vision to do something about it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Briahna Joy Gray is a columnist and senior politics editor at The Intercept.

      "bodyText": "When Kamala Harris speaks, she sure sounds like a progressive. In a speech on Tuesday, the US presidential candidate said: \u201cWe need our leaders to speak truths. We have an economy where the cost of health care, housing, and education are going up, but paychecks aren\u2019t growing fast enough to keep up.\u201d It\u2019s not just the economy that\u2019s broken in her view: Harris hits progressive notes on everything from the criminal justice system to climate change. These are the \u201ctruths\u201d she consistently promises to tell. This rhetoric is matched by her emerging policy platform. Since 2016, Harris has adopted a number of leftwing positions first popularized by Bernie Sanders during his presidential campaign. But, despite the fact that she has embraced these policies as her own, the timing of her leftward shift, combined with her failure to tie it to a consistent ideology, has left some progressives skeptical. During her appearance at a CNN town hall last month, Harris reaffirmed her commitment to Sanders\u2019 most defining policy goal: \u201cI feel very strongly about this, we need to have Medicare for All.\u201d But in the days after, she rolled back her commitment to \u201celiminate all\u201d private insurance, saying instead that she was open to a number of more incremental efforts, though single payer was the goal. There\u2019s a persistent tension between the firmness with which Harris commits herself to her catchphrases and the shallowness of her political commitments (and her record). At times, Harris\u2019s progressivism can feel as poll-tested as her campaign slogans. She likes to say that if something is \u201cworth fighting for, it\u2019s a fight worth having\u201d, by which she means (I think) that if an issue is important, leaders should commit to it regardless of the surety of victory or the political expediency of the cause. \u201cLet me be clear\u201d she often starts her sentences. \u201cI feel very strongly about this\u201d she preambles. But as any writer knows, telling isn\u2019t as good as showing. And Harris\u2019s record is a poor showing. In 2016, Harris didn\u2019t feel \u201cstrongly\u201d enough about Medicare for All to support the only candidate on the Democratic ticket who backed it, Bernie Sanders. Moreover, her policy adviser and sister, Maya Harris, also advised Hillary Clinton in 2016, when the former Senator and first lady famously insisted that single payer would \u201cnever, ever come to pass\u201d. Certainly people can and should evolve. Social mores shift. New information comes to light. Politicians such as Sanders expand the limits of political possibility. But without a more substantive articulation of why and how Harris and her team came to a new ideology, it feels like Harris\u2019s politics are driven less by a normative vision of the world than by the wind of popular opinion. The gap between her professed ideals and her actions is most apparent when the focus is trained on Harris\u2019s career as a prosecutor, about which there\u2019s been significant reporting and criticism. Somewhat hubristically, she\u2019s still chosen to pluck her campaign slogan from the prosecutor\u2019s oath: \u201cFor The People\u201d. In light of her record, which includes failing to prosecute \u201cforeclosure King\u201d turned Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, while supporting an anti-truancy initiative that criminalized noncompliant parents and threatened them with jail time, the slogan raises the question: for which people? When challenged about her office\u2019s defense of the death penalty, opposition to the release of non-violent prisoners, and violation of the constitutional rights of various drug defendants, she demurs by pointing to victims of violent crime who are the \u201cmost vulnerable among us.\u201d She stresses the threats posed by murderers, rapists, and child molestors \u2013 ignoring the scores of non-violent drug offences and misdemeanor violations which comprise the bulk of her office\u2019s prosecutions, and the fact that thousands are jailed merely because they\u2019re too poor to pay. Most disappointing, perhaps, is that Harris should know better than to adopt such a pat understanding of victimhood. She often evokes her progressive parents, going so far as to say that nobody had to teach her \u201cabout the disparities in the criminal justice system because\u201d she was \u201cborn knowing what they are\u201d. But even they questioned her choice to become a prosecutor, calling it \u201ca curious decision\u201d. \u201cWhy would you go and be a part of an institution that is not always fair and does not always pursue justice?\u201d her family asked her, according to Harris. That question looms unanswered. When asked directly \u201chow do you reconcile your contradictory past with what you claim to support today\u201d at the recent town hall, she sidestepped the issue, replying summarily: \u201cI\u2018ve been consistent my whole career.\u201d But that\u2019s the problem. During her 2003 race to become District Attorney of San Fransisco, Harris circulated flyers featuring the torso of a tattooed, presumably Latino, man throwing up a gang sign, with the caption \u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH!\u201d On another flyer, featuring a crime scene chalk outline, she criticized her opponent, progressive prosecutor Terrence Hallinan, for his low conviction rates. \u201cIt\u2019s not progressive to be soft on crime,\u201d she said during race. In 2010, she bragged about using her power to prosecute parents as a \u201chuge stick\u201d to ensure school attendance. \u201cI sent a letter out on my letterhead to every parent in the school district,\u201d she said. \u201cA friend of mine actually called me and he said, \u2018Kamala my wife got the letter, she freaked out, she brought all the kids into the living room, held up the letter, said: if you don\u2019t go to school Kamala is going to put you and me in jail!\u2019\u201d Harris smiled as the audience laughed. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe achieved the intended effect.\u201d In 2013, Harris scoffed at the idea that we should \u201cbuild more schools, less jails.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental problem with that approach,\u201d she said. \u201cI agree with that conceptually, but you have not addressed the reason why I have three padlocks on my door.\u201d A genuinely progressive policy agenda addresses those reasons directly.

      "body": "<p>When Roberto Bola\u00f1o died aged 50 in 2003, he\u2019d only witnessed the first flickers of the extraordinary fame that was to come his way. His life until that point had been hand to mouth and itinerant, divided between Chile, where he was born, Mexico City and the Costa Brava, where he worked a variety of menial jobs in the rundown seaside resort of Blanes. By the time the Anglophone world got to read him, he was months from death \u2013 <em>New Directions</em> published the short, hallucinatory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/fiction\" title=\"\"><em>By Night in Chile</em></a> in March 2003. He died in July, two places from the top of the waiting list for a liver transplant that might have saved him.</p> <p>Bola\u00f1o\u2019s reputation as the greatest Latin American author of his generation rests on two novels \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\"><em>The Savage Detectives</em></a>, published in Spanish in 1999 and in an immaculate English translation by Natasha Wimmer in 2007, and the book he finished on his deathbed, the Pynchonesque maximalist mindstorm that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/11/roberto-bolano-2666\" title=\"\"><em>2666</em></a><em>, </em>published in English in 2008 (and also translated by Wimmer). The ambition, scope and brilliance of these books won him a host of awards, extraordinary sales (particularly given that they were novels in translation) and a cult-like following. Bola\u00f1o\u2019s journals and interviews, pored over by his fans in the wake of his death, helped stoke the myth of his life, which in turn fed his literary reputation. Was he a freedom fighter during Pinochet\u2019s military coup? Was he a heroin addict? To what extent were his novels of sex, drugs and avant-garde poetry romans \u00e0 clefs?</p> <p>What the wild success of <em>The Savage Detectives</em> and <em>2666</em> did was to drive demand for more Bola\u00f1o novels. Luckily enough, there was a significant body of work that had yet to be translated, much of it not even published in Spanish. And so those of us who\u2019d fallen in love with those two reputation-establishing novels began along a strange and disheartening path of diminishing returns. The problem is that his career builds towards <em>The Savage Detectives </em>and <em>2666</em>, and reading the work that came before it, it is as if we are following his evolution as a writer in reverse, with each new novel not quite as good as the one that preceded it, and none of them fit to share a shelf with his two masterpieces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Was he a freedom fighter?

It tells the story of two young, aspiring authors in Mexico City, Jan and Remo, the former a near-hermit who writes letters to the leading science-fiction authors of his day, the latter a garrulous boy on the make in a city mad about poetry. The passages about the boys and their glamorous friend Jos\u00e9 Arco are intercut with a long, dreary interview in which a successful author recounts his time at \u201cThe Potato Academy\u201d and a series of bizarre and increasingly tedious dreams.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why this novel was never published in Bola\u00f1o\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s a rambling, dispiriting mess, symptomatic of the way publishers have dredged up substandard work from this great writer\u2019s past in the hope that it might catch some of the reflected glory of his two great novels.

      "bodyText": "When Roberto Bola\u00f1o died aged 50 in 2003, he\u2019d only witnessed the first flickers of the extraordinary fame that was to come his way. His life until that point had been hand to mouth and itinerant, divided between Chile, where he was born, Mexico City and the Costa Brava, where he worked a variety of menial jobs in the rundown seaside resort of Blanes. By the time the Anglophone world got to read him, he was months from death \u2013 New Directions published the short, hallucinatory By Night in Chile in March 2003. He died in July, two places from the top of the waiting list for a liver transplant that might have saved him. Bola\u00f1o\u2019s reputation as the greatest Latin American author of his generation rests on two novels \u2013 The Savage Detectives, published in Spanish in 1999 and in an immaculate English translation by Natasha Wimmer in 2007, and the book he finished on his deathbed, the Pynchonesque maximalist mindstorm that is 2666, published in English in 2008 (and also translated by Wimmer). The ambition, scope and brilliance of these books won him a host of awards, extraordinary sales (particularly given that they were novels in translation) and a cult-like following. Bola\u00f1o\u2019s journals and interviews, pored over by his fans in the wake of his death, helped stoke the myth of his life, which in turn fed his literary reputation. Was he a freedom fighter during Pinochet\u2019s military coup? Was he a heroin addict? To what extent were his novels of sex, drugs and avant-garde poetry romans \u00e0 clefs? What the wild success of The Savage Detectives and 2666 did was to drive demand for more Bola\u00f1o novels. Luckily enough, there was a significant body of work that had yet to be translated, much of it not even published in Spanish. And so those of us who\u2019d fallen in love with those two reputation-establishing novels began along a strange and disheartening path of diminishing returns. The problem is that his career builds towards The Savage Detectives and 2666, and reading the work that came before it, it is as if we are following his evolution as a writer in reverse, with each new novel not quite as good as the one that preceded it, and none of them fit to share a shelf with his two masterpieces. The Spirit of Science Fiction is one of Bola\u00f1o\u2019s earliest books, written in 1984. Whereas other early novels \u2013 Woes of the True Policeman, Monsieur Pain and The Skating Rink \u2013 point towards the genre-bending plasticity of 2666, The Spirit of Science Fiction is clearly a rehearsal for the Beat-ish K\u00fcnstlerroman of The Savage Detectives. It tells the story of two young, aspiring authors in Mexico City, Jan and Remo, the former a near-hermit who writes letters to the leading science-fiction authors of his day, the latter a garrulous boy on the make in a city mad about poetry. The passages about the boys and their glamorous friend Jos\u00e9 Arco are intercut with a long, dreary interview in which a successful author recounts his time at \u201cThe Potato Academy\u201d and a series of bizarre and increasingly tedious dreams. It\u2019s easy to see why this novel was never published in Bola\u00f1o\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s a rambling, dispiriting mess, symptomatic of the way publishers have dredged up substandard work from this great writer\u2019s past in the hope that it might catch some of the reflected glory of his two great novels. Let us hope The Spirit of Science Fiction is the last of these tawdry outtakes that can only serve to diminish the legacy of one of the most remarkable literary voices of the past 50 years. \u2022 The Spirit of Science Fiction by Roberto Bola\u00f1o is published by Macmillan (\u00a314.99).

In truth it was an excellent team performance from the Glory, with Rachel Hill, Shannon May and Kim Carroll all starring, and youngster Leticia McKenna growing in influence as the game went on.</p> <p>Their opponents will be Sydney FC, who survived a late scare against the Roar to run out 2-1 winners up in Queensland, and it will be the Sky Blues who host the final, courtesy their higher-placed finish on the table.</p> <p>In the A-League the men\u2019s Victory side fared no better against Perth opposition, with Keisuke Honda\u2019s return from injury overshadowed by some Diego Castro brilliance. The Spaniard, alongside former Socceroo Neil Kilkenny, both enjoying Indian summers, ran the show as they provided the goals in a 2-1 win.</p> <p>Two cracking games in the AFLW, where the Dockers smashed ten goals to sink the Lions, and Adelaide came from behind to defeat a brave Carlton witha big third quarter turnaround.</p> <p>In the NBL, Melbourne United won their way back to the top of the ladder, and in the Big Bash a star turn from Glenn \u201cthe Big Show\u201d Maxwell secured the Melbourne Stars\u2019 finals spot, at the expense of Brendon McCullum\u2019s Brisbane Heat.</p> <p>And that\u2019s Sportwatch.

      "bodyText": "So an epic day of football action on Sunday Sportswatch. Sam Kerr set the day alight with a virtuoso performance in the opening W-League semi-final, in which the premiers, Melbourne Victory succumbed to two injury-time goals from the Matildas striker. In truth it was an excellent team performance from the Glory, with Rachel Hill, Shannon May and Kim Carroll all starring, and youngster Leticia McKenna growing in influence as the game went on. Their opponents will be Sydney FC, who survived a late scare against the Roar to run out 2-1 winners up in Queensland, and it will be the Sky Blues who host the final, courtesy their higher-placed finish on the table. In the A-League the men\u2019s Victory side fared no better against Perth opposition, with Keisuke Honda\u2019s return from injury overshadowed by some Diego Castro brilliance. The Spaniard, alongside former Socceroo Neil Kilkenny, both enjoying Indian summers, ran the show as they provided the goals in a 2-1 win. Two cracking games in the AFLW, where the Dockers smashed ten goals to sink the Lions, and Adelaide came from behind to defeat a brave Carlton witha big third quarter turnaround. In the NBL, Melbourne United won their way back to the top of the ladder, and in the Big Bash a star turn from Glenn \u201cthe Big Show\u201d Maxwell secured the Melbourne Stars\u2019 finals spot, at the expense of Brendon McCullum\u2019s Brisbane Heat. And that\u2019s Sportwatch. Thanks for your company - until next weekend! 90 + 3 min: They break again, the Roar, and the decibel level rises intensely. It\u2019s Raso bursting through the middle, she tries to find a teammate, but she\u2019s left her pass a fraction late, and the youngster Riley is caught offside. It\u2019s a heroic effort in the end, and Sydney FC sigh a huge sigh of relief. There\u2019s the whistle. The Sky Blues are hosting the 2019 W-League final! 90 min: To their credit the ten-player continue to chase this. And they\u2019ll have four additional minutes to conjure the remarkable. And just as I\u2019m about to write \u201cthey\u2019ll never score, even if this game goes for a week\u201d, the Roar have conjured something! It\u2019s a terrific strike from Nagasako, curling into the top corner - no chance, Bledsoe. Surely they can\u2019t. Can they?! 87 min: Decent crowd in tonight, 4,273, up in Queensland. They\u2019ll go home disappointed, but they\u2019ve still seen some decent football tonight. It\u2019s a young Roar team though, and with more experienced heads like Katrina Gorry to come back in hopefully they can put together a strong roster again for next season. 83 min: Ooh. A coming together in the box between McCaskill and Polkinghorne - half a shout for a penalty there? The referee kindly declines. If this stays as is, it will be a home final for Sydney FC, with Perth Glory finishing below the Sky Blues on the table. 78 min: Ay, ay, ay. The wheels are off - red card against the Roar! Natalie Tathem is caught the wrong side of Ibini, and she tries to bring the Sydney FC flyer down subtly, but as last player there was never any question there. She\u2019s fouled her, and she has to go. That\u2019s quietened the home crowd. 75 min: A call goes against the Roar, and the skipper Polkinghorne is incensed. They\u2019re on the ropes here, Brisbane - the more they push, the more they leave themselves exposed at the back. And right on cue, it\u2019s Arnold again denying Logarzo who was through one-on-one. There will be plenty of bantz come Matildas camp about that battle. 71 min: And it is starting to really open up, this game. Ibini with a chance at one end, before Toby draws a save out of Bledsoe. And finally Ante Juric goes to his bench. It\u2019s Amy Harrison who comes on, and she slots in at left back, presumably to respond to the fresh legs of Indiah Paige-Riley who has just come on for the Roar, replacing Green, who you\u2019ll recall was on a yellow. 68 min: Thank you, and good night! It\u2019s another set piece with Kennedy making herself a nuisance. This time she\u2019s left completely unmarked, and she jinks brilliantly round Polkinghorne to pick out a teammate. Sofia Huerta still with plenty to do, and she smashes it home from around the penalty spot! Lovely stuff, Sydney FC - but big questions on that Roar defending. They\u2019ve a mountain to climb now. 64 min: My, oh my! It\u2019s a mad minute - as Brisbane Roar survive a peppering of their goal; and then go up the other end as Yuki Nagasako has seemingly all day in a one-on-one, but can\u2019t find a way past Audrey Bledsoe in the FC goal! FC had about three shots on target from a goalmouth scramble; one of them a blistering drive from Logarzo that appeared to hit her own player, McCaskill! Mad business. And the crowd squeal with peals with delight. 59 min: They need a spark from someone, the Roar. But from whom? Raso is busting her tail, but it\u2019s nearly a sole furrow up front. They\u2019re not connecting well enough in the midfield. And as we talk, it\u2019s a burst upfield and Chloe Logarzo is through one-on-one with her Matildas teammate Arnold in the Roar goal - but she crashes her shot wide! Big let off. You feel if Sydney get a second here it\u2019s definitely game over. 53 min: So plenty of cut and thrust, but a few passes just aren\u2019t going to foot. Raso working hard up front, but both sides guilty of turning over the ball cheaply. I guess we can reframe that more positively as, defences on top? 48 min: McCaskill lays off well to Ibini, that\u2019s better use of the false nine, as discussed previously. But Roar captain Polkinghorne is across well to snuff out the danger. It\u2019s a corner to Sydney FC, and ooh - it\u2019s hit the upright! Great nod back from Kennedy, she\u2019s so hard to contain from set pieces. And it\u2019s flicked on, was it McCaskill, or has that come off a Roar defender? Either way, it strikes the post and bounces clear. 45 min: And we\u2019re back! No changes, to my knowledge. I\u2019ll keep an eye out and count my fingers and toes before getting back to you on that. So a different kind of semi-final, this one. Not quite with the Sturm und Drang of that first offering between Melbourne Victory and Perth Glory. But if you missed the Sam Kerr virtuoso show, don\u2019t worry. Here\u2019s 3,581 words I prepared earlier: What an absolute bloody star. No wonder Guardian voted her the second best female player on the planet. 45 min: A late freekick for Sydney FC, and Colaprico fancies it. She lofts it to the far post and Kennedy - oh my - so very nearly sneaks to that inside Arnold from the blind side! That would have really been a sucker blow, if they were to go in two-nil down, the home side. But they hold on. And a chance for Mel Andreatta to get inside the ears of her players and whisper sweet magic with a view to turning this one around. 42 min: Ooph! Ibini with a sharp shot-cross from wide; and it almost deceives Arnold and arrows into the bottom left-hand corner. A sharp effort from the wide forward. 38 min: And a bit of niggle from \u2018Ribbons\u2019. She\u2019s having a decent battle with Sydney FC\u2019s left back, Ally Green, but she cynically fouls the fullback on that occasion. Deary me. A very heavy coming together Ubogaga is clattered into - the Sydney defender with eyes only for the player. And now it\u2019s Green in the book for a foul, you guessed it, on Raso. Some tasty contretemps going on all around the ground, it seems. 36 min: We\u2019re coming alive now, with the fans howling for a perceived foul on Raso. Sydney press and try and trap the Roar in their back third, but the skipper Polkinghorne skips calmly out of defence, lovely play from the back. 33 min: Heavy challenge on Chioma Ubogaga, who gets to her feet gingerly. I was about to say there\u2019s not much zip to this one, but hold the phone - we\u2019ve got an opener! Sharp work from Sydney FC, with Foord being picked out just inside the box; she pivots sharply and drills that home. Arnold no chance - now! Is this the fire needed to spark this contest? 25 min: Both sides scrapping in midfield with Colaprico getting about. Sydney FC struggling to get their lead striker, Savannah McCaskill, into the game. She\u2019s an incredible talent, the American but pace isn\u2019t her strongest feature. She\u2019s being deployed more as a \u2018false nine\u2019, but they\u2019re not quite linking up front the Sky Blues. No Lisa De Vanna to call upon tonight, alas. The veteran striker is out injured. 19 min: But after being second best for the opening exchanges it\u2019s Sydney that have stung the palms of Mackenzie Arnold. Two fines saves in as many minutes, the smartest of the two tipping Princess Ibini\u2019s effort round the post. Great football from both sides! 15 min: And if you missed the lineups for tonight, here\u2019s how our two sides look: Plenty of pace up front out wide for both sides, hard to split the teams on that front. Sydney FC shading it in midfield for mine - plenty of big game experience between Polias, Logarzo and Colaprico. 8 min: Gee, how good is it to see \u2018Ribbons\u2019 out there carving it up. There\u2019s been times over the past few years where it feels like Raso has spent more time on the physio table than on the field, and she sprints away from the Sydney defence here, but her flashed cross evades a teammate. Warning sign for the visitors. 1 min: But, time and tide wait for no football. So here goes. And it\u2019s an all-action start, as Hayley Raso races through the Sydney defence before Alanna Kennedy and Allira Toby suffer a nasty head clash competing for a header. Big break in play - there\u2019s blood everywhere, with the Roar attacker in particular looking a bit poorly. Let\u2019s hope they can both resume. Or even better, they sub off if they can\u2019t. Nobody wants to see a player\u2019s health risked, even in a semi-final. (Cough, Melbourne Victory, Casey Dumont). So! We\u2019ve got one final game to bring you tonight. The union would tell me I\u2019m allowed a toilet break, and I probably should eat something at some stage, so forgive me if there are occasional delays in this one. It\u2019s the second of the W-League semi-finals, and do you reckon it will hit the heights of the first? It\u2019s Brisbane Roar playing host to Sydney FC, up in Queensland. And it\u2019s a costly loss for the finals chasing 36ers who could have secured their top four spot, but for a late rally from the defending premiers, who go back to the top. Here\u2019s an excerpt from Australian Associated Press\u2019s report: Adelaide led at every break but Melbourne\u2019s big names stood up when it mattered most. Casper Ware (20 points) nailed the match-sealing jumper with 14 seconds left on the clock after Chris Goulding (16 points), who was tamed for three quarters, notched four points and a crucial steal in the final 90 seconds. Melbourne coach Dean Vickerman praised his side\u2019s low turnover count. \u201cEven though we still lost the rebound count, we were a lot better than the last time we were here when they had 25 offensive rebounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest one for is was we turned the ball over three times and we got 22 points off turnovers ourselves. \u201cI liked our intent once we got a steal or a rebound to really push it.\u201d 90 + 6 min: Not to be for the home fans! Honda jinks and jives and he does get a half-space for a shot, but it drives just over the bar without testing Reddy. Perth have stayed resolute. And in the battle of one v two, they\u2019ve opened up a seven point gap at the top of the table. Is that the premiership right there? 90 + 3 min: They\u2019re probing Victory, like a European handball team, just passing around the arc endlessly, shifting and passing, endlessly examining for a half-chance. Honda is shown onto his right, so concerned are the Perth defenders of his sweet left foot, so he send over a cross off the right, and guess what, it\u2019s a good one. But a Perth defender stretches and just gets his head to it! He\u2019s making things happen Honda; but has he run out of time? 90 min: And we have five minutes added time. What can the Victory make of this? Honda becoming increasingly prominent, drifting to the right side of the pitch, and then firing balls consummately across the park with his left. 89 min: Lovely work from the Victory, as Honda finds Antonis out wide, who picks out the Japanese at the edge of the box, and his clipped ball over the top sparks a tussle between Spiranovic and Kamsoba. A few cries for a penalty, but nothing given from the referee, or the men upstairs in the VAR-cave. 88 min: XI behind the ball here, and all of them inside their own 30m, as Perth absorb a tonne of pressure. Victory with over 70% possession over the last ten minutes, but they just can\u2019t break down the resolute lines of white. 86 min: Andy Keogh does well to win the ball for his side, before allowing Castro to head to the corner. A heavy challenge from Kilkenny on Corey Brown, who goes down, but the veteran former Socceroo avoids a yellow. 84 min: A third substitution for the Glory, as Popovic brings Neville on for Franjic. Another little momentum breaker you imagine, with the two very much like-for-like right backs. 80 min: And as they try and settle things Glory have a player booked for time wasting, as the \u2018keeper Reddy goes in the book. Now a substitution, again to settle things, as Brimmer comes on for Ikonimidis, and the Glory tweak their formation to pack an extra body in midfield. 77 min: Hahaha. And just as I slagged him (see 71 min), the wee man from Wellington has returned fire. Great build up from Victory, Broxham with a clever ball, and a sharp first time finish across the body of Reddy - and after nearly five game - finally, FINALLY, the Perth net is bulged! Could we be set for a blockbuster last 15? Let\u2019s find out. 75 min: Honda looks to lift his side, with a clever slide pass in behind looking for Kamsoba, but Perth scramble well to clear. Now it\u2019s Corey Brown rampaging down the left after a move sparked by Honda and Baena, but again Perth defend well at the expense of a corner. But they clear that too. 71 min: And if it wasn\u2019t looking grim for the home fans, now the sight of Andy Keogh on the touchline! Handy sub to bring on at this stage of a contest. Baena with a good ball over the top to Barbarouses, but the Kiwi striker drags his shot badly wide! When he\u2019s on, he\u2019s mercurial. But when he\u2019s not, he\u2019s, well, a bit like today, really. 66 min: Ay, ay, ay! That\u2019s top draw from the Glory - who cut Victory to ribbons on the counter. What a day out for Perth fans who\u2019ve made the trek to Melbourne today - first Sam Kerr, now Diego Castro. He\u2019s a magician! Kilkenny lifts a ball out to Davidson, his header forward finds Ikonimidis who beats Deng with power and pace to fire a cross - and Castro, the 36-year-old flies through the air to poke home with an outreached boot! What a goal. 65 min: It almost has immediate dividends, as Terry Antonis\u2019 deflected shot loops agonisingly wide past Liam Reddy. Perth go up the other end, and it\u2019s Ikonimidis who tries to fashion a shot, but he\u2019s well blocked by Leigh Broxham, who\u2019s having a great game deputising at centre back (now, right back after Niedermeier\u2019s introduction). 61 min: And cometh the hour, cometh the man - Kevin Muscat has seen enough, and after a lengthy injury layoff Victory\u2019s talisman - and the A-League\u2019s talisman as a marquee signing - Keisuke Honda is into the action! A double change with Georg Niedermeier also coming on; Athiu and Roux the players to make way. 59 min: Oooh! Big moment - it\u2019s another smart flick from Neil Kilkenny, whose lifted ball strikes the outreached arm of Corey Brown. They go upstairs, but Jarryd Gillett was happy enough to call it a penalty, and the VAR doesn\u2019t overrule. He strikes it low and hard, and Thomas gets a hand to it, but it creeps inside the far post. A great penalty, and almost a miraculous save. But it\u2019s 1-0 Glory; will this send them seven points clear at the top of the table? 56 min: And a first save of the game for Lawrence Thomas! No surprise, it\u2019s Castro with the trickery, who draws two defenders before laying off, to all people, Matthew Spiranovic. The defender shaped to shoot before picking out Davidson, whose cross to Ikonimidis was thumped goalwards - but no further - thanks to the flying frame of Thomas. 50 min: Fun stat from our friends at Fox commentary, Victory have scored in 23 consecutive home games, but Perth Glory haven\u2019t conceded in 373 minutes. Liam Reddy is on track for an A-League record-equaling five consecutive clean sheets. Which of these runs stops today? 45 min: And we\u2019re back underway at AAMI Park in Melbourne. And it\u2019s a more subdued start to the second stanza, before Terry Antonis picks up a yellow for slowing the restart. He\u2019ll miss the trip to Eden Park next week in Auckland as the Victory take on the Phoenix in the largest population base in Australasia without an A-League team. Wowee. And a belter in the early game in the AFLW today, with the Crows running down the Blues in a barnstorming finish. Four majors for Stevie-Lee Thompson, and another all-action performance from Erin Phillips as Adelaide turned around a deficit of 17 points in the third quarter. Keep your eyes out for our write up of that one tomorrow morning, with our eyes at the ground Kirby Fenwick parading the touchline. He may need to score 10,000 runs more before the Australian selectors ever pay him the respect his talents deserve, but the Big Show, Glenn \u201cMaxi\u201d Maxwell has almost single-handedly put his side into the finals, with a demolition of the Sixers. Marcus Stoinis 34 (23) and Peter Handscomb 35 (34) got things going for the home side, who batted first before the Max-factor took over, belting 82 off just 43 deliveries. Six sixers for Maxi, including three in the final over of the innings - poor old Ben Dwarshuis copping the treatment before finally dismissing the big man with one ball to go. The Sixers for their part must have really not fancied seeing the Brisbane Heat make the top four, as they batted like wet tissue, with top scores, two from bowlers, of 12, 10 and 11*. So! With half-time in the A-League finally a chance to get round the grounds and bring you some other action for Sunday Sportwatch. And in the three-way battle for the final Big Bash finals spot, there\u2019s been a big move made. And who else: THE BIG SHOW. 45 min: And in the shadow of half-time Athiu twists and turns and almost fashions the opener. It\u2019s well saved at the near post by Reddy, what\u2019s that - perhaps just his and the game\u2019s second save? For all the intrigue there haven\u2019t been any clear cut chances, and we go to the sheds with this one very equally poised. 43 min: Well it hasn\u2019t exactly been a tinderbox, this one - but on the sideline Kevin Muscat has managed to get himself booked. A bizarre one, this - he\u2019s been pinged for a whistle that caused Neil Kilkenny to stop and handle the ball! Dark arts from the Victory coach! 40 min: Castro tries to solo effort - but it\u2019s blocked well. He\u2019s finding terrific positions for Perth, but on one or two occasions his teammates just aren\u2019t finding him. 38 min: A corner to Victory, and Baena wins the first header. It spills back across the box and Athiu attempts the bicycle kick, but he only catches Dino Djulbic fair in the moush. Owie. He draws blood from the granite defender, and picks up a yellow card for his efforts. A touch unfair that one, perhaps, but it was a nasty connection. 34 min: Good little patch this, for the Glory. Castro finding himself free behind the two Victory midfield screeners, darting in and out of pockets of space. Then Kilkenny finds a cute lofted ball to find Ikonimidis, but it\u2019s an acute angle, and Thomas covers his near post well. 31 min: Brown does well down the left and lofts a tempting ball centrally, but there\u2019s nobody in the box to capitalise, to the ire of coach Kevin Muscat. He was, you\u2019ll remember, a Socceroos teammate of Popovic. But you\u2019d imagine the two defenders would love to get one over each other. Fierce competitors, both. 27 min: Victory with their 4-2-3-1 with Barbarouses and Kamsoba the fliers out wide, Troisi at No 10 pulling the strings behind Athiu. Glory with their 5-3-2 - Castro the playmaker (obviously) with Chianese and Ikonomidis ahead of him. Juande and Kilkenny playing the all-important role at the base of midfield. It\u2019s been a key component of their season that relationship, and when Juande hasn\u2019t played they\u2019ve struggled at times, the Glory. 21 min: So after that pulsating start, both sides have settled into more of a cat-and-mouse kind of encounter. There have been some high-scoring clashes between these two in recent times, but given the nature of one-v-two you can imagine Tony Popovic will be keen to keep it tight today and deny Perth\u2019s premiership rivals a chance to make up ground on the table. 17 min: Half a chance for Ivan Franjic, who looks to bend an effort. He\u2019s been enjoying his return to the A-League since transferring from the Roar over to the Glory. But it\u2019s comfortably dealt with by Lawrence Thomas. 13 min: No Toivonen as well for the Victory today, so it means Kenny Athiu leads the line, and he combines excellently with youngster Elvis Kamsoba. The promising Burundi-born boy turns brilliantly and fires a shot, but he scuffs the connection. An irate Troisi lets him know - he was open for a tap-in centrally! Huge let off for the Victory, but they\u2019ve started with real intent despite no Honda, no Toivonen. 9 min: A chance now for Perth, but Castro and Chianese get in each other\u2019s way - to the ire of the in-form Spaniard. They take the ball off each other inside the eighteen-yard box, and the moment goes begging! Meanwhile, Victory break looking to release the pace of Kosta Barbarouses. It\u2019s a lively game this one, as well! 6 min: It\u2019s a high-tempo start to this one, no surprises there with two teams famous for their work ethic. An early corner for the hosts, Victory, as James Troisi bustles with purpose. No Keogh for the visitors, with the Glory\u2019s leading scorer relegated to the bench. An interesting call from Tony Popovic; looking to draw a response from the Irishman, with Joel Chianese preferred to start? 1 min: So, after that slight delay, we\u2019re underway - it\u2019s second hosting first, as Victory (mens) now face Perth (mens) in a mouth-watering A-League clash. If it\u2019s even half as good as the W-League semi (see earlier) we\u2019re in for a treat. And for those of you sweating on the start of the A-League top of the table fixture. We have a short delay, due to the extra-time at the same venue, AAMI Park, in the W-League: Here\u2019s the team news for that one - and the big news is, there\u2019s a return to the bench for A-League marquee, Keisuke Honda! Melbourne Victory: Perth Glory: We\u2019ll bring you the A-League team line ups shortly, and I\u2019d love to get round the grounds to keep you abreast of AFLW and Big Bash action too. But first, if you didn\u2019t hear the result, please take the time to suss out this amazing game from the W-League: Six goals, a red card, late drama - football at it\u2019s very, very best! So, with the drama of that first W-League semi-final still pulsing through my veins it\u2019s time to shift to the rest of today\u2019s sporting action. We\u2019ve got an A-League top of the table clash between those two sides that featured earlier, but now in male version, as Tony Popovic and Kevin Muscat\u2019s men go head to head; and stick around for the second of the W-League finals later on as Brisbane Roar play host to Sydney FC. As always we\u2019ll be round the grounds, so look out for AFLW, Big Bash, NBL action and more - all here, on Sunday Sportwatch!",

Tickets for the red-carpet premieres are like gold dust \u2013 some hopeful punters stand for hours in full evening dress holding placards begging for a seat \u2013 and once secured, they still have to pass muster with the infamous red carpet fashion police. No flip flops! <em>Quelle horreur! </em>But the smart cineaste looks away from the scrum of the main competition and towards the sidebars. The consistently excellent Director\u2019s Fortnight is the only section open to the public. It\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the edgier, newer voices.</p> <h2>Best for awards season contenders<br><a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2019\" title=\"\">Venice</a><br><strong>28</strong> <strong>Aug \u2013 7 </strong><strong>Sept 2019</strong></h2> <p>The autumn slot of this glamorous but eye-wateringly expensive event has seen it increasingly co-opted as a launchpad for the awards season big hitters. At times it seems as though Hollywood A-listers are only outnumbered by the mosquitos. Tickets are massively over-subscribed, but in theory the public can purchase seats for pretty much everything, even the gala films. The prices, however, can be prohibitive \u2013 the most expensive tickets were \u20ac45 in 2018, although cheaper options are available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"356da90ac72a9ffba38a18ad0afb28c07d118736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/356da90ac72a9ffba38a18ad0afb28c07d118736/0_29_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Hemsworth meets fans at the San Sebastian film festival in Spain last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Hemsworth meets fans at the San Sebastian film festival in Spain last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Best for foodies <br><a href=\"https://www.sansebastianfestival.com/in/\" title=\"\">San Sebasti\u00e1n</a><br><strong>20 \u2013 28 Sept </strong><strong>2019</strong></h2> <p>A genteel resort town an hour or so from Bilbao, San Sebasti\u00e1n is a mecca for innovative Basque cuisine, as well as the location for Spain\u2019s most important film festival. As it\u2019s an event aimed as much at the public as at industry visitors, tickets are easily available, although they frequently sell out. The canny festival-goer will look to the thorough and well-researched retrospective programmes: a deep dive into the work of Preston Sturges remains one of my most cherished San Sebasti\u00e1n memories.</p> <h2>Best for animation<br><a href=\"https://www.annecy.org/home\" title=\"\">Annecy</a><br><strong>10</strong> \u2013 <strong>15</strong> <strong>June 2019</strong></h2> <p>Once a year, the animation industry congregates in this picturesque French lakeside town, near the border with Switzerland \u2013 and the animation industry likes to party. Annecy is not only the place to go to experience the very best in the medium, it\u2019s a festival with a unique atmosphere, full of endearingly geeky traditions. Before each screening, the audience pelts the screen (and each other) with paper aeroplanes; any appearance of a rabbit in a film will be greeted with a rousing shout of \u201cLapin!\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d46f73d08d609b3d6fe8ba9055bdedb834187e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d46f73d08d609b3d6fe8ba9055bdedb834187e6/262_219_2344_1406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An outdoor screening at last year\u2019s Annecy film festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An outdoor screening at last year\u2019s Annecy film festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L Gouttenoire/CITIA/Lauriane Gouttenoire/CITIA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Best for cinephiles on a budget<br><a href=\"https://www.kviff.com/en/homepage\" title=\"\">Karlovy Vary</a><br><strong>28</strong> <strong>June \u2013 6 July </strong><strong>2019</strong></h2> <p>The youthful energy of the Karlovy Vary is in marked contrast to its location, the slightly chintzy Czech spa town where 19th-century tourists flocked to bathe in the hot springs.

Tickets for the red-carpet premieres are like gold dust \u2013 some hopeful punters stand for hours in full evening dress holding placards begging for a seat \u2013 and once secured, they still have to pass muster with the infamous red carpet fashion police. No flip flops! Quelle horreur! But the smart cineaste looks away from the scrum of the main competition and towards the sidebars. The consistently excellent Director\u2019s Fortnight is the only section open to the public. It\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the edgier, newer voices. Best for awards season contenders Venice 28 Aug \u2013 7 Sept 2019 The autumn slot of this glamorous but eye-wateringly expensive event has seen it increasingly co-opted as a launchpad for the awards season big hitters. At times it seems as though Hollywood A-listers are only outnumbered by the mosquitos. Tickets are massively over-subscribed, but in theory the public can purchase seats for pretty much everything, even the gala films. The prices, however, can be prohibitive \u2013 the most expensive tickets were \u20ac45 in 2018, although cheaper options are available. Best for foodies San Sebasti\u00e1n 20 \u2013 28 Sept 2019 A genteel resort town an hour or so from Bilbao, San Sebasti\u00e1n is a mecca for innovative Basque cuisine, as well as the location for Spain\u2019s most important film festival. As it\u2019s an event aimed as much at the public as at industry visitors, tickets are easily available, although they frequently sell out. The canny festival-goer will look to the thorough and well-researched retrospective programmes: a deep dive into the work of Preston Sturges remains one of my most cherished San Sebasti\u00e1n memories. Best for animation Annecy 10 \u2013 15 June 2019 Once a year, the animation industry congregates in this picturesque French lakeside town, near the border with Switzerland \u2013 and the animation industry likes to party. Annecy is not only the place to go to experience the very best in the medium, it\u2019s a festival with a unique atmosphere, full of endearingly geeky traditions. Before each screening, the audience pelts the screen (and each other) with paper aeroplanes; any appearance of a rabbit in a film will be greeted with a rousing shout of \u201cLapin!\u201d. Best for cinephiles on a budget Karlovy Vary 28 June \u2013 6 July 2019 The youthful energy of the Karlovy Vary is in marked contrast to its location, the slightly chintzy Czech spa town where 19th-century tourists flocked to bathe in the hot springs. Hardy film fans bunk in dormitories and tents, and lounge around the parks between movies. The atmosphere is more Glasto than Cannes, and the egalitarian approach means that even those on a tight budget can see plenty of films in this well-curated programme. Best for documentaries CPH:DOX 20 \u2013 31 March 2019 Of the main European documentary festivals, Copenhagen\u2019s CPH:DOX might just have the edge on Amsterdam\u2019s IDFA and Sheffield\u2019s DocFest. Its timing means it can provide a European platform for the best of the Sundance premieres, and Copenhagen makes for a lovely backdrop. It is well attended by the documentary community, so aspiring film-makers can make connections in the ticket queue.",

      "body": "<p>Back in 2017, I was asked to contribute a short piece about British cinema to a book entitled <em>Goodbye Europe</em>. The book was a collection of essays, inspired by the recent referendum, offering a series of different perspectives on the thorny subject of the UK\u2019s relationship to Europe, and \u201cwhat the idea of Europe means to Britons and others living here\u201d. In my essay I argued that, to all intents and purposes, there was no such thing as a \u201cBritish film\u201d per se \u2013 in an age of increasingly international co-production, national boundaries are no longer a defining feature of cinema. Moreover, if you read any interview with a film-maker at the cutting edge of UK cinema, the chances are they will refer to themselves and their work as \u201cEuropean\u201d.</p> <p>Take as typical these words from Carol Morley, director of <em>The Falling</em>, as she prepared to embark upon a film project in the US: \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the films the German \u00e9migr\u00e9s made in America, which to me are so very European,\u201d Morley told me. \u201cFilm language is universal, and I hope my films transcend boundaries. But recently I saw someone describe [my work] as \u2018weird\u2019, so maybe the correct term should be \u2018weird European\u2019!\u201d</p> <p>I loved that phrase \u2013 \u201cweird European\u201d \u2013 and it came back to haunt me as the<em> Observer</em> set about compiling this collection of 25 films that are essential viewing in these tumultuous times. In the era of Brexit, it seems more important than ever to engage with, and feel part of, the rich heritage of European cinema, in all its strange and wonderful manifestations. Whatever the ramifications of current political and social upheavals, it\u2019s clear that film-makers (and film fans) in the UK are part of a wider tradition of borderless cinema that needs to be celebrated and explored, now more than ever.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth stating at the outset that this isn\u2019t intended as some form of competitive countdown. We are not claiming our selection to be a list of the \u201cbest\u201d European films ever made. Nor is it an attempt to create a critical canon that singles out the finest achievements in Euro-cinema. On the contrary, this is a personal selection made by five <em>Observer</em> film writers (Simran Hans, Wendy Ide, Guy Lodge, Jonathan Romney and myself) highlighting movies that we consider to be important, or affecting, or innovative \u2013 films that have struck a chord. Together, they give a flavour of the dazzling breadth of European cinema, offering a tiny snapshot of a vast cinematic landscape.</p> <p>We\u2019ve tried to make the list as diverse as possible, both in terms of where and when they were made, and in the stories that they tell. These titles cover a century of cinema, with the earliest dating back to 1922, while our most recent choice comes from 2017. Some hail from countries, such as Russia and Turkey, that are only partially in Europe, yet all represent a facet of what we consider to be European cinema \u2013 whatever that may be.</p> <p>Although historians are divided on the exact birthplace of moving pictures (Leeds, Paris and New York variously feature in differing accounts), Europe has always been a vital force in the evolution of cinema \u2013 artistically influential, even when economically overshadowed by larger industries. Just as European \u00e9migr\u00e9s shaped the face of Hollywood, so stylistic movements from German expressionism to Italian neo-realism and the French New Wave continue to reverberate throughout popular global cinema. Glancing through this collection of extraordinary, challenging, world-changing films, it\u2019s easy to see why.</p> <h2>Nosferatu <br></h2> <p><strong>(</strong><strong>FW Murnau, 1922, Germany</strong><strong>)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83228b5dd31bd99aa3c3fce12e485c40126d235f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83228b5dd31bd99aa3c3fce12e485c40126d235f/0_243_1417_850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Schreck as Count Orlok in FW Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Schreck as Count Orlok in FW Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This 1922 chiller is a milestone of German expressionist cinema. Subtitled <em>Eine Symphonie des Grauens</em> (a symphony of horror), FW Murnau\u2019s film stars Max Schreck as Count Orlok, whose vampiric presence put the fear of god into film fans in the age before sound. Images of Orlok\u2019s undead shadow ascending a staircase and clawing at his victim\u2019s heart rank among the most haunting (and most parodied) moments in cinema. Despite its classic status, <em>Nosferatu</em> had a rocky start: British censors initially refused it a certificate after legal complaints by Bram Stoker\u2019s estate, claiming it to be an uncredited and unauthorised adaptation of <em>Dracula</em> \u2013 which, of course, it was. Many copies were destroyed, though <em>Nosferatu</em> \u2013 like its anti-hero \u2013 survived.

His only full-length feature is an entrancing essay in modernist romanticism, rooted equally in realism and the language of dreams. <em>L\u2019Atalante</em> is a canal barge, captained by naive Jean (Jean Dast\u00e9), newly married to Juliette (Dita Parlo). The course of true love doesn\u2019t run smooth, on water or on land, not least thanks to an unruly contingent of cats and to the disruptive presence of crewman Le P\u00e8re Jules \u2013 played by Michel Simon, one of the most irreducibly raw, joyous and anarchic presences in screen history.

The \u201cbig calves\u201d of the title are a group of young men in a seaside town, finding it harder to grow up than they expected. Among them are feckless romancer Fausto, joker Alberto (played by Alberto Sordi, soon to be a huge comedy star) and thoughtful Moraldo, the director\u2019s autobiographical stand-in. At once tender and pitiless towards the contradictions of traditional Italian masculinity, <em>I Vitelloni</em> was a major influence on the young Martin Scorsese. The \u201cleaving home\u201d sequence at the end is one of the most poetic moments in Fellini\u2019s work. <strong>JR</strong></p> <h2>Peeping Tom <br></h2> <p><strong>(</strong><strong>Michael Powell, 1960, UK</strong><strong>)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5297499273d0b512c2c98384e73dc055d5878228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5297499273d0b512c2c98384e73dc055d5878228/0_0_4204_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carl Boehm in Michael Powell\u2019s Peeping Tom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carl Boehm in Michael Powell\u2019s Peeping Tom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A cautionary tale about the unhealthy relationship between voyeurism and violence, Michael Powell\u2019s psycho-thriller (from a script by Leo Marks) is a dangerous film about the dangers of watching films. Carl Boehm is the shy young man whose camera has become a deadly weapon, capturing the faces of his victims on film at the moment of their death. Critics loathed <em>Peeping Tom</em> on its first release, branding it \u201cappallingly masochistic and depraved\u201d and calling upon distributors to \u201cflush it swiftly down the nearest sewer\u201d. In the wake of such outrage, the film dropped out of circulation until Martin Scorsese championed its restoration and re-release. With its lurid Eastmancolor hues and daringly confrontational POV camera work, this remains a startlingly uncomfortable experience.

A member of the Italian communist party, but born into a noble Milanese family himself, his preoccupation with class makes perfect sense. Still, I find the operatic <em>Rocco and His Brothers</em> his most bluntly moving work. A meddling mother and her five sons swap Italy\u2019s rural south for industrial Milan in a bid for a better life. An upsetting love triangle emerges between brothers Simone (Renato Salvatori) and Rocco (Alain Delon, never more gorgeous), and a clever, fiery call girl named Nadia (the fabulous Annie Girardot); its denouement always makes me cry.

But that\u2019s not to say it is his most typical: his fluidly amorphous dual character study was a radical departure from his previous work, literalising its Jungian psychology by splintering and merging its two female characters \u2013 a frail, suddenly mute stage diva and her young carer \u2013 to inextricable, disorienting effect. Today, it feels as bracingly experimental as then, awash with disruptive, disconnected imagery that calls the camera\u2019s own perspective into question: half a century later, it remains an object of fascination and dissent among theorists.

Set in Prague, it sees two decadent pranksters in matching polka dot outfits engage in so-called bad behaviour (the world has gone bad, so they might as well). Marie I and Marie II are masters of the dine and dash, seducing sleazy older men before leaving them with the bill.

The result is a glorious hybrid: a story of a romance between a widowed cleaner (Brigitte Mira) and a Moroccan man 20 years her junior (Fassbinder\u2019s then partner El Hedi ben Salem), it has the director\u2019s trademark sharp edges, its characters marinated in disappointment and bigotry. But there is also tenderness to this Munich-based melodrama, a belief that love really can heal the scars of the past.

They play two women \u2013 a magician and a librarian \u2013 who meet one balmy Paris summer and throw themselves into a joyfully free-associative adventure, trying to save the young prisoner of a haunted house. Very loosely inspired by two Henry James stories, it is a delirious mix of hippy-era feminism, goofy mysticism, slapstick comedy and Borgesian time-twisting, as well as a serious contemplation of the mysteries of cinema, and a love letter to the \u201cphantom ladies\u201d of silent-era serials.

Beautifully shot by J\u00f6rg Schmidt-Reitwein, this is one of Herzog\u2019s most atmospheric works, but its claim to immortality is the inspired casting of an unknown as Kaspar \u2013 street musician Bruno S, whose singular vocal rhythms and body language make for a performance like no other.

In 2002 it was infamously and abysmally rehashed by Madonna and Guy Ritchie, with its sly political commentary and poetry (beginning with its full title, <em>Swept Away... By an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August</em>) gutted. It is time its reputation was reclaimed, not least since much of the rhetoric in its love-hate war of ideologies, between a haughty capitalist lady of leisure and a spiky communist deckhand on her yacht, sounds as applicable to 2019 as it did to 1974.

Using long takes and symmetrical, straight-on medium shots, Akerman pays close attention to the gestures of Jeanne\u2019s routine over the course of three minutely observed days. She cooks and cleans, takes a bath, brushes her hair, welcomes men into her bedroom in the afternoons. The cycle continues, until it doesn\u2019t. When I first watched the film, endurance gave way to anger and, later, awe \u2013 the duration forces the viewer to recalibrate the way they anticipate drama. The effect is one of ever-present foreboding that builds in the chest and begins to clog the throat; it\u2019s the feminine condition as cinema.

It is a profoundly humanist work, but one which is not afraid to get its hands dirty in depicting the unsentimental realities of rural life.

His unique vision focuses on the moment at which the banal tips over into the bizarre.

There is very little dialogue, and yet each scene, from the horribly botched magician\u2019s trick to the man who refuses to be fired from his job, speaks volumes. Delicate threads hold the seemingly disparate episodes together to build a portrait of a crumbling society that has resorted to superstition and ritual.

Catherine Breillat\u2019s film is about the bond between sisters \u2013 two warring sides of the same soul (eat your heart out, Elena Ferrante). There are consequences when 12-year-old Ana\u00efs sees her 15-year-old sister lose her innocence (we watch this through Ana\u00efs\u2019s eyes, in excruciating real time). \u201cMy first time should be with nobody,\u201d she declares in retaliation; it is a cruel irony that Breillat grants her wish. The film remains heart-bendingly shocking, violent, disturbing and audacious \u2013 a provocation, determined to challenge mythologies about virginity and romance spread by the history of cinema.

Bridging his affinities for open-hearted melodrama, wittily queer experimentation and ravishing art within art, this intricately structured tale of two men bonding over the comatose women under their care is emotionally complex and morally conflicted in its delicate handling of thorny gender constructs and bodily boundaries. Viewed in a post-#MeToo environment, it only feels more audacious and essential.

Melancholic and philosophical, but also acidly comic, it is a subtle, compassionate dissection of male malaise and class tensions, as well as a bitter-sweet love letter to Istanbul, photographed magnificently by Ceylan himself. And it contains a delicious poker-faced gag about using Tarkovsky films as a cover for watching porn.

The setting is the end of Ceau\u0219escu-era Romania, a labyrinthine maze of red tape and corruption. Two female students, room-mates at university, must negotiate this nightmarish world in order to procure an illegal abortion for one of them. Mungiu\u2019s deliberate pacing exerts a sense of mounting dread; the fiercely unsentimental approach makes for a bruising, yet utterly compelling viewing experience.

Karidja Tour\u00e9 is marvellous as Marieme, perfectly embodying the awkward tensions of someone torn between childhood and adulthood, driven to the margins by her age, her gender, her race. With its street-smart casting (Sciamma auditioned non-professionals recruited from malls and train stations), <em>Girlhood</em> speaks the language of its characters with wit, fluency and insight. A sequence during which the gang dance in stolen dresses to Rihanna\u2019s Diamonds is utterly sublime. Throughout, it is Sciamma\u2019s affection for these characters that shines through, a bitter-sweet admiration of their strengths and complexities.

The story is set against the brutal backdrop of an abattoir, where the star-crossed couple meet. Endre (G\u00e9za Morcs\u00e1nyi) is the slaughterhouse manager who keeps his emotions close to his chest; M\u00e1ria (Alexandra Borb\u00e9ly) is the quality controller, newly arrived at the plant, who seems to fear physical contact. Despite the harshness of their environment, the pair develop an unexpected relationship that scratches at the edge of transcendence. Scenes of beauty and horror, joy and sadness, life and death are juxtaposed with a poetic dexterity that is wholly disarming and quite mesmerising. MK</p>",

      "bodyText": "Back in 2017, I was asked to contribute a short piece about British cinema to a book entitled Goodbye Europe. The book was a collection of essays, inspired by the recent referendum, offering a series of different perspectives on the thorny subject of the UK\u2019s relationship to Europe, and \u201cwhat the idea of Europe means to Britons and others living here\u201d. In my essay I argued that, to all intents and purposes, there was no such thing as a \u201cBritish film\u201d per se \u2013 in an age of increasingly international co-production, national boundaries are no longer a defining feature of cinema. Moreover, if you read any interview with a film-maker at the cutting edge of UK cinema, the chances are they will refer to themselves and their work as \u201cEuropean\u201d. Take as typical these words from Carol Morley, director of The Falling, as she prepared to embark upon a film project in the US: \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by the films the German \u00e9migr\u00e9s made in America, which to me are so very European,\u201d Morley told me. \u201cFilm language is universal, and I hope my films transcend boundaries. But recently I saw someone describe [my work] as \u2018weird\u2019, so maybe the correct term should be \u2018weird European\u2019!\u201d I loved that phrase \u2013 \u201cweird European\u201d \u2013 and it came back to haunt me as the Observer set about compiling this collection of 25 films that are essential viewing in these tumultuous times. In the era of Brexit, it seems more important than ever to engage with, and feel part of, the rich heritage of European cinema, in all its strange and wonderful manifestations. Whatever the ramifications of current political and social upheavals, it\u2019s clear that film-makers (and film fans) in the UK are part of a wider tradition of borderless cinema that needs to be celebrated and explored, now more than ever. It\u2019s worth stating at the outset that this isn\u2019t intended as some form of competitive countdown. We are not claiming our selection to be a list of the \u201cbest\u201d European films ever made. Nor is it an attempt to create a critical canon that singles out the finest achievements in Euro-cinema. On the contrary, this is a personal selection made by five Observer film writers (Simran Hans, Wendy Ide, Guy Lodge, Jonathan Romney and myself) highlighting movies that we consider to be important, or affecting, or innovative \u2013 films that have struck a chord. Together, they give a flavour of the dazzling breadth of European cinema, offering a tiny snapshot of a vast cinematic landscape. We\u2019ve tried to make the list as diverse as possible, both in terms of where and when they were made, and in the stories that they tell. These titles cover a century of cinema, with the earliest dating back to 1922, while our most recent choice comes from 2017. Some hail from countries, such as Russia and Turkey, that are only partially in Europe, yet all represent a facet of what we consider to be European cinema \u2013 whatever that may be. Although historians are divided on the exact birthplace of moving pictures (Leeds, Paris and New York variously feature in differing accounts), Europe has always been a vital force in the evolution of cinema \u2013 artistically influential, even when economically overshadowed by larger industries. Just as European \u00e9migr\u00e9s shaped the face of Hollywood, so stylistic movements from German expressionism to Italian neo-realism and the French New Wave continue to reverberate throughout popular global cinema. Glancing through this collection of extraordinary, challenging, world-changing films, it\u2019s easy to see why. Nosferatu (FW Murnau, 1922, Germany) This 1922 chiller is a milestone of German expressionist cinema. Subtitled Eine Symphonie des Grauens (a symphony of horror), FW Murnau\u2019s film stars Max Schreck as Count Orlok, whose vampiric presence put the fear of god into film fans in the age before sound. Images of Orlok\u2019s undead shadow ascending a staircase and clawing at his victim\u2019s heart rank among the most haunting (and most parodied) moments in cinema. Despite its classic status, Nosferatu had a rocky start: British censors initially refused it a certificate after legal complaints by Bram Stoker\u2019s estate, claiming it to be an uncredited and unauthorised adaptation of Dracula \u2013 which, of course, it was. Many copies were destroyed, though Nosferatu \u2013 like its anti-hero \u2013 survived. MK The Passion of Joan of Arc (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1928, France) It is the face that everyone remembers: that unstinting close-up of the tear-riven visage of French actress Maria Falconetti, maintaining agonised composure as her Joan of Arc is consumed by flames before a braying mob. Aped and echoed countless times on camera \u2013 not least in Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s video for Nothing Compares 2 U \u2013 it is a scene that rewrote how faces could be explored and exploited on screen. The last silent film by Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer, it largely eschewed traditional master shots for a dazzling range of expressive, character-probing close-ups: no historical biopic has ever felt quite so unnervingly intimate. GL L\u2019Atalante (Jean Vigo, 1934, France) Jean Vigo, who died aged 29, only made four films, but his tiny oeuvre remains an inspiring landmark in European cinema. His only full-length feature is an entrancing essay in modernist romanticism, rooted equally in realism and the language of dreams. L\u2019Atalante is a canal barge, captained by naive Jean (Jean Dast\u00e9), newly married to Juliette (Dita Parlo). The course of true love doesn\u2019t run smooth, on water or on land, not least thanks to an unruly contingent of cats and to the disruptive presence of crewman Le P\u00e8re Jules \u2013 played by Michel Simon, one of the most irreducibly raw, joyous and anarchic presences in screen history. JR I Vitelloni (Federico Fellini, 1953, Italy) Fellini\u2019s wilder visionary flights are not to every taste, but one of his most enduring works is this early rites-of-passage story. The \u201cbig calves\u201d of the title are a group of young men in a seaside town, finding it harder to grow up than they expected. Among them are feckless romancer Fausto, joker Alberto (played by Alberto Sordi, soon to be a huge comedy star) and thoughtful Moraldo, the director\u2019s autobiographical stand-in. At once tender and pitiless towards the contradictions of traditional Italian masculinity, I Vitelloni was a major influence on the young Martin Scorsese. The \u201cleaving home\u201d sequence at the end is one of the most poetic moments in Fellini\u2019s work. JR Peeping Tom (Michael Powell, 1960, UK) A cautionary tale about the unhealthy relationship between voyeurism and violence, Michael Powell\u2019s psycho-thriller (from a script by Leo Marks) is a dangerous film about the dangers of watching films. Carl Boehm is the shy young man whose camera has become a deadly weapon, capturing the faces of his victims on film at the moment of their death. Critics loathed Peeping Tom on its first release, branding it \u201cappallingly masochistic and depraved\u201d and calling upon distributors to \u201cflush it swiftly down the nearest sewer\u201d. In the wake of such outrage, the film dropped out of circulation until Martin Scorsese championed its restoration and re-release. With its lurid Eastmancolor hues and daringly confrontational POV camera work, this remains a startlingly uncomfortable experience. MK Rocco and His Brothers (Luchino Visconti, 1960, Italy) Italian film-maker Luchino Visconti is best known for sweeping melodramas that focus on the upper echelons of society. A member of the Italian communist party, but born into a noble Milanese family himself, his preoccupation with class makes perfect sense. Still, I find the operatic Rocco and His Brothers his most bluntly moving work. A meddling mother and her five sons swap Italy\u2019s rural south for industrial Milan in a bid for a better life. An upsetting love triangle emerges between brothers Simone (Renato Salvatori) and Rocco (Alain Delon, never more gorgeous), and a clever, fiery call girl named Nadia (the fabulous Annie Girardot); its denouement always makes me cry. SH Persona (Ingmar Bergman, 1966, Sweden) Persona is often described as stern Swedish moodmeister Ingmar Bergman\u2019s definitive film \u2013 topping his other works in Sight &amp; Sound magazine\u2019s most recent greatest films poll. But that\u2019s not to say it is his most typical: his fluidly amorphous dual character study was a radical departure from his previous work, literalising its Jungian psychology by splintering and merging its two female characters \u2013 a frail, suddenly mute stage diva and her young carer \u2013 to inextricable, disorienting effect. Today, it feels as bracingly experimental as then, awash with disruptive, disconnected imagery that calls the camera\u2019s own perspective into question: half a century later, it remains an object of fascination and dissent among theorists. GL Daisies (V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1, 1966, Czechoslovakia) V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1\u2019s merrily anarchic Czech New Wave wonder is both a \u201cscrew you!\u201d to the joyless efficiency of collectivisation and an impish dismantling of the patriarchy. Set in Prague, it sees two decadent pranksters in matching polka dot outfits engage in so-called bad behaviour (the world has gone bad, so they might as well). Marie I and Marie II are masters of the dine and dash, seducing sleazy older men before leaving them with the bill. They slice up phallic objects for fun, and orchestrate a libertine food fight, trampling trifle intended for politicians. Frankly, it\u2019s inspirational. SH Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1973, West Germany) A prolific and unflinching film-maker who was most at home on the fringes of 1970s West German society, Rainer Werner Fassbinder paid tribute to Douglas Sirk with this portrait of love against the odds. The result is a glorious hybrid: a story of a romance between a widowed cleaner (Brigitte Mira) and a Moroccan man 20 years her junior (Fassbinder\u2019s then partner El Hedi ben Salem), it has the director\u2019s trademark sharp edges, its characters marinated in disappointment and bigotry. But there is also tenderness to this Munich-based melodrama, a belief that love really can heal the scars of the past. WI C\u00e9line &amp; Julie Go Boating (Jacques Rivette, 1974, France) The often unsung experimenter of the French New Wave, Rivette wrote this delirium of a film in collaboration with his cast, notably leads Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier. They play two women \u2013 a magician and a librarian \u2013 who meet one balmy Paris summer and throw themselves into a joyfully free-associative adventure, trying to save the young prisoner of a haunted house. Very loosely inspired by two Henry James stories, it is a delirious mix of hippy-era feminism, goofy mysticism, slapstick comedy and Borgesian time-twisting, as well as a serious contemplation of the mysteries of cinema, and a love letter to the \u201cphantom ladies\u201d of silent-era serials. JR The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (Werner Herzog, 1974, West Germany) Herzog connects with the spirit of German romanticism as he explores the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of a young man apparently raised in captivity, emerging into the daylight in 1828 a stranger to both language and the outside world. As a professor attempts to educate him, society finds its own attitudes judged by this seeming exemplar of that 19th-century archetype, the \u201cnoble savage\u201d. Beautifully shot by J\u00f6rg Schmidt-Reitwein, this is one of Herzog\u2019s most atmospheric works, but its claim to immortality is the inspired casting of an unknown as Kaspar \u2013 street musician Bruno S, whose singular vocal rhythms and body language make for a performance like no other. JR Swept Away (Lina Wertm\u00fcller, 1974, Italy) Rarely has a great film been as unjustly tarnished by a remake as Italian writer-director Lina Wertm\u00fcller\u2019s lavishly sun-varnished, idea-spilling social satire. In 2002 it was infamously and abysmally rehashed by Madonna and Guy Ritchie, with its sly political commentary and poetry (beginning with its full title, Swept Away... By an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August) gutted. It is time its reputation was reclaimed, not least since much of the rhetoric in its love-hate war of ideologies, between a haughty capitalist lady of leisure and a spiky communist deckhand on her yacht, sounds as applicable to 2019 as it did to 1974. GL Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (Chantal Akerman, 1975, Belgium/France) The late, great Chantal Akerman broke new ground with her hypnotic three-and-a-half hour response to the suffocating drudgery of domestic life. Using long takes and symmetrical, straight-on medium shots, Akerman pays close attention to the gestures of Jeanne\u2019s routine over the course of three minutely observed days. She cooks and cleans, takes a bath, brushes her hair, welcomes men into her bedroom in the afternoons. The cycle continues, until it doesn\u2019t. When I first watched the film, endurance gave way to anger and, later, awe \u2013 the duration forces the viewer to recalibrate the way they anticipate drama. The effect is one of ever-present foreboding that builds in the chest and begins to clog the throat; it\u2019s the feminine condition as cinema. SH The Travelling Players (Theo Angelopoulos, 1975, Greece) Both in its running time \u2013 three and three-quarter hours \u2013 and the scope of its sociopolitical themes, this is a substantial work. A ragtag bunch of itinerant actors tour Greece, scraping together a subsistence living. The languorous camera captures a crumbling provincial Greece between 1939 and 1952. The second world war and its aftermath loom large in a sprawling story, which also weaves in references to mythology. Audacious in its approach, and in the demands it makes on the audience, The Travelling Players is one of the most important works of Greek cinema. WI The Tree of Wooden Clogs (Ermanno Olmi, 1978, Italy) Guardian film critic Derek Malcolm opined in 1999 that \u201cno other Italian film-maker of world stature has been as neglected as Ermanno Olmi\u201d. This Palme d\u2019Or-winning epic about hard lives in late 19th-century Lombardy uses non-professional actors speaking in the distinctive Bergamasque dialect, drawing us into a tough and unforgiving world of births, weddings and deaths; of religion and feudalism; of support and slaughter. It is a profoundly humanist work, but one which is not afraid to get its hands dirty in depicting the unsentimental realities of rural life. As Mike Leigh observed: \u201cDirectly, objectively, yet compassionately, it puts on the screen the great, hard, real adventure of living and surviving from day to day, and from year to year, the experience of ordinary people everywhere.\u201d MK Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979, Soviet Union) In 2017\u2019s stylish comic-book fightfest Atomic Blonde, one of many lavishly choreographed shootouts takes place in a modernist East Berlin cinema playing Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s terrifying, spiritually tortured sci-fi nightmare: as real-life violence throws the screening into chaos, you wonder if the disruption might have come as light relief to the audience. The heady Russian formalist\u2019s most narratively straightforward film, it also might be his most philosophically and atmospherically dense. Following a misfit writer and a professor as they are led through a hostile no man\u2019s land in pursuit of a mysterious, wish-granting room, it plays like The Wizard of Oz set to a death march; gallows humour occasionally bleeding through its ominous musings on society and human nature. GL A Lonely Woman (Agnieszka Holland, 1981, Poland) A Lonely Woman is not Agnieszka Holland\u2019s most famous film. However, shot in 1981, just before martial law was imposed in Poland and the film-maker fled her own country for France, it is one of her most enduringly political (so much so that it was banned in Poland). An unblinking, hard-edged portrait of austerity and survival under communism, it centres on single mother and social outcast Irena (Maria Chwalib\u00f3g). A disabled man named Jacek (Bogus\u0142aw Linda) offers her the erotic taste of freedom, but its cost requires a brutal compromise. SH Beau Travail (Claire Denis, 1999, France) Very loosely based on Billy Budd, the Herman Melville novella, Beau Travail is a masterpiece that showcases Claire Denis\u2019s gift for visual storytelling. The backdrop, a remote French foreign legion outpost on the Horn of Africa, serves as a stage for a stylised ballet of masculinity in crisis. The abrasive Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant), a legionnaire of antisocial nature, takes against the easy charm of new recruit Gilles Sentain (Gr\u00e9goire Colin). Training exercises, viewed through the reminiscence of Galoup, take on a loaded, almost homoerotic tone. A hymn in praise of male beauty, it explores the conflict in this austere military environment between comradeship and a deeper form of attraction. WI Songs from the Second Floor (Roy Andersson, 2000, Sweden) This glumly hilarious collection of surreal vignettes could only be the work of Sweden\u2019s Roy Andersson. His unique vision focuses on the moment at which the banal tips over into the bizarre. Locked long shots emphasise the meticulous composition of the frame, and the colour palette runs the gamut from cold porridge to wet concrete. There is very little dialogue, and yet each scene, from the horribly botched magician\u2019s trick to the man who refuses to be fired from his job, speaks volumes. Delicate threads hold the seemingly disparate episodes together to build a portrait of a crumbling society that has resorted to superstition and ritual. WI Fat Girl (Catherine Breillat, 2001, France) When I think of Fat Girl, I think of a little girl in a lime green swimming costume applying sunscreen to her pudgy arms and legs. Catherine Breillat\u2019s film is about the bond between sisters \u2013 two warring sides of the same soul (eat your heart out, Elena Ferrante). There are consequences when 12-year-old Ana\u00efs sees her 15-year-old sister lose her innocence (we watch this through Ana\u00efs\u2019s eyes, in excruciating real time). \u201cMy first time should be with nobody,\u201d she declares in retaliation; it is a cruel irony that Breillat grants her wish. The film remains heart-bendingly shocking, violent, disturbing and audacious \u2013 a provocation, determined to challenge mythologies about virginity and romance spread by the history of cinema. SH Talk to Her (Pedro Almodov\u00e1r, 2002, Spain) There is little consensus on the question of Pedro Almodov\u00e1r\u2019s greatest film \u2013 some plump for the all-out heart assault of All About My Mother, others prefer the early, rowdy ones \u2013 but his 2003 Oscar winner is, for this critic\u2019s money, his most complete work. Bridging his affinities for open-hearted melodrama, wittily queer experimentation and ravishing art within art, this intricately structured tale of two men bonding over the comatose women under their care is emotionally complex and morally conflicted in its delicate handling of thorny gender constructs and bodily boundaries. Viewed in a post-#MeToo environment, it only feels more audacious and essential. GL Uzak (Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2002, Turkey) Turkish writer-director Ceylan has become more expansively novelistic in recent films such as Winter Sleep and The Wild Pear Tree, but his breakthrough feature is all about caustic concision. Uzak \u2013 meaning distant \u2013 is an odd-couple drama about a jaded intellectual photographer who finds himself playing host to an unemployed cousin. Melancholic and philosophical, but also acidly comic, it is a subtle, compassionate dissection of male malaise and class tensions, as well as a bitter-sweet love letter to Istanbul, photographed magnificently by Ceylan himself. And it contains a delicious poker-faced gag about using Tarkovsky films as a cover for watching porn. JR 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (Cristian Mungiu, 2007, Romania) Pretty much the archetypal film from the Romanian New Wave, this Palme d\u2019Or-winning drama is austere, naturalistic and, despite the unpromising subject matter, as gripping as any thriller. The setting is the end of Ceau\u0219escu-era Romania, a labyrinthine maze of red tape and corruption. Two female students, room-mates at university, must negotiate this nightmarish world in order to procure an illegal abortion for one of them. Mungiu\u2019s deliberate pacing exerts a sense of mounting dread; the fiercely unsentimental approach makes for a bruising, yet utterly compelling viewing experience. WI Girlhood (C\u00e9line Sciamma, 2014, France) Following 2007\u2019s Water Lilies and 2011\u2019s Tomboy, C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s brilliant tale of young girls living the Paris banlieue life (originally entitled Bande de filles) forms the third chapter of an accidental \u201ctrilogy of youth\u201d. Karidja Tour\u00e9 is marvellous as Marieme, perfectly embodying the awkward tensions of someone torn between childhood and adulthood, driven to the margins by her age, her gender, her race. With its street-smart casting (Sciamma auditioned non-professionals recruited from malls and train stations), Girlhood speaks the language of its characters with wit, fluency and insight. A sequence during which the gang dance in stolen dresses to Rihanna\u2019s Diamonds is utterly sublime. Throughout, it is Sciamma\u2019s affection for these characters that shines through, a bitter-sweet admiration of their strengths and complexities. MK On Body and Soul (Ildik\u00f3 Enyedi, 2017, Hungary) Hungarian director Ildik\u00f3 Enyedi won the top prize at the Berlin film festival for this eerie, disorientating love story about two withdrawn outsiders who find themselves inexplicably sharing the same woodland dreams. The story is set against the brutal backdrop of an abattoir, where the star-crossed couple meet. Endre (G\u00e9za Morcs\u00e1nyi) is the slaughterhouse manager who keeps his emotions close to his chest; M\u00e1ria (Alexandra Borb\u00e9ly) is the quality controller, newly arrived at the plant, who seems to fear physical contact. Despite the harshness of their environment, the pair develop an unexpected relationship that scratches at the edge of transcendence. Scenes of beauty and horror, joy and sadness, life and death are juxtaposed with a poetic dexterity that is wholly disarming and quite mesmerising. MK",

      "body": "<p>Meeting the author and neuropsychologist AK Benjamin is bit like an encounter with a spy or someone in witness protection. First of all, AK Benjamin is not his real name. He doesn\u2019t want to say what that is. Or where he lives. \u201cAsia\u201d is as specific as he gets about his current address. He won\u2019t say where in England he was originally from \u2013 his accent suggests it wasn\u2019t too far from Manchester \u2013 or which university he went to, or where he has worked. But there are some details he is prepared to divulge. There are hints at his age \u2013 mid-to-late 40s. Aside from being a trained neuropsychologist \u2013 that is, a psychologist who works with people with neurological conditions or injuries \u2013 he has been a scriptwriter in the British film industry, he set up a charity, was a monk in California, has worked with gang members in US prisons and South American sex workers, is a father of two daughters, and for a decade was a self-destructive alcoholic and drug addict.</p> <p>It sounds like five different lives crashed into one, which is, curiously, very much the impression Benjamin gives in the flesh. Not through anything he says, but just the way he looks, with an aura of intensity that seems to hover over him like an electrical storm.</p> <p>Despite his close-cropped head, he doesn\u2019t look like a monk. And nowadays he\u2019s not, but he doesn\u2019t look like someone who was ever a monk or, come to that, a neuropsychologist. He bears a passing resemblance to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kiefer-sutherland\" title=\"\">Kiefer Sutherland </a>in his Jack Bauer days \u2013 wiry but muscular and tightly wound. He looks, as they say, as if he could look after himself, although looking after himself has in many respects been a struggle for Benjamin, even as he was looking after others. This struggle and the plight of those in his care are the subject of his first book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/let-me-not-be-mad-9781847925428.html\" title=\"\">Let Me Not Be Mad</a></em>.</p> <p>It starts out as a series of case studies in which a neuropsychologist holds clinics with various patients. There is, for example, a woman, known only as \u201cYou\u201d, who, slipping into premature dementia, pierces the professional\u2019s heart. There\u2019s \u201cMichael\u201d, an all-action businessman who suffers a brain injury while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/06/base-jumping-why-do-it\" title=\"\">base-jumping</a> that transforms his personality \u2013 or does it enable emergence of the one he\u2019d been repressing? There are also other patients who may or may not be versions of the narrator \u2013 ie the neuropsychologist \u2013 undergoing psychological assessment.</p> <p>On the surface the stories are told with that precise clinical detachment \u2013 jargon and protocols explained \u2013 familiar from many medical memoirs. But the style is almost ironic because beneath it there is a great swell of compassion, black comedy and astute personal observation constantly threatening to break through. Slowly we begin to see that the clinician is also suffering. As the encounters grow more uncertain and even surreal, it becomes evident that during episodes of paranoia, insomnia, aggression and delusion, the person most in danger of losing his mind is, in fact, the narrator. So why the pseudonym and surrounding mystery?</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to protect people who know me, the people I\u2019ve treated and who I will treat in the future,\u201d he tells me in a caf\u00e9 in King\u2019s Cross. He\u2019s worried patients might project things from the book on to themselves, or that some might be disturbed, as he puts it, \u201cto see an incarnation of me debasing myself\u201d.</p> <p>Debasing? It\u2019s certainly a strange and powerful work of\u2026 well, what exactly? You can\u2019t call it a memoir as although drawn from his life, it\u2019s written through a fictionalised filter that, at times, is dark and distorting. But then nor is it a novel. If anything, it occupies that increasingly disputed borderland between fiction and nonfiction, where many of today\u2019s most intriguing writers gather. Benjamin mentions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/ben-lerner-1004-novel-books-interview\" title=\"\">Ben Lerner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/21/emmanuel-carrere-most-important-french-writer-youve-never-heard-of\" title=\"\">Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re</a>, both of whom are difficult to categorise, as writers he admires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd7b3d3317005c00d0434ba16bbd626eba87e762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7b3d3317005c00d0434ba16bbd626eba87e762/0_0_3226_4230/763.jpg\" alt=\"A white line drawing on a blue background of a face and a decreasing square for the head with a stick figure man falling right in the centre\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve always experienced the world quite intensely one way or another.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: The Project Twins/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first writer that engaged young Benjamin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\" title=\"\">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>. He was a troubled boy, he says, upset by his parents\u2019 divorce and unsettled by moving from school to school. From an early age, he felt he didn\u2019t fit in and he knew life was going to be difficult. Then he read <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. \u201cI hadn\u2019t read a book before that,\u201d he recalls. At the same time he discovered alcohol and girls. The combination of high literature, booze and romance proved painfully irresistible. What followed was drink, drugs, heartbreak \u2013 and books that made sense of the chaos. He managed to make it to university, but was asked to take a year out because of his alcohol and drug abuse. Nevertheless he had plans to become an academic. Then he fell in love with a woman who was going into the film industry. So he decided to follow her.</p> <p>He describes it as a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d time in his life. While everyone else seemed to realise that there was a serious point to what they were doing, he just thought: \u201cWe\u2019re in a playground, what\u2019s the point of going home now when we can stay out?\u201d Was he a binge drinker? \u201cYeah. But I binged every night.\u201d What drugs was he using? \u201cMainly things that helped with the drinking. Coke and speed.\u201d</p> <p>Benjamin\u2019s dreams of making elaborate arthouse films went nowhere. At 28, having hit what he describes as \u201crock bottom\u201d, he decided to get sober. He joined AA and NA, but his way of dealing with life without drink and drugs was to set up a charity for homeless people with drink and drug problems. He still had a lot of pent-up anger, which he tried to channel into Thai boxing. \u201cI got to semi-professional status,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was just constantly working out if I could take that guy and that guy at the same time. So that wasn\u2019t useful.\u201d</p> <p>He started visiting retreats in the UK and then joined a monastery on the west coast of America, living as a monk. He sang psalms and read philosophy, in between helping gang members and sex workers. He says he\u2019s long had an urge to help people worse off than himself, partly as a coping mechanism. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always experienced the world quite intensely one way or another. I don\u2019t want to make myself exceptional, but at the same time there are aspects of being alive that I\u2019ve found extremely difficult. Being around people who have got it much worse has been one helpful way.\u201d</p> <p>While he was a monk \u2013 not an environment renowned for procreative possibilities \u2013 he realised he wanted to have children. And it was then he met a spiritual mentor who told him he should work in neuroscience and psychology and spend his life writing about it. And that\u2019s precisely what he did. He returned to the UK, went back to university at 32, qualified as a clinical psychologist and didn\u2019t complete his studies entirely until he was 44, by which time he\u2019d been seeing patients for about eight years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are some aspects of being alive that I have found very difficult</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He met a partner and they quite quickly had two girls.

      "bodyText": "Meeting the author and neuropsychologist AK Benjamin is bit like an encounter with a spy or someone in witness protection. First of all, AK Benjamin is not his real name. He doesn\u2019t want to say what that is. Or where he lives. \u201cAsia\u201d is as specific as he gets about his current address. He won\u2019t say where in England he was originally from \u2013 his accent suggests it wasn\u2019t too far from Manchester \u2013 or which university he went to, or where he has worked. But there are some details he is prepared to divulge. There are hints at his age \u2013 mid-to-late 40s. Aside from being a trained neuropsychologist \u2013 that is, a psychologist who works with people with neurological conditions or injuries \u2013 he has been a scriptwriter in the British film industry, he set up a charity, was a monk in California, has worked with gang members in US prisons and South American sex workers, is a father of two daughters, and for a decade was a self-destructive alcoholic and drug addict. It sounds like five different lives crashed into one, which is, curiously, very much the impression Benjamin gives in the flesh. Not through anything he says, but just the way he looks, with an aura of intensity that seems to hover over him like an electrical storm. Despite his close-cropped head, he doesn\u2019t look like a monk. And nowadays he\u2019s not, but he doesn\u2019t look like someone who was ever a monk or, come to that, a neuropsychologist. He bears a passing resemblance to Kiefer Sutherland in his Jack Bauer days \u2013 wiry but muscular and tightly wound. He looks, as they say, as if he could look after himself, although looking after himself has in many respects been a struggle for Benjamin, even as he was looking after others. This struggle and the plight of those in his care are the subject of his first book, Let Me Not Be Mad. It starts out as a series of case studies in which a neuropsychologist holds clinics with various patients. There is, for example, a woman, known only as \u201cYou\u201d, who, slipping into premature dementia, pierces the professional\u2019s heart. There\u2019s \u201cMichael\u201d, an all-action businessman who suffers a brain injury while base-jumping that transforms his personality \u2013 or does it enable emergence of the one he\u2019d been repressing? There are also other patients who may or may not be versions of the narrator \u2013 ie the neuropsychologist \u2013 undergoing psychological assessment. On the surface the stories are told with that precise clinical detachment \u2013 jargon and protocols explained \u2013 familiar from many medical memoirs. But the style is almost ironic because beneath it there is a great swell of compassion, black comedy and astute personal observation constantly threatening to break through. Slowly we begin to see that the clinician is also suffering. As the encounters grow more uncertain and even surreal, it becomes evident that during episodes of paranoia, insomnia, aggression and delusion, the person most in danger of losing his mind is, in fact, the narrator. So why the pseudonym and surrounding mystery? \u201cBecause I want to protect people who know me, the people I\u2019ve treated and who I will treat in the future,\u201d he tells me in a caf\u00e9 in King\u2019s Cross. He\u2019s worried patients might project things from the book on to themselves, or that some might be disturbed, as he puts it, \u201cto see an incarnation of me debasing myself\u201d. Debasing? It\u2019s certainly a strange and powerful work of\u2026 well, what exactly? You can\u2019t call it a memoir as although drawn from his life, it\u2019s written through a fictionalised filter that, at times, is dark and distorting. But then nor is it a novel. If anything, it occupies that increasingly disputed borderland between fiction and nonfiction, where many of today\u2019s most intriguing writers gather. Benjamin mentions Ben Lerner and Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, both of whom are difficult to categorise, as writers he admires. The first writer that engaged young Benjamin was Fyodor Dostoevsky. He was a troubled boy, he says, upset by his parents\u2019 divorce and unsettled by moving from school to school. From an early age, he felt he didn\u2019t fit in and he knew life was going to be difficult. Then he read Crime and Punishment. \u201cI hadn\u2019t read a book before that,\u201d he recalls. At the same time he discovered alcohol and girls. The combination of high literature, booze and romance proved painfully irresistible. What followed was drink, drugs, heartbreak \u2013 and books that made sense of the chaos. He managed to make it to university, but was asked to take a year out because of his alcohol and drug abuse. Nevertheless he had plans to become an academic. Then he fell in love with a woman who was going into the film industry. So he decided to follow her. He describes it as a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d time in his life. While everyone else seemed to realise that there was a serious point to what they were doing, he just thought: \u201cWe\u2019re in a playground, what\u2019s the point of going home now when we can stay out?\u201d Was he a binge drinker? \u201cYeah. But I binged every night.\u201d What drugs was he using? \u201cMainly things that helped with the drinking. Coke and speed.\u201d Benjamin\u2019s dreams of making elaborate arthouse films went nowhere. At 28, having hit what he describes as \u201crock bottom\u201d, he decided to get sober. He joined AA and NA, but his way of dealing with life without drink and drugs was to set up a charity for homeless people with drink and drug problems. He still had a lot of pent-up anger, which he tried to channel into Thai boxing. \u201cI got to semi-professional status,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was just constantly working out if I could take that guy and that guy at the same time. So that wasn\u2019t useful.\u201d He started visiting retreats in the UK and then joined a monastery on the west coast of America, living as a monk. He sang psalms and read philosophy, in between helping gang members and sex workers. He says he\u2019s long had an urge to help people worse off than himself, partly as a coping mechanism. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always experienced the world quite intensely one way or another. I don\u2019t want to make myself exceptional, but at the same time there are aspects of being alive that I\u2019ve found extremely difficult. Being around people who have got it much worse has been one helpful way.\u201d While he was a monk \u2013 not an environment renowned for procreative possibilities \u2013 he realised he wanted to have children.

It\u2019s been another level of guilt, another sense of failure,\u201d he says. That sounds bleak, but Benjamin is one of those people for whom awkward honesty will always come before social niceties.

He also derived a lot of satisfaction from his job. \u201cBuilding up relationships with people who are either on the brink of some terrible neurological devastation or on the other side of it is tremendously meaningful,\u201d he says.

      "body": "<p>Between dozing off and the alarm shrieking, our bodies and brains undergo quite a few changes. Sleep researchers call the first stage of sleep N1. It is light, and if woken from it we might not realise we had drifted off in the first place. Our night-time voyage is well established by the time we enter the second stage of sleep, N2. This can be identified in the laboratory by distinctive brainwaves such as sleep spindles, involving a sudden burst of brain activity. N3 is referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because of the brain activity, which is more comparable to rolling waves. Eventually, we reach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/08/sleep-how-much-do-we-really-need\" title=\"\">rapid eye movement (REM) sleep</a> \u2013 a stage characterised by brain activity not unlike that seen during our waking lives. Vivid dreams and bodily paralysis also occur \u2013 perhaps the latter keeps us safe, by preventing us from acting out the former. Adult sleep cycles take about 90 minutes.</p> <p>Two main processes control when we sleep. The first is called sleep homeostasis and refers to our sleep drive. The longer we have been awake, the greater our pressure to fall asleep. This alone can\u2019t explain why we might struggle to sleep during the day, despite having been up all night; or find ourselves nodding off in the evening even though we snuck a daytime nap. Instead, the circadian process helps to explain such occurrences. This clock-like mechanism is controlled by a central pacemaker in the brain. Our internal body clocks often run at slightly over 24 hours a day, so we use zeitgebers (time-givers) from the environment, to tweak our internal clocks so as to fit with the world outside. Cues come from all around \u2013 including the time we eat or exercise \u2013 but none is as important as light exposure. Light helps our brain know it is time to be awake and darkness allows us to produce melatonin, giving our bodies a sign that it is time to sleep. Without cues from the environment, bedtime would typically become later night-on-night, and soon we\u2019d find ourselves ready to sleep when we should be waking up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/sleep_duration/giv-3902iIZYe4Vi4CyX/\" data-alt=\"Recommended sleeping hours\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/02/sleep_duration/giv-3902iIZYe4Vi4CyX/\">Recommended sleeping hours</a> </figure>  <h2>Babies</h2> <p>Our sleep changes throughout our lives. At birth, babies do not move through sleep stages as they will as adults. Instead, they start their night in active sleep (much like REM) and progress into a stage known as quiet sleep. A premature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/mar/01/babies-sleep-patterns-challenging-shouldnt-despair-baby-sleep-day\" title=\"\">baby may complete a sleep cycle</a> in as little as half the time it takes an adult. The circadian and homeostatic processes develop gradually; by six months, the body clock is well-established and synchronised to the surrounding world. Babies\u2019 sleep can be difficult for parents to cope with, but a plethora of advice is available, such as that on the website set up by the <a href=\"http://www.babysleep.com\" title=\"\">Pediatric Sleep Council</a>.</p> <h2>Children</h2> <p>As babies develop into pre-schoolers and then start school, the amount of sleep they need decreases. The composition of sleep changes, too. Whereas newborn babies spend about 50% of their sleep in a REM-like state, this reduces to 25% by the age of two. REM sleep is most abundant at the stage of life during which the brain is most plastic \u2013 and when connections are being formed most rapidly. This hints at the importance of REM for the developing brain, and one of its functions may be to support the developing visual system.</p> <p>Over time, the challenge of a baby waking around the clock can be replaced by other night-time issues, such as bedtime resistance of a toddler. Establishing routines early in life can be helpful, and research has found that the more often a child has a bedtime routine, the better they sleep. There are endless other tips to support sleep, including avoiding light at night: exposure can suppress melatonin. Televisions should also be kept out of the bedroom. Pre-schoolers with TVs in their bedrooms have been reported to have poorer sleep.</p> <h2>Teenagers</h2> <p>As well as length, sleep timing changes throughout our lives. The most dramatic shift occurs during the teenage years. Sleep can easily shift two hours later in adolescence, compared with that of younger children or older adults. This change is found in teenagers around the world and in other mammals too, and has been linked to puberty. For example, puberty has been associated with a delay in the start and end of daily activity in marmoset monkeys. The processes leading to the shift in sleep timing that occurs during adolescence have been referred to as the \u201cperfect storm\u201d, involving changes in the homeostatic and circadian mechanisms in concert with social pressures and societal demands.</p> <p>The mechanisms underlying this shift are complex. For example, some data suggest that adolescents have a lower sleep drive than children during certain parts of the evening, making it harder for them to nod off. With increased development there does not seem to be a greater sensitivity to evening light, as was once considered likely, but rather there might be greater exposure to light that could delay the body clock. This light could come from multiple sources including smartphones, tablets and TVs. Increased autonomy granted by parents and greater social obligations could also result in a later bedtime.</p> <p>Although it is clear that sleep is important for development, many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/30/childrens-lack-of-sleep-is-hidden-health-crisis-experts-say\" title=\"\">children and adolescents may not be getting enough</a>. For example, a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published last year, noted that more than half of the middle-school children assessed reported getting less than the recommended amount. This increased to nearly 75% of those in secondary education.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Sleep can easily shift two hours later in adolescence, a process that has been referred to as the 'perfect storm'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This widespread issue needs to be addressed. Policy decisions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/school-deprived-pupils-extra-hour-classes\" title=\"\">such as pushing back school start times for adolescents</a> to align with their circadian patterns, can result in more sleep. Whether a bedtime is set by parents (and its time at which it is set) is also linked to the amount of sleep children get. The value of educating children about sleep might seem intuitive, but research has suggested that education alone does not always result in the desired behaviour change. Those who miss out on sleep during the week, might want to catch up at the weekend \u2013 and this can be helpful. However, we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that this is as good as a consistent sleep routine. Substantial changes to our sleep timing can result in a jetlag-like state (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/21/social-jetlag-are-late-nights-and-chaotic-sleep-patterns-making-you-ill\" title=\"\">social jetlag</a>). A shift in sleep timing at the weekend can mean that on Sunday evening we need to traverse multiple time zones in order to cope with an early start on Monday morning. Going to bed earlier than we did on the preceding nights can mean that it is difficult to nod off and we end up missing out on sleep. Social jetlag has also been associated with various difficulties including alcohol consumption, depression, metabolic dysfunction, and obesity.</p> <h2>Adults</h2> <p>At about 20 years of age, there is a return to earlier sleep timing, and this shift has even been considered to provide biological evidence of the end of adolescence. Sleep-length recommendations in early and mid-adulthood average about eight hours a night. However, during these rush-hour years, many people report that it can be difficult to achieve. At least some recent data suggests that things could be improving, and that sleep duration is increasing. Sleep remains important as we hit our senior years, yet it can be more difficult to obtain than ever before. Reasons are plentiful and could include a reduction of cells in brain regions important in bringing about sleep, and changes to our eyes which filter light in a different way. Health difficulties and social reasons, such as lifestyle changes linked to retirement, can also play a part.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb2d60c369137b3ab534638a52c7c8c5c4df3904\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb2d60c369137b3ab534638a52c7c8c5c4df3904/0_0_1138_1330/856.jpg\" alt=\"snoring illustation\" width=\"856\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alec Doherty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Alec Doherty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Women and sleep</h2> <p>While relatively under-researched, different aspects of sleep have been linked to gender. The adolescent shift in sleep timing differs in males and females, with the shift peaking earlier in females compared with males, perhaps reflecting their earlier physical development. After puberty, males typically have later sleep timing than females, a trend that disappears once menopause is reached.</p> <p>Puberty also rings changes for those horrible sleepless nights that we all experience.

      "bodyText": "Between dozing off and the alarm shrieking, our bodies and brains undergo quite a few changes. Sleep researchers call the first stage of sleep N1. It is light, and if woken from it we might not realise we had drifted off in the first place. Our night-time voyage is well established by the time we enter the second stage of sleep, N2. This can be identified in the laboratory by distinctive brainwaves such as sleep spindles, involving a sudden burst of brain activity. N3 is referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because of the brain activity, which is more comparable to rolling waves. Eventually, we reach rapid eye movement (REM) sleep \u2013 a stage characterised by brain activity not unlike that seen during our waking lives. Vivid dreams and bodily paralysis also occur \u2013 perhaps the latter keeps us safe, by preventing us from acting out the former. Adult sleep cycles take about 90 minutes. Two main processes control when we sleep. The first is called sleep homeostasis and refers to our sleep drive. The longer we have been awake, the greater our pressure to fall asleep. This alone can\u2019t explain why we might struggle to sleep during the day, despite having been up all night; or find ourselves nodding off in the evening even though we snuck a daytime nap. Instead, the circadian process helps to explain such occurrences. This clock-like mechanism is controlled by a central pacemaker in the brain. Our internal body clocks often run at slightly over 24 hours a day, so we use zeitgebers (time-givers) from the environment, to tweak our internal clocks so as to fit with the world outside. Cues come from all around \u2013 including the time we eat or exercise \u2013 but none is as important as light exposure. Light helps our brain know it is time to be awake and darkness allows us to produce melatonin, giving our bodies a sign that it is time to sleep. Without cues from the environment, bedtime would typically become later night-on-night, and soon we\u2019d find ourselves ready to sleep when we should be waking up. Babies Our sleep changes throughout our lives. At birth, babies do not move through sleep stages as they will as adults. Instead, they start their night in active sleep (much like REM) and progress into a stage known as quiet sleep. A premature baby may complete a sleep cycle in as little as half the time it takes an adult. The circadian and homeostatic processes develop gradually; by six months, the body clock is well-established and synchronised to the surrounding world. Babies\u2019 sleep can be difficult for parents to cope with, but a plethora of advice is available, such as that on the website set up by the Pediatric Sleep Council. Children As babies develop into pre-schoolers and then start school, the amount of sleep they need decreases. The composition of sleep changes, too. Whereas newborn babies spend about 50% of their sleep in a REM-like state, this reduces to 25% by the age of two. REM sleep is most abundant at the stage of life during which the brain is most plastic \u2013 and when connections are being formed most rapidly. This hints at the importance of REM for the developing brain, and one of its functions may be to support the developing visual system. Over time, the challenge of a baby waking around the clock can be replaced by other night-time issues, such as bedtime resistance of a toddler. Establishing routines early in life can be helpful, and research has found that the more often a child has a bedtime routine, the better they sleep. There are endless other tips to support sleep, including avoiding light at night: exposure can suppress melatonin. Televisions should also be kept out of the bedroom. Pre-schoolers with TVs in their bedrooms have been reported to have poorer sleep. Teenagers As well as length, sleep timing changes throughout our lives. The most dramatic shift occurs during the teenage years. Sleep can easily shift two hours later in adolescence, compared with that of younger children or older adults. This change is found in teenagers around the world and in other mammals too, and has been linked to puberty. For example, puberty has been associated with a delay in the start and end of daily activity in marmoset monkeys. The processes leading to the shift in sleep timing that occurs during adolescence have been referred to as the \u201cperfect storm\u201d, involving changes in the homeostatic and circadian mechanisms in concert with social pressures and societal demands. The mechanisms underlying this shift are complex. For example, some data suggest that adolescents have a lower sleep drive than children during certain parts of the evening, making it harder for them to nod off. With increased development there does not seem to be a greater sensitivity to evening light, as was once considered likely, but rather there might be greater exposure to light that could delay the body clock. This light could come from multiple sources including smartphones, tablets and TVs. Increased autonomy granted by parents and greater social obligations could also result in a later bedtime. Although it is clear that sleep is important for development, many children and adolescents may not be getting enough. For example, a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published last year, noted that more than half of the middle-school children assessed reported getting less than the recommended amount. This increased to nearly 75% of those in secondary education. This widespread issue needs to be addressed. Policy decisions, such as pushing back school start times for adolescents to align with their circadian patterns, can result in more sleep. Whether a bedtime is set by parents (and its time at which it is set) is also linked to the amount of sleep children get. The value of educating children about sleep might seem intuitive, but research has suggested that education alone does not always result in the desired behaviour change. Those who miss out on sleep during the week, might want to catch up at the weekend \u2013 and this can be helpful. However, we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that this is as good as a consistent sleep routine. Substantial changes to our sleep timing can result in a jetlag-like state (social jetlag). A shift in sleep timing at the weekend can mean that on Sunday evening we need to traverse multiple time zones in order to cope with an early start on Monday morning. Going to bed earlier than we did on the preceding nights can mean that it is difficult to nod off and we end up missing out on sleep. Social jetlag has also been associated with various difficulties including alcohol consumption, depression, metabolic dysfunction, and obesity. Adults At about 20 years of age, there is a return to earlier sleep timing, and this shift has even been considered to provide biological evidence of the end of adolescence. Sleep-length recommendations in early and mid-adulthood average about eight hours a night. However, during these rush-hour years, many people report that it can be difficult to achieve. At least some recent data suggests that things could be improving, and that sleep duration is increasing. Sleep remains important as we hit our senior years, yet it can be more difficult to obtain than ever before. Reasons are plentiful and could include a reduction of cells in brain regions important in bringing about sleep, and changes to our eyes which filter light in a different way. Health difficulties and social reasons, such as lifestyle changes linked to retirement, can also play a part. Women and sleep While relatively under-researched, different aspects of sleep have been linked to gender. The adolescent shift in sleep timing differs in males and females, with the shift peaking earlier in females compared with males, perhaps reflecting their earlier physical development. After puberty, males typically have later sleep timing than females, a trend that disappears once menopause is reached. Puberty also rings changes for those horrible sleepless nights that we all experience. Whereas insomnia is reported with similar frequency in young boys and girls, after puberty, it is more common in females, remaining that way into older adulthood. Daniel Buysse, professor of sleep medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, notes: \u201cMen and women also have differences in sleep physiology, specifically greater amounts of deep sleep in women. Paradoxically, one might predict better sleep in women as a result.\u201d So, why might these gender differences appear? Links to other conditions could play a part. Instances of depression, which are commonly associated with insomnia, become more pronounced in females than males during adolescence. Could the increased rates of depression in females after adolescence to some extent also help to explain the rise in insomnia? Another possibility is that there are gender differences in the way that men and women report symptoms. Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, the director of the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, thinks this may be the case. He tells me: \u201cOur data show that in healthy people without sleep complaints, the association between subjective sleep quality [self-report] and polysomnography [an objective measure of sleep] is much stronger in women than in men.\u201d This might suggest that women are more accurate than men at reporting certain aspects of their sleep.

      "body": "<p>If they did not exist, would we invent them? Given the chance to start from scratch, would Britain regard the Conservative and Labour parties, the two old and ugly sisters of our politics, as the best we can do? Are they fit for the purpose of representing and reconciling the diversity of opinions in a modern and complex country? And for offering it a choice of decent governments? A growing number of us have been saying not and for a long time.</p> <p>Even before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> split both parties and scrambled voter allegiances, much of the electorate was expressing its dissatisfaction with the big two. The Tories have not won a solid parliamentary majority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1987/jun/12/electionspast.past\" title=\"\">since 1987</a>. The last Labour leader who was not called Tony Blair to secure a healthy Commons majority was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0075011\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a> in 1966.</p> <p>The number of voters who enthusiastically identify as red or blue has been in long-term decline. Party membership has also been shrivelling. The Tories, who once boasted that they were a million strong, bump along at <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/07/their-numbers-are-dwindling-tory-members-are-now-uk-s-most-influential-political\" title=\"\">around 100,000</a>. Labour enjoyed a trend-defying surge in its membership during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jun/12/oh-jeremy-corbyn-how-people-started-chanting-the-labour-leaders-name-video\" title=\"\">Ohhh Jeremy Corbyn</a> phase of his leadership, but that is going downhill as the magical uncle turns out not to be so wondrous after all.</p> <p>It is true that the big two can still gather up a lot of votes. After decades of decline in their combined vote share, it blipped up at the last election. But I don\u2019t think that truly indicated renewed enthusiasm for either of them. It was a false positive induced by an electoral system that compels many voters to make a forced choice between the unappetising and the inedible. It doesn\u2019t mean that these nose-holding voters like what\u2019s put before them. The current choice on offer is so disdained that, when pollsters ask who would make best prime minister, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are regularly beaten into second and third place by <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/sctel9ttf5/YG%20Trackers%20-%20Best%20Prime%20Minister.pdf\" title=\"\">Neither</a>. More than half of the electorate say their views are not properly represented by the existing political parties.</p> <p>Many politicians can\u2019t stand the parties they represent. Some actively and publicly rage about what has become of them. I cannot recall a period in my lifetime when so many MPs have expressed so much disgust and despair with the state of their own parties. For every Tory who expresses agony about what Brexit has done to the party they used to love, there is a Labour MP voicing anguish about what Corbynism has done to the party that they have spent a lifetime serving.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64da914ff61fb5ee060a74c2d5274d1857bb2fe0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64da914ff61fb5ee060a74c2d5274d1857bb2fe0/0_238_3045_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Boles MP for Grantham and Stamford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nick Boles is being threatened with de-selection as MP for Grantham and Stamford because local Tories don\u2019t like the positions he has taken on Brexit.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both parties are closer to splitting than at any time in the past 30 years. In fact, they are already split. The relevant questions are when, how and in what numbers actual breakaways will start to happen. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/02/rebel-labour-mps-set-to-quit-party-and-form-centre-group\" title=\"\">group of Labour MPs</a> has one foot out of the door. They would have gone some time ago were it not for Brexit and it will be Brexit and the Labour leadership\u2019s refusal to commit to a second referendum that will be most often cited as the catalyst for the creation of a new formation. While Brexit is evidently important, it also stands proxy for the many profound ideological divisions between the social democrats in Labour and a leadership cadre that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/03/shami-chakrabarti-defends-jeremy-corbyn-venezuela-remarks\" title=\"\">will not condemn</a> Venezuela\u2019s corrupt and ruinous dictatorship because the regime calls itself socialist. The root cause of a breakaway from Labour will be the belief of some of its MPs and members that the party they used to belong to no longer exists and their self-respect is incompatible with remaining within its ranks.</p> <p>It goes without saying that Brexit has driven a wedge through the Conservative party. Explaining the humiliations and contortions that Theresa May has undergone over the past 32 months, some of her friends report that her overriding objective has been to avoid going down in history as the leader who turned Tory divisions over Europe into a formal split. She is now in the last gasp of her attempts to find a Brexit deal that does not blow up her party. Even if she somehow pulls that off, this will only be a temporary postponement of the ultimate struggle for the Tory soul. Brexit is a cause of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/03/hard-brexiters-say-only-acceptable-way-forward-is-to-remove-backstop\" title=\"\">Tory division</a> in itself and the battleground for a war between very different conceptions of what Conservatism should be about and what the party ought to be offering the country. This struggle will come to its head when Mrs May\u2019s retirement unleashes a contest to succeed her. A group of centrist Conservative MPs has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44870393\" title=\"\">publicly declared</a> that they could not remain members of their party if the leadership is acquired by Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg or another of the English nationalist faction most popular with Tory activists.</p> <p>Both parties would have split already and probably long ago were it not for the straitjacket imposed by Britain\u2019s method of electing MPs. The unstable coalition that is the Conservative party and the unhappy forced marriage called the Labour party are held together by a system that is designed to accommodate only two parties. It makes breaking away to try something fresh difficult and risky. That is how we have ended up with a Conservative party that contains <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-wins-vote-confidence-conservative-leadership-brexit-deal-eu-vote-a8679986.html\" title=\"\">Sarah Wollaston and Andrew Bridgen</a>, who would be in separate parties in a different system. That is how we have ended up with a Labour party that contains <a href=\"https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/diary/rival-labour-mps-chris-leslie-and-chris-williamson-finally-share-studio\" title=\"\">Chris Williamson and Chris Leslie</a>, politicians who will very likely be in separate parties before very long.</p> <p>The Tory party has long been a menagerie of free marketeers, internationalists, liberals, libertarians, traditionalists, reactionaries, authoritarians and nationalists. When times are good and the party is prospering, they have held it together if only because they have loathed the Labour party even more than each other. When their fundamental differences are stressed, the competing Tory factions erupt. The trigger for Conservative explosions has nearly always been Europe because it exposes very different ideas of what it means to be on the right. Labour has ever been a church so broad that its pews have included social democrats, socialists, greens, incrementalists, would-be revolutionaries, central planners, localists, Atlanticists who were appalled by the Soviet Union and fellow travellers who rather admired the Kremlin. When times are good and the party is prospering, they have kept the show on the road if only because they have detested the Tories even more than each other.

      "bodyText": "If they did not exist, would we invent them? Given the chance to start from scratch, would Britain regard the Conservative and Labour parties, the two old and ugly sisters of our politics, as the best we can do? Are they fit for the purpose of representing and reconciling the diversity of opinions in a modern and complex country? And for offering it a choice of decent governments? A growing number of us have been saying not and for a long time. Even before Brexit split both parties and scrambled voter allegiances, much of the electorate was expressing its dissatisfaction with the big two. The Tories have not won a solid parliamentary majority since 1987. The last Labour leader who was not called Tony Blair to secure a healthy Commons majority was Harold Wilson in 1966. The number of voters who enthusiastically identify as red or blue has been in long-term decline. Party membership has also been shrivelling. The Tories, who once boasted that they were a million strong, bump along at around 100,000. Labour enjoyed a trend-defying surge in its membership during the Ohhh Jeremy Corbyn phase of his leadership, but that is going downhill as the magical uncle turns out not to be so wondrous after all. It is true that the big two can still gather up a lot of votes. After decades of decline in their combined vote share, it blipped up at the last election. But I don\u2019t think that truly indicated renewed enthusiasm for either of them. It was a false positive induced by an electoral system that compels many voters to make a forced choice between the unappetising and the inedible. It doesn\u2019t mean that these nose-holding voters like what\u2019s put before them. The current choice on offer is so disdained that, when pollsters ask who would make best prime minister, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are regularly beaten into second and third place by Neither. More than half of the electorate say their views are not properly represented by the existing political parties. Many politicians can\u2019t stand the parties they represent. Some actively and publicly rage about what has become of them. I cannot recall a period in my lifetime when so many MPs have expressed so much disgust and despair with the state of their own parties. For every Tory who expresses agony about what Brexit has done to the party they used to love, there is a Labour MP voicing anguish about what Corbynism has done to the party that they have spent a lifetime serving. Both parties are closer to splitting than at any time in the past 30 years. In fact, they are already split. The relevant questions are when, how and in what numbers actual breakaways will start to happen. A group of Labour MPs has one foot out of the door. They would have gone some time ago were it not for Brexit and it will be Brexit and the Labour leadership\u2019s refusal to commit to a second referendum that will be most often cited as the catalyst for the creation of a new formation. While Brexit is evidently important, it also stands proxy for the many profound ideological divisions between the social democrats in Labour and a leadership cadre that will not condemn Venezuela\u2019s corrupt and ruinous dictatorship because the regime calls itself socialist. The root cause of a breakaway from Labour will be the belief of some of its MPs and members that the party they used to belong to no longer exists and their self-respect is incompatible with remaining within its ranks. It goes without saying that Brexit has driven a wedge through the Conservative party. Explaining the humiliations and contortions that Theresa May has undergone over the past 32 months, some of her friends report that her overriding objective has been to avoid going down in history as the leader who turned Tory divisions over Europe into a formal split. She is now in the last gasp of her attempts to find a Brexit deal that does not blow up her party. Even if she somehow pulls that off, this will only be a temporary postponement of the ultimate struggle for the Tory soul. Brexit is a cause of Tory division in itself and the battleground for a war between very different conceptions of what Conservatism should be about and what the party ought to be offering the country. This struggle will come to its head when Mrs May\u2019s retirement unleashes a contest to succeed her. A group of centrist Conservative MPs has publicly declared that they could not remain members of their party if the leadership is acquired by Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg or another of the English nationalist faction most popular with Tory activists. Both parties would have split already and probably long ago were it not for the straitjacket imposed by Britain\u2019s method of electing MPs. The unstable coalition that is the Conservative party and the unhappy forced marriage called the Labour party are held together by a system that is designed to accommodate only two parties. It makes breaking away to try something fresh difficult and risky. That is how we have ended up with a Conservative party that contains Sarah Wollaston and Andrew Bridgen, who would be in separate parties in a different system. That is how we have ended up with a Labour party that contains Chris Williamson and Chris Leslie, politicians who will very likely be in separate parties before very long. The Tory party has long been a menagerie of free marketeers, internationalists, liberals, libertarians, traditionalists, reactionaries, authoritarians and nationalists. When times are good and the party is prospering, they have held it together if only because they have loathed the Labour party even more than each other. When their fundamental differences are stressed, the competing Tory factions erupt. The trigger for Conservative explosions has nearly always been Europe because it exposes very different ideas of what it means to be on the right. Labour has ever been a church so broad that its pews have included social democrats, socialists, greens, incrementalists, would-be revolutionaries, central planners, localists, Atlanticists who were appalled by the Soviet Union and fellow travellers who rather admired the Kremlin. When times are good and the party is prospering, they have kept the show on the road if only because they have detested the Tories even more than each other. Under strain, the deep fissures can no longer be concealed. There are several serious problems with two parties each containing rival and sometimes downright contradictory ideologies. One wing or another of each tribe is always in a state of dissatisfaction with the party\u2019s direction. When Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp, one-nation Conservatives felt forlorn. In David Cameron\u2019s time, social conservatives were repelled by his liberal social reforms. During the New Labour era, Jeremy Corbyn and his friends were a marginalised and constantly rebellious minority within their party. Under Corbyn Labour, it is the party\u2019s social democrats who feel that their party has been stolen from them. Big tent parties are only sustainable when they are broad-minded and permissive places, capable of containing, managing and reconciling the wide diversity of opinion within them. Both the Conservative and the Labour parties have become notably less tolerant, in the polarising age of Brexit and Corbynism. Nick Boles, a former minister, is being threatened with deselection as MP for Grantham and Stamford because local Tories don\u2019t like the positions he has taken on Brexit. He is the most visible but not the only Tory MP who is being menaced in this way. Other Tory MPs will privately confess that they have not properly voiced their conviction that Brexit is a folly, for fear that they will be unseated by angry activists. Labour has been gripped by a sectarianism that demands loyalty oaths from Labour MPs and threatens them with eviction for ideological deviancy. The party has descended to a very bad place when Luciana Berger, a Labour MP who has been on the receiving end of the most vile antisemitic abuse and required police protection at last year\u2019s party conference following death threats, can be threatened with censure by her local party for protesting about racism. The number of MPs who split off will be small, at least to begin with. It is a big decision, and too perilous for the average timorous parliamentarian, given the high hurdle presented by the British electoral system. The breakaways may be doomed to failure; they may have more success than most currently expect. Whichever it is, they will be another symptom of the chronic condition of the ugly sisters, a sickliness the voters noticed long ago. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist",

He studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama before a series of stage roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2005, he fulfilled his childhood dream <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/dec/20/david-tennant-best-doctor-who\" title=\"\">when he was cast as the 10th Doctor</a>, a role he played for five years.

I\u2019m 50 in a handful of years, which feels like a preposterous thing to say.

It\u2019s not his day job either, yet he does it incredibly well, probably because he\u2019s so cool and fearless.

      "bodyText": "David Tennant, 47, was born David McDonald in West Lothian. Aged three, he told his parents he wanted to become an actor because of Doctor Who. He studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama before a series of stage roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2005, he fulfilled his childhood dream when he was cast as the 10th Doctor, a role he played for five years. Subsequent screen credits have included Broadchurch, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones. He\u2019s married to actor Georgia Moffett and they have four children. He has just launched a new interview podcast series, David Tennant Does a Podcast With\u2026, featuring indepth conversations with cultural figures such as Olivia Colman and Whoopi Goldberg. You\u2019ve described your new podcast as \u201cslightly inexplicable\u201d. How did it come about? It happened accidentally, starting with a conversation with my agent about my predilection for podcasts. Before I knew what was happening, I was in a production meeting, postulating who might take part. The people I asked were keen, so suddenly I had to do it. It\u2019s been interesting to have this other life. A side-hustle. You\u2019ve joked that maybe it\u2019s a midlife crisis. Is it? If it is, it\u2019s less destructive than running off with a go-go dancer or buying a sports car. I\u2019m 50 in a handful of years, which feels like a preposterous thing to say. In my head, I\u2019m 30 at most. Was there a particular podcast that inspired yours? Alec Baldwin\u2019s Here\u2019s the Thing. It\u2019s not his day job either, yet he does it incredibly well, probably because he\u2019s so cool and fearless. I\u2019m neither of those things, but I liked the way he sat down, often with people he knows or has a connection to, for a rambling, freeform interview that is often very revealing. What other podcasts do you listen to? The Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly is a favourite. So is Pod Save America. As the world descends into chaos, I find it useful to have some analysis. Also true crime ones such as Serial and The RFK Tapes. The great thing about podcasts is that you can curate your own radio station. Gordon Brown is your guest on an forthcoming episode. How come? I\u2019m a lifelong Labour supporter and have known Gordon through that for years. I ran into him again at Kirkcaldy festival, asked him and I suspect he felt he couldn\u2019t say no. I love talking to actors, but wanted other voices. This is someone who ran a country \u2013 experience doesn\u2019t come more fascinating than that. What do you make of the whole Brexit shitshow? [Laughs] It can\u2019t be described as anything else, can it? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on or what the solution is. Which would be fine if I felt like someone else did. It\u2019s like we\u2019re careering down a suicidal path and if you even suggest taking stock or considering other options, people scream \u201cheretic!\u201d and \u201ctraitor!\u201d. Foppish clowns who we wouldn\u2019t normally listen to for a second have suddenly become imbued with this extraordinary status and are holding the government to ransom. None of it makes sense, but that seems to be the political situation across the world right now. One only hopes it is a pendulum swing that\u2019s about to correct itself. Is it true the only advice you gave Jodie Whittaker about playing the Doctor was about the attention it brings? To certain people, you\u2019ll always be the Doctor, which is a wonderful, humbling thing but it does mean accepting an adjustment to your life. You have to be ready for that. It\u2019s a unique experience and there\u2019s a very small support group who know how that feels. One would never give advice about how to play a part. The acting bit is what you go to drama school for. All you can help with is the other stuff. Jodie was such an exciting choice. I\u2019m hugely proud of how successful she\u2019s been. What did you think of the backlash against the last series being too PC? Is it possible to be too politically correct? What does that even mean? Inclusivity has always been one of Doctor Who\u2019s strengths. You\u2019re currently in HBO\u2019s US remake of Julia Davis comedy Camping. Were you a fan of the original? I wasn\u2019t, shamefully, but when I was offered the part, I devoured it all in one sitting and loved it. This is Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner\u2019s take on it. I was a huge fan of theirs from Girls, so to work with them, with a flavour of Julia Davis, was fantastic. Have you ever met Neil Tennant, whose surname you borrowed for your Equity card? Never. I\u2019ve always been a huge Pet Shop Boys fan, so I\u2019d love to. Although I might also be embarrassed about how my 16-year-old self stole his name. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t charge me some sort of back rent on it. You had to put a little list of options down on the Equity form and my first choice was actually David Brandon, after Kirk Brandon from Spear of Destiny, which would have been much better for alphabetical cast lists. Next up is Good Omens, an Amazon series based on the novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. Was that a hoot to make? Absurdly good fun. It\u2019s totally bonkers. Because Neil Gaiman adapted it and is showrunner, the oddness isn\u2019t diluted at all. Terry charged Neil with getting it made, almost as his deathbed wish, so it\u2019s a real labour of love. The whole thing is dedicated to Terry\u2019s memory. His hat was at the script read-through. You play Crowley, a demon with ginger hair and snake eyes. Was that a good look for you? I quite liked the hair. I\u2019ve got a bit of that colouring in me, so it strangely suited me. Michael Sheen plays the angel Aziraphale, the yin to my yang. We\u2019ve agreed that in our dotage, when we do the Good Omens theatre tour, we\u2019ll alternate parts each night.",

Not only was there the extraordinary confession Neeson volunteered in the middle of what was supposed to be a perfectly vacuous press junket, and Humphrys\u2019s equally unexpected proclamation, but also Maureen Lipman, writing in the <em>Radio Times</em>, had a pop at the modern style of chatshow. \u201cThe sofa is crammed, like a chapel pew, with English actors telling their juiciest genitalia stories while the host sniggers in a three-piece suit,\u201d was how she described the genre.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think Neeson\u2019s anecdote would have amused Graham Norton though. I can imagine him glazing over in horror and wishing that, instead of putting Neeson on the sofa, he\u2019d been seated on that red tippy chair. If the producers of his new film <em>Cold Pursuit</em> had been able to pull a big chair-tipping lever before Liam could say \u201cblack bastard\u201d, they wouldn\u2019t have needed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/05/liam-neeson-red-carpet-event-cancelled-following-remarks\" title=\"\">cancel the premiere</a>.</p> <p>By now, Neeson\u2019s words will have been subjected to more scrutiny than some moderately controversial Bible verses, but I don\u2019t think the very first piece of analysis, from Tom Bateman, his co-star, who was also being interviewed, has really been bettered. He went with: \u201cHoly shit.\u201d Come to think of it, that\u2019s also a workmanlike gloss of a lot of Bible verses.</p> <p>Neeson\u2019s remarks are, more than anything else, colossally surprising. They seem completely disconnected from the entire narrative of what\u2019s supposedly happening to public discourse at the moment. You know, the whole feeling that celebrities \u201chave to be so careful\u201d. The sense that anyone saying anything publicly needs to tiptoe round the sensibilities of dozens of interest groups; that you never know when you\u2019re crossing some line or other without meaning to; that basically, whatever you say, no matter how bland, \u201cyou can\u2019t win\u201d.</p> <p>Frankly, I think those fears are often justified. I think freedom of speech is sometimes hemmed in unnecessarily and perfectly nice people who have said something slightly careless can get into unfair trouble. Then again, I\u2019m an affluent white man and I accept that I don\u2019t necessarily get all the ways in which certain statements can subliminally reinforce prejudice against historically oppressed sectors of society. But that\u2019s been the debate, right? It has, hasn\u2019t it? I wasn\u2019t imagining it?</p> <p>And then, quite calmly, under no pressure, in the middle of a press junket, when he could\u2019ve just droned on about how the filming conditions were really chilly or something, a movie star baldly announces that he once went round with a cosh for a week in the hope of killing someone black. It feels like a hallucination.</p> <p>We\u2019re all minutely attuned to the subtle ways in which things people say are or aren\u2019t deemed acceptable, our ears straining for the faintest whisper of a dog whistle, and then \u201cBang!\u201d It\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43-7fGKKg2s\" title=\"\">the moment in <em>Fawlty Towers</em></a> when Basil starts miming to trick Mrs Richards into turning up her hearing aid and then suddenly yells at her. Liam Neeson seems to be asking: \u201cIs this a piece of your brain?\u201d</p> <p>In their befuddled shock, many commentators have reached for the obvious question: \u201cIs Liam Neeson racist?\u201d He says he\u2019s not. Many say he is. Others have defended him. The trouble is, even if he is racist, it doesn\u2019t come close to being an adequate explanation of why he said what he said. Being racist might explain why he hung around with the cosh 40 years ago, but it doesn\u2019t explain why he\u2019d tell anyone now. Out of doing it and telling people, in some ways it\u2019s the latter that\u2019s hardest to fathom \u2013 and it\u2019s also only the latter that we definitely know happened.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t got an explanation, by the way. I\u2019m still on \u201cHoly shit.\u201d It\u2019s just incredibly weird. Was he stuck for something to say? How frightened of an awkward silence can a grown man be? But could it possibly be social anxiety? And a little racism? A mixture of racism and social anxiety? Now he really sounds like Hitler.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the modern chat show has it right: the best way of enjoying a film is to know nothing at all about the actors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Or was it the fact that the film he was promoting is about vengeance and so was his story? Did he say it all simply because he couldn\u2019t get over how extremely apposite it was?</p> <p>One thing is clear: he shouldn\u2019t do interviews. Some people are saying he shouldn\u2019t do films, but he certainly shouldn\u2019t do interviews. Except possibly, if Lipman is to be believed, the modern sort of chatshow. On them, she claims, there are far too many guests, \u201cso we learn nothing about any of them. Nada. Except that they are famous and good sports.\u201d \u201cOh, if only!\u201d the publicists of <em>Cold Pursuit</em> must be thinking.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure I really want to learn much about the actors who are in the things I watch. I know a lot of actors and most of them are nice people, but I don\u2019t think knowing them helps me enjoy whatever they\u2019re acting in. It makes it more likely I\u2019ll have to bloody turn up and see it, but it doesn\u2019t improve their work, even when they don\u2019t have a history of violent racist plotting.</p> <p>It\u2019s illogical really that, of all the people involved in making a film, it\u2019s the actors whom we\u2019re encouraged to know lots of real-life stuff about.

      "bodyText": "Is it because of Liam Neeson, I wonder, that John Humphrys has announced he\u2019s going to retire from the Today programme? Was Neeson\u2019s astonishing interview in the Independent what finally made the great Radio 4 inquisitor realise quite how much you can get out of an interviewee if you give them a bit of space to speak? Interviews and interviewing have been in the news a lot. Not only was there the extraordinary confession Neeson volunteered in the middle of what was supposed to be a perfectly vacuous press junket, and Humphrys\u2019s equally unexpected proclamation, but also Maureen Lipman, writing in the Radio Times, had a pop at the modern style of chatshow. \u201cThe sofa is crammed, like a chapel pew, with English actors telling their juiciest genitalia stories while the host sniggers in a three-piece suit,\u201d was how she described the genre. I don\u2019t think Neeson\u2019s anecdote would have amused Graham Norton though. I can imagine him glazing over in horror and wishing that, instead of putting Neeson on the sofa, he\u2019d been seated on that red tippy chair. If the producers of his new film Cold Pursuit had been able to pull a big chair-tipping lever before Liam could say \u201cblack bastard\u201d, they wouldn\u2019t have needed to cancel the premiere. By now, Neeson\u2019s words will have been subjected to more scrutiny than some moderately controversial Bible verses, but I don\u2019t think the very first piece of analysis, from Tom Bateman, his co-star, who was also being interviewed, has really been bettered. He went with: \u201cHoly shit.\u201d Come to think of it, that\u2019s also a workmanlike gloss of a lot of Bible verses. Neeson\u2019s remarks are, more than anything else, colossally surprising. They seem completely disconnected from the entire narrative of what\u2019s supposedly happening to public discourse at the moment. You know, the whole feeling that celebrities \u201chave to be so careful\u201d. The sense that anyone saying anything publicly needs to tiptoe round the sensibilities of dozens of interest groups; that you never know when you\u2019re crossing some line or other without meaning to; that basically, whatever you say, no matter how bland, \u201cyou can\u2019t win\u201d. Frankly, I think those fears are often justified. I think freedom of speech is sometimes hemmed in unnecessarily and perfectly nice people who have said something slightly careless can get into unfair trouble. Then again, I\u2019m an affluent white man and I accept that I don\u2019t necessarily get all the ways in which certain statements can subliminally reinforce prejudice against historically oppressed sectors of society. But that\u2019s been the debate, right? It has, hasn\u2019t it? I wasn\u2019t imagining it? And then, quite calmly, under no pressure, in the middle of a press junket, when he could\u2019ve just droned on about how the filming conditions were really chilly or something, a movie star baldly announces that he once went round with a cosh for a week in the hope of killing someone black. It feels like a hallucination. We\u2019re all minutely attuned to the subtle ways in which things people say are or aren\u2019t deemed acceptable, our ears straining for the faintest whisper of a dog whistle, and then \u201cBang!\u201d It\u2019s like the moment in Fawlty Towers when Basil starts miming to trick Mrs Richards into turning up her hearing aid and then suddenly yells at her. Liam Neeson seems to be asking: \u201cIs this a piece of your brain?\u201d In their befuddled shock, many commentators have reached for the obvious question: \u201cIs Liam Neeson racist?\u201d He says he\u2019s not. Many say he is. Others have defended him. The trouble is, even if he is racist, it doesn\u2019t come close to being an adequate explanation of why he said what he said. Being racist might explain why he hung around with the cosh 40 years ago, but it doesn\u2019t explain why he\u2019d tell anyone now. Out of doing it and telling people, in some ways it\u2019s the latter that\u2019s hardest to fathom \u2013 and it\u2019s also only the latter that we definitely know happened. I haven\u2019t got an explanation, by the way. I\u2019m still on \u201cHoly shit.\u201d It\u2019s just incredibly weird. Was he stuck for something to say? How frightened of an awkward silence can a grown man be? But could it possibly be social anxiety? And a little racism? A mixture of racism and social anxiety? Now he really sounds like Hitler. Or was it the fact that the film he was promoting is about vengeance and so was his story? Did he say it all simply because he couldn\u2019t get over how extremely apposite it was? One thing is clear: he shouldn\u2019t do interviews. Some people are saying he shouldn\u2019t do films, but he certainly shouldn\u2019t do interviews. Except possibly, if Lipman is to be believed, the modern sort of chatshow. On them, she claims, there are far too many guests, \u201cso we learn nothing about any of them. Nada. Except that they are famous and good sports.\u201d \u201cOh, if only!\u201d the publicists of Cold Pursuit must be thinking. I\u2019m not sure I really want to learn much about the actors who are in the things I watch. I know a lot of actors and most of them are nice people, but I don\u2019t think knowing them helps me enjoy whatever they\u2019re acting in. It makes it more likely I\u2019ll have to bloody turn up and see it, but it doesn\u2019t improve their work, even when they don\u2019t have a history of violent racist plotting. It\u2019s illogical really that, of all the people involved in making a film, it\u2019s the actors whom we\u2019re encouraged to know lots of real-life stuff about. It would be much easier to buy into the fictions they depict if we weren\u2019t so fully informed of the reality. Why not tell us about the private life of the designer or the cinematographer? Knowing about their affairs, divorces, strange opinions or huge houses won\u2019t make the fictional characters on screen less believable. So, if you like cinema, I think the modern chatshow has got it just right. The best way of enjoying a film is to know nothing at all about the actors. Except that they\u2019re famous and good sports.",

      "bodyText": "Apart from its grisliness, its hopelessness, and its pointlessness, what strikes you most about this true-crime movie is its brownness. The colour brown predominates. Fatih Akin painstakingly and pedantically re-enacts the gruesome life of Fritz Honka, a Hamburg serial killer who in the early 70s kept dismembered body parts of prostitutes in his attic flat. When people complained about the smell, Honka \u2013 a racist as well as everything else \u2013 blamed the Greek Gastarbeiter family that lived downstairs. Everything in this universe is a deeply depressing shade of brown: the wooden furniture in his apartment and also in The Golden Glove \u2013 the unspeakable pub where he picked up his victims \u2013 as well as the beer bottles, the curtains, the food, the dried blood, the wet blood, the stains on clothing and of course the spilling contents of Honka\u2019s lavatory.

      "body": "<p>A lot of musicians will fib and say they don\u2019t pay attention to industry awards, such as the Grammys and the Brits. And that\u2019s exactly what Jorja Smith does. Except the 21-year-old soul singer from Walsall might actually be telling the truth. Tonight the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grammys\" title=\"\">Grammys</a> will be presented in Los Angeles; Alicia Keys is the host, Dolly Parton the guest of honour. Smith was so oblivious to this fact that she booked a show, halfway round the world, in Western Australia for the same day. Then it was announced in December that she was up for Best New Artist.</p> <p>\u201cLiterally the day before I was talking to my boyfriend [producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/17/new-band-joel-compass\" title=\"\">Joel Compass</a>] because he makes music and he wanted to come out to LA around that time just to work with some people,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Oh, I reckon I\u2019ll do the same, but maybe next year\u2026\u2019 Then the day after I get a message from his manager: \u2018Congratulations!\u2019 I was like, \u2018What for?\u2019 And then I saw. I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d</p> <p>So how did Smith celebrate? She looks a bit confused, like it\u2019s a trick question. \u201cHugged my boyfriend,\u201d she replies. \u201cAnd that was it.\u201d</p> <p>Our conversation is taking place in a cab on the way to Heathrow. Smith is heading out to New Zealand. She\u2019ll honour the first few days of her tour but then \u2013 sorry Fremantle \u2013 duck out early to zip across to the Grammys. She\u2019s a long shot to win the award: her debut album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/08/jorja-smith-lost-found-review\" title=\"\">Lost &amp; Found</a></em>, which was released last summer, didn\u2019t crack the top 40 in the US, and she\u2019s up against established names such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa\" title=\"\">Dua Lipa</a> and the R&amp;B star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/05/her-randb-star-her-i-wanted-to-be-anonymous\" title=\"\">HER</a>. But, again, if Smith is remotely stressed about the company she\u2019s keeping, she\u2019s not showing it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great being\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say up against, it\u2019s just great being recognised among these talented people,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople like HER\u2026 Who else is in there? I knew when I looked, but now I\u2019ve forgotten. Sorry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ddd5cf9a018321e61b112592e2b0369313c5f6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ddd5cf9a018321e61b112592e2b0369313c5f6a/0_707_5504_6837/805.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I have a lot of control\u2019: Jorja Smith wears wears track jacket by valentino.com and own rings and earrings.\" width=\"805\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have a lot of control\u2019: Jorja Smith wears wears track jacket by <a href=\"http://valentino.com\">valentino.com</a> and own rings and earrings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Gorrigan/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To be fair to Smith, it can\u2019t be easy keeping track of all the awards she\u2019s up for. Since winning the Critics\u2019 Choice at the 2018 Brits \u2013 which, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sam-smith\" title=\"\">Sam Smith</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rag-n-bone-man\" title=\"\">Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man</a>, has a near-unerring hit-rate for predicting future success \u2013 she\u2019s been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize and she returns to the Brits later this month with three more nominations: best British female solo, British album and British breakthrough act.</p> <p>If Smith isn\u2019t on your radar right now, you might want to rectify that. And it won\u2019t take long to realise what the fuss is about. Smith is often name-checked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sade\" title=\"\">Sade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/aliciakeys\" title=\"\">Alicia Keys</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a> and it\u2019s true that her vocals, smoky yet somehow soothing, have a richness and complexity that comes along rarely. Introducing her at a show in Toronto in 2017, the Canadian rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake\" title=\"\">Drake</a> described her as: \u201cOne of the most incredible voices, incredible talents and incredible humans I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p> <p>Such attention could, and should, be head-spinning. There is a moment, when we are bombing down the A4, where she pops a brace into her mouth and it\u2019s genuinely shocking to realise \u2013 to be reminded really \u2013 that\u2019s she\u2019s only 21. Three years ago she was sitting her A-levels. When Drake was heaping praise on her, she\u2019d not long given up a job as a barista in Starbucks. She starts our conversation warily, but quickly warms up. There\u2019s a preternatural assurance here, one that explains how a young woman from the West Midlands, growing up with no connections in the industry, finds herself in LA tonight waiting to find out if she\u2019s won another life-changing award.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s mother, Jolene, a jewellery designer, was the first to notice that she might have a special voice. \u201cWhen I was eight I sang at church in front of everyone,\u201d Smith recalls. \u201cMy mum used to make me sing, tell people I could sing and I hated that. I was so embarrassed!\u201d She played piano and wrote her first song, aged 11, titled Life is a Path Worth Taking, but she concedes that life at home with her younger brother and parents \u2013 dad, Peter, was a benefits officer who played in a neo-soul band named 2nd Naicha \u2013 didn\u2019t give her very much material.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was younger I wasn\u2019t really going through anything traumatic or bad,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI have my parents and I went to school, didn\u2019t really get in trouble. I was naughty at home; yeah, still am. But I liked making stories up and turning them into songs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"853c6e40f26dfbecdfb8707dc4ccbcc08045028b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/853c6e40f26dfbecdfb8707dc4ccbcc08045028b/0_2077_7333_6488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018How can you have problems when you\u2019re doing what you want?\u2019: Jorja Smith wears jumpsuit with jewelled straps, leather belt fashioned into choker and earrings, all by chanel.com, and Maureen pumps by Malone Souliers, harveynichols.com.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"885\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018How can you have problems when you\u2019re doing what you want?\u2019: Jorja Smith wears jumpsuit with jewelled straps, leather belt fashioned into choker and earrings, all by <a href=\"http://chanel.com\">chanel.com</a>, and Maureen pumps by Malone Souliers, <a href=\"http://harveynichols.com\">harveynichols.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Gorrigan/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her teenage years brought insecurity, about her looks and, at times, about being mixed race. \u201cAll my friends were white, they were all slim and had long hair,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have big lips or a bum. In school you\u2019re so confined to a small space and the boys like the blonde girls and they didn\u2019t like me. But it\u2019s all right, I got over it.\u201d</p> <p>Music became more serious when, at the age of 15, she was bought a MacBook. On the program GarageBand, Smith would record covers and upload videos to YouTube; one of these, her take on Alex Clare\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfc46nmFVE\" title=\"\">Too Close</a>, found her a manager. After school, she left Walsall for south London, where she lived with relatives and took a job in Starbucks. All the while, Smith was writing, putting out tracks on Soundcloud, and it was one of these \u2013 Where Did I Go? \u2013 that found its way to Drake. He made contact on Instagram, said the song had kept him sane on a long flight, and asked her to do a duet on a song called Get It Together. Smith, scarcely believably, said no, because in her words: \u201cI didn\u2019t write it, I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d But she changed her mind a year later and the track appeared on his ubiquitous 2017 mixtape <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/19/drake-more-life-review-new-playlist-sets-the-sound-of-summer-agenda\" title=\"\">More Life</a></em>.</p> <p>Before the release of <em>Lost &amp; Found</em>, Smith was mainly known for such collaborations: with Drake, and on the Kali Uchis track Tyrant, and on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kendrick-lamar\" title=\"\">Kendrick Lamar\u2019s</a> soundtrack for the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a></em> movie; she also shared vocals with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\" title=\"\">Stormzy</a> on a song of her own, Let Me Down. These were positive experiences, she says, but it\u2019s a relief now that she doesn\u2019t always get asked about, say, what Drake smells like. Or have to deny that they are dating: a rumour that blossomed in early 2017 after the pair was seen late-night shopping at the Co-op in Walsall after a gig in Birmingham. Smith clarified that he had tagged along when she was buying wine gums and tampons, and that was that.</p> <p>\u201cIt was never part of my plan to work with Kendrick or Drake or Kali, but they just added to everything,\u201d says Smith now. \u201cBecause then I got opened up to a whole new Drake world, a whole new Kendrick world and a Kali world. So I got new fans from it and maybe they were waiting for me to put a project out and then they liked that, hopefully.\u201d</p> <p>Smith\u2019s success is all the more astonishing for the detail that she isn\u2019t backed by a major label. There\u2019s a simple reason for that: she doesn\u2019t much like being told what to do. That clear-headedness could be seen at the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s photo shoot. \u201cIf I don\u2019t like something, I won\u2019t wear it,\u201d says Smith, who has now changed into her travelling outfit of a Mondrian-ish Nike tracksuit, with her hair scraped back into a tight bun. She giggles: \u201cI have a lot of control, yeah.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"174c7c197b46a35264772533ad317a3c1569a0bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/174c7c197b46a35264772533ad317a3c1569a0bc/0_0_4448_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorja Smith in concert at O2 Shepherds Bush Empire, London, 3 November, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady in red: Jorja Smith in concert at O2 Shepherds Bush Empire, London, 3 November 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just always done it this way,\u201d she continues. \u201cI did a distribution deal for my album, but I\u2019ve always been independent without a major-label record deal. And I\u2019m fine. I just feel the same as I was when I moved to London. My team has got bigger, but it\u2019s still really small. How can you have problems when you\u2019re doing what you want and no one\u2019s actually telling you no? Not that no one\u2019s telling me no. But no one\u2019s telling me, \u2018You must do this!\u2019 or, \u2018You can\u2019t do this!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to offer Smith patronising advice, and she gets that a lot. People she meets \u2013 journalists, industry execs \u2013 do it all the time. Why doesn\u2019t she write more fast songs? That\u2019s the main one. \u201cPeople mention how my songs are quite slow,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWell, cool. If you don\u2019t want to listen to slow songs, don\u2019t listen to me. I\u2019ve been asked, \u2018If you hear music in the charts, it\u2019s upbeat, why don\u2019t you want to write music like that?\u2019 But I write something that I think\u2019s good. With this album I wanted to make something classic. Something that doesn\u2019t just get played once and then left in your music library.\u201d</p> <p>This is the point: Smith is doing all right on her own. Her dad keeps an eye on the charts \u2013 <em>Lost &amp; Found</em> reached number three in the UK \u2013 but again, she feigns complete indifference.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t look at sales,\u201d she says. \u201cAs long as no one tells me I\u2019m in red, no one tells me I\u2019m in debt, and I can still pay my rent and feed my dog, then I\u2019m fine.

      "bodyText": "A lot of musicians will fib and say they don\u2019t pay attention to industry awards, such as the Grammys and the Brits. And that\u2019s exactly what Jorja Smith does. Except the 21-year-old soul singer from Walsall might actually be telling the truth. Tonight the Grammys will be presented in Los Angeles; Alicia Keys is the host, Dolly Parton the guest of honour. Smith was so oblivious to this fact that she booked a show, halfway round the world, in Western Australia for the same day. Then it was announced in December that she was up for Best New Artist. \u201cLiterally the day before I was talking to my boyfriend [producer Joel Compass] because he makes music and he wanted to come out to LA around that time just to work with some people,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I was like: \u2018Oh, I reckon I\u2019ll do the same, but maybe next year\u2026\u2019 Then the day after I get a message from his manager: \u2018Congratulations!\u2019 I was like, \u2018What for?\u2019 And then I saw. I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d So how did Smith celebrate? She looks a bit confused, like it\u2019s a trick question. \u201cHugged my boyfriend,\u201d she replies. \u201cAnd that was it.\u201d Our conversation is taking place in a cab on the way to Heathrow. Smith is heading out to New Zealand. She\u2019ll honour the first few days of her tour but then \u2013 sorry Fremantle \u2013 duck out early to zip across to the Grammys. She\u2019s a long shot to win the award: her debut album, Lost &amp; Found, which was released last summer, didn\u2019t crack the top 40 in the US, and she\u2019s up against established names such as Dua Lipa and the R&amp;B star HER. But, again, if Smith is remotely stressed about the company she\u2019s keeping, she\u2019s not showing it. \u201cIt\u2019s great being\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say up against, it\u2019s just great being recognised among these talented people,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople like HER\u2026 Who else is in there? I knew when I looked, but now I\u2019ve forgotten. Sorry.\u201d To be fair to Smith, it can\u2019t be easy keeping track of all the awards she\u2019s up for. Since winning the Critics\u2019 Choice at the 2018 Brits \u2013 which, from Adele to Sam Smith to Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man, has a near-unerring hit-rate for predicting future success \u2013 she\u2019s been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize and she returns to the Brits later this month with three more nominations: best British female solo, British album and British breakthrough act. If Smith isn\u2019t on your radar right now, you might want to rectify that. And it won\u2019t take long to realise what the fuss is about. Smith is often name-checked with Sade, Alicia Keys and Adele and it\u2019s true that her vocals, smoky yet somehow soothing, have a richness and complexity that comes along rarely. Introducing her at a show in Toronto in 2017, the Canadian rapper Drake described her as: \u201cOne of the most incredible voices, incredible talents and incredible humans I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Such attention could, and should, be head-spinning. There is a moment, when we are bombing down the A4, where she pops a brace into her mouth and it\u2019s genuinely shocking to realise \u2013 to be reminded really \u2013 that\u2019s she\u2019s only 21. Three years ago she was sitting her A-levels. When Drake was heaping praise on her, she\u2019d not long given up a job as a barista in Starbucks. She starts our conversation warily, but quickly warms up. There\u2019s a preternatural assurance here, one that explains how a young woman from the West Midlands, growing up with no connections in the industry, finds herself in LA tonight waiting to find out if she\u2019s won another life-changing award. Smith\u2019s mother, Jolene, a jewellery designer, was the first to notice that she might have a special voice. \u201cWhen I was eight I sang at church in front of everyone,\u201d Smith recalls. \u201cMy mum used to make me sing, tell people I could sing and I hated that. I was so embarrassed!\u201d She played piano and wrote her first song, aged 11, titled Life is a Path Worth Taking, but she concedes that life at home with her younger brother and parents \u2013 dad, Peter, was a benefits officer who played in a neo-soul band named 2nd Naicha \u2013 didn\u2019t give her very much material. \u201cWhen I was younger I wasn\u2019t really going through anything traumatic or bad,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI have my parents and I went to school, didn\u2019t really get in trouble. I was naughty at home; yeah, still am. But I liked making stories up and turning them into songs.\u201d Her teenage years brought insecurity, about her looks and, at times, about being mixed race. \u201cAll my friends were white, they were all slim and had long hair,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have big lips or a bum. In school you\u2019re so confined to a small space and the boys like the blonde girls and they didn\u2019t like me. But it\u2019s all right, I got over it.\u201d Music became more serious when, at the age of 15, she was bought a MacBook. On the program GarageBand, Smith would record covers and upload videos to YouTube; one of these, her take on Alex Clare\u2019s Too Close, found her a manager. After school, she left Walsall for south London, where she lived with relatives and took a job in Starbucks. All the while, Smith was writing, putting out tracks on Soundcloud, and it was one of these \u2013 Where Did I Go? \u2013 that found its way to Drake. He made contact on Instagram, said the song had kept him sane on a long flight, and asked her to do a duet on a song called Get It Together. Smith, scarcely believably, said no, because in her words: \u201cI didn\u2019t write it, I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d But she changed her mind a year later and the track appeared on his ubiquitous 2017 mixtape More Life. Before the release of Lost &amp; Found, Smith was mainly known for such collaborations: with Drake, and on the Kali Uchis track Tyrant, and on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s soundtrack for the Black Panther movie; she also shared vocals with Stormzy on a song of her own, Let Me Down. These were positive experiences, she says, but it\u2019s a relief now that she doesn\u2019t always get asked about, say, what Drake smells like. Or have to deny that they are dating: a rumour that blossomed in early 2017 after the pair was seen late-night shopping at the Co-op in Walsall after a gig in Birmingham. Smith clarified that he had tagged along when she was buying wine gums and tampons, and that was that. \u201cIt was never part of my plan to work with Kendrick or Drake or Kali, but they just added to everything,\u201d says Smith now. \u201cBecause then I got opened up to a whole new Drake world, a whole new Kendrick world and a Kali world. So I got new fans from it and maybe they were waiting for me to put a project out and then they liked that, hopefully.\u201d Smith\u2019s success is all the more astonishing for the detail that she isn\u2019t backed by a major label. There\u2019s a simple reason for that: she doesn\u2019t much like being told what to do. That clear-headedness could be seen at the Observer\u2019s photo shoot. \u201cIf I don\u2019t like something, I won\u2019t wear it,\u201d says Smith, who has now changed into her travelling outfit of a Mondrian-ish Nike tracksuit, with her hair scraped back into a tight bun. She giggles: \u201cI have a lot of control, yeah. \u201cI\u2019ve just always done it this way,\u201d she continues. \u201cI did a distribution deal for my album, but I\u2019ve always been independent without a major-label record deal. And I\u2019m fine. I just feel the same as I was when I moved to London. My team has got bigger, but it\u2019s still really small. How can you have problems when you\u2019re doing what you want and no one\u2019s actually telling you no? Not that no one\u2019s telling me no. But no one\u2019s telling me, \u2018You must do this!\u2019 or, \u2018You can\u2019t do this!\u2019\u201d It\u2019s tempting to offer Smith patronising advice, and she gets that a lot. People she meets \u2013 journalists, industry execs \u2013 do it all the time. Why doesn\u2019t she write more fast songs? That\u2019s the main one. \u201cPeople mention how my songs are quite slow,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWell, cool. If you don\u2019t want to listen to slow songs, don\u2019t listen to me. I\u2019ve been asked, \u2018If you hear music in the charts, it\u2019s upbeat, why don\u2019t you want to write music like that?\u2019 But I write something that I think\u2019s good. With this album I wanted to make something classic. Something that doesn\u2019t just get played once and then left in your music library.\u201d This is the point: Smith is doing all right on her own. Her dad keeps an eye on the charts \u2013 Lost &amp; Found reached number three in the UK \u2013 but again, she feigns complete indifference. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t look at sales,\u201d she says. \u201cAs long as no one tells me I\u2019m in red, no one tells me I\u2019m in debt, and I can still pay my rent and feed my dog, then I\u2019m fine. And feed myself, of course. I\u2019m good with my money so I\u2019m not really worried about that.\u201d We\u2019re now idling in the drop-off parking spots at Heathrow. This is Smith\u2019s life now. So busy, so in demand that work expands into almost every small fissure of the day. Her only downtime is when she\u2019s sleeping or running 5k at the gym: \u201cI only need to think about not falling off the treadmill rather than thinking about this email I know needs an answer.\u201d That\u2019s fame, I suggest. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be famous,\u201d Smith shoots back. \u201cI\u2019m not famous.

      "body": "<p>If you were to close your eyes and conjure the headquarters of a 50-year campaign to legalise and license psychedelic drugs, you might well see \u201cBrainblood Hall\u201d. A Tudor hunting lodge, surrounded by three concentric moats and formal boxwood topiary, it appears, as you approach along its winding drive on a wintry afternoon, to be ready to whisper all kinds of curious stories. There are plenty from which to choose. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/black_prince.shtml\" title=\"\">The Black Prince</a> used to hunt from a house on this site. Lewis Carroll based the chessboard landscape of <em>Alice Through the Looking-</em><em>Glass</em> on the watery Oxfordshire moorland that extends in all directions. And Aldous Huxley set his first novel, <em>Crome Yellow</em>, here after visiting for tea with Lady Ottoline Morrell in 1921.</p> <p>Amanda Feilding, who grew up here and returned to live in the manor after the death of her parents, is the natural heir to all of those associations. She is an eye-bright woman of 76, a spirited talker and an attentive listener, with that ingrained aristocratic habit of passing off wild and whirling eccentricity as mundane routine. For the past half century, she has led an indefatigable \u2013 and mostly frustrated \u2013 campaign to relax the prohibition on research into psychedelic compounds, particularly LSD. What long seemed a hopeless quest, a one-woman battle against the massed artillery of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, has recently begun to turn in her favour. Feilding has lately been dubbed the \u201cQueen of Consciousness\u201d by the <em>New Scientist</em>. I have arranged to meet her to talk about the ways in which her half century of lobbying seems finally to be paying off.</p> <p>It is, appropriately enough, by no means straightforward to find Beckley Park (Feilding nicknamed it Brainblood Hall in the 1960s). The postcode I\u2019ve keyed in to satnav first takes me to an MoD firing range. Directions from the landlady of the local pub lead to a golf club car park. By the time I eventually locate the correct unmarked mile-long track, the low sun is losing its brightness on the red walls of the old lodge, lending it an off-grid glow.</p> <p>Feilding, who also enjoys the titles the Countess of Wemyss and March, and Lady Neidpath, courtesy of her husband, Jamie Charteris, has converted an outbuilding into the two-storey nerve centre of her lobbying operation. Downstairs, her team of five researchers and interns is at computer screens. Upstairs, in a beamed loft, we sit down to tea and biscuits while she talks me through the latest pile of data and research literature and the little, brightly coloured fMRI scans of the brain \u2013 this one on LSD, that one not.</p> <p>Feilding started her campaign from her kitchen table toward the end of the 1960s. But after a while, she thought: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t try to change global drug policy and carry out scientific research as just me. I have to become a foundation.\u201d She was, she says, \u201clucky or clever\u201d in getting serious scientists to support her. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/01/medicalresearch\" title=\"\">Albert Hofmann</a>, the Swiss chemist who famously had the first LSD \u201ctrip\u201d in 1943 after accidentally dosing himself with the compound he was analysing as a cure for migraine, became a lifelong ally. He was joined on the <a href=\"https://beckleyfoundation.org/about/the-foundation/\" title=\"\">Beckley Foundation</a>\u2019s advisory board by luminaries including Professor Colin Blakemore, director of the Oxford University Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, and his counterpart at Cambridge, Professor Trevor Robbins.</p> <p>In the past few years, since the controls on experimentation with psychedelics have been relaxed, the Beckley Foundation has sponsored research programmes at Imperial College London and elsewhere to explore the effects of LSD on the brain, particularly in treating long-term depression. These studies are part of the science that begins to suggest psychedelics may have a role to play in treating everything from alcohol addiction to Alzheimer\u2019s disease to post-traumatic stress disorder. Significant headlines first resulted from a <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/12/01/hallucinogen-treats-cancer-depression-anxiety/\" title=\"\">Beckley-funded study</a> at Johns Hopkins University in 2016, detailing the positive effects of using psilocybin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, to combat depression in terminally ill patients.</p> <p>That study was the starting point for a book-length investigation by the influential <em>New York Times</em> writer Michael Pollan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/22/how-to-change-mind-new-science-psychedelics-michael-pollan-review\" title=\"\"><em>How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics</em></a>, which topped the bestseller lists last year. Feilding had been arguing for many of Pollan\u2019s findings all her adult life: \u201cWe have been stuck with SSRIs [such as Prozac or Zoloft] as our<strong> </strong>only tool for treating depression,\u201d she says now, \u201cand meanwhile there has been an epidemic of mental illness.\u201d It is Feilding\u2019s as yet unproved<strong> </strong>belief that LSD in controlled dosages has the capacity to \u201cget deep down in the brain and reset \u2018the wish to get better\u2019 \u2013 like shaking up a snow globe\u201d. She began microdosing herself in her 20s. \u201cWe used to call it a psychovitamin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes you more lively, you enjoy your thoughts more. You can find your flow.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since President Nixon outlawed LSD in the wake of the Charles Manson trials, prohibition codified in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it has been virtually impossible for pharmacologists to show an interest in Hofmann\u2019s \u201cwonder drug\u201d. One of the reasons that Feilding has been able to keep the argument going through those years, however, is that she has existed outside the academic establishment. She has no university degree. It would be fair to say, however, that her credibility as an advocate has not always been helped by her storied history with self-experimentation. This reached an infamous extreme in 1970, when Feilding became enthralled by the ancient practice of trepanning, the drilling of a hole in the skull, in the belief that it would expand consciousness and reduce neurosis (a practice that, needless to say, has zero support in the medical profession). Following the example of her former lover and mentor Bart Huges, a Dutch natural scientist with whom she first experimented with LSD, Feilding carefully bored a hole in her own skull using a dentist\u2019s drill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"950fb1e27a920eeba050f730d3bf95f08de79055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950fb1e27a920eeba050f730d3bf95f08de79055/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda Feilding at \u2018Brainblood Hall\u2019, her Tudor home and nerve centre of her thinktank, the Beckley Foundation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda Feilding at \u2018Brainblood Hall\u2019, her Tudor home and nerve centre of her thinktank, the Beckley Foundation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She made an artful film of the process, designed to be shown to the curious (somewhat gruesome clips from which are discoverable on the internet). The film did not endear her to mainstream science, but that experience was nothing new.</p> <p>\u201cFunnily enough, growing up here as children, we always were so far out of society,\u201d she says, cheerfully. \u201cMy parents had no cash for heating or petrol or toys or school uniform or whatever. I was always very isolated. So becoming a pariah made not much difference to me. And I always had a couple of other pariahs for company.\u201d</p> <p>That rebellious streak was inherited from her father, whose mother had been a friend of Nietzsche and \u201call that lot in Europe\u201d. He used to do his hedging and ditching at Beckley at night, by torch and candlelight, because he believed daylight should be reserved for making art \u2013 he was a painter who didn\u2019t really sell. Feilding trailed around after him at all hours. He read her <em>Seven Pillars of </em><em>Wisdom</em> when she was six.</p> <p>Her mother was potentially less forgiving, an impassioned Catholic who believed that her daughter should live at home until she married. \u201cI have to say, I admired her in old age, though,\u201d Feilding says, with characteristic brightness. \u201cThere I was, druggy, trepanned, unmarried, with two sons \u2013 bastards, as she might have seen them \u2013 and she didn\u2019t mind a bit.\u201d</p> <p>Before the light outside goes, Feilding insists that we have a wander around the grounds, where the seeds of her curiosity were sown. Out among the ancient hedges and ponds she points out the mound and tree stump that she believed housed a private god figure; her game, aged five or six, was to find ways to make that god laugh, \u201cthat kind of orgasm experience that I think a lot of young children have and then forget\u201d.</p> <p>Feilding did not forget. She wanted afterwards, she says, to recreate that childlike intensity of experience. She discovered pot at 16 and left her convent school when she won the science prize and the nuns refused to present her with her chosen book about Buddhism. She decided to continue her education by going in search of her godfather, a man named Bertie Moore, who had been \u201ca spycatcher in the war\u201d and was by now living as a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. Feilding, with \u00a325 in her pocket, got as far as the Syrian border, where she spent some time living (of course she did) with Bedouins before returning to study comparative religion with an Oxford professor and fine art at <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/slade/\" title=\"\">the Slade school in London</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/12/michael-pollan-reluctant-psychonanaut-psychedelic-drugs-how-to-change-your-mind\">Michael Pollan: \u2018I was a very reluctant psychonaut\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her first experience with LSD was nearly her last. An acquaintance spiked some coffee she was drinking with a massive dose and she spent three months recovering from the \u201cpsychic wound\u201d in a little hut she points out at the end of the garden. She was eventually persuaded out of the hut to a party at which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/12/ravi-shankar-dies\" title=\"\">Ravi Shankar</a> was playing, in London. It was there that she met Huges, who had not long returned from Ibiza, where he had been making his own LSD. Huges was a man after her own seeker\u2019s heart. He had been, she suggests, the top medical student in the Netherlands.</p> <p>\u201cThen,\u201d she says, \u201che called his daughter Marijuana, and trepanned himself, and inevitably they failed him in his finals.\u201d</p> <p>The day after they met, Huges followed her down here and they started their hallucinogenic romance. As Feilding explains this former life, in digressive fits and starts, fretting a little that she is saying too much, she leads me through the twilit garden, over well-trodden stepping stones, pointing out a pond she dug \u201cbased on sacred geometries\u201d, with a half-submerged colonnade as if from a forgotten civilisation.</p> <p>It is hard to separate her from her habitat in the dusk; she says she thinks of the house as her soul. She feared she was going to have to lose it when her parents died. The house went up for sale and Drue Heinz, the baked beans heiress, expressed an interest. Feilding eventually managed to secure it by \u2013 she suggests, half-joking \u2013 letting her two young sons hide in the woods with air rifles to frighten off prospective buyers and by indulging in some financial smoke and mirrors with the bank.</p> <p>Her desire to stay was wrapped up with the experiences she had here with Huges. His cultish philosophy, which she imbibed enthusiastically, along with his drugs, was based on the notion that in evolving to stand upright, human beings had lost some of the vital blood volume in their brains. One result, Huges argued, apparently persuasively, was that the ego had come to dominate more vital connections with the external world. The broad hypothesis was that LSD, with its action on blood capillaries, restored that connection, flooding the senses and allowing us to experience the world something like a newborn baby did. The key to controlling those trips, Feilding discovered, remembering the hypoglycaemic collapses of her diabetic father, was to keep sugar levels high in the blood as the drug depleted the body\u2019s energy.</p> <p>At some point in these experiments, Huges made the mistake of explaining his brain-blood-volume thesis to a journalist. A few nights later, Feilding says, there was a knock at the door of her London flat and two burly gentlemen (\u201cfrom the Home Office or wherever\u201d) advised Huges that he should return to his native Holland. He was, Feilding says, unable to return to the UK for 25 years.</p> <p>As she completes this story, Feilding leads me into the main house itself, with its panelled walls and huge stone fireplaces and Ottoman rugs and tapestries. She fetches down a skull from her mantelpiece and shows me its several trepanned holes. The skull, she insists, was recovered from the grave of an Irish chieftain from 700BC; it is the cue for a brief history of skull boring in ancient cultures in Germany, India and Central America. The practice was, she believes \u2013 not entirely in step with received anthropological wisdom \u2013 most commonly associated with the priesthood, those with access to the best drugs. \u201cThe ones with the holes in the head became the shaman.\u201d</p> <p>And what about her own experience with the dentist\u2019s drill. Did it change her life?</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d she says. She recalls in passing a terrible journey home from Amsterdam back in the 1970s, when she had gone to visit Huges and had taken strychnine instead of mescaline and nearly died. When she got to London, Joey Mellon, her fellow traveller with Huges and subsequently the father of her sons, was trying and failing to make a hole in his skull with this \u201cancient handheld trepan\u201d. Was that a moment, I wonder, when she felt their experiments might have been going too far?</p> <p>\u201cI took it more as an example of how not to trepan,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I did it myself, I was very careful; I had practised for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>She lost the movie of the operation for a while, but rediscovered it. I wonder how it felt to watch it now?</p> <p>\u201cActually, I think it is rather beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd terribly English. It starts with the bird, of course, who flies off from the attic window.\u201d</p> <p>The bird in question was a tame pigeon that Feilding had found as an orphaned squab, fed using a paintbrush, and which subsequently lived with her for 15 years, coming and going from the house as it pleased, sometimes sitting on her shoulder, Long John Silver style. \u201cBirdie\u201d was the reason she did not follow Huges to Holland. \u201cHe is,\u201d she says with certainty, \u201cthe reason I know telepathy exists. He would look at me before he flew off, as if to say, \u2018You poor person, why don\u2019t you fly away with me over the river?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She pauses, laughs. \u201cI know that sounds mad, but to my mind it was not mad at all.\u201d</p> <p>Keen to return to the challenges of the present, Feilding takes me back up to her loft office and her excitement at the current Beckley-sponsored research. When I mention Pollan\u2019s book she expresses dismay that although the <em>New York </em><em>Times</em> writer visited her here, he did not acknowledge in his book her work in shaping the debate around legalisation. \u201cHe wrote me out of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI have learned it is quite easy to write a woman out.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her vision and energy have led to transformational changes in international drug policy</p> <footer> <cite>Sir David Nutt</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She leafs through some of the foundation\u2019s reports on her desk.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I got involved, global drug policy was in the dark ages,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really just interested in cannabis and the psychedelics and horrified how they were classified in the same bag as all other drugs, heroin and cocaine and the rest.\u201d</p> <p>Feilding launched a series of seminars through the foundation, <a href=\"https://beckleyfoundation.org/policy/seminars-society-and-drugs/\" title=\"\">Society and Drugs: A Rational Perspective</a>, which drew in speakers and policy-makers from across the world. She leveraged her influence to help frame a more realistic approach by the UN and sympathetic governments toward cannabis in particular. Psychedelics remained more of a taboo subject. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Sir David Nutt</a>, another of her Beckley Foundation advisory board, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/09/ecstasy-horse-riding\" title=\"\">lost his job</a> as chair of the Home Office committee on the misuse of drugs in 2009 for stating that \u201cthe drug ecstasy is [statistically] no more dangerous an addiction than horse riding\u201d. He could have gone further, Feilding suggests. \u201cCannabis and psychedelics are non-addictive. They have been used as medicines since the beginning of human history. I think,\u201d she says, \u201cour meetings were quite influential in persuading important people of that fact.\u201d (Nutt, now chair of the <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/department-of-medicine/research/brain-sciences/neuropsychopharmacology/\" title=\"\">neuropsychopharmacology programme at Imperial</a>, later confirms to me how \u201cAmanda\u2019s remarkable vision and energy have led to transformational changes in both international drug policy and research with psychedelic drugs\u201d.)</p> <p>A faith in conventional scientific method seems to have partly supplanted some of the more speculative theories that Feilding adopted from Huges. In the years before the latter\u2019s death in 2004, she dismissed some of his later conjecture, she recalls, as \u201crubbish\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfb1afc5163feb83a7d73fdaedfb97557f998941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb1afc5163feb83a7d73fdaedfb97557f998941/238_300_3317_4252/780.jpg\" alt=\"In London with Joey Mellen (left) and scientist Bart Huges, 1966.

She admits it has not. When she helped to lead the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/11/lsd-impact-brain-revealed-groundbreaking-images\" title=\"\">first brain imaging study with LSD</a>, the scans did not reveal the increase of blood supply she had been expecting, though they did show a decrease in what she calls the \u201cconditioned reflex mechanism\u201d, the controlling effect of the ego. The principal investigator in the study, Robin Carhart-Harris at Imperial, subsequently suggested that blood flow was probably \u201ca little bit of a sideshow\u2026 The brain doesn\u2019t fundamentally work through flowing blood. That\u2019s part of it, but we know that the function is electrical, so why don\u2019t we measure the electrical signals?\u201d</p> <p>Those signals, on Feilding\u2019s primary-coloured fMRI scans, seemed to illustrate the mechanism that Aldous Huxley more poetically described as the opening of the doors of perception. Feilding points me to the patterns of colour on the brain scans. \u201cThe activity in the visual centre on the brain connects with a dozen other centres, so you get this flood of emotion and memory and colouring and music,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is what people have been trying to describe.\u201d</p> <p>When Feilding launched this landmark study at <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/\" title=\"\">the Royal Society</a> in 2016, she did so in honour of Hofmann, who had always wanted to be welcomed there, but never was. Hofmann remained president of the Beckley Foundation right up until his death, aged 102, in 2008.</p> <p>Had he died frustrated that his \u201celixir\u201d had apparently been consigned to scientific history?</p> <p>\u201cNo, Albert was a very happy man,\u201d she says. \u201cHe felt this was a gift he had been allowed to give the world. Though the world didn\u2019t seem to want it then, he knew it would at some point. I promised him I would get it re-established and that\u2019s what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>The study that she is \u201czooming in on\u201d is the trial of psychedelics with terminally ill patients. \u201cIt clearly brings this contentment to many people,\u201d she says. The original small, double-blind study showed a range of responses, but 80% of those involved showed significant decreases in depressed mood and more than two-thirds announced their experience with psilocybin as one of the top five most meaningful experiences in their lives. Does it matter, does Feilding think, if such experiences are illusory, a pharmacological trick?</p> <p>\u201cIf it makes your dying better, and gives comfort to all those around you, who cares?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd perhaps it gives us a glimpse that we are more connected to the world outside ourselves than we think.\u201d</p> <p>Does she retain the faith in a meaningful universe that she felt as a child?</p> <p>\u201cWell, it is utterly amazing, whatever you call it. And on every scale: billions of stars, billions of neurons. I think it\u2019s reasonable to believe there is some kind of connection between all of it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/22/how-to-change-mind-new-science-psychedelics-michael-pollan-review\">How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics by Michael Pollan \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She returns to other favourite strands of research \u2013 a collaboration in Brazil using ayahuasca to make neurons fire in a petri dish; her plans to look into the ways psychedelics might encourage \u201cbrain plasticity\u201d in Parkinson\u2019s patients; an idea to try to prove enhanced cognitive function by studying the effects of LSD on winning strategies in the <a href=\"https://www.kiseido.com/ff.htm\" title=\"\">board game Go</a>; policy roadmaps for the regulation of cannabis and MDMA.</p> <p>She punctuates these accounts with occasional expressions of the pressures all this work places on her time.

She has two grandchildren, twin boys aged five. Does she have enough time to spend with them, I wonder, or, rather, does she never think her work is done?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quickly, \u201cI love the work, but then I sometimes think, what am I doing?

It\u2019s pitch dark outside by now and Feilding walks me out to the car. She is anxious that I concentrate on the work rather than the personal history. I reassure her as far as I can, though it seems to me that you cannot separate one from the other. Then she waves me off, and I watch her in the rear-view mirror disappear back into the shadows of Brainblood Hall and her lifelong mission.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you were to close your eyes and conjure the headquarters of a 50-year campaign to legalise and license psychedelic drugs, you might well see \u201cBrainblood Hall\u201d. A Tudor hunting lodge, surrounded by three concentric moats and formal boxwood topiary, it appears, as you approach along its winding drive on a wintry afternoon, to be ready to whisper all kinds of curious stories. There are plenty from which to choose. The Black Prince used to hunt from a house on this site. Lewis Carroll based the chessboard landscape of Alice Through the Looking-Glass on the watery Oxfordshire moorland that extends in all directions. And Aldous Huxley set his first novel, Crome Yellow, here after visiting for tea with Lady Ottoline Morrell in 1921. Amanda Feilding, who grew up here and returned to live in the manor after the death of her parents, is the natural heir to all of those associations. She is an eye-bright woman of 76, a spirited talker and an attentive listener, with that ingrained aristocratic habit of passing off wild and whirling eccentricity as mundane routine. For the past half century, she has led an indefatigable \u2013 and mostly frustrated \u2013 campaign to relax the prohibition on research into psychedelic compounds, particularly LSD. What long seemed a hopeless quest, a one-woman battle against the massed artillery of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, has recently begun to turn in her favour. Feilding has lately been dubbed the \u201cQueen of Consciousness\u201d by the New Scientist. I have arranged to meet her to talk about the ways in which her half century of lobbying seems finally to be paying off. It is, appropriately enough, by no means straightforward to find Beckley Park (Feilding nicknamed it Brainblood Hall in the 1960s). The postcode I\u2019ve keyed in to satnav first takes me to an MoD firing range. Directions from the landlady of the local pub lead to a golf club car park. By the time I eventually locate the correct unmarked mile-long track, the low sun is losing its brightness on the red walls of the old lodge, lending it an off-grid glow. Feilding, who also enjoys the titles the Countess of Wemyss and March, and Lady Neidpath, courtesy of her husband, Jamie Charteris, has converted an outbuilding into the two-storey nerve centre of her lobbying operation. Downstairs, her team of five researchers and interns is at computer screens. Upstairs, in a beamed loft, we sit down to tea and biscuits while she talks me through the latest pile of data and research literature and the little, brightly coloured fMRI scans of the brain \u2013 this one on LSD, that one not. Feilding started her campaign from her kitchen table toward the end of the 1960s. But after a while, she thought: \u201cWell, I can\u2019t try to change global drug policy and carry out scientific research as just me. I have to become a foundation.\u201d She was, she says, \u201clucky or clever\u201d in getting serious scientists to support her. Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who famously had the first LSD \u201ctrip\u201d in 1943 after accidentally dosing himself with the compound he was analysing as a cure for migraine, became a lifelong ally. He was joined on the Beckley Foundation\u2019s advisory board by luminaries including Professor Colin Blakemore, director of the Oxford University Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, and his counterpart at Cambridge, Professor Trevor Robbins. In the past few years, since the controls on experimentation with psychedelics have been relaxed, the Beckley Foundation has sponsored research programmes at Imperial College London and elsewhere to explore the effects of LSD on the brain, particularly in treating long-term depression. These studies are part of the science that begins to suggest psychedelics may have a role to play in treating everything from alcohol addiction to Alzheimer\u2019s disease to post-traumatic stress disorder. Significant headlines first resulted from a Beckley-funded study at Johns Hopkins University in 2016, detailing the positive effects of using psilocybin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, to combat depression in terminally ill patients. That study was the starting point for a book-length investigation by the influential New York Times writer Michael Pollan, How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics, which topped the bestseller lists last year. Feilding had been arguing for many of Pollan\u2019s findings all her adult life: \u201cWe have been stuck with SSRIs [such as Prozac or Zoloft] as our only tool for treating depression,\u201d she says now, \u201cand meanwhile there has been an epidemic of mental illness.\u201d It is Feilding\u2019s as yet unproved belief that LSD in controlled dosages has the capacity to \u201cget deep down in the brain and reset \u2018the wish to get better\u2019 \u2013 like shaking up a snow globe\u201d. She began microdosing herself in her 20s. \u201cWe used to call it a psychovitamin,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes you more lively, you enjoy your thoughts more. You can find your flow.\u201d In the years since President Nixon outlawed LSD in the wake of the Charles Manson trials, prohibition codified in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it has been virtually impossible for pharmacologists to show an interest in Hofmann\u2019s \u201cwonder drug\u201d. One of the reasons that Feilding has been able to keep the argument going through those years, however, is that she has existed outside the academic establishment. She has no university degree. It would be fair to say, however, that her credibility as an advocate has not always been helped by her storied history with self-experimentation. This reached an infamous extreme in 1970, when Feilding became enthralled by the ancient practice of trepanning, the drilling of a hole in the skull, in the belief that it would expand consciousness and reduce neurosis (a practice that, needless to say, has zero support in the medical profession). Following the example of her former lover and mentor Bart Huges, a Dutch natural scientist with whom she first experimented with LSD, Feilding carefully bored a hole in her own skull using a dentist\u2019s drill. She made an artful film of the process, designed to be shown to the curious (somewhat gruesome clips from which are discoverable on the internet). The film did not endear her to mainstream science, but that experience was nothing new. \u201cFunnily enough, growing up here as children, we always were so far out of society,\u201d she says, cheerfully. \u201cMy parents had no cash for heating or petrol or toys or school uniform or whatever. I was always very isolated. So becoming a pariah made not much difference to me. And I always had a couple of other pariahs for company.\u201d That rebellious streak was inherited from her father, whose mother had been a friend of Nietzsche and \u201call that lot in Europe\u201d. He used to do his hedging and ditching at Beckley at night, by torch and candlelight, because he believed daylight should be reserved for making art \u2013 he was a painter who didn\u2019t really sell. Feilding trailed around after him at all hours. He read her Seven Pillars of Wisdom when she was six. Her mother was potentially less forgiving, an impassioned Catholic who believed that her daughter should live at home until she married. \u201cI have to say, I admired her in old age, though,\u201d Feilding says, with characteristic brightness. \u201cThere I was, druggy, trepanned, unmarried, with two sons \u2013 bastards, as she might have seen them \u2013 and she didn\u2019t mind a bit.\u201d Before the light outside goes, Feilding insists that we have a wander around the grounds, where the seeds of her curiosity were sown. Out among the ancient hedges and ponds she points out the mound and tree stump that she believed housed a private god figure; her game, aged five or six, was to find ways to make that god laugh, \u201cthat kind of orgasm experience that I think a lot of young children have and then forget\u201d. Feilding did not forget. She wanted afterwards, she says, to recreate that childlike intensity of experience. She discovered pot at 16 and left her convent school when she won the science prize and the nuns refused to present her with her chosen book about Buddhism. She decided to continue her education by going in search of her godfather, a man named Bertie Moore, who had been \u201ca spycatcher in the war\u201d and was by now living as a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. Feilding, with \u00a325 in her pocket, got as far as the Syrian border, where she spent some time living (of course she did) with Bedouins before returning to study comparative religion with an Oxford professor and fine art at the Slade school in London. Her first experience with LSD was nearly her last. An acquaintance spiked some coffee she was drinking with a massive dose and she spent three months recovering from the \u201cpsychic wound\u201d in a little hut she points out at the end of the garden. She was eventually persuaded out of the hut to a party at which Ravi Shankar was playing, in London. It was there that she met Huges, who had not long returned from Ibiza, where he had been making his own LSD. Huges was a man after her own seeker\u2019s heart. He had been, she suggests, the top medical student in the Netherlands. \u201cThen,\u201d she says, \u201che called his daughter Marijuana, and trepanned himself, and inevitably they failed him in his finals.\u201d The day after they met, Huges followed her down here and they started their hallucinogenic romance. As Feilding explains this former life, in digressive fits and starts, fretting a little that she is saying too much, she leads me through the twilit garden, over well-trodden stepping stones, pointing out a pond she dug \u201cbased on sacred geometries\u201d, with a half-submerged colonnade as if from a forgotten civilisation. It is hard to separate her from her habitat in the dusk; she says she thinks of the house as her soul. She feared she was going to have to lose it when her parents died. The house went up for sale and Drue Heinz, the baked beans heiress, expressed an interest. Feilding eventually managed to secure it by \u2013 she suggests, half-joking \u2013 letting her two young sons hide in the woods with air rifles to frighten off prospective buyers and by indulging in some financial smoke and mirrors with the bank. Her desire to stay was wrapped up with the experiences she had here with Huges. His cultish philosophy, which she imbibed enthusiastically, along with his drugs, was based on the notion that in evolving to stand upright, human beings had lost some of the vital blood volume in their brains. One result, Huges argued, apparently persuasively, was that the ego had come to dominate more vital connections with the external world. The broad hypothesis was that LSD, with its action on blood capillaries, restored that connection, flooding the senses and allowing us to experience the world something like a newborn baby did. The key to controlling those trips, Feilding discovered, remembering the hypoglycaemic collapses of her diabetic father, was to keep sugar levels high in the blood as the drug depleted the body\u2019s energy. At some point in these experiments, Huges made the mistake of explaining his brain-blood-volume thesis to a journalist. A few nights later, Feilding says, there was a knock at the door of her London flat and two burly gentlemen (\u201cfrom the Home Office or wherever\u201d) advised Huges that he should return to his native Holland. He was, Feilding says, unable to return to the UK for 25 years. As she completes this story, Feilding leads me into the main house itself, with its panelled walls and huge stone fireplaces and Ottoman rugs and tapestries. She fetches down a skull from her mantelpiece and shows me its several trepanned holes. The skull, she insists, was recovered from the grave of an Irish chieftain from 700BC; it is the cue for a brief history of skull boring in ancient cultures in Germany, India and Central America. The practice was, she believes \u2013 not entirely in step with received anthropological wisdom \u2013 most commonly associated with the priesthood, those with access to the best drugs. \u201cThe ones with the holes in the head became the shaman.\u201d And what about her own experience with the dentist\u2019s drill. Did it change her life? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d she says. She recalls in passing a terrible journey home from Amsterdam back in the 1970s, when she had gone to visit Huges and had taken strychnine instead of mescaline and nearly died. When she got to London, Joey Mellon, her fellow traveller with Huges and subsequently the father of her sons, was trying and failing to make a hole in his skull with this \u201cancient handheld trepan\u201d. Was that a moment, I wonder, when she felt their experiments might have been going too far? \u201cI took it more as an example of how not to trepan,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I did it myself, I was very careful; I had practised for a long time.\u201d She lost the movie of the operation for a while, but rediscovered it. I wonder how it felt to watch it now? \u201cActually, I think it is rather beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd terribly English. It starts with the bird, of course, who flies off from the attic window.\u201d The bird in question was a tame pigeon that Feilding had found as an orphaned squab, fed using a paintbrush, and which subsequently lived with her for 15 years, coming and going from the house as it pleased, sometimes sitting on her shoulder, Long John Silver style. \u201cBirdie\u201d was the reason she did not follow Huges to Holland. \u201cHe is,\u201d she says with certainty, \u201cthe reason I know telepathy exists. He would look at me before he flew off, as if to say, \u2018You poor person, why don\u2019t you fly away with me over the river?\u2019\u201d She pauses, laughs. \u201cI know that sounds mad, but to my mind it was not mad at all.\u201d Keen to return to the challenges of the present, Feilding takes me back up to her loft office and her excitement at the current Beckley-sponsored research. When I mention Pollan\u2019s book she expresses dismay that although the New York Times writer visited her here, he did not acknowledge in his book her work in shaping the debate around legalisation. \u201cHe wrote me out of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI have learned it is quite easy to write a woman out.\u201d She leafs through some of the foundation\u2019s reports on her desk. \u201cWhen I got involved, global drug policy was in the dark ages,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really just interested in cannabis and the psychedelics and horrified how they were classified in the same bag as all other drugs, heroin and cocaine and the rest.\u201d Feilding launched a series of seminars through the foundation, Society and Drugs: A Rational Perspective, which drew in speakers and policy-makers from across the world. She leveraged her influence to help frame a more realistic approach by the UN and sympathetic governments toward cannabis in particular. Psychedelics remained more of a taboo subject. Sir David Nutt, another of her Beckley Foundation advisory board, lost his job as chair of the Home Office committee on the misuse of drugs in 2009 for stating that \u201cthe drug ecstasy is [statistically] no more dangerous an addiction than horse riding\u201d. He could have gone further, Feilding suggests. \u201cCannabis and psychedelics are non-addictive. They have been used as medicines since the beginning of human history. I think,\u201d she says, \u201cour meetings were quite influential in persuading important people of that fact.\u201d (Nutt, now chair of the neuropsychopharmacology programme at Imperial, later confirms to me how \u201cAmanda\u2019s remarkable vision and energy have led to transformational changes in both international drug policy and research with psychedelic drugs\u201d.) A faith in conventional scientific method seems to have partly supplanted some of the more speculative theories that Feilding adopted from Huges. In the years before the latter\u2019s death in 2004, she dismissed some of his later conjecture, she recalls, as \u201crubbish\u201d. I wonder if any of the research she has done with Imperial College has vindicated Huges\u2019s original blood brain notion? She admits it has not. When she helped to lead the first brain imaging study with LSD, the scans did not reveal the increase of blood supply she had been expecting, though they did show a decrease in what she calls the \u201cconditioned reflex mechanism\u201d, the controlling effect of the ego. The principal investigator in the study, Robin Carhart-Harris at Imperial, subsequently suggested that blood flow was probably \u201ca little bit of a sideshow\u2026 The brain doesn\u2019t fundamentally work through flowing blood. That\u2019s part of it, but we know that the function is electrical, so why don\u2019t we measure the electrical signals?\u201d Those signals, on Feilding\u2019s primary-coloured fMRI scans, seemed to illustrate the mechanism that Aldous Huxley more poetically described as the opening of the doors of perception. Feilding points me to the patterns of colour on the brain scans. \u201cThe activity in the visual centre on the brain connects with a dozen other centres, so you get this flood of emotion and memory and colouring and music,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is what people have been trying to describe.\u201d When Feilding launched this landmark study at the Royal Society in 2016, she did so in honour of Hofmann, who had always wanted to be welcomed there, but never was. Hofmann remained president of the Beckley Foundation right up until his death, aged 102, in 2008. Had he died frustrated that his \u201celixir\u201d had apparently been consigned to scientific history? \u201cNo, Albert was a very happy man,\u201d she says. \u201cHe felt this was a gift he had been allowed to give the world. Though the world didn\u2019t seem to want it then, he knew it would at some point. I promised him I would get it re-established and that\u2019s what we are doing.\u201d The study that she is \u201czooming in on\u201d is the trial of psychedelics with terminally ill patients. \u201cIt clearly brings this contentment to many people,\u201d she says. The original small, double-blind study showed a range of responses, but 80% of those involved showed significant decreases in depressed mood and more than two-thirds announced their experience with psilocybin as one of the top five most meaningful experiences in their lives. Does it matter, does Feilding think, if such experiences are illusory, a pharmacological trick? \u201cIf it makes your dying better, and gives comfort to all those around you, who cares?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd perhaps it gives us a glimpse that we are more connected to the world outside ourselves than we think.\u201d Does she retain the faith in a meaningful universe that she felt as a child? \u201cWell, it is utterly amazing, whatever you call it. And on every scale: billions of stars, billions of neurons. I think it\u2019s reasonable to believe there is some kind of connection between all of it.\u201d She returns to other favourite strands of research \u2013 a collaboration in Brazil using ayahuasca to make neurons fire in a petri dish; her plans to look into the ways psychedelics might encourage \u201cbrain plasticity\u201d in Parkinson\u2019s patients; an idea to try to prove enhanced cognitive function by studying the effects of LSD on winning strategies in the board game Go; policy roadmaps for the regulation of cannabis and MDMA. She punctuates these accounts with occasional expressions of the pressures all this work places on her time. Feilding remains very involved in the lives of her sons: Cosmo, the youngest, is a film-maker, most recently of The Sunshine Makers, a documentary about 60s counter-culture; Rock, five years older, \u201crebelled\u201d to become deputy leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, until his abrupt departure after the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire, a \u201cterrible, terrible time\u201d that Feilding has no wish to discuss in detail. She has two grandchildren, twin boys aged five. Does she have enough time to spend with them, I wonder, or, rather, does she never think her work is done? \u201cNo,\u201d she says quickly, \u201cI love the work, but then I sometimes think, what am I doing? I love the research but I don\u2019t love the policy.\u201d Whatever the case, she suggests determinedly, now that she feels she is winning \u201cafter 45 years of not winning\u201d she is not going to give up soon. It\u2019s pitch dark outside by now and Feilding walks me out to the car. She is anxious that I concentrate on the work rather than the personal history. I reassure her as far as I can, though it seems to me that you cannot separate one from the other. Then she waves me off, and I watch her in the rear-view mirror disappear back into the shadows of Brainblood Hall and her lifelong mission.",

A neat joke; but what else?</p> <p>One thing about this compact show \u2013 and Koons\u2019s whole aesthetic \u2013 is that it puts everything on exactly the same level as anything else: the classical sculpture and the Disney ballerina, the basketball, the pig and the baby Jesus. Nothing is greater or lesser or more significant: not the smart new Hoover or the martyred saint. And the works in this show, we are told, put past and present on equal footing. Look at the <em>Belvedere Torso</em>, Koons argues, and you are both together in the here and now.</p> <p>Koons has curated the show himself, along with Norman Rosenthal, late of the Royal Academy (can it really have taken two brains?). The works are arranged so that you come upon the most monumental work, without knowing it, from behind.

      "body": "<p>Since 14-year-old Molly Russell killed herself in 2017, the apps and services our teenagers and children use \u2013 and their safety \u2013 have become a key concern for parents. Last week, the digital minister, Margot James, stated that \u201cthe tragic death of Molly Russell is the latest consequence of a social media world that behaves as if it is above the law\u201d. James went on to announce plans to introduce a legally binding code and duty of care towards young users for social media companies.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s children are not just using the likes of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Pinterest and Snapchat on a daily basis. There is a wealth of apps targeted at teens and children that have their own ecosystems and controversies.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.houseparty.com/\" title=\"\">Houseparty</a> </h2> <p><strong>What is it? </strong><br>In essence, a multi-person Skype or FaceTime video conversation. The screen \u2013 the app can be used on smartphones or laptops and desktops \u2013 is split into up to eight different tiles. It\u2019s the preteen equivalent of a conference call, with participants talking over one another \u2013 a way for the day\u2019s gossip to continue beyond the school gates.</p> <p><strong>How safe is it? </strong><br>You can connect on calls not only with friends, but friends of friends (with an on-screen warning about \u201cstranger danger\u201d). Different levels of security can be set on the account that limit the type of people who you can chat to, but some may choose to chat to anyone. \u201cThat would worry me,\u201d says Dr Victoria Nash, deputy director of the <a href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/victoria-nash/\" title=\"\">Oxford Internet Institute</a>, who has researched child safety online. \u201cIt combines live streaming video with stranger danger.\u201d There is discouragement of dubious behaviour, though; users are asked to enter their phone number when registering, theoretically making them trackable.</p> <p><strong>Controversies </strong><br>The phone number tie doesn\u2019t stop criminals: two Mancunian children aged 11 and 12 were <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4385918/Warning-House-Party-app-men-perform-lewd-acts.html\" title=\"\">reportedly confronted</a> by men who exposed themselves to other users in one chat in 2017. Anti-child sexual exploitation agencies in Rochdale have also <a href=\"http://rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/2/news-headlines/111060/dangers-of-%E2%80%98houseparty%E2%80%99-app-being-investigated\" title=\"\">investigated the app</a> after preteen users were alleged to have been targeted by adult men using the app. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.kik.com/\" title=\"\">Kik</a> </h2> <p><strong>What is it? </strong><br>Kik has been around for the best part of a decade, but the text messaging app still remains popular among teenagers and children, partly because it allows anonymous sign-ups that don\u2019t require tethering an account to a phone number. Which is an immediate red flag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7ace3b252d8e2df4712c409410ebc5f77d9765d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ace3b252d8e2df4712c409410ebc5f77d9765d/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kik app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>How safe is it? </strong><br>Kik\u2019s anonymity makes it particularly problematic. Users can create accounts and groom children (or send explicit messages and images) without fear of being traced. \u201cOn Kik, people can\u2019t be traced if they\u2019re on it for nefarious reasons; that\u2019s concerning, definitely,\u201d says Nash. An investigation by the UK\u2019s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) found that it was the <a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/how-safe-are-our-children/\" title=\"\">seventh most recorded method</a> used by child groomers last year (the first six were Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, text messages, WhatsApp and face-to-face conversation). And even if it\u2019s not grownup users trying to communicate with children, there are still risks. The lack of an easily accessible digital trail makes it a boon for cyberbullies.</p> <p><strong>Controversies</strong> <br>Last September, it was reported that British police forces had investigated more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45568276\" title=\"\">1,100 child sexual abuse cases</a> involving the app in the last five years.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" title=\"\">TikTok</a> </h2> <p><strong>What is it? </strong><br>TikTok \u2013 a Chinese app with hundreds of millions of users \u2013 is a successor to the defunct video sharing app <a href=\"https://vine.co/\" title=\"\">Vine</a>. Originally called musical.ly, the app allows children to lip-sync to their favourite songs and is a hotbed for memes: short, sharable, community-driven posts that mimic a theme.</p> <p><strong>How safe is it? </strong><br>A significant proportion of TikTok\u2019s users are children and teenagers, which is a draw to predators. \u201cThere\u2019s something weird about the performative nature of TikTok,\u201d explains Kyle McGregor, assistant professor at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Langone Health, who has studied the impact of social media on children. \u201cHow do we make sure there aren\u2019t risque, provocative, potentially illegal things being shown on this platform?\u201d It\u2019s something that concerns Nash too. \u201cI worry about age-inappropriate content, which might be song lyrics, for example, or sexualised content. Young children mouthing along to adult songs doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d TikTok has introduced a <a href=\"http://support.tiktok.com/knowledge-base/digital-wellbeing\" title=\"\">\u201cDigital Wellbeing\u201d</a> feature that is meant to limit young users\u2019 access to inappropriate content but its effectiveness is moot.</p> <p><strong>Controversies </strong><br>The app has battled negative headlines in recent months after journalists discovered that older users were soliciting nude images from underage users and that it was being used to host neo-Nazi propaganda. In a world where personal data is treasured like a prize, Nash also worries about the app being owned by <a href=\"https://www.bytedance.com/\" title=\"\">ByteDance</a>, a Chinese company. \u201cI have concerns about how far they would comply with GDPR, even though they\u2019re bound by it,\u201d she says.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\" title=\"\">Twitch</a> (and Discord) </h2> <p><strong>What is it? </strong><br>Twitch was formerly called Justin.tv and has become the home for video game streaming. Users can watch \u201cstreamers\u201d play games while on camera, interacting with fellow fans in text comment sections that run alongside the video.</p> <p><strong>How safe is it? </strong><br>The main concern around Twitch is common to most platforms: that users your children meet on Twitch may have bad intentions and aim to take the interaction offline.

      "bodyText": "Since 14-year-old Molly Russell killed herself in 2017, the apps and services our teenagers and children use \u2013 and their safety \u2013 have become a key concern for parents. Last week, the digital minister, Margot James, stated that \u201cthe tragic death of Molly Russell is the latest consequence of a social media world that behaves as if it is above the law\u201d. James went on to announce plans to introduce a legally binding code and duty of care towards young users for social media companies. Britain\u2019s children are not just using the likes of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Pinterest and Snapchat on a daily basis. There is a wealth of apps targeted at teens and children that have their own ecosystems and controversies. Houseparty What is it? In essence, a multi-person Skype or FaceTime video conversation. The screen \u2013 the app can be used on smartphones or laptops and desktops \u2013 is split into up to eight different tiles. It\u2019s the preteen equivalent of a conference call, with participants talking over one another \u2013 a way for the day\u2019s gossip to continue beyond the school gates. How safe is it? You can connect on calls not only with friends, but friends of friends (with an on-screen warning about \u201cstranger danger\u201d). Different levels of security can be set on the account that limit the type of people who you can chat to, but some may choose to chat to anyone. \u201cThat would worry me,\u201d says Dr Victoria Nash, deputy director of the Oxford Internet Institute, who has researched child safety online. \u201cIt combines live streaming video with stranger danger.\u201d There is discouragement of dubious behaviour, though; users are asked to enter their phone number when registering, theoretically making them trackable. Controversies The phone number tie doesn\u2019t stop criminals: two Mancunian children aged 11 and 12 were reportedly confronted by men who exposed themselves to other users in one chat in 2017. Anti-child sexual exploitation agencies in Rochdale have also investigated the app after preteen users were alleged to have been targeted by adult men using the app. Kik What is it? Kik has been around for the best part of a decade, but the text messaging app still remains popular among teenagers and children, partly because it allows anonymous sign-ups that don\u2019t require tethering an account to a phone number. Which is an immediate red flag. How safe is it? Kik\u2019s anonymity makes it particularly problematic. Users can create accounts and groom children (or send explicit messages and images) without fear of being traced. \u201cOn Kik, people can\u2019t be traced if they\u2019re on it for nefarious reasons; that\u2019s concerning, definitely,\u201d says Nash. An investigation by the UK\u2019s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) found that it was the seventh most recorded method used by child groomers last year (the first six were Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, text messages, WhatsApp and face-to-face conversation). And even if it\u2019s not grownup users trying to communicate with children, there are still risks. The lack of an easily accessible digital trail makes it a boon for cyberbullies. Controversies Last September, it was reported that British police forces had investigated more than 1,100 child sexual abuse cases involving the app in the last five years. TikTok What is it? TikTok \u2013 a Chinese app with hundreds of millions of users \u2013 is a successor to the defunct video sharing app Vine. Originally called musical.ly, the app allows children to lip-sync to their favourite songs and is a hotbed for memes: short, sharable, community-driven posts that mimic a theme. How safe is it? A significant proportion of TikTok\u2019s users are children and teenagers, which is a draw to predators. \u201cThere\u2019s something weird about the performative nature of TikTok,\u201d explains Kyle McGregor, assistant professor at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Langone Health, who has studied the impact of social media on children. \u201cHow do we make sure there aren\u2019t risque, provocative, potentially illegal things being shown on this platform?\u201d It\u2019s something that concerns Nash too. \u201cI worry about age-inappropriate content, which might be song lyrics, for example, or sexualised content. Young children mouthing along to adult songs doesn\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d TikTok has introduced a \u201cDigital Wellbeing\u201d feature that is meant to limit young users\u2019 access to inappropriate content but its effectiveness is moot. Controversies The app has battled negative headlines in recent months after journalists discovered that older users were soliciting nude images from underage users and that it was being used to host neo-Nazi propaganda. In a world where personal data is treasured like a prize, Nash also worries about the app being owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. \u201cI have concerns about how far they would comply with GDPR, even though they\u2019re bound by it,\u201d she says. Twitch (and Discord) What is it? Twitch was formerly called Justin.tv and has become the home for video game streaming. Users can watch \u201cstreamers\u201d play games while on camera, interacting with fellow fans in text comment sections that run alongside the video. How safe is it? The main concern around Twitch is common to most platforms: that users your children meet on Twitch may have bad intentions and aim to take the interaction offline. There\u2019s also a text-based chat app popular with gamers called Discord, which features chatrooms, often containing hundreds of participants. \u201cPeer pressure via text chat on video streaming services is one of the things we need to be aware of, particularly with online grooming,\u201d says Nash. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging people to commit acts they might not necessarily think of as sexual. People who do this deliberately are clever and manipulative people.\u201d Controversies Some of Twitch\u2019s biggest controversies aren\u2019t around security flaws but stem from the opinions it hosts. Critics have said that the text chat that accompanies video streams is a hotbed of racism, with casual slurs tossed around \u2013 potentially warping young users\u2019 beliefs. \u201cChildren can be exposed to inappropriate content that\u2019s posted or broadcast in real time,\u201d explains an NSPCC spokesperson. \u201cIt\u2019s important the government considers how it ensures these types of sites are moderated properly.\u201d Depop What is it? An eBay-like app for selling unwanted goods. Load up the app and you\u2019re presented with a grid of perfectly presented pictures showing off colour-coordinated clothes you can buy with a minimum of friction. More than 10 million users \u2013 most teenagers and in their early 20s \u2013 log on to the app to buy and sell. How safe is it? Relatively so, unless you think capitalism is dangerous. You may regard it as teaching children important business skills \u2013 marketing, negotiation, pricing and so on. Controversies Platforms selling items are often used to market contraband, and Depop is no different. In 2016, Depop users were offering ritalin and dextroamphetamine as well as unlicensed \u201csmart drugs\u201d such as modafinil for sale through the app, despite Depop\u2019s no-tolerance rule on restricted sales.

They generate a lot of heat, outrage and public angst. But, eventually, the media caravan moves on and nothing much changes. When in 2011, for example, the Guardian printed shocking revelations of tabloid phone-hacking and, particularly, the news that reporters had hacked the mobile phone of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, many observers concluded that this indicated a crisis for the British newspaper industry. Initially, the signs were promising: solemn statement by the prime minister, ubiquitous shock-horror-outrage, closure of a big newspaper, a judicial inquiry \u2013 all the trappings of a democracy embarking on radical reform. But in the end, nothing much changed. British tabloids are as intrusive and crass as ever. And the industry remains \u201cself-regulated\u201d. It was just another scandal, after all.

A few hours later, Maduro appeared and was greeted with chants of: \u201c<em>Maduro, amigo! El pueblo est\u00e1 contigo!</em>\u201d \u201cMaduro, our friend!

      "bodyText": "In the final weeks of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s life, shattered followers flocked to a palm-dotted square in downtown Caracas to pray for the recovery of \u201cEl Comandante\u201d. Six years on, with Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leftist Bolivarian revolution seemingly in its death throes, some are returning to appeal for the survival of his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \u201cThere are millions of us,\u201d insisted Fernando Andrade, 69, a retired electrician and one of hundreds of mostly elderly Chavistas queuing to sign a pro-Maduro petition in Plaza Bol\u00edvar last week. A few hours later, Maduro appeared and was greeted with chants of: \u201cMaduro, amigo! El pueblo est\u00e1 contigo!\u201d \u201cMaduro, our friend! The people are with you!\u201d But as a revolt against Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir enters its fourth week, political observers and former Chavista insiders say that claim to popular support has never been flimsier. \u201cChavismo is broken \u2026 If they carry on like this, they will have nothing left,\u201d said Nicmer Evans, a longtime loyalist who split with the movement in 2013, and believes that Maduro must now resign if that movement is to survive. Those descending on Plaza Bol\u00edvar insisted they remained devoted to Maduro, who inherited Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s revolution after his death in 2013 and now faces the fight of his political life after a stunning challenge from opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. Little known until just a few weeks ago, Guaid\u00f3 declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader on 23 January and is now recognised as Venezuela\u2019s interim president by more than 40 nations, including the United States. \u201cI have only one president and that\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\u201d said Maryuri Gonz\u00e1lez, a 25-year-old from La Victoria, a city an hour west of Caracas. \u201cI never voted for anyone called Guaid\u00f3.\u201d But experts say support for Maduro is evaporating, with many of those publicly backing him doing so because they depend on government jobs or food handouts known as \u201cclap\u201d boxes. \u201cHe knows he has lost the people. He knows the streets and the barrios [poor areas] are no longer with him,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, Venezuela\u2019s former trade minister and a vocal critic of Chavismo. Evans estimated Ch\u00e1vez, who first took office 20 years ago and governed until his death in 2013, had been able to rely on a hardcore support base of about 30% of voters. For years those diehard disciples lived by the maxim: \u201cCon hambre y sin empleo, con Ch\u00e1vez me resteo\u201d \u2013 \u201cEven hungry and jobless, I\u2019ll stick with Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d Under Maduro \u2013 who has presided over one of the most severe economic collapses in recent history \u2013 that support base had plummeted to about 10%, Evans thought. And he predicted that figure would shrink further as sweeping US oil sanctions devastate the economy. \u201cThe risk is that if Maduro stays in power, Chavismo will disappear. The Chavistas know this \u2013 they know it very well,\u201d he said. Many believe that leaves Chavistas with an urgent dilemma \u2013 ditch Maduro in order to keep their political movement afloat, or sink along with him.

In an interview this week with El Pa\u00eds, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s former oil minister, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, said that Maduro was \u201cout of time\u201d. \u201cThe country stands on the edge of an abyss, fundamentally because Maduro\u2019s situation is unsustainable,\u201d said Ram\u00edrez, who split with Maduro in 2017 and appears to be plotting a comeback from exile in Europe. \u201cHe has to go, because he is destroying the country and will continue destroying the country,\u201d Ram\u00edrez added.

But there were also hints that some would not mourn the political passing of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s inheritor.

Six years of crisis 2013 April A month after the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Maduro is elected president by a narrow margin. The result is contested. 2015 December An opposition coalition takes over the legislature, the National Assembly, ending 16 years\u2019 control by Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro\u2019s Socialist party. 2017 spring Several people die during protests opposing Maduro\u2019s plans for a \u201cconstituent assembly\u201d to supercede the opposition-controlled parliament. 2018 May Maduro wins a second term in an election boycotted by the opposition and tainted by allegations of irregularities including vote-buying. 2018 August Venezuela slashes five zeros from its currency in bid to tackle rampant hyperinflation; millions flee their country. 2019 January Maduro starts his second term.

      "body": "<p>Andrew Cammiss got up at four yesterday morning to set off on a 250-mile trip to Oxford for a third division football match. \u201cI took my lad Niall who\u2019s named after my favourite player,\u201d he reveals. Along with other club legends Peter Reid and Kevin Phillips, an image of Niall Quinn is inked on the 39-year-old superfan\u2019s body. \u201cIt takes my mind off things. Tattoos show my love for the lads.\u201d</p> <p>By \u201cthings\u201d he means the latest kick in the teeth to his home city. Nissan has <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/02/07/nissan-snubs-sunderland-is-brexit-to-blame\" title=\"\">scrapped plans to manufacture the X-Trail sport-utility vehicle</a> there. Despite reassurances that the cancellation does not imperil the plant, which employs about 7,000 people, Cammiss fears the worst. \u201cI\u2019ve a cousin and uncle who work there. Everyone knows someone who works there. If Nissan goes we\u2019ll be gutted for a bit, but we\u2019ll get used to it. There\u2019s always the football.\u201d</p> <p>Such blind faith is not shared by Father Marc Lyden-Smith. Like Cammiss, he was an unlikely star of Netflix\u2019s documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/dec/12/sunderland-til-i-die-showcasing-everything-right-wrong-in-english-football-documentary-netflix\" title=\"\">Sunderland \u2019Til I Die</a>, a fly-on-the-wall portrait of last season\u2019s descent into oblivion, or League One as it is more commonly known. In the opening episode, the local priest began his sermon with the incantation: \u201cDear Lord, help Sunderland because the success of our team leads to the success and prosperity of our city.\u201d</p> <p>This season there has been a mini-revival, with new owners \u2013 rather than divine intervention \u2013 inspiring a push for promotion. But the dysfunctionality exposed in the documentary continues to blight a city scarred by both sporting and economic austerity. Thatcherism oversaw the destruction of the mines and shipyards in the 1980s. According to a government report, a hard Brexit would lead to a 16% economic decline in the region. The fallout from the Nissan cancellation might prove to be the final nail in the coffin.</p> <p>\u201cThe very culture of this city is we make things \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re Mackems,\u201d Lyden-Smith tells me in a cafe near the metro railway station. \u201cThis is the city\u2019s identity. It was eroded with the closure of the shipyards and pits. There is a tangible sense of anxiety and worry about what\u2019s happening with Nissan. If that goes, what else do we make? There are some business leaders looking at new development, but who\u2019s the major employer of the last 10 years? It\u2019s the football club, which has had back-to-back relegation and redundancies.\u201d</p> <p>It was the intense connection between city and club which inspired Fulwell 73 producer Leo Pearlman and two other Sunderland fans to make the Netflix series. It is a love letter to a city on its knees, a searing, riches-to-rags account of the central role the people\u2019s game still plays in a left-behind, deindustrialised area. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing we have,\u201d says Pearlman. \u201cThe Nissan thing feels like another blow to the city. It\u2019s terrible news.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42ed78de635afc90274321d9db7dcb0c9a99a5c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42ed78de635afc90274321d9db7dcb0c9a99a5c4/0_179_5367_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signage at near the Sunderland car assembly plant of Nissan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fortunes of Sunderland are closely aligned to those of carmaker Nissan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there is hope, it lies in the fans. Despite the club\u2019s rapid freefall, the crippling debt and bad investments, the rise in child poverty and decline in public services, attendances at the Stadium of Light have averaged more than 30,000. On Boxing Day, a new League One record was set when about 46,000 turned out to watch the team beat Bradford City; only Manchester United and Liverpool attracted more supporters.</p> <p>Taxi driver Peter Farrer says the football has always been an escape from economic woes. As he drives past the ground\u2019s Davy Lamp monument, a tribute to the colliery it has replaced, he argues that the sport has been \u201ctaken game away from the working man\u201d. But Sunderland is the exception. There would be no club without the supporters; there would be no point to it.</p> <p>Farrer has become a local hero since appearing in the documentary, but \u201cI\u2019m not big-headed or up me own arse. People do recognise us in the street. I\u2019ve had nobody slag us. Just support. We\u2019re all fanatics like. We cannot help ourselves. We never lost the hard core supporters. You just cannae give up. If Hitler invaded Poland on Tuesday I\u2019d still be at the Blackpool match.\u201d</p> <p>As we pass the world-famous carmaker, housed in a giant factory complex just off the A19, he suddenly confesses to being a Remainer. Sunderland is known as Brexit City, with 61% voting to Leave. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bellyful of Brexit but I do know the local economy is dependent on Nissan.\u201d He points out the sprawling fields. \u201cThese were football pitches but hopefully will now be used to bring the supply chain nearer. That\u2019s if Nissan doesn\u2019t go. Nobody knows for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Half a mile away, in a village pub, a former Nissan employee \u2013 Steven France \u2013 is waiting for me. He\u2019s also a former footballer. After starring for a Sunday League team, he played for Barbados against Cuba in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. Today he\u2019s a community leader.</p> <p>\u201cNissan won\u2019t necessarily close tomorrow,\u201d says France, \u201cbut it will in 10 or 15 years time. Jacob Rees Mogg\u2019s favourite economist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/21/will-brexit-boost-or-hurt-economy-free-trade\" title=\"\">Patrick Minford</a>, said the car industry will have to be wound down if Britain left the EU. I\u2019ve got to explain this to my community. People work blood, sweat and tears in that factory.</p> <p>\u201cSure, the club brings people together. It is the last big community. But how will that feed people? How is the club going to take the 16% GDP hit in the city?\u201d</p> <p><em>Anthony Clavane is a sports writer and the author of Promised Land and Moving the Goalposts</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Cammiss got up at four yesterday morning to set off on a 250-mile trip to Oxford for a third division football match. \u201cI took my lad Niall who\u2019s named after my favourite player,\u201d he reveals. Along with other club legends Peter Reid and Kevin Phillips, an image of Niall Quinn is inked on the 39-year-old superfan\u2019s body. \u201cIt takes my mind off things. Tattoos show my love for the lads.\u201d By \u201cthings\u201d he means the latest kick in the teeth to his home city. Nissan has scrapped plans to manufacture the X-Trail sport-utility vehicle there. Despite reassurances that the cancellation does not imperil the plant, which employs about 7,000 people, Cammiss fears the worst. \u201cI\u2019ve a cousin and uncle who work there. Everyone knows someone who works there. If Nissan goes we\u2019ll be gutted for a bit, but we\u2019ll get used to it. There\u2019s always the football.\u201d Such blind faith is not shared by Father Marc Lyden-Smith. Like Cammiss, he was an unlikely star of Netflix\u2019s documentary Sunderland \u2019Til I Die, a fly-on-the-wall portrait of last season\u2019s descent into oblivion, or League One as it is more commonly known. In the opening episode, the local priest began his sermon with the incantation: \u201cDear Lord, help Sunderland because the success of our team leads to the success and prosperity of our city.\u201d This season there has been a mini-revival, with new owners \u2013 rather than divine intervention \u2013 inspiring a push for promotion. But the dysfunctionality exposed in the documentary continues to blight a city scarred by both sporting and economic austerity. Thatcherism oversaw the destruction of the mines and shipyards in the 1980s. According to a government report, a hard Brexit would lead to a 16% economic decline in the region. The fallout from the Nissan cancellation might prove to be the final nail in the coffin. \u201cThe very culture of this city is we make things \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re Mackems,\u201d Lyden-Smith tells me in a cafe near the metro railway station. \u201cThis is the city\u2019s identity. It was eroded with the closure of the shipyards and pits. There is a tangible sense of anxiety and worry about what\u2019s happening with Nissan. If that goes, what else do we make? There are some business leaders looking at new development, but who\u2019s the major employer of the last 10 years? It\u2019s the football club, which has had back-to-back relegation and redundancies.\u201d It was the intense connection between city and club which inspired Fulwell 73 producer Leo Pearlman and two other Sunderland fans to make the Netflix series. It is a love letter to a city on its knees, a searing, riches-to-rags account of the central role the people\u2019s game still plays in a left-behind, deindustrialised area. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing we have,\u201d says Pearlman. \u201cThe Nissan thing feels like another blow to the city. It\u2019s terrible news.\u201d If there is hope, it lies in the fans. Despite the club\u2019s rapid freefall, the crippling debt and bad investments, the rise in child poverty and decline in public services, attendances at the Stadium of Light have averaged more than 30,000. On Boxing Day, a new League One record was set when about 46,000 turned out to watch the team beat Bradford City; only Manchester United and Liverpool attracted more supporters. Taxi driver Peter Farrer says the football has always been an escape from economic woes. As he drives past the ground\u2019s Davy Lamp monument, a tribute to the colliery it has replaced, he argues that the sport has been \u201ctaken game away from the working man\u201d. But Sunderland is the exception. There would be no club without the supporters; there would be no point to it. Farrer has become a local hero since appearing in the documentary, but \u201cI\u2019m not big-headed or up me own arse. People do recognise us in the street. I\u2019ve had nobody slag us. Just support. We\u2019re all fanatics like. We cannot help ourselves. We never lost the hard core supporters. You just cannae give up. If Hitler invaded Poland on Tuesday I\u2019d still be at the Blackpool match.\u201d As we pass the world-famous carmaker, housed in a giant factory complex just off the A19, he suddenly confesses to being a Remainer. Sunderland is known as Brexit City, with 61% voting to Leave. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bellyful of Brexit but I do know the local economy is dependent on Nissan.\u201d He points out the sprawling fields. \u201cThese were football pitches but hopefully will now be used to bring the supply chain nearer. That\u2019s if Nissan doesn\u2019t go. Nobody knows for sure.\u201d Half a mile away, in a village pub, a former Nissan employee \u2013 Steven France \u2013 is waiting for me. He\u2019s also a former footballer. After starring for a Sunday League team, he played for Barbados against Cuba in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. Today he\u2019s a community leader. \u201cNissan won\u2019t necessarily close tomorrow,\u201d says France, \u201cbut it will in 10 or 15 years time. Jacob Rees Mogg\u2019s favourite economist, Patrick Minford, said the car industry will have to be wound down if Britain left the EU. I\u2019ve got to explain this to my community. People work blood, sweat and tears in that factory. \u201cSure, the club brings people together. It is the last big community. But how will that feed people? How is the club going to take the 16% GDP hit in the city?\u201d Anthony Clavane is a sports writer and the author of Promised Land and Moving the Goalposts",

      "body": "<p>I found myself walking the aisles humming \u201cValentines at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/07/last-days-poundworld-bargain-chains-econonomic-downturn-close-stores\" title=\"\">Poundland</a>\u201d to the tune of Lullaby of Birdland, I was that happy. How long did I stand there, in front of the Valentine\u2019s display, in its vulvic shades of pink and brown? Long enough to finally understand the plastic business of love.</p> <p>The gifts could be roughly separated into the following categories: True Love; \u201cI Hate You\u201d; Gender as Seen in British Sitcoms of the 1970s; I\u2019m Six; Sex Presents; and Third Wave Feminism But Melted Slightly. Upfront, on its own shelf unit, was the \u00a31 engagement ring, its elegance only disturbed by the wanton disarray of the stacks. Somebody had got extremely excited trying to find the one that would make her say yes: gold, with a red heart stone glinting cheekily from its velvet box.</p> <p>What would a \u00a31 engagement look like? On one hand, not lovely, with the suggestion that they had invested nothing in this \u2013 no money, no hope, that this love is a joke destined to clog our oceans like so many short promises. On the other, lovely. Casual. An acknowledgement that this ring, though 3,000 times cheaper than some others, was a similar feat of romantic marketing and, so, just as worthy. An acknowledgment that the wedding is not the thing. That, instead, what the proposer is proposing is a marriage without need for expensive gestures, a partnership that could survive in an empty room with only conversation and tinned soup to stay alive.</p> <p>Then there were the \u201cHouse Husband Dusting Slippers\u201d, decorated on the bottom with a loose grey weave, the idea being that you give them to the man you love, the man who, let\u2019s say, was made redundant after 15 years of service in a company that promptly replaced him with a graduate called Finn, and who now, after two years of fruitless job-hunting and a crisis talk about your relationship that happened to take place in a service station equidistant from your two dying mothers, has decided to \u201csee the funny side\u201d. There were the \u2013 and apologies while I quietly retch into my shoulder \u2013 \u201cbanter mugs\u201d: You\u2019re So Fit \u2013 Run and Get me a Brew, and the stark, You\u2019ll Do, and one with a boiled egg saying to its egg mate, I Want To Dunk My Soldier In You, which I can only imagine being accidentally handed to the lady from social services on one of their little \u201cpop ins\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My delight was only punctured by their Galentine\u2019s Day Selfie Kit, a collection of props that made me shudder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My delight was only punctured by their Galentine\u2019s Day Selfie Kit, a collection of props (Grl Power!) that made me shudder. In recent years this friendly alternative, one with worthy emotion behind it, has multiplied like a wet gremlin. Romantic relationships need all the support they can get, whether in the shape of safe words or internationally recognised greeting-card days. But one beauty of platonic friendship is that it needn\u2019t be tended in the same way \u2013 it is strong enough to remain without annual cuddly affirmations. This February, the marketing has been stepped up further \u2013 I\u2019ve seen personalised Galentine\u2019s jewellery for sale, complimentary Galentine\u2019s cocktails with a tapas sharing platter, and also, \u201csassy socks\u201d. Must we?</p> <p>There were cuddly hearts and two how-to charts, one on how to use the washing machine, the other on how to catch a spider. I saw a lot of these cheery joke-on-a-ropes during my Rightmove addiction, a lot of kitchens exposing in ye olde twine the reason their flat was up for sale. In Poundland there were also two roadside \u201cwarning cones\u201d: one for \u201ctoxic gases\u201d (a stick figure sits on a toilet) and one warning Mood Swing in Operation. I don\u2019t know \u2013 is there a woman who would thank her partner for this cone on Valentine\u2019s day? Would welcome it as a comical way for him to communicate he had noticed that her depression had floated its way to the surface again, that dark raft on choppy seas, that horror that caused her to skip another day of work, another week, another pack of Mini Rolls, that blind way she looked at him in the evenings? Plomp, a traffic cone on the stairs! Yeah, no I get it, actually.</p> <p>I was less taken by a heart-shaped money box claiming to be a for a couple\u2019s \u201cdate fund\u201d, which, and call me a bitter crone with a masticated energy ball where my heart should be, struck me as uniquely mean. But next to it, and similarly empty, a transparent heart: the Gift of Nothing! Exactly What You Asked For! Bravo you massive bastards, bravo \u2013 the essence of Will This Do? wrapped twice in plastic, for this we must stand and applaud the level of cynicism, the contempt for romance, the faith that a hundred people will arrive in a panic \u2013 people who are in a relationship, well, is it a relationship, it\u2019s been a month, they don\u2019t want to come on too strong, but also they don\u2019t want to not acknowledge it at all, so ha, here\u2019s an answer, of sorts \u2013 and then pay a further 5p for a bag.</p> <p>A shop assistant asked if I needed any help, and I turned my joyful beam on him saying no, I was good. Better than good.

      "bodyText": "I found myself walking the aisles humming \u201cValentines at Poundland\u201d to the tune of Lullaby of Birdland, I was that happy. How long did I stand there, in front of the Valentine\u2019s display, in its vulvic shades of pink and brown? Long enough to finally understand the plastic business of love. The gifts could be roughly separated into the following categories: True Love; \u201cI Hate You\u201d; Gender as Seen in British Sitcoms of the 1970s; I\u2019m Six; Sex Presents; and Third Wave Feminism But Melted Slightly. Upfront, on its own shelf unit, was the \u00a31 engagement ring, its elegance only disturbed by the wanton disarray of the stacks. Somebody had got extremely excited trying to find the one that would make her say yes: gold, with a red heart stone glinting cheekily from its velvet box. What would a \u00a31 engagement look like? On one hand, not lovely, with the suggestion that they had invested nothing in this \u2013 no money, no hope, that this love is a joke destined to clog our oceans like so many short promises. On the other, lovely. Casual. An acknowledgement that this ring, though 3,000 times cheaper than some others, was a similar feat of romantic marketing and, so, just as worthy. An acknowledgment that the wedding is not the thing. That, instead, what the proposer is proposing is a marriage without need for expensive gestures, a partnership that could survive in an empty room with only conversation and tinned soup to stay alive. Then there were the \u201cHouse Husband Dusting Slippers\u201d, decorated on the bottom with a loose grey weave, the idea being that you give them to the man you love, the man who, let\u2019s say, was made redundant after 15 years of service in a company that promptly replaced him with a graduate called Finn, and who now, after two years of fruitless job-hunting and a crisis talk about your relationship that happened to take place in a service station equidistant from your two dying mothers, has decided to \u201csee the funny side\u201d. There were the \u2013 and apologies while I quietly retch into my shoulder \u2013 \u201cbanter mugs\u201d: You\u2019re So Fit \u2013 Run and Get me a Brew, and the stark, You\u2019ll Do, and one with a boiled egg saying to its egg mate, I Want To Dunk My Soldier In You, which I can only imagine being accidentally handed to the lady from social services on one of their little \u201cpop ins\u201d. My delight was only punctured by their Galentine\u2019s Day Selfie Kit, a collection of props (Grl Power!) that made me shudder. In recent years this friendly alternative, one with worthy emotion behind it, has multiplied like a wet gremlin. Romantic relationships need all the support they can get, whether in the shape of safe words or internationally recognised greeting-card days. But one beauty of platonic friendship is that it needn\u2019t be tended in the same way \u2013 it is strong enough to remain without annual cuddly affirmations. This February, the marketing has been stepped up further \u2013 I\u2019ve seen personalised Galentine\u2019s jewellery for sale, complimentary Galentine\u2019s cocktails with a tapas sharing platter, and also, \u201csassy socks\u201d. Must we? There were cuddly hearts and two how-to charts, one on how to use the washing machine, the other on how to catch a spider. I saw a lot of these cheery joke-on-a-ropes during my Rightmove addiction, a lot of kitchens exposing in ye olde twine the reason their flat was up for sale. In Poundland there were also two roadside \u201cwarning cones\u201d: one for \u201ctoxic gases\u201d (a stick figure sits on a toilet) and one warning Mood Swing in Operation. I don\u2019t know \u2013 is there a woman who would thank her partner for this cone on Valentine\u2019s day? Would welcome it as a comical way for him to communicate he had noticed that her depression had floated its way to the surface again, that dark raft on choppy seas, that horror that caused her to skip another day of work, another week, another pack of Mini Rolls, that blind way she looked at him in the evenings? Plomp, a traffic cone on the stairs! Yeah, no I get it, actually. I was less taken by a heart-shaped money box claiming to be a for a couple\u2019s \u201cdate fund\u201d, which, and call me a bitter crone with a masticated energy ball where my heart should be, struck me as uniquely mean. But next to it, and similarly empty, a transparent heart: the Gift of Nothing! Exactly What You Asked For! Bravo you massive bastards, bravo \u2013 the essence of Will This Do? wrapped twice in plastic, for this we must stand and applaud the level of cynicism, the contempt for romance, the faith that a hundred people will arrive in a panic \u2013 people who are in a relationship, well, is it a relationship, it\u2019s been a month, they don\u2019t want to come on too strong, but also they don\u2019t want to not acknowledge it at all, so ha, here\u2019s an answer, of sorts \u2013 and then pay a further 5p for a bag. A shop assistant asked if I needed any help, and I turned my joyful beam on him saying no, I was good. Better than good. In Poundland, aisle three, I\u2019d found love. One more thing\u2026 I was alerted this week to a company that creates slippers which look exactly like your pet. Cuddle Clones picture slippered people beside the happy panting dogs they\u2019re based on, never touching on the fact that, surely, this is a service for people whose pets have recently died. And who, presumably, always dreamed of wearing them as shoes. \u2018Since I was elected I have met many people who earn way more than \u00a330,000 and have literally no discernible skills,\u2019 said the marvellous Jess Phillips in parliament last week, talking about \u2018skilled workers\u2019. \u2018I thought I had met posh people before I came here, but I had actually just met people who eat olives\u2026 I would not let some of those very rich people hold my pint if I had to go and vote while in the bar.\u2019 Instead of the title of her new song, Ariana Grande accidentally got a tattoo that said \u2018small charcoal grill\u2019 in Japanese \u2013 a nightmare only topped by trying to fix it, and then turning it into \u2018barbecue grill finger\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May faced cross-party calls to sack her transport secretary, Chris Grayling, last night, after the calamitous collapse of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract handed to a company with no ships. Senior Tories said the prime minister had turned \u201ca blind eye\u201d to Grayling\u2019s decision to award the \u00a313.8m contract to Seaborne Freight to run ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend, despite widespread derision and accusations that it had been awarded illegally. The collapse of the contract comes amid growing unease in the international business community about Britain\u2019s preparedness for a no-deal outcome, with less than 50 days until Brexit is due to take place. Several MPs suggested Grayling should now consider his position after his department revealed the contract had been cancelled, and Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said the saga would \u201cjust confirm the view of many that this country is in a mess\u201d. Anna Soubry, a former Tory business minister, said Grayling \u201cshould be quietly considering his position\u201d. \u201cChris Grayling holds a critical position in government, trying to mitigate what would be a very serious crisis for the country if we leave the European Union without a deal,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has no grip on the very serious nature of his job. The prime minister should also be considering whether there is not someone else who could do the job better.\u201d Another senior Tory MP said Grayling was a \u201cwalking disaster zone\u201d, adding: \u201cA no-deal Brexit would be a major national crisis and stories like this suggest we have not got the people in place who are capable of responding to it.\u201d Another said: \u201cGrayling never has a grip on the detail, as the Seaborne mess shows. His Heathrow proposal will be just the same but way more costly. The PM just turns a blind eye, for some reason.\u201d Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cWhile Theresa May needs the few friends she has right now, we cannot have this incompetent transport secretary heaping humiliation after humiliation on our country.

      "bodyText": "Often Onstage begins at the end, opening on a stage strewn with five bodies in cod-Shakespearean costumes, plastic swords tucked under arms, paper ruffs askew. No sooner have the house lights gone down than they come back up, as the five members of the all-female theatre/dance/comedy collective Figs in Wigs \u2013 Alice Roots, Sarah Moore, Rachel Gammon, Rachel Porter and Suzanna Hurst \u2013 are resurrected to take their curtain calls, again and again. After the final round of applause has been milked dry, the Figs scatter backstage, returning in lime-green velour leotards and a state of frantic activity. The stage is reset for another piece; their stage manager, Sorcha Stott-Strzala, hands out the programme notes to the audience. Did I say that Often Onstage begins at the end? Correction: it begins 20 minutes into the piece. The enduring appeal of this show, now in its third year, lies in Figs in Wigs\u2019 riotous nose-thumbing at the industry to which they have devoted their energies. \u201cThe UK\u2019s most ignored performance collective\u201d (their words) also ply their self-aware, farcical humour beyond the stage: their website lists every performer\u2019s biography as \u201cBlah blah blah\u2026\u201d; their January appearance at Tate Modern\u2019s Uniqlo Tate Lates saw them running a nail bar. They\u2019ve collaborated with Duckie and LGBTQ+ club night Sink the Pink, with whom they share an exuberant sense of community and knowing theatricality.

The result is another mesmerising and wholly immersive experience from a film-maker whose love of the medium of cinema \u2013 and fierce compassion for Baldwin\u2019s finely drawn characters \u2013 shines through every frame.</p>",

As before, Jenkins invites the audience to look directly into his characters\u2019 eyes, highlighting the sense of connection by stretching and slowing time, taking his lead from the \u201cchopped-and-screwed\u201d beats that have long fascinated this most musical film-maker. Just as the narrative shuffles past and present like cards in a dexterously dealt hand, so Jenkins invites us to focus on the moment, turning seconds into minutes with sensual slow-mo. Meanwhile, Nicholas Britell\u2019s subtly counterintuitive score brushes up against classic vinyl cuts (the ritual of putting on a record is evoked more than once), creating a musical mosaic that both anchors the drama in the here and now while expanding it beyond the specifics of time and place. The result is another mesmerising and wholly immersive experience from a film-maker whose love of the medium of cinema \u2013 and fierce compassion for Baldwin\u2019s finely drawn characters \u2013 shines through every frame.",

      "body": "<p>In the icy depths of late January, just as Theresa May was absorbing the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-suffers-historic-defeat-as-tories-turn-against-her\" title=\"\">parliamentary defeat</a> for her Brexit plan, David Cameron landed in the sunshine of southern India. He had been hired to deliver a lecture on geopolitics, plus a few amusing cricket anecdotes, in Chennai, in honour of the late Indian entrepreneur <a href=\"http://sanmargroup.com/profile.php\" title=\"\">KS Narayanan</a>. The businessman was known in his home country for quitting while he was ahead, retiring at the height of his powers.

In private, it\u2019s not that simple. He may be more sanguine about it than his old friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/31/george-osborne-we-got-things-wrong-in-run-up-to-eu-vote\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a>, but Brexit has divided the Camerons\u2019 social circle just as it has divided the country, and they have not been spared the backlash. One society hostess entertaining the couple recently had to ring fellow guests in advance, checking that they would be able to keep things civil; not all the responses were positive. Even his wife Samantha\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sammacameron/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram feed</a>, devoted mainly to holiday snaps and puffs for her new fashion business, is occasionally invaded by passersby criticising her husband.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the world is moving on without him. Osborne has reinvented himself as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/19/george-osborne-london-evening-standard-government-advertising-spend\" title=\"\">newspaper editor</a>; even Nick Clegg has a swanky new life in California <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/19/facebook-hires-nick-clegg-as-head-of-global-affairs\" title=\"\">working for Facebook</a>. But Cameron seems oddly stuck. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/02/david-camerons-rumoured-return-to-politics-dismays-labour-mps\" title=\"\">Rumours</a> that he fancies coming back as foreign secretary seem wide of the mark, but one old acquaintance describes him as being in an \u201cincredibly reflective and self-searching\u201d mood. \u201cI think this is a really difficult time for him. He\u2019s rethinking the usefulness of his time, all the decisions he made. Look at the Hagues and the Cleggs and the Osbornes, they\u2019re all doing really well, and he\u2019s the odd one out. He\u2019s not been able to carve out a new life.\u201d</p> <p>When in London, his day often starts with a run, after which there might be meetings \u2013 he is <a href=\"https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/about-us/our-organisation/our-president/\" title=\"\">president</a> of the charity Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, works <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/david-cameron-takes-job-with-us-electronic-payments-firm-first-data\" title=\"\">two or three days a month</a> for the US firm First Data Corporation, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/19/aid-fragile-states-david-cameron\" title=\"\">serves on an academic commission</a> on fragile states \u2013 or a gossipy lunch at someone\u2019s club. Weekends are often spent either at the Camerons\u2019 new bolthole in Cornwall or their Oxfordshire constituency home, where he famously installed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/30/downing-street-to-garden-retreat-david-cameron-spends-25000-on-luxury-hut\" title=\"\">chichi revamped shepherd\u2019s hut in which to finish his memoirs</a>. But he lacks a grand purpose. Even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/16/david-cameron-to-lead-750m-uk-china-investment-initiative\" title=\"\">UK-China investment fund</a> he is leading seems unfortunately timed, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/china-slowing-economy-and-inequality-force-new-priorities-for-rulers\" title=\"\">Chinese growth slowing</a> and wariness about Chinese companies being used for political ends.</p> <p>Writing the book has meanwhile forced him to relive painful decisions, and despite predictions that he will use it to settle scores with the likes of former friend Michael Gove, colleagues expect it to be reflective. \u201cI know he\u2019ll be very proud of what he did manage to achieve and I think he\u2019ll put his case across, but you always wonder: \u2018What if I\u2019d done that differently?\u2019\u201d says a former aide. \u201cYou live it over again, and I think he will be quite honest.\u201d</p> <p>For some, Cameron will always be the man who wrecked his country in a clumsy attempt to save his party. At worst, a bad Brexit could break not just the economy, but the union \u2013 giving Scotland new reasons to seek independence, even pushing Northern Irish voters towards unification with the south \u2013 and the political party system, if both Labour and the Tories are punished by voters for enabling it. Even if it somehow miraculously delivers everything leavers promised, Cameron probably won\u2019t get the credit. \u201cIf it\u2019s a success he didn\u2019t want it, and if it\u2019s failure he was the one who didn\u2019t avert it. Brexit is his legacy in the same way Iraq was Blair\u2019s,\u201d says Tim Montgomerie, the pro-leave Conservative commentator.</p> <p>Had Brexit never happened, Cameron would still have bequeathed us the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/27/the-bedroom-tax-explained\" title=\"\">bedroom tax</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/05/1000-sure-start-childrens-centres-may-have-shut-since-2010\" title=\"\">axed Sure Start centres</a>. He would be the man who cut tax credits for the poor while abolishing the 50p tax rate for the wealthiest, left headteachers soliciting donations from parents so they could buy basic supplies, and whose \u201cjobs miracle\u201d (record levels of employment) relied heavily on insecure and part-time work. And his defence for all this \u2013 that without austerity, Britain would have lost its credit rating and faced even more painful cuts \u2013 relies on something that can never be definitively proven. Whatever happened to the 39-year-old who became Conservative leader on a wave of such hope and promise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47f79bad0f79ab009bb320782d593a941eaa1a89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f79bad0f79ab009bb320782d593a941eaa1a89/383_432_3564_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David and Samantha Cameron on holiday in 2013 in Ibiza, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"602\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Chillaxed\u2019: on holiday in 2013 in Ibiza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in 2005, David Cameron embodied everything a party that had lost three elections could want from a leadership candidate: charisma, confidence, and a sense of being at ease with modern Britain. True, he was an Old Etonian. But he was also a father who spent nights sleeping on the floor in A&amp;E, watching over his oldest son, Ivan, who suffered from a rare disorder that would sadly claim his life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/25/ivan-cameron\" title=\"\">at the age of six</a>.

And crucially, in championing it against fierce grassroots opposition Cameron was \u201cputting people before party\u201d, says Boles. It was the opposite of what he would later be accused of doing in the referendum.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My general view of Cameron is that he held every belief fairly lightly\u2026 but that\u2019s perfectly authentically Conservative</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Montgomerie</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boles also singles out the <a href=\"https://www.ncsyes.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Citizen Service</a>, a programme of voluntary work for teenagers which Cameron still chairs, and the academy and free schools programme as progressive achievements (although, for good or ill, academisation began under Tony Blair, and free schools were Michael Gove\u2019s brainchild). Others cite the pledge to raise overseas aid spending to 0.7% of GDP, inherited from his predecessor Michael Howard but adopted by Cameron as a badge of compassionate internationalism despite internal opposition. \u201cHe always believed in the cause, there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d says Andrew Mitchell, his first international development secretary, who recalls \u201csitting and squirming\u201d in cabinet as his budget rose while colleagues all around faced painful cuts.</p> <p>Beyond that, however, the record gets patchier. Military intervention in Libya soon turned sour and a frustrated Cameron couldn\u2019t secure parliamentary consent to intervene in Syria. The two biggest public sector reforms were Andrew Lansley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/20/nhs-reform-health-bill-passes-vote\" title=\"\">structural reorganisation of the NHS</a>, which baffled most people outside the NHS and exasperated many within it, and Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s rolling up of six separate welfare benefits into one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/universal-credit-benefits-scheme-iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">universal credit</a>.

But for Conservatives who view austerity as having been painful but necessary to balance the books, the critique is different.</p> <p>On the right of the party, it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t go far enough or fast enough in eliminating the deficit, missed a golden opportunity to shrink the state permanently, and moved Gove from education before his work was finished. On the Tory left, however, it\u2019s that he gave ministers too much freedom to make mistakes. \u201cHe would intervene if he could see a political car crash actually happening, but [have] very little engagement otherwise,\u201d says one former special adviser in the Cameron government. \u201cIf you look at what Andrew Lansley was doing at health, which was a massive reorganisation that nobody knew about until the last minute, or universal credit, or the education reforms \u2013 whatever their merits or otherwise, Cameron was very disengaged from all of them.\u201d</p> <p>The advantage of that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/11/cameron-daughter-pub-too-chillaxed\" title=\"\">\u201cchillaxed\u201d</a> leadership style is that it arguably helped hold a potentially fractious coalition together. Cameron\u2019s partnership with Clegg survived a full five years at least partly because he was unusually tolerant of dissent and pragmatic about compromises. (Were he still around now, some suspect he\u2019d be rather better than Theresa May at brokering truces between warring Brexit camps.) His early career as a Treasury adviser during the Major years, the last time the Conservative party was this divided over Europe, left him suspicious of ideological purists in general as well as allergic to \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe in particular. He was insistent there was no such thing as Cameronism, that what mattered was what worked.</p> <p>\u201cMy general view of Cameron is that he held every belief fairly lightly. There was nothing very much he really believed passionately in,\u201d says Montgomerie. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s perfectly authentically Conservative, I think pragmatism and not believing in anything in a theological way is actually quite an important Conservative instinct.\u201d But from the beginning, the downside of that flexibility was a willingness to put tactics above strategy.</p> <p>Back in 2005, Cameron was lagging behind David Davis, the initial frontrunner in the leadership race, when he gave a <em>Daily Telegraph </em>interview promising two things that sounded strangely at odds with his modernising agenda. One was tax breaks for marriage, and the second was an obscure hobbyhorse of the Eurosceptic right: taking the Tories out of the centre-right European People\u2019s Party group (EPP) within the European parliament.</p> <p>The latter proposal was \u201centirely cynical\u201d, says one MP who played a prominent role in his leadership campaign: \u201cI\u2019m sure Dave could persuade himself that we should have our own grouping at an intellectual level, but it was a stunt. It didn\u2019t matter to him at all.\u201d But it was an early indicator of willingness to gamble on Europe for short-term gain. Years later, leaving the EPP would arguably make it harder for Cameron to build the goodwill needed when trying to renegotiate Britain\u2019s EU membership.</p> <p>His 2010 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/11/david-cameron-limit-immigration\" title=\"\">manifesto promise</a> to reduce immigration to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d, paving the way for the now infamous hostile environment for immigrants created by his home secretary, Theresa May, in an attempt to meet it, was arguably more sincerely meant. Cameron genuinely believed, says a colleague, that the British people had a \u201cright to know that we understood\u201d their feelings on immigration.</p> <p>But in making the promise, he essentially accepted Ukip\u2019s argument that immigration was too high. Once it was obvious the target couldn\u2019t be met while free movement within the EU existed, what then?</p> <p>Opinion was sharply divided when Cameron began thinking aloud, halfway through his first parliament, about an in-out referendum to settle the Europe question. Andrew Feldman, the party\u2019s co-chairman and a close friend since Oxford, was against; election strategist Lynton Crosby was wary. At a kitchen cabinet meeting to discuss options, Osborne warned that losing would be catastrophic. But Mitchell, by then chief whip, raised a different concern. \u201cGeorge told him not to do it because he might lose. I thought we couldn\u2019t possibly lose, but I told him he shouldn\u2019t do it because he was using a referendum to solve a party management issue,\u201d he recalls. The charge of putting the whole country through the mill to solve an internal Tory psychodrama has been made ever since.</p> <p>Why did Cameron ignore the warnings? In his memoirs he is likely to defend it as democracy in action, giving the people the final say. But it was also surely driven by arithmetic. The splitting of the rightwing vote, with disgruntled Tories defecting to Ukip, had long hampered Conservative leaders but coalition turned a festering problem into an urgent one. Leftwing votes had also been split between two parties but were now consolidating, as Liberal Democrat voters swung to Labour in protest at their party entering coalition. His own backbenchers were jittery, threatening to oust him. If Cameron wanted more than one term in office, he needed those Ukip voters back.</p> <p>Boles is convinced that without promising a referendum in 2015, Cameron would have lost the general election. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way that he could have remained in No 10 in any form, in coalition or in a majority government. It had been building for so long and the Ukip situation was very real.\u201d Tactically it worked, with Cameron becoming the first sitting prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/17/cameron-at-10-the-inside-story-2010-to-2015-anthony-seldon-peter-snowdon-review-authorised-biography\" title=\"\">since Palmerston</a> to increase both his vote share and number of seats held. Yet, in seeking to ward off what he saw as the socialist threat from Ed Miliband, he unleashed a chain of events that may yet make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.</p> <p>Cameron appears to have seen the referendum primarily as a safety valve, a means of releasing pent-up rightwing urges relatively harmlessly before getting on with what he regarded as the real business of the second term: returning to the themes that originally won him the Tory leadership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96ae9b66364eb23c9121f9acff9d318f41c81027\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ae9b66364eb23c9121f9acff9d318f41c81027/0_331_3142_1885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron at an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron at an EU summit in Brussels, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortly after the 2015 election, he asked the Downing Street policy unit to draw up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/cameron-pushes-for-trident-and-life-chances-plan-at-last-cabinet-meeting\" title=\"\">\u201clife chances\u201d agenda</a>, envisaged as a way of bringing the party back together after the referendum. The strategy was designed to improve poorer children\u2019s future prospects by investing in the early years, helping families at key transition times during childhood and into adulthood, and tackling social issues such as addiction. Having already decided to quit before the 2020 election to spend more time with Samantha and their three surviving children, Cameron wanted to focus in his final years on becoming the social reformer he had always intended. The dream was to go out on a high having lanced the Europe boil, belatedly balanced the national books and returned to the sunlit uplands of his early vision.</p> <p>Christian Guy was <a href=\"https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/leader-column/christian-guy-joins-prime-ministers-downing-street-team\" title=\"\">brought into Downing Street</a> to work on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/11/david-cameron-no-conflict-improving-lives-cutting-benefits-poverty\" title=\"\">life chances programme</a> from the Centre for Social Justice, a thinktank set up by Iain Duncan Smith that, in opposition, had taken Cameron on tours of the kind of deprived neighbourhoods Tory leaders rarely visited. \u201cI think he met people that really moved him, and his eyes were opened to what was really going on. His instinct was to reform and change,\u201d Guy recalls. \u201cI never saw the Cameron that was all \u2018steady as she goes\u2019. He\u2019d get frustrated with people who would kick things into the long grass.\u201d</p> <p>There was some scepticism within Cameron\u2019s inner circle about all this, partly because the intended beneficiaries were considered unlikely to vote Tory. But it appealed to Cameron\u2019s sense of moral decency, building on his earlier notion of creating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/19/david-cameron-big-society-launch\" title=\"\">\u201cbig society\u201d</a> \u2013 in which people recognised their responsibilities towards the less fortunate \u2013 which had fizzled out for lack of concrete ideas. As Guy puts it: \u201cDeficit reduction he always felt was his duty, but the moral mission was social reform. Europe was something he just wanted to get out of the way so he could do these social reforms.\u201d</p> <p>Had he won the referendum, it\u2019s by no means guaranteed that Cameron would have got the chance. The jockeying for succession had begun the moment he admitted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/24/david-cameron-prime-minister-leadership-challenge-conservatives-election-warning\" title=\"\">in March 2015</a>, that he wouldn\u2019t stand for a third term; even before the referendum, Boris Johnson\u2019s supporters were boasting of submitting letters to the 1922 committee urging a leadership contest. If he\u2019d won the EU vote, the right might still have come for him, triggering a contest that Johnson could well have won. \u201cBoris\u2019s great mistake was to win the referendum, in a way,\u201d says Boles.</p> <p>But the fact that he was already in a tight corner may have helped convince Cameron he had nothing to lose from a referendum. As Guy points out, his instinct was usually to confront an argument head on. \u201cOther politicians at a time of crisis would duck out of view; he used to come in fired up. He had that ability \u2013 in party conference, in cabinet, in places where they frankly wanted to string him up \u2013 to lead.\u201d</p> <p>Others take a less flattering view. \u201cIt was arrogance, I\u2019m afraid, which has been his fatal flaw throughout his career: \u2018Leave it to me, I\u2019ll pull it off,\u2019 sort of thing, because that had seen him through the Scottish referendum [on independence]. He wanted to get it out of the way and get back to governing,\u201d says a longstanding ally. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he ever thought he would definitely win, but he just had that fundamental presumption that he was better than his opponents.\u201d In his impatience to get on with it, however, Cameron spent far too little time rolling the pitch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f74ce576bd74650a4008396ae458e634abe8b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f74ce576bd74650a4008396ae458e634abe8b44/0_181_2984_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron drinks beer with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a pub in the town of Princes Risborough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron drinks beer with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a village pub in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, October 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the recent BBC documentary series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/28/inside-europe-10-years-of-turmoil-review-the-road-to-brexit\" title=\"\">Inside Europe</a></em>, Downing Street policy adviser Mats Persson recalled proposing a 2017 referendum to Cameron, only for the latter\u2019s chief of staff to argue that if they left it that long Cameron would be \u201ctired\u201d of the issue by then. So it was pencilled in for 2016, leaving far too little time to overturn decades of British governments portraying Brussels as an enemy requiring handbagging into submission.</p> <p>Before Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/ireland-votes-by-landslide-to-legalise-abortion\" title=\"\">referendum</a> on repealing the abortion ban, the government published specific proposals for replacing it and held citizens\u2019 meetings exploring the issue in detail. The referendum itself was bitterly fought, but voters largely understood what they were being asked and what might happen next.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s preparations, meanwhile, consisted of demanding concessions on immigration from Brussels which were refused, only reinforcing Eurosceptic voters\u2019 sense of powerlessness. He failed to grasp how many Labour voters would see the referendum as a chance to hit back at the man who inflicted austerity on them. And he made far too few contingency plans for losing, leaving Whitehall exposed to a crisis for which it was woefully underprepared. On 24 June, the man who defined himself in opposition to the ideological wing of his party was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union\" title=\"\">duly beaten</a> by it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2016/sep/12/david-cameron-stands-down-mp-political-career-picture-gallery\">David Cameron - a political career in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cameron was criticised for not staying on to help clean up the mess, but the consensus inside Downing Street was that it would be counter-productive. \u201cHe emailed me and said: \u2018I\u2019ve thought about it and my heart isn\u2019t in what we are going to have to do,\u2019\u201d recalls Christian Guy. \u201cHe would have had no authority, or mandate within the EU.\u201d He resolved from the start not to meddle publicly in his successor\u2019s handling of Brexit, delaying publication of his memoirs until this autumn lest he be seen as a backseat driver. But according to his former press secretary, Craig Oliver, he privately favours the soft Norway-style arrangement \u2013 outside the EU, but staying in the single market \u2013 championed by Boles and Cameron\u2019s former policy chief, Oliver Letwin. At the time of writing, it looks as if he may be disappointed there too.</p> <p>For his friends, the ignominiously abrupt end to Cameron\u2019s political career represents a tragic waste of promise, a story of noble intent derailed by an economic crisis and Conservative neurosis over Europe as much as by his own flaws. Yet others will see an epic misjudgment rivalling Blair\u2019s over Iraq, but without Blair\u2019s redeeming record of prior achievements; a leader who thought he had transformed his party, only for it to turn on him. Cameron always was a gifted communicator. But if his memoirs are to shift that verdict, he may need to be a better writer than he was a politician.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the icy depths of late January, just as Theresa May was absorbing the latest parliamentary defeat for her Brexit plan, David Cameron landed in the sunshine of southern India. He had been hired to deliver a lecture on geopolitics, plus a few amusing cricket anecdotes, in Chennai, in honour of the late Indian entrepreneur KS Narayanan. The businessman was known in his home country for quitting while he was ahead, retiring at the height of his powers. Cameron, however, is better known for doing the opposite. The official line is that the man who brought us Brexit, and then walked away whistling from his final farewell to the nation, has no regrets; that all will explained in the memoirs he is due to publish later this year, and that meanwhile he is enjoying an agreeable retirement on the international speaking circuit. In private, it\u2019s not that simple. He may be more sanguine about it than his old friend George Osborne, but Brexit has divided the Camerons\u2019 social circle just as it has divided the country, and they have not been spared the backlash. One society hostess entertaining the couple recently had to ring fellow guests in advance, checking that they would be able to keep things civil; not all the responses were positive. Even his wife Samantha\u2019s Instagram feed, devoted mainly to holiday snaps and puffs for her new fashion business, is occasionally invaded by passersby criticising her husband. Meanwhile, the world is moving on without him. Osborne has reinvented himself as a newspaper editor; even Nick Clegg has a swanky new life in California working for Facebook. But Cameron seems oddly stuck. Rumours that he fancies coming back as foreign secretary seem wide of the mark, but one old acquaintance describes him as being in an \u201cincredibly reflective and self-searching\u201d mood. \u201cI think this is a really difficult time for him. He\u2019s rethinking the usefulness of his time, all the decisions he made. Look at the Hagues and the Cleggs and the Osbornes, they\u2019re all doing really well, and he\u2019s the odd one out. He\u2019s not been able to carve out a new life.\u201d When in London, his day often starts with a run, after which there might be meetings \u2013 he is president of the charity Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, works two or three days a month for the US firm First Data Corporation, and serves on an academic commission on fragile states \u2013 or a gossipy lunch at someone\u2019s club. Weekends are often spent either at the Camerons\u2019 new bolthole in Cornwall or their Oxfordshire constituency home, where he famously installed a chichi revamped shepherd\u2019s hut in which to finish his memoirs. But he lacks a grand purpose. Even the UK-China investment fund he is leading seems unfortunately timed, with Chinese growth slowing and wariness about Chinese companies being used for political ends. Writing the book has meanwhile forced him to relive painful decisions, and despite predictions that he will use it to settle scores with the likes of former friend Michael Gove, colleagues expect it to be reflective. \u201cI know he\u2019ll be very proud of what he did manage to achieve and I think he\u2019ll put his case across, but you always wonder: \u2018What if I\u2019d done that differently?\u2019\u201d says a former aide. \u201cYou live it over again, and I think he will be quite honest.\u201d For some, Cameron will always be the man who wrecked his country in a clumsy attempt to save his party. At worst, a bad Brexit could break not just the economy, but the union \u2013 giving Scotland new reasons to seek independence, even pushing Northern Irish voters towards unification with the south \u2013 and the political party system, if both Labour and the Tories are punished by voters for enabling it. Even if it somehow miraculously delivers everything leavers promised, Cameron probably won\u2019t get the credit. \u201cIf it\u2019s a success he didn\u2019t want it, and if it\u2019s failure he was the one who didn\u2019t avert it. Brexit is his legacy in the same way Iraq was Blair\u2019s,\u201d says Tim Montgomerie, the pro-leave Conservative commentator. Had Brexit never happened, Cameron would still have bequeathed us the bedroom tax and axed Sure Start centres. He would be the man who cut tax credits for the poor while abolishing the 50p tax rate for the wealthiest, left headteachers soliciting donations from parents so they could buy basic supplies, and whose \u201cjobs miracle\u201d (record levels of employment) relied heavily on insecure and part-time work. And his defence for all this \u2013 that without austerity, Britain would have lost its credit rating and faced even more painful cuts \u2013 relies on something that can never be definitively proven. Whatever happened to the 39-year-old who became Conservative leader on a wave of such hope and promise? Back in 2005, David Cameron embodied everything a party that had lost three elections could want from a leadership candidate: charisma, confidence, and a sense of being at ease with modern Britain. True, he was an Old Etonian. But he was also a father who spent nights sleeping on the floor in A&amp;E, watching over his oldest son, Ivan, who suffered from a rare disorder that would sadly claim his life at the age of six. This Cameron argued earnestly for more understanding of young offenders, and demonstrated his eco-credentials by posing with huskies in the Arctic. Yet much of that turned to slush when he entered Downing Street in 2010. The man who evangelised about \u201csharing the proceeds of growth\u201d so everyone benefited from rising prosperity found himself in the aftermath of a banking crash with no growth to share. A leader temperamentally suited to good times would wield the axe instead. Hints of the old sunny Cameron still surfaced periodically. For Nick Boles, a founding member of the \u201cNotting Hill set\u201d of socially liberal conservatives around Cameron, the legalisation of gay marriage in 2013 was \u201cthe high watermark\u201d of modernisation in office. \u201cIt was sort of classic Dave, in that it was a liberal progressive and even radical move that involved extending one of the most conservative and traditional institutions around,\u201d recalls Boles, who as an equalities minister helped steer the legislation and later used it to marry his own partner. \u201cAnd it rang true because he was the most uxorious person I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019ve never seen somebody so totally, utterly in love with his wife, who felt marriage was the best thing that ever happened to him. It was genuine, it wasn\u2019t calculation.\u201d It changed minds, as well as lives. And crucially, in championing it against fierce grassroots opposition Cameron was \u201cputting people before party\u201d, says Boles. It was the opposite of what he would later be accused of doing in the referendum. Boles also singles out the National Citizen Service, a programme of voluntary work for teenagers which Cameron still chairs, and the academy and free schools programme as progressive achievements (although, for good or ill, academisation began under Tony Blair, and free schools were Michael Gove\u2019s brainchild). Others cite the pledge to raise overseas aid spending to 0.7% of GDP, inherited from his predecessor Michael Howard but adopted by Cameron as a badge of compassionate internationalism despite internal opposition. \u201cHe always believed in the cause, there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d says Andrew Mitchell, his first international development secretary, who recalls \u201csitting and squirming\u201d in cabinet as his budget rose while colleagues all around faced painful cuts. Beyond that, however, the record gets patchier. Military intervention in Libya soon turned sour and a frustrated Cameron couldn\u2019t secure parliamentary consent to intervene in Syria. The two biggest public sector reforms were Andrew Lansley\u2019s structural reorganisation of the NHS, which baffled most people outside the NHS and exasperated many within it, and Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s rolling up of six separate welfare benefits into one universal credit. The latter is now a byword for bureaucratic incompetence and unintended cruelty, inextricably linked in the public mind with food bank use, rent arrears and evictions; Duncan Smith himself eventually resigned over cuts to disability benefit, saying the project had been scuppered by insufficient resources. For many Labour voters, the welfare reforms alone would be damning. But for Conservatives who view austerity as having been painful but necessary to balance the books, the critique is different. On the right of the party, it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t go far enough or fast enough in eliminating the deficit, missed a golden opportunity to shrink the state permanently, and moved Gove from education before his work was finished. On the Tory left, however, it\u2019s that he gave ministers too much freedom to make mistakes. \u201cHe would intervene if he could see a political car crash actually happening, but [have] very little engagement otherwise,\u201d says one former special adviser in the Cameron government. \u201cIf you look at what Andrew Lansley was doing at health, which was a massive reorganisation that nobody knew about until the last minute, or universal credit, or the education reforms \u2013 whatever their merits or otherwise, Cameron was very disengaged from all of them.\u201d The advantage of that \u201cchillaxed\u201d leadership style is that it arguably helped hold a potentially fractious coalition together. Cameron\u2019s partnership with Clegg survived a full five years at least partly because he was unusually tolerant of dissent and pragmatic about compromises. (Were he still around now, some suspect he\u2019d be rather better than Theresa May at brokering truces between warring Brexit camps.) His early career as a Treasury adviser during the Major years, the last time the Conservative party was this divided over Europe, left him suspicious of ideological purists in general as well as allergic to \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe in particular. He was insistent there was no such thing as Cameronism, that what mattered was what worked. \u201cMy general view of Cameron is that he held every belief fairly lightly. There was nothing very much he really believed passionately in,\u201d says Montgomerie. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s perfectly authentically Conservative, I think pragmatism and not believing in anything in a theological way is actually quite an important Conservative instinct.\u201d But from the beginning, the downside of that flexibility was a willingness to put tactics above strategy. Back in 2005, Cameron was lagging behind David Davis, the initial frontrunner in the leadership race, when he gave a Daily Telegraph interview promising two things that sounded strangely at odds with his modernising agenda. One was tax breaks for marriage, and the second was an obscure hobbyhorse of the Eurosceptic right: taking the Tories out of the centre-right European People\u2019s Party group (EPP) within the European parliament. The latter proposal was \u201centirely cynical\u201d, says one MP who played a prominent role in his leadership campaign: \u201cI\u2019m sure Dave could persuade himself that we should have our own grouping at an intellectual level, but it was a stunt. It didn\u2019t matter to him at all.\u201d But it was an early indicator of willingness to gamble on Europe for short-term gain. Years later, leaving the EPP would arguably make it harder for Cameron to build the goodwill needed when trying to renegotiate Britain\u2019s EU membership. His 2010 manifesto promise to reduce immigration to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d, paving the way for the now infamous hostile environment for immigrants created by his home secretary, Theresa May, in an attempt to meet it, was arguably more sincerely meant. Cameron genuinely believed, says a colleague, that the British people had a \u201cright to know that we understood\u201d their feelings on immigration. But in making the promise, he essentially accepted Ukip\u2019s argument that immigration was too high. Once it was obvious the target couldn\u2019t be met while free movement within the EU existed, what then? Opinion was sharply divided when Cameron began thinking aloud, halfway through his first parliament, about an in-out referendum to settle the Europe question. Andrew Feldman, the party\u2019s co-chairman and a close friend since Oxford, was against; election strategist Lynton Crosby was wary. At a kitchen cabinet meeting to discuss options, Osborne warned that losing would be catastrophic. But Mitchell, by then chief whip, raised a different concern. \u201cGeorge told him not to do it because he might lose. I thought we couldn\u2019t possibly lose, but I told him he shouldn\u2019t do it because he was using a referendum to solve a party management issue,\u201d he recalls. The charge of putting the whole country through the mill to solve an internal Tory psychodrama has been made ever since. Why did Cameron ignore the warnings? In his memoirs he is likely to defend it as democracy in action, giving the people the final say. But it was also surely driven by arithmetic. The splitting of the rightwing vote, with disgruntled Tories defecting to Ukip, had long hampered Conservative leaders but coalition turned a festering problem into an urgent one. Leftwing votes had also been split between two parties but were now consolidating, as Liberal Democrat voters swung to Labour in protest at their party entering coalition. His own backbenchers were jittery, threatening to oust him. If Cameron wanted more than one term in office, he needed those Ukip voters back. Boles is convinced that without promising a referendum in 2015, Cameron would have lost the general election. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way that he could have remained in No 10 in any form, in coalition or in a majority government. It had been building for so long and the Ukip situation was very real.\u201d Tactically it worked, with Cameron becoming the first sitting prime minister since Palmerston to increase both his vote share and number of seats held. Yet, in seeking to ward off what he saw as the socialist threat from Ed Miliband, he unleashed a chain of events that may yet make Jeremy Corbyn prime minister. Cameron appears to have seen the referendum primarily as a safety valve, a means of releasing pent-up rightwing urges relatively harmlessly before getting on with what he regarded as the real business of the second term: returning to the themes that originally won him the Tory leadership. Shortly after the 2015 election, he asked the Downing Street policy unit to draw up a \u201clife chances\u201d agenda, envisaged as a way of bringing the party back together after the referendum. The strategy was designed to improve poorer children\u2019s future prospects by investing in the early years, helping families at key transition times during childhood and into adulthood, and tackling social issues such as addiction. Having already decided to quit before the 2020 election to spend more time with Samantha and their three surviving children, Cameron wanted to focus in his final years on becoming the social reformer he had always intended. The dream was to go out on a high having lanced the Europe boil, belatedly balanced the national books and returned to the sunlit uplands of his early vision. Christian Guy was brought into Downing Street to work on the life chances programme from the Centre for Social Justice, a thinktank set up by Iain Duncan Smith that, in opposition, had taken Cameron on tours of the kind of deprived neighbourhoods Tory leaders rarely visited. \u201cI think he met people that really moved him, and his eyes were opened to what was really going on. His instinct was to reform and change,\u201d Guy recalls. \u201cI never saw the Cameron that was all \u2018steady as she goes\u2019. He\u2019d get frustrated with people who would kick things into the long grass.\u201d There was some scepticism within Cameron\u2019s inner circle about all this, partly because the intended beneficiaries were considered unlikely to vote Tory. But it appealed to Cameron\u2019s sense of moral decency, building on his earlier notion of creating a \u201cbig society\u201d \u2013 in which people recognised their responsibilities towards the less fortunate \u2013 which had fizzled out for lack of concrete ideas. As Guy puts it: \u201cDeficit reduction he always felt was his duty, but the moral mission was social reform. Europe was something he just wanted to get out of the way so he could do these social reforms.\u201d Had he won the referendum, it\u2019s by no means guaranteed that Cameron would have got the chance. The jockeying for succession had begun the moment he admitted, in March 2015, that he wouldn\u2019t stand for a third term; even before the referendum, Boris Johnson\u2019s supporters were boasting of submitting letters to the 1922 committee urging a leadership contest. If he\u2019d won the EU vote, the right might still have come for him, triggering a contest that Johnson could well have won. \u201cBoris\u2019s great mistake was to win the referendum, in a way,\u201d says Boles. But the fact that he was already in a tight corner may have helped convince Cameron he had nothing to lose from a referendum. As Guy points out, his instinct was usually to confront an argument head on. \u201cOther politicians at a time of crisis would duck out of view; he used to come in fired up. He had that ability \u2013 in party conference, in cabinet, in places where they frankly wanted to string him up \u2013 to lead.\u201d Others take a less flattering view. \u201cIt was arrogance, I\u2019m afraid, which has been his fatal flaw throughout his career: \u2018Leave it to me, I\u2019ll pull it off,\u2019 sort of thing, because that had seen him through the Scottish referendum [on independence]. He wanted to get it out of the way and get back to governing,\u201d says a longstanding ally. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he ever thought he would definitely win, but he just had that fundamental presumption that he was better than his opponents.\u201d In his impatience to get on with it, however, Cameron spent far too little time rolling the pitch. In the recent BBC documentary series Inside Europe, Downing Street policy adviser Mats Persson recalled proposing a 2017 referendum to Cameron, only for the latter\u2019s chief of staff to argue that if they left it that long Cameron would be \u201ctired\u201d of the issue by then. So it was pencilled in for 2016, leaving far too little time to overturn decades of British governments portraying Brussels as an enemy requiring handbagging into submission. Before Ireland\u2019s referendum on repealing the abortion ban, the government published specific proposals for replacing it and held citizens\u2019 meetings exploring the issue in detail. The referendum itself was bitterly fought, but voters largely understood what they were being asked and what might happen next. Cameron\u2019s preparations, meanwhile, consisted of demanding concessions on immigration from Brussels which were refused, only reinforcing Eurosceptic voters\u2019 sense of powerlessness. He failed to grasp how many Labour voters would see the referendum as a chance to hit back at the man who inflicted austerity on them. And he made far too few contingency plans for losing, leaving Whitehall exposed to a crisis for which it was woefully underprepared. On 24 June, the man who defined himself in opposition to the ideological wing of his party was duly beaten by it. Cameron was criticised for not staying on to help clean up the mess, but the consensus inside Downing Street was that it would be counter-productive. \u201cHe emailed me and said: \u2018I\u2019ve thought about it and my heart isn\u2019t in what we are going to have to do,\u2019\u201d recalls Christian Guy. \u201cHe would have had no authority, or mandate within the EU.\u201d He resolved from the start not to meddle publicly in his successor\u2019s handling of Brexit, delaying publication of his memoirs until this autumn lest he be seen as a backseat driver. But according to his former press secretary, Craig Oliver, he privately favours the soft Norway-style arrangement \u2013 outside the EU, but staying in the single market \u2013 championed by Boles and Cameron\u2019s former policy chief, Oliver Letwin. At the time of writing, it looks as if he may be disappointed there too. For his friends, the ignominiously abrupt end to Cameron\u2019s political career represents a tragic waste of promise, a story of noble intent derailed by an economic crisis and Conservative neurosis over Europe as much as by his own flaws. Yet others will see an epic misjudgment rivalling Blair\u2019s over Iraq, but without Blair\u2019s redeeming record of prior achievements; a leader who thought he had transformed his party, only for it to turn on him. Cameron always was a gifted communicator. But if his memoirs are to shift that verdict, he may need to be a better writer than he was a politician.",

      "body": "<p>It is hard to imagine a more effective political novel than <strong><a href=\"https://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/noughts-and-crosses\" title=\"\">Noughts &amp; Crosses</a></strong>. Or one that is so naturally dramatic. Strongly visual and action driven, the first book in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/14/review-noughts-and-crosses-malorie-blackman\" title=\"\">Malorie Blackman\u2019s 2001 series</a> for young adults rips across the stage in Esther Richardson\u2019s production. Often described as dystopian, it shows us the present tilted; the modern world turned inside out, upside down. Us, now, caught unawares.</p> <p>Blackman has said that she was driven to write the book by the \u201cburning anger\u201d she felt at the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence,</a> and the mishandling of the inquiry. Lit up by this anger, her fictional world is harshly divided between two segregated groups: the Noughts, who are white, and the Crosses, who are black. It is the Crosses who are in charge. Repressively. They go to exclusive schools, run the judiciary, are dominant in the reporting of news, and have a special jeering word for the Noughts: \u201cblankers\u201d. Two teenagers from opposite sides of this divide fall in love.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/19/sabrina-mahfouz-interview-noughts-and-crosses-emma-watson\" title=\"\">Sabrina Mahfouz</a> has written a forceful adaptation for <a href=\"https://www.pilot-theatre.com/\" title=\"\">Pilot</a>, the York-based touring company that specialises in staging work for younger audiences. She has been true to the quality of Blackman\u2019s interesting central relationship, which is not at all soppy but inquisitive, confrontational and sexy: Heather Agyepong and Billy Harris are both edgy and vibrant, and Kimisha Lewis beautifully sassy and sardonic as an unsupportive elder sister. </p> <p>Mahfouz has also captured an extraordinary amount of the high-voltage action: suicide, public hanging, political activism, abduction, body dysmorphia, bombing. Richardson\u2019s production tears along in a fiery red box: in a further twist on the play\u2019s refocusing of the way we see things, Simon Kenny has based his design on those infra-red photographs of cities in which all greenery registers as scarlet.</p> <p>A few bumps could be smoothed: there is some confusing double-casting (parents morph into terrorists) and unnecessary waving of chairs in the air to show revolt and disorder. But at a schools\u2019 matinee you could have followed the plot from the audience\u2019s explosive responses: gasps (at a slap), whistles at kissing, utter silence as a noose tightens.</p> <p>London is used to Chekhov that snarls as well as sighs. Yet even veteranovs of the Young Vic\u2019s revolutionary productions may be shaken and stirred by Vladimir Mirzoev\u2019s staging of <strong><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/moscow-pushkin-drama-theatre-the-cherry-orchard\" title=\"\">The Cherry Orchard </a></strong>for the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre.</p> <p>Samovars and silver birches are banished: with them go dapple, murmur and lassitude. The dynamic, as well as texture, is changed. With a landed class about to be swept away by a thrusting new commercialism, everyone is awry, everything disjointed. The stage slopes; the lighting is chilly; actors often move like marionettes; the palette is subdued \u2013 shades of grey and khaki, with a splash of lavender in the dress of the marvellous Victoria Isakova. Some of this is stock stage code for \u201cunsettling\u201d; some touches \u2013 an orchard of blood bags \u2013 are look-at-me effects. And for non-Russian speakers an inadvertent weirdness is added by skewiff surtitles: what does \u201cQuite a pippin, aren\u2019t you?\u201d mean?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9aa57fb7f3b5af7438ff5955200224b4c87424e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9aa57fb7f3b5af7438ff5955200224b4c87424e8/0_335_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Isakova and Aleksander Petrov in a subdued Cherry Orchard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Isakova and Aleksander Petrov in the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre\u2019s The Cherry Orchard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Yocu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet there is nothing imported and everything important in the central idea of this as a drama of strangeness as well as sadness. It is, after all, the play where a man wanders around potting imaginary billiard balls and makes a solemn address to a bookcase. It is also the play that features one of my dramatic heroines, a completely distinctive figure. As Charlotta, the governess who does magic tricks, Vera Voronkova wheels across the stage with baggy trousers and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struwwelpeter\" title=\"\">Struwwelpeter hair</a>; her part is highlighted, and she is, unusually, present at the closing moments. She, who does not know where she comes from, or how old she is, becomes a nonchalant commentary on the characters\u2019 preoccupation with property and family. Even the smallest role in Chekhov can irradiate, as Mirzoev\u2019s production shows incisively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae9e643cf78d1c9a99f79ce406cd8aa6cf0d822d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9e643cf78d1c9a99f79ce406cd8aa6cf0d822d/0_0_5925_3950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adrian Lester and Katy Sullivan in Cost of Living.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Exceptional moments\u2019: Adrian Lester and Katy Sullivan in Cost of Living.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2019/cost-of-living/\" title=\"\">Cost of Living</a></strong> is the 100th premiere in Edward Hall\u2019s audience-restoring, American-leaning Hampstead reign. The play won Martyna Majok the 2018 Pulitzer prize for drama, and Hall\u2019s precise, warm production suggests why. At its centre are a man with cerebral palsy and a quadriplegic woman. Majok specifies that these characters be played by \u201cdisabled actors\u201d, as they are, strongly, by Jack Hunter, an enigmatic professor, and paralympian Katy Sullivan, rasping with fury.</p> <p>Yet this is a play not only about the wheelchair users, but also about those who are dubbed \u201ccarers\u201d, coping with grief and with daily life in a harsh social climate. This yields a variety of exceptional moments. Adrian Lester, who conveys with beautiful economy a man both pent-up and reaching out, tends his ex-wife, paralysed after an accident, as she lies in the bath.

      "bodyText": "It is hard to imagine a more effective political novel than Noughts &amp; Crosses. Or one that is so naturally dramatic. Strongly visual and action driven, the first book in Malorie Blackman\u2019s 2001 series for young adults rips across the stage in Esther Richardson\u2019s production. Often described as dystopian, it shows us the present tilted; the modern world turned inside out, upside down. Us, now, caught unawares. Blackman has said that she was driven to write the book by the \u201cburning anger\u201d she felt at the death of Stephen Lawrence, and the mishandling of the inquiry. Lit up by this anger, her fictional world is harshly divided between two segregated groups: the Noughts, who are white, and the Crosses, who are black. It is the Crosses who are in charge. Repressively. They go to exclusive schools, run the judiciary, are dominant in the reporting of news, and have a special jeering word for the Noughts: \u201cblankers\u201d. Two teenagers from opposite sides of this divide fall in love. Sabrina Mahfouz has written a forceful adaptation for Pilot, the York-based touring company that specialises in staging work for younger audiences. She has been true to the quality of Blackman\u2019s interesting central relationship, which is not at all soppy but inquisitive, confrontational and sexy: Heather Agyepong and Billy Harris are both edgy and vibrant, and Kimisha Lewis beautifully sassy and sardonic as an unsupportive elder sister. Mahfouz has also captured an extraordinary amount of the high-voltage action: suicide, public hanging, political activism, abduction, body dysmorphia, bombing. Richardson\u2019s production tears along in a fiery red box: in a further twist on the play\u2019s refocusing of the way we see things, Simon Kenny has based his design on those infra-red photographs of cities in which all greenery registers as scarlet. A few bumps could be smoothed: there is some confusing double-casting (parents morph into terrorists) and unnecessary waving of chairs in the air to show revolt and disorder. But at a schools\u2019 matinee you could have followed the plot from the audience\u2019s explosive responses: gasps (at a slap), whistles at kissing, utter silence as a noose tightens. London is used to Chekhov that snarls as well as sighs. Yet even veteranovs of the Young Vic\u2019s revolutionary productions may be shaken and stirred by Vladimir Mirzoev\u2019s staging of The Cherry Orchard for the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre. Samovars and silver birches are banished: with them go dapple, murmur and lassitude. The dynamic, as well as texture, is changed. With a landed class about to be swept away by a thrusting new commercialism, everyone is awry, everything disjointed. The stage slopes; the lighting is chilly; actors often move like marionettes; the palette is subdued \u2013 shades of grey and khaki, with a splash of lavender in the dress of the marvellous Victoria Isakova. Some of this is stock stage code for \u201cunsettling\u201d; some touches \u2013 an orchard of blood bags \u2013 are look-at-me effects. And for non-Russian speakers an inadvertent weirdness is added by skewiff surtitles: what does \u201cQuite a pippin, aren\u2019t you?\u201d mean? Yet there is nothing imported and everything important in the central idea of this as a drama of strangeness as well as sadness. It is, after all, the play where a man wanders around potting imaginary billiard balls and makes a solemn address to a bookcase. It is also the play that features one of my dramatic heroines, a completely distinctive figure. As Charlotta, the governess who does magic tricks, Vera Voronkova wheels across the stage with baggy trousers and Struwwelpeter hair; her part is highlighted, and she is, unusually, present at the closing moments. She, who does not know where she comes from, or how old she is, becomes a nonchalant commentary on the characters\u2019 preoccupation with property and family. Even the smallest role in Chekhov can irradiate, as Mirzoev\u2019s production shows incisively. Cost of Living is the 100th premiere in Edward Hall\u2019s audience-restoring, American-leaning Hampstead reign. The play won Martyna Majok the 2018 Pulitzer prize for drama, and Hall\u2019s precise, warm production suggests why. At its centre are a man with cerebral palsy and a quadriplegic woman. Majok specifies that these characters be played by \u201cdisabled actors\u201d, as they are, strongly, by Jack Hunter, an enigmatic professor, and paralympian Katy Sullivan, rasping with fury. Yet this is a play not only about the wheelchair users, but also about those who are dubbed \u201ccarers\u201d, coping with grief and with daily life in a harsh social climate. This yields a variety of exceptional moments. Adrian Lester, who conveys with beautiful economy a man both pent-up and reaching out, tends his ex-wife, paralysed after an accident, as she lies in the bath. He lays one of her arms along the rim of the bath and gently runs his fingers along it, as if on a keyboard, sharing a song. Emily Barber, wary and hyper-alert, explains to the professor she has come to help that she has never worked with \u201cthe differently abled\u201d. He responds smartly that her language is \u201cfucking retarded\u201d. However, the play drifts from moment to moment, its strands never tightly intertwined. It gleams rather than grips. Star ratings (out of five) Noughts and Crosses \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Cherry Orchard \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Cost of Living \u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2022 Noughts and Crosses is at the Derby theatre until 16 February, and then on tour until 11 May \u2022 Cost of Living is at Hampstead theatre until 9 March",

This is a story we want to tell,\u201d he said at a press conference where examples of said curvaceous women were paraded.</p> <p>Obviously, Kiwanda has never been a curvaceous woman, or any other kind of woman, in Uganda.

Perhaps his campaign would have been about making the streets safe for female tourists, who are particular targets for heckling. In one case a German woman was raped by the rider of a <em>boda boda</em> (motorcycle taxi).</p> <p>If Kiwanda and the government he works for really cared about women\u2019s stories, another woman would not have been murdered last month. Police would not have failed to investigate the murders of the dozens of women kidnapped last year \u2013 resulting in the release of suspects for lack of evidence. It would be clear to them that the evil spirit behind laws that seek to punish women deemed indecently dressed in government offices or on the streets is the same spirit that fuels rapes and killings. And they certainly would not be trying to trade women\u2019s bodies \u2013 which they have long considered too sexy, provocative or deserving of abuse \u2013 for foreign currency.</p> <p>At first Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, said he understood the concept of Miss Curvy, insisting that it was no different from any other beauty pageant. Later, however, he distanced himself from it. \u201cThis was not a cabinet decision. People should not come here to see women. I do not like the idea that we are marketing our women for tourism.\u201d</p> <p>And religious leaders including Simon Lokodo \u2013 a former minister of ethics and former priest who is at the forefront of a witch hunt for gay people and \u201cindecent\u201d women \u2013 also spoke out against the pageant.</p> <p>\u201cThis thing they are doing is very bad for the country. Uganda is a moral country. We have so many things we can use instead of women\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>When your enemies start to fight on your side, you must watch them very closely. The women\u2019s rights movement should not be so quick to embrace Lokodo, Museveni and the religious leaders who find Miss Curvy despicable but stay silent when a woman is undressed on the street while men cheer. It is confusing to see the leader of a government where women are stopped from entering ministries and parliament if they are deemed too \u201csexy\u201d now say that he is against the objectification of women.</p> <p>A closer look at the reasons why government and religious leaders are against the Miss Curvy pageant suggests that they are more angry that the moral fabric of the country is being assaulted than concerned about the women exposed to harassment and abuse.</p> <p>Tourism brings in about $1.4bn to Uganda annually \u2013 nearly 10% of GDP. However, its poor governance and human rights record has stifled its potential for tourism, and the country\u2019s profile is dwarfed by neighbours Kenya and Rwanda.</p> <p>Uganda has ambitious development goals, including becoming a middle-income country by 2020. Attracting revenue at the expense of women\u2019s dignity is perhaps part of the plan.</p> <p>The women who turned up for Miss Curvy say they are happy to be tourist attractions and make money at the same time. What they do not realise is that the system will be designed so that they receive only crumbs.</p> <p>And, once again, the only winners will be the men who think a woman\u2019s body is a source of vulgarity and distraction \u2013 unless, of course, that body is being used for the benefit of a man, whether it be the man holding political office, the man grappling her on the street, or the abusive man in her home.</p>",

I do not like the idea that we are marketing our women for tourism.\u201d And religious leaders including Simon Lokodo \u2013 a former minister of ethics and former priest who is at the forefront of a witch hunt for gay people and \u201cindecent\u201d women \u2013 also spoke out against the pageant. \u201cThis thing they are doing is very bad for the country. Uganda is a moral country. We have so many things we can use instead of women\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said. When your enemies start to fight on your side, you must watch them very closely. The women\u2019s rights movement should not be so quick to embrace Lokodo, Museveni and the religious leaders who find Miss Curvy despicable but stay silent when a woman is undressed on the street while men cheer. It is confusing to see the leader of a government where women are stopped from entering ministries and parliament if they are deemed too \u201csexy\u201d now say that he is against the objectification of women. A closer look at the reasons why government and religious leaders are against the Miss Curvy pageant suggests that they are more angry that the moral fabric of the country is being assaulted than concerned about the women exposed to harassment and abuse. Tourism brings in about $1.4bn to Uganda annually \u2013 nearly 10% of GDP. However, its poor governance and human rights record has stifled its potential for tourism, and the country\u2019s profile is dwarfed by neighbours Kenya and Rwanda. Uganda has ambitious development goals, including becoming a middle-income country by 2020. Attracting revenue at the expense of women\u2019s dignity is perhaps part of the plan. The women who turned up for Miss Curvy say they are happy to be tourist attractions and make money at the same time. What they do not realise is that the system will be designed so that they receive only crumbs. And, once again, the only winners will be the men who think a woman\u2019s body is a source of vulgarity and distraction \u2013 unless, of course, that body is being used for the benefit of a man, whether it be the man holding political office, the man grappling her on the street, or the abusive man in her home.",

Then Griffith, and [Sergei] Eisenstein in Russia, started cutting and editing their films and directors needed someone to splice the footage together. These women already knew how to handle film,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey would hold up the film and measure it out along their arm like a tailor does, with 3ft considered the right length of time to hold a close-up. In fact, Marty shows Coates doing exactly that in a scene in The Aviator.\u201d</p> <p>Female editors such as Booth, at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, or Barbara McLean at 20th Century Fox, became leading supervisors, brought in to approve or rescue a film, during the heyday of Hollywood studios.</p> <p>\u201cThen, as soon as editing became a more important job and men saw it was possibly going to be paid better, they started pushing women out,\u201d said Schoonmaker. \u201cI have a feeling it became a plum job after the second world war, when men came back from fighting.\u201d</p> <p>Schoonmaker also contends women are better physically suited to editing than men. \u201cWe are often more dexterous, and also used to multi-tasking,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut the major thing is we are more cooperative and collaborative. It is not such of an ego thing for a woman somehow. When two people are battling over a movie, it is very bad for the movie.\u201d</p> <p>Schoonmaker first met Scorsese by chance on a summer film course in New York and he began to teach her his craft. \u201cMarty felt he could trust me to do what was right for a movie,\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>\u201cMy artistic development came through him. We don\u2019t fight and it has been a wonderful collaboration.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08f16b63add2b2dd2a6d9ed073b9c77528e24a58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f16b63add2b2dd2a6d9ed073b9c77528e24a58/0_311_2842_1885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thelma Schoonmaker with director Mike Wadleigh (left) and editor Martin Scorsese (centre) during the making of Woodstock in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thelma Schoonmaker with director Mike Wadleigh, left, and Martin Scorsese during the making of Woodstock in 1970.<br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of Scorsese\u2019s skill, Schoonmaker believes, is in thinking like an editor from the moment he conceives a new film. \u201cEditing is his favourite part. I don\u2019t think you can be a great director without a feeling for it.\u201d</p> <p>For Dame Pippa Harris, chair of Bafta, the value of Schoonmaker\u2019s contribution is difficult to overstate. \u201cBecause the work of an editor takes place in dimly lit rooms, often one to one with the director, their influence and skill sometimes gets overlooked,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThelma is a storyteller in her own right, influencing not only the narrative structure, but shaping the rhythm and pacing of the films she works on, the performances of the actors and, ultimately, the emotions of the audience.</p> <p>\u201cIn what is still a male-dominated craft, Thelma has been a towering role model for other women, and I couldn\u2019t be more delighted she is being celebrated.\u201d</p> <p>Tonight, when the Bafta fellowship, the British film industry\u2019s highest token of recognition, is presented to Schoonmaker it will mean all the more because of the legacy of her late husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/05/thelma-schoonmaker-a-matter-of-life-and-death-scorsese-powell-and-pressburger\" title=\"\">Michael Powell, the English director</a> of <em>The Red Shoes</em>, <em>Black Narcissus, Peeping Tom</em> and <em>A Matter of Life and Death</em>.</p> <p>Powell, a giant of British film history who worked with his creative partner Emeric Pressburger, was introduced to Schoonmaker by Scorsese. When he died in 1990, at 84, he left his widow with an affection for Britain, as well the home they once shared in Kent.</p> <p>\u201cMichael gave me a view of England that was very unorthodox, and I still go to our cottage whenever I can,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As a young woman Schoonmaker had avidly watched classic movies, including those of Powell and Pressburger, on American television.

      "bodyText": "Tonight many of the actors walking up the red carpet to the Bafta awards ceremony in the Albert Hall will be wearing a ribbon in a show of support for the Time\u2019s Up campaign, launched to promote and protect women working in film. It is clearly a cause still in need of champions, given that half the cinema audience is women and only 4% of major films are directed by them. But this is not the whole story. For among the major award recipients tonight will be film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, cinema\u2019s ultimate backroom heroine, who has worked alongside Martin Scorsese since he made Raging Bull in 1980. Schoonmaker, 79, is to be honoured with a Bafta fellowship in recognition of a 50-year career that is testament to the hidden legacy of the women who have quietly shaped the films we have watched since the art form first began. \u201cPeople think there were fewer women in Hollywood than there were,\u201d Schoonmaker told the Observer this weekend. \u201cAfter all, Cecil B DeMille\u2019s editor, Anne Bauchens, actually won an Oscar, and DW Griffith worked with Margaret Booth, and Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s films were edited by his wife, Alma. \u201cI welcome the push for more diversity in the industry, it is terrific, of course, but I also hope people understand women were there from the start.\u201d And while Schoonmaker, as a triple-Oscar winner, can hardly claim to be unsung, she does argue that women\u2019s crucial role in film-making has been underestimated. Listing Dede Allen, Verna Fields and Anne Coates, the artistically powerful Hollywood editors of the 1920s, 30s and 40s, as further evidence of a strong tradition that has continued with the late Sally Menke\u2019s editing of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s films and in the work of Alisa Lepselter for Woody Allen, Schoonmaker suggests women first became involved in the industry as assistants in film laboratories. \u201cThey were there spooling film in the labs, back when it was just one 100ft roll. Then Griffith, and [Sergei] Eisenstein in Russia, started cutting and editing their films and directors needed someone to splice the footage together. These women already knew how to handle film,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would hold up the film and measure it out along their arm like a tailor does, with 3ft considered the right length of time to hold a close-up. In fact, Marty shows Coates doing exactly that in a scene in The Aviator.\u201d Female editors such as Booth, at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, or Barbara McLean at 20th Century Fox, became leading supervisors, brought in to approve or rescue a film, during the heyday of Hollywood studios. \u201cThen, as soon as editing became a more important job and men saw it was possibly going to be paid better, they started pushing women out,\u201d said Schoonmaker. \u201cI have a feeling it became a plum job after the second world war, when men came back from fighting.\u201d Schoonmaker also contends women are better physically suited to editing than men. \u201cWe are often more dexterous, and also used to multi-tasking,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the major thing is we are more cooperative and collaborative. It is not such of an ego thing for a woman somehow. When two people are battling over a movie, it is very bad for the movie.\u201d Schoonmaker first met Scorsese by chance on a summer film course in New York and he began to teach her his craft. \u201cMarty felt he could trust me to do what was right for a movie,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy artistic development came through him. We don\u2019t fight and it has been a wonderful collaboration.\u201d Part of Scorsese\u2019s skill, Schoonmaker believes, is in thinking like an editor from the moment he conceives a new film. \u201cEditing is his favourite part. I don\u2019t think you can be a great director without a feeling for it.\u201d For Dame Pippa Harris, chair of Bafta, the value of Schoonmaker\u2019s contribution is difficult to overstate. \u201cBecause the work of an editor takes place in dimly lit rooms, often one to one with the director, their influence and skill sometimes gets overlooked,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cThelma is a storyteller in her own right, influencing not only the narrative structure, but shaping the rhythm and pacing of the films she works on, the performances of the actors and, ultimately, the emotions of the audience. \u201cIn what is still a male-dominated craft, Thelma has been a towering role model for other women, and I couldn\u2019t be more delighted she is being celebrated.\u201d Tonight, when the Bafta fellowship, the British film industry\u2019s highest token of recognition, is presented to Schoonmaker it will mean all the more because of the legacy of her late husband, Michael Powell, the English director of The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus, Peeping Tom and A Matter of Life and Death. Powell, a giant of British film history who worked with his creative partner Emeric Pressburger, was introduced to Schoonmaker by Scorsese. When he died in 1990, at 84, he left his widow with an affection for Britain, as well the home they once shared in Kent. \u201cMichael gave me a view of England that was very unorthodox, and I still go to our cottage whenever I can,\u201d she said. As a young woman Schoonmaker had avidly watched classic movies, including those of Powell and Pressburger, on American television. Intrigued, she put aside her plans to become a diplomat. \u201cI saw A Matter of Life and Death without knowing I would marry the man that made it. And Marty had been watching his films too, it turned out. He was living in an Italian ghetto, while Michael was born in Kent, but the films connected because they are about humanity.\u201d It was Scorsese who later, along with film scholars Kevin Gough-Yates and Ian Christie and French director Bertrand Tavernier, became instrumental in reviving interest in Powell\u2019s work. In 1975 when the New York director was invited to the Edinburgh film festival to receive an award, he requested Powell should make the presentation, but few people remembered who Powell was. Eventually a lunch was set up in London and Scorsese finally met his forgotten cinematic idol, who was by then down on his luck. \u201cMichael said that Marty knew every shot he had ever taken,\u201d Schoonmaker recalls, wiping her eyes. \u201cI am sorry. I always cry when I think of it. You have no idea how Michael had suffered and how bad it was.\u201d Scorsese has since funded the digital restoration, overseen by Schoonmaker, of a succession of Powell\u2019s films. The influence of the duel scene in Powell\u2019s The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is evident, Schoonmaker said, in the way Scorsese handled the famous championship fight build-up in Raging Bull. And it is also there now as they work on their current project, The Irishman, starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, which is out on Netflix in October. \u201cMichael always told us never to explain and to stay ahead of the audience: to show them some respect, and that is what we are still doing,\u201d she said. Schoonmaker\u2019s aim, as she finishes restoration of Powell\u2019s 1945 Scottish romance, I Know Where I\u2019m Going, is to persuade young directors to pay attention to film history. \u201cFilm schools tell me they have a hard time getting students to watch older films, particularly black and white ones, and it is devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is like throwing away 85 years of the art, when masterpiece after masterpiece were being made.\u201d",

Labour\u2019s general secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/21/with-jennie-formbys-coronation-corbyn-has-total-control-of-labour\" title=\"\">Jennie Formby</a> also bowed to pressure and agreed to publish details of hundreds of antisemitism complaints against party members and progress to date in dealing with them, having batted away MPs\u2019 calls to do so last Monday in a move that caused widespread dismay.</p> <p>As it firefights rows on many fronts there is a stubbornness about Corbyn\u2019s leadership on issues such as antisemitism and Venezuela, and a deliberate vagueness on Brexit, that irks many Labour MPs and increasingly members of the party. But, according to very senior figures, there is also no doubt that there is concern at the highest level about rising levels of discontent and talk of breakaways. As reported by the <em>Observer</em> last weekend, a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/02/rebel-labour-mps-set-to-quit-party-and-form-centre-group?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">at least six Labour MPs</a>, all persistent critics of Corbyn, are planning to resign the whip and form a new breakaway party within weeks. Moves are also being considered by a far bigger group of \u201cmainstream\u201d MPs to do the same, after Brexit.</p> <p>Supporters of the Labour leader have piled on to social media to say good riddance to the splitters. But the discontent is no longer confined to what Corbyn loyalists like to dismiss as a Blairite rump of MPs. Unrest and disillusion have spread to sections of the pro-EU left of the party, and the activist base. Party membership has fallen rapidly. Labour is dropping in the polls. Two surveys have put the party seven points behind the Tories in the past week and Corbyn\u2019s personal ratings have nosedived, particularly over his handling of Brexit, to record lows. At a time when discontent with politicians is arguably greater than ever, debate at Westminster now focuses not only on whether the Tories can survive Brexit as a coherent fighting force, but whether Labour can hold itself together too. As one shadow cabinet member put it: \u201cThings are already tense. I think some of our MPs will split off pretty soon. But if we are seen to allow a Tory Brexit there is no telling what will happen. All hell will break loose.\u201d</p> <p>After Corbyn sent his five-point letter to May on Wednesday, and Labour Remainers reacted with fury, the leadership and the small circle who had been involved in drafting it were quick in their attempts to pour cold water on the flames. The Brexit spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer</a> made clear that the letter had been signed off by him, in consultation with the leader\u2019s office, and was really just a restatement of the party\u2019s existing position. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell\" title=\"\">John McDonnell</a>, went public to insist that a second referendum was still \u201con the table\u201d and the fact that it was not mentioned meant nothing. In fact nothing had changed. The commitment to the \u201cexact same benefits\u201d of the single market was also implicit in the five points.</p> <p>But, while some Labour MPs were supportive of the initiative, including Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock (hardly full-throated Corbyn backers), doubts remained in the minds of many others who are committed to fighting May\u2019s Brexit tooth and nail. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, told the <em>Observer</em> it was time for clarity from the leadership because the country was heading for a catastrophe which had to be avoided.</p> <p>\u201cIt really is decision time for Jeremy Corbyn now on whether he actually backs a people\u2019s vote or whether he really wants to facilitate Brexit. No ifs, no buts, no tables. We have to be clear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79b85bc5b6d6b6d7626ff0a2c074d92c73d127cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79b85bc5b6d6b6d7626ff0a2c074d92c73d127cd/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn poses for a selfie after a speech at the Labour local government conference in Coventry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing today on guardian.co.uk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/labour-must-stop-the-tory-brexit-dream\" title=\"\">Alena Ivanova</a>, a Momentum and Labour activist, says there is a danger that the leadership\u2019s so-called \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d on Brexit, and reluctance to involve the wider party in policy, could drive many Corbyn supporters away. While the Corbyn letter might have been designed to split the Tories, it could also split and fracture the Corbyn support base. \u201cIt may have the inadvertent effect of disillusioning Labour supporters further who might interpret this as an offer to co-deliver what was always a Tory-driven project,\u201d she writes. \u201cLabour should stand firm on its commitment to vote down May\u2019s deal. All MPs should be effectively whipped to do so. It is the only principled thing to do \u2013 it offers a chance to defeat the government, to get the general election we need now, not in 2022, and to then go back to the public, honestly stating that Labour never wanted or participated in the Tory Brexit dream, and that it has a different, positive, socialist vision for our relationship with the EU. Then, we let the voters decide.\u201d</p> <p>A strongly pro-Remain member of the shadow cabinet said there were two interpretations of what Corbyn was up to. \u201cThe charitable view is that he is doing this so when May cannot accept his demands he can then move to support a second referendum, saying it is the option left and he has tried everything. But the second view is that Corbyn wants to get Brexit over the line because that is what be believes, which in my view would be disastrous.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, in a speech in Coventry, Corbyn adopted a familiar formula on Brexit that left few people any the wiser as to where Labour will end up or where he really stands. He said his plan \u2013 as outlined in the letter to May and involving a permanent customs union of the kind the prime minister refuses to accept \u2013 could \u201cwin the support of parliament and bring the country together\u201d. If the Tories could not support Labour\u2019s demand he said \u2013 unequivocally, and decisively \u2013 there should be a general election, even though Labour recently lost a confidence vote that could have delivered one. Its main route to an election has already been cut away.</p> <p>Corbyn then gave a typically cautious nod to the idea of a second referendum, saying that without an election \u201cwe will keep all options on the table \u2013 as agreed in our conference motion \u2013 including the option of a public vote\u201d.</p> <p>After a week in which Labour MPs and members from all wings of the party demanded clearer leadership, and talk of a breakaway group grew ever louder, it was hardly the kind of address to reassure the doubters. \u201cThis is more kicking the can down the road,\u201d said one disillusioned MP. \u201cThe longer this goes on and the closer Brexit comes the worse it gets. We should be clearly demanding another referendum by now because that is our policy. But it is clear he cannot bring himself to do so. If the leader cannot implement his party\u2019s policy there is no hope for us.\u201d</p>",

A no-confidence motion in Berger was withdrawn following pressure from an evidently panicked leader\u2019s office. Labour\u2019s general secretary Jennie Formby also bowed to pressure and agreed to publish details of hundreds of antisemitism complaints against party members and progress to date in dealing with them, having batted away MPs\u2019 calls to do so last Monday in a move that caused widespread dismay.

But the discontent is no longer confined to what Corbyn loyalists like to dismiss as a Blairite rump of MPs. Unrest and disillusion have spread to sections of the pro-EU left of the party, and the activist base. Party membership has fallen rapidly. Labour is dropping in the polls. Two surveys have put the party seven points behind the Tories in the past week and Corbyn\u2019s personal ratings have nosedived, particularly over his handling of Brexit, to record lows. At a time when discontent with politicians is arguably greater than ever, debate at Westminster now focuses not only on whether the Tories can survive Brexit as a coherent fighting force, but whether Labour can hold itself together too. As one shadow cabinet member put it: \u201cThings are already tense. I think some of our MPs will split off pretty soon. But if we are seen to allow a Tory Brexit there is no telling what will happen. All hell will break loose.\u201d After Corbyn sent his five-point letter to May on Wednesday, and Labour Remainers reacted with fury, the leadership and the small circle who had been involved in drafting it were quick in their attempts to pour cold water on the flames. The Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer made clear that the letter had been signed off by him, in consultation with the leader\u2019s office, and was really just a restatement of the party\u2019s existing position. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, went public to insist that a second referendum was still \u201con the table\u201d and the fact that it was not mentioned meant nothing. In fact nothing had changed. The commitment to the \u201cexact same benefits\u201d of the single market was also implicit in the five points. But, while some Labour MPs were supportive of the initiative, including Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock (hardly full-throated Corbyn backers), doubts remained in the minds of many others who are committed to fighting May\u2019s Brexit tooth and nail. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, told the Observer it was time for clarity from the leadership because the country was heading for a catastrophe which had to be avoided. \u201cIt really is decision time for Jeremy Corbyn now on whether he actually backs a people\u2019s vote or whether he really wants to facilitate Brexit. No ifs, no buts, no tables. We have to be clear.\u201d Writing today on guardian.co.uk, Alena Ivanova, a Momentum and Labour activist, says there is a danger that the leadership\u2019s so-called \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d on Brexit, and reluctance to involve the wider party in policy, could drive many Corbyn supporters away. While the Corbyn letter might have been designed to split the Tories, it could also split and fracture the Corbyn support base. \u201cIt may have the inadvertent effect of disillusioning Labour supporters further who might interpret this as an offer to co-deliver what was always a Tory-driven project,\u201d she writes. \u201cLabour should stand firm on its commitment to vote down May\u2019s deal. All MPs should be effectively whipped to do so. It is the only principled thing to do \u2013 it offers a chance to defeat the government, to get the general election we need now, not in 2022, and to then go back to the public, honestly stating that Labour never wanted or participated in the Tory Brexit dream, and that it has a different, positive, socialist vision for our relationship with the EU. Then, we let the voters decide.\u201d A strongly pro-Remain member of the shadow cabinet said there were two interpretations of what Corbyn was up to. \u201cThe charitable view is that he is doing this so when May cannot accept his demands he can then move to support a second referendum, saying it is the option left and he has tried everything. But the second view is that Corbyn wants to get Brexit over the line because that is what be believes, which in my view would be disastrous.\u201d On Saturday, in a speech in Coventry, Corbyn adopted a familiar formula on Brexit that left few people any the wiser as to where Labour will end up or where he really stands. He said his plan \u2013 as outlined in the letter to May and involving a permanent customs union of the kind the prime minister refuses to accept \u2013 could \u201cwin the support of parliament and bring the country together\u201d. If the Tories could not support Labour\u2019s demand he said \u2013 unequivocally, and decisively \u2013 there should be a general election, even though Labour recently lost a confidence vote that could have delivered one. Its main route to an election has already been cut away. Corbyn then gave a typically cautious nod to the idea of a second referendum, saying that without an election \u201cwe will keep all options on the table \u2013 as agreed in our conference motion \u2013 including the option of a public vote\u201d. After a week in which Labour MPs and members from all wings of the party demanded clearer leadership, and talk of a breakaway group grew ever louder, it was hardly the kind of address to reassure the doubters. \u201cThis is more kicking the can down the road,\u201d said one disillusioned MP. \u201cThe longer this goes on and the closer Brexit comes the worse it gets. We should be clearly demanding another referendum by now because that is our policy. But it is clear he cannot bring himself to do so. If the leader cannot implement his party\u2019s policy there is no hope for us.\u201d",

Fourteen bees were put through 100 training exercises in a maze \u2013 and got the correct answer between 64% and 72% of the time. \u201cIt is not that every bee could do this [spontaneously], but we could teach them to do it,\u201d said Dr Adrian Dyer, co-author of the research.</p> <h2>Solve tasks<br></h2> <p>In 2017, researchers from Queen Mary University of London <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6327/833\" title=\"\">demonstrated </a>that bees can learn to gain a reward and then show others to do the same. The bees were taught by a decoy bee to move a small ball to a particular location \u2013 and some of them even managed to solve the task more efficiently by shortening the distance.</p> <h2>Give directions<br></h2> <p>Karl von Frisch was awarded the 1973 Nobel prize for decoding the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance\" title=\"\">waggle dance</a>\u201d performed by bees to inform hive-mates about the location of pollen sources. On returning to the hive, a bee vibrates its wings in such a way as to relay information about the location of food in relation to the position of the sun.</p> <h2>Understand zero <br></h2> <p>Honeybees were the first insect species to be observed to have <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180607141031.htm\" title=\"\">a concept of zero,</a> a numerical notion that human children find difficult to learn. Researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne last year showed that bees conceive zero as a number but they were unclear why had this mathematical skill.</p> <h2>Share decisions<br></h2> <p>Bees have also developed a sense of democracy. When looking for a location for a new home for, say, 10,000 bees, 300 older bees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/science/28scibks.html\" title=\"\">form a \u201csenate\u201d </a>and fly off looking for options.

      "bodyText": "Crunch numbers Last week, Australian scientists announced that honeybees (Apis mellifera) can learn to add and subtract. Fourteen bees were put through 100 training exercises in a maze \u2013 and got the correct answer between 64% and 72% of the time. \u201cIt is not that every bee could do this [spontaneously], but we could teach them to do it,\u201d said Dr Adrian Dyer, co-author of the research. Solve tasks In 2017, researchers from Queen Mary University of London demonstrated that bees can learn to gain a reward and then show others to do the same. The bees were taught by a decoy bee to move a small ball to a particular location \u2013 and some of them even managed to solve the task more efficiently by shortening the distance. Give directions Karl von Frisch was awarded the 1973 Nobel prize for decoding the \u201cwaggle dance\u201d performed by bees to inform hive-mates about the location of pollen sources. On returning to the hive, a bee vibrates its wings in such a way as to relay information about the location of food in relation to the position of the sun. Understand zero Honeybees were the first insect species to be observed to have a concept of zero, a numerical notion that human children find difficult to learn. Researchers from RMIT University in Melbourne last year showed that bees conceive zero as a number but they were unclear why had this mathematical skill. Share decisions Bees have also developed a sense of democracy. When looking for a location for a new home for, say, 10,000 bees, 300 older bees form a \u201csenate\u201d and fly off looking for options. They use the waggle dance described above to communicate the potential locations, the number of dance repetitions indicating the quality of the site.",

Not the stroppy news two-way, where the journalist operates on the assumption that the interviewee is lying \u2013 or applying local council funding principles to the truth. No, I mean the celebrity interview. The cosy, on-air chat with the artist who has something to promote.</p> <p>I often interview such people, occasionally on the radio, and there are a few factors that can make or break such interchanges, the most important of which is time. There is never enough. You are always rushed, restricted, checking how long you have left. And so the best radio interviewers are usually those who have come up through live broadcasting, who know exactly, to the second, how long there is before the news, who can work out in their heads the minutes they have for each question \u2013 and, more importantly, answer.

Not the stroppy news two-way, where the journalist operates on the assumption that the interviewee is lying \u2013 or applying local council funding principles to the truth. No, I mean the celebrity interview. The cosy, on-air chat with the artist who has something to promote. I often interview such people, occasionally on the radio, and there are a few factors that can make or break such interchanges, the most important of which is time. There is never enough. You are always rushed, restricted, checking how long you have left. And so the best radio interviewers are usually those who have come up through live broadcasting, who know exactly, to the second, how long there is before the news, who can work out in their heads the minutes they have for each question \u2013 and, more importantly, answer. They take that skill with them to pre-recorded interviews, which are often more intimate when recorded \u201cas live\u201d, rather than as an indulgent, no-clocks shooting of the breeze. Then there\u2019s atmosphere. A relaxed ambience always helps; and that, too, is about the interviewer. They must have done the work: read the book, watched the film, thought about the career.

Will Young\u2019s engaging Homo Sapiens, which he presents with Christopher Sweeney, has recently returned for its third series (Troye Sivan and Sam Smith so far).

As Virginia, and soon the nation, reeled from that revelation, Northam then denied he was in the image, but said he had indeed worn blackface in the past, to impersonate Michael Jackson during a dance competition.</p> <p>As the governor clung on, the state\u2019s attorney general, Mark Herring, the man third in line to replace Northam should he have to quit, confessed to his own dalliances with blackface. Herring said he had worn \u201cdark makeup\u201d while dressing as the rapper Kurtis Blow.</p> <p>Sandwiched in-between those incidents, Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/07/virginia-blackface-sexual-assault-scandals-engulf-top-three-democrats\">sexually assaulting a female academic</a> in 2004.

Many have been stunned by the efforts of Northam and Herring to attempt to place into context their blackface makeup shenanigans. Both have cited their age at the time \u2013 Northam was 25, Herring was 19 \u2013 and that the incidents occurred in the 1980s, as providing some sort of reasonable explanation.

He has resisted calls from Democrats, including the Virginia legislative black caucus and candidates for the White House, to resign, and has hired a crisis communications firm.</p> <p>To the outsider, Virginia has been moving left politically over the past decade, to the extent that some have mused whether the state, which brushes up against Washington DC, in the north-east, should even still be considered part of \u201cThe South\u201d, in the parlance of the US civil war.</p> <p>The state elected Douglas Wilder, the first African American to serve as governor in the US since reconstruction, in 1989.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 400 years since the ship carrying the first African slaves to what is today the United States of America docked on the coast of Virginia, beginning a process that would see millions of black people forced into servitude. The state has spent the better part of a decade planning for 2019 to be a solemn remembrance, with a series of exhibitions and ceremonies aimed at recognizing that dark past, and looking to a more inclusive future. But in the space of a week all that endeavor has been forced into the background, with Virginia\u2019s leaders instead seemingly engaged in an effort to singlehandedly revive the art of blackface. Ralph Northam, Virginia\u2019s governor, kicked things off when he admitted to being in a college yearbook photo that showed a man in blackface next to a man in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. As Virginia, and soon the nation, reeled from that revelation, Northam then denied he was in the image, but said he had indeed worn blackface in the past, to impersonate Michael Jackson during a dance competition. As the governor clung on, the state\u2019s attorney general, Mark Herring, the man third in line to replace Northam should he have to quit, confessed to his own dalliances with blackface. Herring said he had worn \u201cdark makeup\u201d while dressing as the rapper Kurtis Blow. Sandwiched in-between those incidents, Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, was accused of sexually assaulting a female academic in 2004. And on Friday, a second woman came forward accusing Fairfax of rape while the two were students at Duke University in 2000. As much of the nation has looked on in horror, all three men have refused to resign. Many have been stunned by the efforts of Northam and Herring to attempt to place into context their blackface makeup shenanigans. Both have cited their age at the time \u2013 Northam was 25, Herring was 19 \u2013 and that the incidents occurred in the 1980s, as providing some sort of reasonable explanation. But others have pointed out that 25 years old is not that young, and 1980 was not that long ago. Still, for all the surprise outside, and inside, the state, many say they are not shocked. \u201cFor me the scariest part is \u2013 and this has been said in the black community for decades \u2013 what happened this past week was that things we know exist came to the surface,\u201d said Francesca Leigh-Davis, who co-hosts the RVA Dirt local politics radio show in Richmond, the Virginia state capital. Leigh-Davis and her RVA Dirt co-hosts, Melissa Vaughn and Jessee Perry, organized a demonstration outside the governor\u2019s mansion. Scores of people held signs and chanted \u201cNortham has got to go\u201d as the governor held a news conference inside \u2013 where he told reporters about his shoe-polish-assisted Michael Jackson impression. Northam hasn\u2019t been seen in public since. He has resisted calls from Democrats, including the Virginia legislative black caucus and candidates for the White House, to resign, and has hired a crisis communications firm. To the outsider, Virginia has been moving left politically over the past decade, to the extent that some have mused whether the state, which brushes up against Washington DC, in the north-east, should even still be considered part of \u201cThe South\u201d, in the parlance of the US civil war. The state elected Douglas Wilder, the first African American to serve as governor in the US since reconstruction, in 1989. More recently, Virginia voted for Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 the first time the state had pledged for a Democrat in the White House in more than 40 years, and backed Obama again in 2012. In 2016 Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 5% in the state. But Cornell Brooks, a Virginia resident and former president of the NAACP, and a current professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that while Virginia \u201cis embracing the politics, the economics and the future\u201d, there is a limit to its progressiveness. \u201cVirginia is still a southern state. It\u2019s a southern state in the mid-Atlantic, but bear in mind Richmond was the capitol of the confederacy,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI hesitate to say that the vestiges of the old south are gone. Simply because when you drive down the street in Richmond, there are Confederate memorials. There are Confederate flags still flying. And there are some people, who may be a minority, who still subscribe to those old ways of thinking.\u201d Some Virginians say much of the alleged \u201cawakening\u201d is just a northern Virginia thing. The migration of academics, government employees and those with more liberal politics to places such as Alexandria and Arlington, just outside Washington where Amazon will base its new hub, has skewed Virginia\u2019s politics. \u201cIn theory it might be becoming more progressive, but it\u2019s all surface level,\u201d said Perry, the radio co-host. She pointed to the Virginia government\u2019s support for a gas pipeline compressor station to be built in the historically black community of Union Hill, 70 miles west of Richmond, despite environmentalists\u2019 fears it could pollute the air. And as recently as last October, Northam dressed as James Barbour, a slaveowner who governed Virginia in 1812-14, for Halloween. Outside the left-leaning north, the Confederate symbology is hard to miss. Monument Avenue, which runs from west Richmond towards the state capitol, is a veritable rogues\u2019 gallery of Confederate figures. There\u2019s Confederate commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, Confederate general Stonewall Jackson and Confederate president Jefferson Davis, looming over the street. The largest monument is of Robert E Lee, with the Confederate commander depicted on a giant horse, looking out over the city. On Thursday there were again protests at Virginia\u2019s capitol, although this time not over the blackface scandal. Hundreds of anti-abortion campaigners had gathered to oppose a bill which would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions. Days before Northam\u2019s racist debacle, he had drawn ire from the right for his support for the bill. Rosemary Storaska, a retired teacher, was wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, one of a number of attendees sporting Donald Trump garb.

The drive west from Richmond, through a barren landscape , leads to the town of Appomattox where the court house is one of the most important sites in US history. It was here that the Confederate army, under Robert E Lee, finally surrendered to the Union on 9 April 1865, effectively ending the civil war.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s representative,\u201d Myers said. Charlottesville, an hour\u2019s drive north, has seen one of the most recent examples that the country is yet to put racism in the past. It\u2019s less than two years since hundreds of white supremacists gathered in the city for a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally that left civil rights activist Heather Heyer dead and dozens injured. In the aftermath, Donald Trump infamously claimed there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d among the white supremacist marchers. The Robert E Lee statue in Charlottesville that was a rallying point for the right that day remains in place, surrounded by orange barriers and signs saying \u201cNo trespassing\u201d. A few blocks south is where Heyer was murdered. There are always flowers, candles and chalked messages at the spot. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is a common post, along with \u201cLove has no color\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The only computer game I\u2019ve ever played involved no killing, zombies, heavily-armed monsters or quests for hidden keys. It was called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity\" title=\"\"><em>SimCity</em></a> and involved developing a virtual city from a patch of undeveloped land. The game enabled you to determine where to place development zones, infrastructure (like roads and power plants), landmarks and public services such as schools, parks, hospitals and fire stations. You could decide the tax rate, budget and social policy for your city \u2013 populated by Sims (for \u201csimulated persons\u201d, I guess) who had to live and work in the three zones you created for them: residential had houses and apartment buildings, commercial had shops and offices and industrial had factories, warehouses, laboratories and (oddly) farms.</p> <p><em>SimCity</em> was the brainchild of Will Wright, a software developer who had first made a splash with a shoot-\u2019em-up (well, bomb-\u2019em-flat) video game in which the player controls a helicopter dropping bombs on islands. But he became more fascinated with the islands than with the weaponry and started to wonder what a virtual city would be like \u2013 and how it would work. What he came up with was magical for its time: it gave the player a feeling of omnipotence: you decided where Sims should live, whether their electricity should come from nukes, where schools and offices should be located, how much tax they paid... </p> <p>What you discovered early on, though, was that your decisions had consequences. Forget a fire station and one day a fire would get out of control and raze a city block. Set taxes too high and the inhabitants might emigrate. What you were learning was your city was a dynamic system in which hidden feedback loops determined its behaviour and apparently innocuous policy ideas had unanticipated consequences.</p> <p>SimCity was absorbing to play. In fact it was so thought-provoking that schools of urban planning in universities began to use it to introduce their students to the idea that intervening in complex dynamic systems is not for the faint-hearted or the simple-minded.</p> <p>It\u2019s at least 20 years since I played the game and I had more or less forgotten about it. But last week, I stumbled on <a href=\"https://logicmag.io/06-model-metropolis/\" title=\"\">Model Metropolis</a>, a remarkable essay by Kevin Baker, a science historian. Baker answers a question I\u2019d sometimes thought about (but never answered) when playing <em>SimCity</em>: where did the theoretical model underpinning its feedback dynamics come from?</p> <p>The answer is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/538561/the-many-careers-of-jay-forrester/\" title=\"\">Jay Forrester</a>, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology technocrat from central casting. He started out as a pioneering computer scientist but then switched to MIT\u2019s Sloan business school, where he studied the messy way that human beings tried to manage commercial operations. Why, for example, did ostensibly sensible decisions to solve a local problem give rise to huge fluctuations in inventory?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95e18f577c7ed056a2099271d40091996e91409b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95e18f577c7ed056a2099271d40091996e91409b/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Wright wrote a game in which a helicopter drops bombs on islands, but became more fascinated with the islands than with the weaponry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Wright wrote a game in which a helicopter drops bombs on islands, but became more fascinated with the islands than with the weaponry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Anson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forrester concluded that such differences were generally produced by feedback loops \u2013 positive and reinforcing, negative and self-correcting \u2013 of which the human actors were unaware and so he set about developing a computer simulation tool that would enable managers to explore the systemic consequences of their decisions before they made them. At first, he called this modelling tool \u201cindustrial dynamics\u201d but it eventually wound up as \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics\" title=\"\">system dynamics</a>\u201d.</p> <p>A chance encounter with the outgoing mayor of Boston awakened Forrester\u2019s interest in cities and led to the construction of a simulation model of a city at a time when American planners were alarmed by the flight to the suburbs and the hollowing out of urban centres.</p> <p>Forrester called this model \u201curban dynamics\u201d, declaring that he had reduced the problems of the city to a series of 150 equations and 200 parameters.</p> <p>The beauty of a simulation model is that you can try things out. So Forrester did and some of his simulations produced alarming conclusions, suggesting, for example, that the worst thing you can do for a city that is beginning to decay at its core is to build affordable public housing: that just attracts more poor people, erodes the tax base and sends the city into a death spiral, like the one that afflicted <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2018/07/31/why-has-detroit-continued-to-decline/#156844a33fbe\" title=\"\">Detroit</a>, which suffered a population fall of 600,000 between 1950 and 1980.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that Forrester ever believed this, but many policymakers in the Nixon and Reagan eras interpreted the bleak technocratic realism of his urban model as providing \u201cscientific\u201d support for their view that low-income housing programmes would just increase unemployment and reduce upward economic mobility, thereby condemning the underemployed to lifelong poverty.</p> <p>Neither is it clear how much of Forrester\u2019s urban model was incorporated into <em>SimCity</em>. But with hindsight it\u2019s suddenly clear why it often seemed impossible \u2013 at least to this player \u2013 to design planning policies that embodied social justice.</p> <p>In fact, the most successful policies always seemed to be ones that maximised economic growth. Perhaps this was a measure of my incompetence.

      "bodyText": "The only computer game I\u2019ve ever played involved no killing, zombies, heavily-armed monsters or quests for hidden keys. It was called SimCity and involved developing a virtual city from a patch of undeveloped land. The game enabled you to determine where to place development zones, infrastructure (like roads and power plants), landmarks and public services such as schools, parks, hospitals and fire stations. You could decide the tax rate, budget and social policy for your city \u2013 populated by Sims (for \u201csimulated persons\u201d, I guess) who had to live and work in the three zones you created for them: residential had houses and apartment buildings, commercial had shops and offices and industrial had factories, warehouses, laboratories and (oddly) farms. SimCity was the brainchild of Will Wright, a software developer who had first made a splash with a shoot-\u2019em-up (well, bomb-\u2019em-flat) video game in which the player controls a helicopter dropping bombs on islands. But he became more fascinated with the islands than with the weaponry and started to wonder what a virtual city would be like \u2013 and how it would work. What he came up with was magical for its time: it gave the player a feeling of omnipotence: you decided where Sims should live, whether their electricity should come from nukes, where schools and offices should be located, how much tax they paid... What you discovered early on, though, was that your decisions had consequences. Forget a fire station and one day a fire would get out of control and raze a city block. Set taxes too high and the inhabitants might emigrate. What you were learning was your city was a dynamic system in which hidden feedback loops determined its behaviour and apparently innocuous policy ideas had unanticipated consequences. SimCity was absorbing to play. In fact it was so thought-provoking that schools of urban planning in universities began to use it to introduce their students to the idea that intervening in complex dynamic systems is not for the faint-hearted or the simple-minded. It\u2019s at least 20 years since I played the game and I had more or less forgotten about it. But last week, I stumbled on Model Metropolis, a remarkable essay by Kevin Baker, a science historian. Baker answers a question I\u2019d sometimes thought about (but never answered) when playing SimCity: where did the theoretical model underpinning its feedback dynamics come from? The answer is Jay Forrester, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology technocrat from central casting. He started out as a pioneering computer scientist but then switched to MIT\u2019s Sloan business school, where he studied the messy way that human beings tried to manage commercial operations. Why, for example, did ostensibly sensible decisions to solve a local problem give rise to huge fluctuations in inventory? Forrester concluded that such differences were generally produced by feedback loops \u2013 positive and reinforcing, negative and self-correcting \u2013 of which the human actors were unaware and so he set about developing a computer simulation tool that would enable managers to explore the systemic consequences of their decisions before they made them. At first, he called this modelling tool \u201cindustrial dynamics\u201d but it eventually wound up as \u201csystem dynamics\u201d. A chance encounter with the outgoing mayor of Boston awakened Forrester\u2019s interest in cities and led to the construction of a simulation model of a city at a time when American planners were alarmed by the flight to the suburbs and the hollowing out of urban centres. Forrester called this model \u201curban dynamics\u201d, declaring that he had reduced the problems of the city to a series of 150 equations and 200 parameters. The beauty of a simulation model is that you can try things out. So Forrester did and some of his simulations produced alarming conclusions, suggesting, for example, that the worst thing you can do for a city that is beginning to decay at its core is to build affordable public housing: that just attracts more poor people, erodes the tax base and sends the city into a death spiral, like the one that afflicted Detroit, which suffered a population fall of 600,000 between 1950 and 1980. It\u2019s not clear that Forrester ever believed this, but many policymakers in the Nixon and Reagan eras interpreted the bleak technocratic realism of his urban model as providing \u201cscientific\u201d support for their view that low-income housing programmes would just increase unemployment and reduce upward economic mobility, thereby condemning the underemployed to lifelong poverty. Neither is it clear how much of Forrester\u2019s urban model was incorporated into SimCity. But with hindsight it\u2019s suddenly clear why it often seemed impossible \u2013 at least to this player \u2013 to design planning policies that embodied social justice. In fact, the most successful policies always seemed to be ones that maximised economic growth. Perhaps this was a measure of my incompetence. Or was it just a reminder that the technological is now political too? What I\u2019m reading Daddy still loves you Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social media monster, is 15 years old and still its founder thinks it\u2019s beautiful, as a self-congratulatory post on his own account testifies.

And Twitter is shrinking. The company reported 321 million monthly active users, a year-on-year drop of 9 million and 5 million down on the third quarter.</p> <p>The global success of Facebook \u2013 with its 1.5 billion active users \u2013 and Google has fuelled a size-matters-at-all-costs mantra in digital advertising. Twitter is seeking to change that focus to push a quality-over-quantity message and has unveiled a new metric: \u201cmonetisable\u201d daily active users.</p> <p>\u201cOur goal was not to disclose the largest daily active user number we could,\u201d said Twitter, taking a swipe at rivals by pointing out that its measure is far more accurate, as it only counts users it knows are actually exposed to ads.</p> <p>Snapchat faces the same issue \u2013 earlier this week it saw a jump of more than 20% in the value of its stock after reporting daily active user numbers had stabilised in the fourth quarter, at 186 million, after two straight quarterly declines.</p> <p>Twitter is hoping that its new focus on measuring the most commercially valuable audience will pay off. The decline in its monthly user total is due, in part, to the company taking millions of fake and suspicious accounts off its platform. This has helped restore some credibility with the public. There is still some way to go in terms of building faith among investors.</p>",

Civil servants operating under the watchful eye of cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill are also examining reforms to the regulatory landscape and, separately, how they might put a rocket under what currently passes for a policy to encourage businesses to locate in Britain\u2019s economic hinterlands. No 10 has kept Project After under wraps and little is known about any conclusions that might have been drawn. The theme, we know, centres on encouraging companies that might otherwise depart these shores to stay, and encouraging fresh investment from businesses nervous about setting up shop in a newly outcast UK. When the project was first given the green light, in the weeks after the referendum vote, the common thread was Singapore\u2019s regime of low taxes and light-touch regulation. Tory Brexiters were in the driving seat and argued strongly for cuts to business taxes, more tax breaks for investment and lower capital gains taxes on wealth to mimic the south-east Asian city state. A bonfire of employment laws and \u201cuseless\u201d health and safety regulations was called for, along with a relaxation of private company financial reporting to protect entrepreneurs from prying eyes. As it happens, Sir James Dyson sought out this package of business-friendly measures before deciding where to build his first electric car. Not surprisingly, he picked Singapore ahead of the UK. Tory Brexiters, judging by recent coverage of Project After, remain convinced that the government\u2019s agenda favours cuts to taxes and regulations as the route to winning over businesses like Dyson\u2019s.

He is pessimistic about ministers arriving at a coherent plan, though, whichever route is picked. With free-marketers like Jacob Rees-Mogg on the one hand calling for measures that mimic Singapore, and one-nation Tories on the other calling for more collaboration between unions, businesses and the state, May\u2019s government is as hopelessly divided over its industrial strategy as it is over Brexit. It is understandable that May\u2019s inability to see off Rees-Mogg and his supporters over Brexit fuels concerns that she hasn\u2019t ruled out joining a race to the bottom with Singapore on tax and regulations. For that reason alone she should instruct Sedwill and his team to publish the results of their deliberations and show that at least one arm of government has a straightforward and reasoned plan.

The global success of Facebook \u2013 with its 1.5 billion active users \u2013 and Google has fuelled a size-matters-at-all-costs mantra in digital advertising. Twitter is seeking to change that focus to push a quality-over-quantity message and has unveiled a new metric: \u201cmonetisable\u201d daily active users. \u201cOur goal was not to disclose the largest daily active user number we could,\u201d said Twitter, taking a swipe at rivals by pointing out that its measure is far more accurate, as it only counts users it knows are actually exposed to ads. Snapchat faces the same issue \u2013 earlier this week it saw a jump of more than 20% in the value of its stock after reporting daily active user numbers had stabilised in the fourth quarter, at 186 million, after two straight quarterly declines. Twitter is hoping that its new focus on measuring the most commercially valuable audience will pay off. The decline in its monthly user total is due, in part, to the company taking millions of fake and suspicious accounts off its platform. This has helped restore some credibility with the public. There is still some way to go in terms of building faith among investors.",

I wasn\u2019t prepared for that at all,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s difficult to talk about the people and animals that we love growing old and dying, and the portraits give people a licence to express grief for someone.\u201d</p> <p>Leshko\u2019s photographs, collected in her book <em><a href=\"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo24320304.html\">Allowed To Grow Old: Portraits of Elderly Animals from Farm Sanctuaries</a></em>, are of old and often rather weather-beaten farm animals. You need a bit of a nudge before you see what\u2019s unusual about them \u2013 ie they are <em>old</em>, whereas most farm animals are dispatched to the abattoir in their youth (and in many cases in their infancy).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6005b0f5a2eafcb146100aad876b090d6e787931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6005b0f5a2eafcb146100aad876b090d6e787931/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An unnamed rooster, age unknown, rescued from a factory farm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unnamed rooster, age unknown, rescued from a factory farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Isa Leshko</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The subjects have mostly been rescued from slaughterhouses or farms after the authorities have intervened in cases of cruelty, and taken to live on one of the animal sanctuaries scattered across the US. A few, like the 28-year-old Appaloosa horse Buddy, have been donated when owners became unable to care for them \u2013 in Buddy\u2019s case, painful iritis meant he had to have his eyes removed, and he needed expert care to help him get used to his blindness.</p> <p>Having grown up in an urban, working-class Italian-American family, Leshko began her project in 2008 after encountering a brother-in-law\u2019s old horse, Petey, in her native New Jersey. She was a professional photographer by then, and felt drawn to photograph the horse without knowing why. Later, she came to think that it was a way of making herself confront her own fears of getting old and dying, prompted by her mother becoming seriously ill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This could've been as dry as a rooster\u2019s dust bath, but she describes their personalities like a post-pastoral EB White</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As she visited more sanctuaries, however, Leshko developed her campaigning edge. Already a vegetarian, she became vegan after meeting Valentino, a 19-year-old bull who, as a calf, had been rescued from a dairy farm which would most likely have sold him for veal or beef. \u201cAs I met more animals,\u201d she says, speaking on the phone from her home in New England, \u201cit became important to me that I advocated on behalf of the ones that were not lucky enough to have been rescued. Animal products may be ubiquitous, but farm animals themselves are fairly invisible, and I\u2019m hoping people who read the book might stop to consider these animals\u2019 lives and recognise that they\u2019re individuals, not commodities; that they are sentient, and have unique personalities and emotions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b5b40039ce6abdac5fc44690b737f3c98a8d818\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b5b40039ce6abdac5fc44690b737f3c98a8d818/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abe, a 21-year-old Alpine goat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abe, a 21-year-old Alpine goat, was given to a sanctuary after his guardian entered an assisted living facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Isa Leshko</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, for non-vegetarians who are not unduly fussed about the plight of modern livestock, this could all have been worthily depressing and as dry as a rooster\u2019s dust bath. It isn\u2019t, though, because Leshko puts herself into the book, and describes the animals\u2019 personalities like a sort of grownup, post-pastoral <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White\" title=\"\">EB White</a>.</p> <p>This is partly the story of a woman who starts out not knowing how to open and close a farm gate, and ends up learning how to put animals at ease so she can photograph them in close-up (approach them at eye level; lie in the hay with them for as long as it takes; don\u2019t take your bag into the pen, because they\u2019ll eat it).</p> <p>It\u2019s also about characters like friendly Melvin the Angora goat, and Babs the impossibly stoic, shaggy donkey, who are described in the text with an empathy at times reminiscent of Helen Macdonald\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel\" title=\"\">H is for Hawk</a></em>.</p> <p>Making the text personal makes the book feel warm and open rather than preachy, which seems the right way to go if you really want to \u201cstart a conversation\u201d, as Leshko does.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1442e2a0a7e256cc5ba34ec6553dde30b7f317c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1442e2a0a7e256cc5ba34ec6553dde30b7f317c/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buddy, an Apaloosa horse aged 28, went to a sanctuary after losing his sight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buddy, an Appaloosa horse aged 28, went to a sanctuary after losing his sight.

It is perfectly true that livestock farmers can routinely send hundreds of young creatures to their deaths without much sense of them as individual living creatures. But it\u2019s also true that many of them recognise, appreciate and enjoy the characters of the breeding stock, who are around for years.</p> <p>My mum and dad usually had three or four old pigs they kept back as pets, though they never referred to them as that.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen I began this project, my galleries weren\u2019t sure people would want to buy the prints, because the pictures were too sad,\u201d says the American photographer Isa Leshko. \u201cSo I put a film about the work online. Immediately I was flooded by emails with stories about ageing parents or pets, and when I showed the pictures at some exhibitions, visitors would come up to me in tears. I wasn\u2019t prepared for that at all,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s difficult to talk about the people and animals that we love growing old and dying, and the portraits give people a licence to express grief for someone.\u201d Leshko\u2019s photographs, collected in her book Allowed To Grow Old: Portraits of Elderly Animals from Farm Sanctuaries, are of old and often rather weather-beaten farm animals. You need a bit of a nudge before you see what\u2019s unusual about them \u2013 ie they are old, whereas most farm animals are dispatched to the abattoir in their youth (and in many cases in their infancy). The subjects have mostly been rescued from slaughterhouses or farms after the authorities have intervened in cases of cruelty, and taken to live on one of the animal sanctuaries scattered across the US. A few, like the 28-year-old Appaloosa horse Buddy, have been donated when owners became unable to care for them \u2013 in Buddy\u2019s case, painful iritis meant he had to have his eyes removed, and he needed expert care to help him get used to his blindness. Having grown up in an urban, working-class Italian-American family, Leshko began her project in 2008 after encountering a brother-in-law\u2019s old horse, Petey, in her native New Jersey. She was a professional photographer by then, and felt drawn to photograph the horse without knowing why. Later, she came to think that it was a way of making herself confront her own fears of getting old and dying, prompted by her mother becoming seriously ill. As she visited more sanctuaries, however, Leshko developed her campaigning edge. Already a vegetarian, she became vegan after meeting Valentino, a 19-year-old bull who, as a calf, had been rescued from a dairy farm which would most likely have sold him for veal or beef. \u201cAs I met more animals,\u201d she says, speaking on the phone from her home in New England, \u201cit became important to me that I advocated on behalf of the ones that were not lucky enough to have been rescued. Animal products may be ubiquitous, but farm animals themselves are fairly invisible, and I\u2019m hoping people who read the book might stop to consider these animals\u2019 lives and recognise that they\u2019re individuals, not commodities; that they are sentient, and have unique personalities and emotions.\u201d Of course, for non-vegetarians who are not unduly fussed about the plight of modern livestock, this could all have been worthily depressing and as dry as a rooster\u2019s dust bath. It isn\u2019t, though, because Leshko puts herself into the book, and describes the animals\u2019 personalities like a sort of grownup, post-pastoral EB White. This is partly the story of a woman who starts out not knowing how to open and close a farm gate, and ends up learning how to put animals at ease so she can photograph them in close-up (approach them at eye level; lie in the hay with them for as long as it takes; don\u2019t take your bag into the pen, because they\u2019ll eat it). It\u2019s also about characters like friendly Melvin the Angora goat, and Babs the impossibly stoic, shaggy donkey, who are described in the text with an empathy at times reminiscent of Helen Macdonald\u2019s H is for Hawk. Making the text personal makes the book feel warm and open rather than preachy, which seems the right way to go if you really want to \u201cstart a conversation\u201d, as Leshko does. I grew up on a little farm that had cows, chickens and pigs, and I always felt that neither vegetarians nor hardcore carnivores understood the reality of our relationship with animals. It is perfectly true that livestock farmers can routinely send hundreds of young creatures to their deaths without much sense of them as individual living creatures. But it\u2019s also true that many of them recognise, appreciate and enjoy the characters of the breeding stock, who are around for years. My mum and dad usually had three or four old pigs they kept back as pets, though they never referred to them as that. Leshko\u2019s picture of Teresa the pig, rescued from a truck in Washington DC in 1998, reminds me of our old boar, Champion, who died a natural death after being allowed to retire into a strawy corner. My dad used to go to scratch his back and talk to him after finishing work some nights. Of course, keeping back a few pigs didn\u2019t make us \u201chumane\u201d \u2013 certainly not from the point of view of the ones who didn\u2019t get a reprieve \u2013 but it did mean our capacity for compassion was selective rather than nonexistent. This is what a lot of farm folk mean when they say animal advocates \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d farming (\u201cHow can they call us heartless\u2026 look at how I sat up all night with Daisy!\u201d). Leshko and I have a chat about it \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it gets us anywhere, really (\u201cBut to me, it sounds like me saying to one of my cats, \u2018You\u2019re off to the slaughterhouse\u2019 and to the other one \u2018You can stay\u2019!\u201d), but she does make me think of so many farm stories, like Babe or Charlotte\u2019s Web, that feature wily old animals and escapees as the heroes. Leshko is beginning a new project in which she\u2019ll document the moment of animals\u2019 birth. It will be more challenging than the last one, because \u201cit means being on call so I can be there at the moment it happens\u201d, but she\u2019s an old hand now, with a penchant for having turkeys and chickens sit in her lap.

      "body": "<p>In England, or rather in the comfortable parts of England, to have been a communist is still considered extraordinary. Not in Italy or France, of course, or Brazil or Bengal. Not in South Yorkshire, either, and certainly not in Scotland (whose post-1945 institutions owe so much to discreet communist initiatives).</p> <p>This polite amazement still unbalances assessments of Eric Hobsbawm. In his lifetime, reviewers and interviewers asked: \u201cHow can you still?\u201d Then it became \u201cHow could he have?\u201d This huge life study by <a href=\"http://www.richardjevans.com/#\" title=\"\">Richard Evans</a>, a historian colleague of social-democratic rather than Marxist views, tries to avoid that routine. \u201cThis biography\u2026 while not neglecting Eric\u2019s intellectual and political development, focuses above all on his personal experiences and, indeed, on his inner life.\u201d</p> <p>So Evans keeps Hobsbawm\u2019s engagement with what used to be called Marxism-Leninism generally in the background. Instead, he studies how the political environment of the fearsome 20th century shaped his tastes, career and relationships. His life\u2019s first phase from his birth in Alexandria, Egypt, as a British citizen (he was never a refugee, in spite of his Mitteleuropa Jewish heritage) through a poverty-haunted childhood in Vienna to his arrival, a teenage orphan, in the thrilling and tempestuous Berlin of 1931. The Weimar Republic was dying; the German Communist party was fighting its final street battles against the rising strength of the Nazis.</p> <p>The world was burning. Hobsbawm took fire and joined the fight. How could he not? Evans suggests, a bit weakly, that he joined the Communist party as a way of escaping the shame of his own poverty \u2013 his battered old bicycle was so inferior to the sleek machines of his school friends. More powerful, surely, was his sense of being on the front line of Armageddon. The boy Hobsbawm and his sister, Nancy, lived dangerously, distributing \u201cred\u201d leaflets even after Hitler took power, until their uncle moved the family to Britain in early 1933. (He did it for business reasons, not to escape persecution as most people, myself included, later assumed.)</p> <p>The communists were fighting to take power, not merely to defend the republic against the Nazis. Their defeat, Hobsbawm reflected long afterwards, was the most formative political experience of his life. This was not just because of the drama of the struggle but because \u201cI grew up at the most sectarian point of the socialist-communist split\u201d \u2013 the disastrous Comintern policy of treating fascism and social democracy as equally deadly enemies. Hobsbawm reached London as a starry devotee of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. But in his subsequent political life, he argued constantly for broad left/progressive alliances and against the often paranoid exclusiveness he found in the leadership of the Communist party of Great Britain. This was the strategy that, almost 40 years later, led him into short-lived admiration for New Labour.</p> <p>Hobsbawm once said that he decided to be a historian at the age of 16. Evans can find no evidence for this. Instead, he shows the young Hobsbawm in London furiously reading the Marxist classics but also absorbed in French and German fiction, poetry and literary criticism and, above all, in \u201cnature\u201d. Evans has discovered wonderful, exuberant pages of prose about a London fog, for instance, and Hobsbawm caught the habit of identifying and cataloguing rare birds. Clambering about beloved Welsh hills until near the end of his life, he was no pallid, study-bound intellectual in spite of his enormous output of paper and pipe smoke.</p> <p>Aged 18 and about to enter King\u2019s College, Cambridge, Hobsbawm thought of himself as ugly, \u201ca tall, angular, slim, ugly blond chap\u201d. But if he was going to be distinct, he wanted to stand out and be distinct in ways he had chosen. At his Berlin school, he had been conspicuous as \u201cthe English boy\u201d. Perhaps that suited him. This biography suggests that he kept an instinct to stand at the edge of the play yard, involved in the game up to a point but always visible. In his later politics, above all in his exasperated and exasperating relationship with the leaders of the Communist party of Great Britain, he was never quite \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d. He stood around just inside the pale. Other insiders sometimes told him to get out, while outsiders yelled at him to cross the fence, but he never did. He used to say to friends who asked him why he remained: \u201cNever resign. Wait till they expel you!\u201d But it\u2019s a favour the party didn\u2019t do him, though often sorely tempted. If he had left, he would have been lost in a large, disoriented mob. He often said that he had no intention of becoming an \u201cex-communist\u201d, a club he had no wish to be a member of. He kept faith with the blinding vision of a new, just world that had transformed him in Berlin, at first by trying to subordinate his intelligence and conscience to party discipline, later by fierce but \u201cinternal\u201d criticism of the leadership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c0fe85b411982f0e2172fa5b0686dd93e98c87f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c0fe85b411982f0e2172fa5b0686dd93e98c87f/0_0_1836_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hobsbawm with his children, Andy and Julia, in the 60s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hobsbawm with his children, Andy and Julia, in the 60s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Marlene Hobsbawm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a long time, this taste for living at a tangent to mainstreams steered both his private and his professional life. When he became a historian, he gave most of his energies to the 19th rather than to his own century (it was only in his late 70s that he published the superb <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/age-of-extremes.html\" title=\"\">The Age of Extremes</a></em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/age-of-extremes.html\" title=\"\">,</a> on what he called \u201cthe most revolutionary era in the recorded history of the globe\u201d). <em>Primitive Rebels</em>, which came out in 1959, showed his excitement with marginal popular revolts \u2013 \u201csocial banditry\u201d. At a time when communist orthodoxy sanctified \u201cauthentic\u201d folk music, Hobsbawm doubled himself as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2013/04/eric-hobsbawms-secret-passion-ellington-and-ella\" title=\"\">Francis Newton</a>\u201d, the most sophisticated jazz critic in Britain. The history scholar at grave universities lived an alternative life as a Soho night owl among the \u201ccats\u201d and \u201cchicks\u201d, living for a time with a charming part-time prostitute.</p> <p>By now, he had recovered from a \u201ccomradely\u201d marriage to Muriel Seaman. Neither seemed to know quite what they wanted (\u201cI have to conclude from my feelings that I am in love\u201d). But the marriage limped on for eight years before falling agonisingly to pieces, leaving Hobsbawm in a depression that apparently lasted for years. I don\u2019t think that Evans achieves much beyond readers\u2019 embarrassment by including the whole sad text of Muriel\u2019s final Dear Eric letter.</p> <p>By then, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/mi5-spied-historians-eric-hobsbawm-christopher-hill-secret-files\" title=\"\">under the surveillance of MI5</a>. This had begun during the war, when he served in the Royal Engineers and became an army lecturer delivering \u201csubversively\u201d pro-Soviet ideas and views \u2013 \u201cSecond Front Now!\u201d Although bugging phones and opening mail didn\u2019t turn up anything damning about their target, the MI5 records have given Evans an intriguing resource, second only to Hobsbawm\u2019s vivid and thoughtful diaries.</p> <p>His political statements up to 1956 make unhappy reading. He thought Stalin made \u201ca wise move\u201d with the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 and supported the Soviet attack on Finland as \u201cdefensive\u201d. He condemned renegade defectors from the party such as Arthur Koestler. He noted that it had been \u201csurely not easy\u201d for Feliks Dzier\u017cy\u0144ski (founder of the Soviet secret police) to have people shot, an \u201cobjective cruelty\u201d that was justified by \u201cbelief in the proletariat and the future of the movement\u201d.</p> <p>But Evans confirms how soon, in the postwar decades, Hobsbawm became a thorn in his party\u2019s side, complaining about its lack of internal democracy and its inability to criticise anything Soviet. That was well before the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 shattered British communism\u2019s morale. The party \u201chistorians\u2019 group\u201d fell apart, but gave birth to the intellectual new left while the journal <em>Past &amp; Present</em>, close to Hobsbawm\u2019s heart, rose to rival the independent Marxism of the Annales historians in France.</p> <p>This book shows well how personal relationships helped to develop Hobsbawm\u2019s intense interest in peasant societies, first in southern Europe, especially Italy, and later in Latin America. (He once said to me, ruefully, that there were two institutions he had never expected to survive beyond the 20th century: the Catholic church and the peasantry.) In many of those countries, he became much more famous and widely read than in Britain. Evans has been criticised for including too much detail about income, publishing deals and sales. But it\u2019s impossible to appreciate Hobsbawm\u2019s global impact without knowing that Brazilians, for instance, have bought something near a million copies of his books.</p> <p><em>A Life in History</em> tells the inside story of these now classic works \u2013 the <em>Age</em> sequence of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/age-of-revolution-9780349104843.html\" title=\"\">Revolution</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/age-of-capital.html\" title=\"\">Capital</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/age-of-extremes.html\" title=\"\">Extremes</a></em>, <em>Industry and Empire</em> (my favourite), <em>The Invention of Tradition</em>, <em>Nations and Nationalism</em>, and so on. Will they last? Hobsbawm, ironic and realistic, assumed not: everything is there to be overtaken. Certainly, some gaps are obvious already. He never really \u201cgot\u201d nationalism and he despised postmodernism. Disappointingly, his left-over party instinct couldn\u2019t forgive the indiscipline of the women\u2019s movement for charging passionately forward without waiting for the revolution. In the same way, the fractured \u201cme\u201d politics of identity choices made him despair.</p> <p>Hobsbawm became what they call \u201ca lovely man\u201d, hospitable and wise and movingly loyal to his friends. His marriage to Marlene Schwarz in 1962 really saved him. She gave him an inner happiness to withstand the pessimism he felt about the future as the hope of socialism faded. Evans describes a great savant, honoured but standing \u2013 conspicuously, as usual \u2013 just outside the establishment pale. He lived to the age of 95 without failing in his wit. His books will live long too. This is because they are irresistibly well written. But also because all of them are about how the Many across the globe struggle against the power, arrogance and greed of the Few. That struggle won\u2019t end soon.</p> <p><em>Neal Ascherson is a writer, journalist and former foreign correspondent for the Observer.

In his lifetime, reviewers and interviewers asked: \u201cHow can you still?\u201d Then it became \u201cHow could he have?\u201d This huge life study by Richard Evans, a historian colleague of social-democratic rather than Marxist views, tries to avoid that routine. \u201cThis biography\u2026 while not neglecting Eric\u2019s intellectual and political development, focuses above all on his personal experiences and, indeed, on his inner life.\u201d So Evans keeps Hobsbawm\u2019s engagement with what used to be called Marxism-Leninism generally in the background. Instead, he studies how the political environment of the fearsome 20th century shaped his tastes, career and relationships. His life\u2019s first phase from his birth in Alexandria, Egypt, as a British citizen (he was never a refugee, in spite of his Mitteleuropa Jewish heritage) through a poverty-haunted childhood in Vienna to his arrival, a teenage orphan, in the thrilling and tempestuous Berlin of 1931. The Weimar Republic was dying; the German Communist party was fighting its final street battles against the rising strength of the Nazis. The world was burning. Hobsbawm took fire and joined the fight. How could he not? Evans suggests, a bit weakly, that he joined the Communist party as a way of escaping the shame of his own poverty \u2013 his battered old bicycle was so inferior to the sleek machines of his school friends. More powerful, surely, was his sense of being on the front line of Armageddon. The boy Hobsbawm and his sister, Nancy, lived dangerously, distributing \u201cred\u201d leaflets even after Hitler took power, until their uncle moved the family to Britain in early 1933. (He did it for business reasons, not to escape persecution as most people, myself included, later assumed.) The communists were fighting to take power, not merely to defend the republic against the Nazis. Their defeat, Hobsbawm reflected long afterwards, was the most formative political experience of his life. This was not just because of the drama of the struggle but because \u201cI grew up at the most sectarian point of the socialist-communist split\u201d \u2013 the disastrous Comintern policy of treating fascism and social democracy as equally deadly enemies. Hobsbawm reached London as a starry devotee of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. But in his subsequent political life, he argued constantly for broad left/progressive alliances and against the often paranoid exclusiveness he found in the leadership of the Communist party of Great Britain. This was the strategy that, almost 40 years later, led him into short-lived admiration for New Labour. Hobsbawm once said that he decided to be a historian at the age of 16. Evans can find no evidence for this. Instead, he shows the young Hobsbawm in London furiously reading the Marxist classics but also absorbed in French and German fiction, poetry and literary criticism and, above all, in \u201cnature\u201d. Evans has discovered wonderful, exuberant pages of prose about a London fog, for instance, and Hobsbawm caught the habit of identifying and cataloguing rare birds. Clambering about beloved Welsh hills until near the end of his life, he was no pallid, study-bound intellectual in spite of his enormous output of paper and pipe smoke. Aged 18 and about to enter King\u2019s College, Cambridge, Hobsbawm thought of himself as ugly, \u201ca tall, angular, slim, ugly blond chap\u201d. But if he was going to be distinct, he wanted to stand out and be distinct in ways he had chosen. At his Berlin school, he had been conspicuous as \u201cthe English boy\u201d. Perhaps that suited him. This biography suggests that he kept an instinct to stand at the edge of the play yard, involved in the game up to a point but always visible. In his later politics, above all in his exasperated and exasperating relationship with the leaders of the Communist party of Great Britain, he was never quite \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d. He stood around just inside the pale. Other insiders sometimes told him to get out, while outsiders yelled at him to cross the fence, but he never did. He used to say to friends who asked him why he remained: \u201cNever resign. Wait till they expel you!\u201d But it\u2019s a favour the party didn\u2019t do him, though often sorely tempted. If he had left, he would have been lost in a large, disoriented mob. He often said that he had no intention of becoming an \u201cex-communist\u201d, a club he had no wish to be a member of. He kept faith with the blinding vision of a new, just world that had transformed him in Berlin, at first by trying to subordinate his intelligence and conscience to party discipline, later by fierce but \u201cinternal\u201d criticism of the leadership. For a long time, this taste for living at a tangent to mainstreams steered both his private and his professional life. When he became a historian, he gave most of his energies to the 19th rather than to his own century (it was only in his late 70s that he published the superb The Age of Extremes, on what he called \u201cthe most revolutionary era in the recorded history of the globe\u201d). Primitive Rebels, which came out in 1959, showed his excitement with marginal popular revolts \u2013 \u201csocial banditry\u201d. At a time when communist orthodoxy sanctified \u201cauthentic\u201d folk music, Hobsbawm doubled himself as \u201cFrancis Newton\u201d, the most sophisticated jazz critic in Britain. The history scholar at grave universities lived an alternative life as a Soho night owl among the \u201ccats\u201d and \u201cchicks\u201d, living for a time with a charming part-time prostitute. By now, he had recovered from a \u201ccomradely\u201d marriage to Muriel Seaman. Neither seemed to know quite what they wanted (\u201cI have to conclude from my feelings that I am in love\u201d). But the marriage limped on for eight years before falling agonisingly to pieces, leaving Hobsbawm in a depression that apparently lasted for years. I don\u2019t think that Evans achieves much beyond readers\u2019 embarrassment by including the whole sad text of Muriel\u2019s final Dear Eric letter. By then, he was under the surveillance of MI5. This had begun during the war, when he served in the Royal Engineers and became an army lecturer delivering \u201csubversively\u201d pro-Soviet ideas and views \u2013 \u201cSecond Front Now!\u201d Although bugging phones and opening mail didn\u2019t turn up anything damning about their target, the MI5 records have given Evans an intriguing resource, second only to Hobsbawm\u2019s vivid and thoughtful diaries. His political statements up to 1956 make unhappy reading. He thought Stalin made \u201ca wise move\u201d with the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 and supported the Soviet attack on Finland as \u201cdefensive\u201d. He condemned renegade defectors from the party such as Arthur Koestler. He noted that it had been \u201csurely not easy\u201d for Feliks Dzier\u017cy\u0144ski (founder of the Soviet secret police) to have people shot, an \u201cobjective cruelty\u201d that was justified by \u201cbelief in the proletariat and the future of the movement\u201d. But Evans confirms how soon, in the postwar decades, Hobsbawm became a thorn in his party\u2019s side, complaining about its lack of internal democracy and its inability to criticise anything Soviet. That was well before the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 shattered British communism\u2019s morale. The party \u201chistorians\u2019 group\u201d fell apart, but gave birth to the intellectual new left while the journal Past &amp; Present, close to Hobsbawm\u2019s heart, rose to rival the independent Marxism of the Annales historians in France. This book shows well how personal relationships helped to develop Hobsbawm\u2019s intense interest in peasant societies, first in southern Europe, especially Italy, and later in Latin America. (He once said to me, ruefully, that there were two institutions he had never expected to survive beyond the 20th century: the Catholic church and the peasantry.) In many of those countries, he became much more famous and widely read than in Britain. Evans has been criticised for including too much detail about income, publishing deals and sales. But it\u2019s impossible to appreciate Hobsbawm\u2019s global impact without knowing that Brazilians, for instance, have bought something near a million copies of his books. A Life in History tells the inside story of these now classic works \u2013 the Age sequence of Revolution, Capital and Extremes, Industry and Empire (my favourite), The Invention of Tradition, Nations and Nationalism, and so on. Will they last? Hobsbawm, ironic and realistic, assumed not: everything is there to be overtaken. Certainly, some gaps are obvious already. He never really \u201cgot\u201d nationalism and he despised postmodernism. Disappointingly, his left-over party instinct couldn\u2019t forgive the indiscipline of the women\u2019s movement for charging passionately forward without waiting for the revolution. In the same way, the fractured \u201cme\u201d politics of identity choices made him despair. Hobsbawm became what they call \u201ca lovely man\u201d, hospitable and wise and movingly loyal to his friends. His marriage to Marlene Schwarz in 1962 really saved him. She gave him an inner happiness to withstand the pessimism he felt about the future as the hope of socialism faded. Evans describes a great savant, honoured but standing \u2013 conspicuously, as usual \u2013 just outside the establishment pale. He lived to the age of 95 without failing in his wit. His books will live long too. This is because they are irresistibly well written. But also because all of them are about how the Many across the globe struggle against the power, arrogance and greed of the Few. That struggle won\u2019t end soon.

Roses don\u2019t have to come in red buds and straight stems, they don\u2019t have to smell of desperation. For this we have to thank David Austin, the rose guru, who died at 92 on 18 December last year.</p> <p>Mr A, as his staff knew him, brought romance back to roses, creating the English Rose, a marriage between fragrant Old Roses and the repeat-flowering Hybrid Tea varieties which had largely replaced them before the young son of a Shropshire farmer decided to change all that.</p> <p>It took a decade of dedication before Austin\u2019s Rosa Constance Spry was released in 1961, but still most nurseries were unconvinced. It took another 20 years until his Mary Rose and Graham Thomas (named after his horticultural mentor) established Austin and his English Roses \u2013 colourful, repeat-flowering, deeply fragrant \u2013 in the hearts and gardens of British growers.</p> <p>The rest is Chelsea-gilded history. Graham Thomas was later voted the world\u2019s favourite rose and his Gertrude Jekyll was twice-named the UK\u2019s favourite.</p> <p>We have three roses on our London roof terrace: a spicy apricot that a few years ago won best plant at Chelsea; a Bengal Crimson from Great Dixter and a perfect yellow David Austin, named, I think, after an actress. As I write, the name escapes me but never the repeated flowering and its fragrance.</p> <p>So steer clear of the more obvious flower choices for the 14th. Roses, like people, are rarely at their best after a long-haul flight. Search out something personal, surprising and special. Maybe think about buying a rose for summer flowering. It is what Mr A deserves and would have wanted.</p> <p><em>Allan Jenkins\u2019s Plot 29 (4th Estate, \u00a39.99) is out now.

Roses don\u2019t have to come in red buds and straight stems, they don\u2019t have to smell of desperation. For this we have to thank David Austin, the rose guru, who died at 92 on 18 December last year. Mr A, as his staff knew him, brought romance back to roses, creating the English Rose, a marriage between fragrant Old Roses and the repeat-flowering Hybrid Tea varieties which had largely replaced them before the young son of a Shropshire farmer decided to change all that. It took a decade of dedication before Austin\u2019s Rosa Constance Spry was released in 1961, but still most nurseries were unconvinced. It took another 20 years until his Mary Rose and Graham Thomas (named after his horticultural mentor) established Austin and his English Roses \u2013 colourful, repeat-flowering, deeply fragrant \u2013 in the hearts and gardens of British growers. The rest is Chelsea-gilded history. Graham Thomas was later voted the world\u2019s favourite rose and his Gertrude Jekyll was twice-named the UK\u2019s favourite. We have three roses on our London roof terrace: a spicy apricot that a few years ago won best plant at Chelsea; a Bengal Crimson from Great Dixter and a perfect yellow David Austin, named, I think, after an actress. As I write, the name escapes me but never the repeated flowering and its fragrance. So steer clear of the more obvious flower choices for the 14th. Roses, like people, are rarely at their best after a long-haul flight. Search out something personal, surprising and special. Maybe think about buying a rose for summer flowering. It is what Mr A deserves and would have wanted. Allan Jenkins\u2019s Plot 29 (4th Estate, \u00a39.99) is out now. Order it for \u00a38.49 from guardianbookshop.com",

      "bodyText": "Lemn Sissay, the fantastically gifted poet and vice chancellor of Manchester University, claims that \u201cchildren in care are in danger. They are in danger because they\u2019re being placed with foster carers who are unqualified, unskilled and uninformed.\u201d (\u201cWe don\u2019t value the children \u2013 or those who care for them\u201d, Viewpoint.) His words hold weight because he has experienced first-hand the worst of the care system, works hard to give looked-after children a voice, and is someone I have met and very much respect and admire. But he is wrong. Nearly five years ago I founded a charity to inspire more people to consider fostering and adoption and to better support those that do. I have met thousands and know hundreds of carers. Not one that I know is putting their children in danger, as Lemn claims. Most are more qualified, skilled and informed than you could imagine. I wish Lemn could spend time with these people. I wish he could spend a day with me and see the lengths I go to for the three foster children in my care to flourish. Dr Krish Kandiah Oxon Why Maduro must go Simon Tisdall is right to warn rightists in Washington not to interfere in Venezuela (\u201cOnly Venezuela can solve its problems \u2013 meddling by outsiders isn\u2019t the solution\u201d, Analysis). However, it does not follow that the democratic left worldwide should stay silent at the behaviour of a regime that, if headed by a Pinochet or previous corrupt and criminal South American authoritarian government, would have been met with universal opprobrium. The Socialist International, the global federation uniting democratic socialist, Labour and social democratic parties, issued a statement after its leadership meeting in Santo Domingo last month. The SI general secretary, the Chilean Luis Ayala, was imprisoned and tortured under Pinochet and the SI president, George Papandreou, spent years in exile when the Greek colonels and generals ran Greece on lines very similar to the military crooks who support the Venezuela regime. The SI stated that Venezuela\u2019s May 2018 elections \u201cwere carried out through the outlawing of leaders and political parties, contrary to the democratic norms of competition, freedom and guarantees. The National Assembly is the legitimate authority to lead the democratic transition.\u201d The Voluntad Popular party headed by Juan Guaid\u00f3 is affiliated to the Socialist International and a sister party of the democratic left parties of Europe. By all means tell President Trump not to make matters worse, but anyone who cares for Venezuela should be supporting calls for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to go, the military to leave politics and money-making, and for fair and free elections to be held. Denis MacShane, UK Minister for Latin America 2001-2003 London SW1 A second vote is the only way Regarding your leader (\u201cA parliamentary paralysis, no leadership. So ask the people\u201d), it may be perversely reassuring that the various opinions in parliament regarding the way forward in the Brexit process/debate reflect the opinions in the country in June 2016. The results of the referendum were: 17.4 million (37.3%) voted to leave the EU, 16.1 million (34.6%) voted to remain and 13 million (28%) did not register a vote. That is, no clear decision. The research on public opinion published in your five-page Brexit special (News, last week) shows how the view of the public has clearly changed in the two and a half years since the referendum, with 45% supporting Remain and 28% wanting to leave on the terms of the prime minister\u2019s deal. The case for another referendum is just a common-sense way out of the parliamentary deadlock. Mike Hobday Surbiton, Surrey Tone deaf? No, just history Your review of Green Book (The New Review) is unfair \u2013 there\u2019s nothing \u201ctone deaf\u201d in a showing a racist character misappropriating \u201cblack\u201d culture \u2013 it\u2019s a key part of 20th-century history. Your reviewer and we might not like it, but it happened. Further, the film is as much about class as race \u2013 the patrician south celebrates the black pianist (just another hired help) while the brilliant pianist treats his white employee with amused contempt grounded in his own education, financial standing and social capital. Antony Crossley Chobham, Surrey Children need to take risks Play England welcomes the call from the England children\u2019s commissioner for the government and local authorities to step in and work with insurers to protect adventure playgrounds (\u201cChildren\u2019s tsar in plea to \u2018save our adventure playgrounds\u2019\u201d, News). Adventure playgrounds provide vital opportunities for children to play and to experience risk and challenge, under the supervision of experienced playworkers. They are often run by small charities and provide a lifeline for disadvantaged children and families. The risks posed by playgrounds are extremely low compared with other risks that children face every day, such as traffic, pollution and sedentary lifestyles. No child will learn about risk if they are wrapped in cotton wool. Maybe the insurance industry should take a look at HSE\u2019s advice? Nicola Butler, chair of trustees, Play England, Bristol A rare pleasure Thank you, Barbara Ellen, for such a positive, clear, all-embracing article about life in a mixed community (\u201cAt last someone has spoken up for the pleasures of life in a mixed community\u201d, Comment). Why do so few of our political representatives and leaders present such arguments and viewpoints? As a now-retired teacher in east London and Essex schools for over 30 years, these are the kinds of things I long to hear and read but so rarely do. Peter Wyatt Kenninghall, Norfolk Shedding light on murder The Observer has done a public service with coverage of the new information about the plane crash that killed Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in 1961, particularly the details of a South African connection (\u201cCoups and murder: the sinister world of apartheid\u2019s secret mercenaries\u201d, Focus). A reopened United Nations inquiry into the loss of the plane has found \u201ca significant amount of evidence\u201d that the plane was brought down by another aircraft, with the loss of all passengers and air crew on board. It also found that UK and US intercepts of radio traffic in the area could solve a mystery now almost six decades old, but they have not been provided. The UN special investigator has criticised British and South African authorities for their lack of cooperation with the inquiry. South Africa at the time was under a different regime, but the UN needs at least to know the state or the continuity of the relevant archives. But in the case of Her Majesty\u2019s government, the claim that there is no extra information is not credible. Indeed, it is a scandal that the government has not even agreed to the United Nations\u2019 direct request that Britain appoint a senior official to be the contact person with the investigation. The MI6 chief in the Congo at that time was Daphne Park. When I asked her years later if MI6 was involved in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the country\u2019s first democratically elected prime minister, the same year Hammarskj\u00f6ld died, she replied: \u201cYes, I organised it.\u201d Any claim that MI6 has no material is not credible.

Intense chefs no longer merely want to cook your tea, they want to reflect and honour the landscape through their food. They want to rub up against a Herdwick or grapple fish from a babbling brook with their calloused bare hands.</p> <p>Chefs forage relentlessly as if well-managed agriculture were some filthy, brazen intervention by the 17th century. Hard-crusted, unyielding sourdough is always part of the deal, as is cheesy butter which is either whipped or cultured or both. Invariably, dishes are plated up on bits of crockery for which the word \u201cgnarled\u201d was invented. You just know that people who call themselves artisans will have been involved in your lunch. </p> <p>It\u2019s easy to mock, which is obviously why I just did so. In truth the standard Lake District food story has led to both some very good restaurants and food. And that\u2019s the point. This whole schtick has become so established that diverging from it, cooking in vibrant Technicolor as they do at Gilpin Spice, takes what the Mexicans call cojones and I\u2019ll call guts, because I\u2019m well dragged up. The man responsible is <a href=\"http://www.rouxscholarship.co.uk/page/2009-hrishikesh-desai/\" title=\"\">Hrishikesh Desai</a>, a one-time Roux Scholarship winner with serious experience both here and in the US.

The more laid-back Gilpin Spice opened in 2016. On a wintry lunchtime, the flames flickering a deep-orange welcome at the back of the open kitchen, it feels like exactly the right place to be. Outside there are views of snowy peaks; inside there is the promise of hot and sour and of roasted spice, a nod to the historic trade through nearby Whitehaven. The cooking here is determined to hit every one of your yielding sweet spots.</p> <p>We start very much on the Indian side of the menu, with pani puri, the delicate pastry cups filled with chickpea curry, chaat masala and chopped raw onions (visit with a close friend). There is a small and extremely functional jug \u2013 just look how well it pours \u2013 with which to add a little hot and sour tamarind sauce. These have to go in your gob all in one, regardless of whether that\u2019s your thing or not. It\u2019s a whoosh of crunch, chilli and sweetness. A boisterous puffed rice salad is full of highly spiced nutty things you\u2019ll be happily picking out of your teeth for days to come. There are flaky wedges of flatbread, still warm from the oven. Alongside them for dredging and dipping, there is a tamarind sauce, a tomato chutney and a sugary Thai-style chilli jam.</p> <p>From the list of small plates comes a salad of little gem and pink grapefruit which hits the table with the glorious armpit funk of the fermented fish sauce used in the dressing. It\u2019s both mildly repellent and thoroughly alluring; a plate full of the fresh and the dead. From the more delicate side of the ledger come thick pieces of seared salmon, on a bright yellow sauce of coconut, mustard and turmeric with cubes of pickled root vegetables. It\u2019s all hinged between softness and bite. Smoked mashed potato is pelted with cumin and chilli, formed into cakes, then deep-fried and served on a Thai-inflected chickpea salad, blowsy with pumpkin chutney and dribbled with yogurt spun through ginger.

      "bodyText": "Gilpin Hotel, Crook Road, Windermere LA23 3NF (01539 488818). Snacks and small dishes \u00a35-\u00a312. Larger dishes \u00a312-\u00a317.50 Desserts \u00a36-\u00a38. Wines from \u00a322. Gilpin Spice is an act of bravery, fashioned from raw wood, vibrant dangling lampshades, tamarind, garlic, ginger, noodles and open guttering flames. Its interest in southeast Asia and, in particular, Desi-Chinese food, a venerable amalgam of Chinese and Indian styles courtesy of Hakka immigration into Kolkata, would be bold down London\u2019s Walworth Road. Here, just a polished stone\u2019s throw from Windermere in the Lake District, it\u2019s almost wilful. Over the past few years, courtesy first of L\u2019Enclume and then Forest Side, Holbeck Ghyll, the Old Stamp House, Lake Road Kitchen and a bunch of others, a Cumbrian food narrative has emerged. Intense chefs no longer merely want to cook your tea, they want to reflect and honour the landscape through their food. They want to rub up against a Herdwick or grapple fish from a babbling brook with their calloused bare hands. Chefs forage relentlessly as if well-managed agriculture were some filthy, brazen intervention by the 17th century. Hard-crusted, unyielding sourdough is always part of the deal, as is cheesy butter which is either whipped or cultured or both. Invariably, dishes are plated up on bits of crockery for which the word \u201cgnarled\u201d was invented. You just know that people who call themselves artisans will have been involved in your lunch. It\u2019s easy to mock, which is obviously why I just did so. In truth the standard Lake District food story has led to both some very good restaurants and food. And that\u2019s the point. This whole schtick has become so established that diverging from it, cooking in vibrant Technicolor as they do at Gilpin Spice, takes what the Mexicans call cojones and I\u2019ll call guts, because I\u2019m well dragged up. The man responsible is Hrishikesh Desai, a one-time Roux Scholarship winner with serious experience both here and in the US. He arrived at Gilpin Hotel and Lake House in 2015 courtesy of an Alex Polizzi BBC TV show which followed the Cunliffe family as they attempted to recruit a new chef for their hotel. The rather fancy Hrishi restaurant came first, and soon picked up a star from a tyre company. The more laid-back Gilpin Spice opened in 2016. On a wintry lunchtime, the flames flickering a deep-orange welcome at the back of the open kitchen, it feels like exactly the right place to be. Outside there are views of snowy peaks; inside there is the promise of hot and sour and of roasted spice, a nod to the historic trade through nearby Whitehaven. The cooking here is determined to hit every one of your yielding sweet spots. We start very much on the Indian side of the menu, with pani puri, the delicate pastry cups filled with chickpea curry, chaat masala and chopped raw onions (visit with a close friend). There is a small and extremely functional jug \u2013 just look how well it pours \u2013 with which to add a little hot and sour tamarind sauce. These have to go in your gob all in one, regardless of whether that\u2019s your thing or not. It\u2019s a whoosh of crunch, chilli and sweetness. A boisterous puffed rice salad is full of highly spiced nutty things you\u2019ll be happily picking out of your teeth for days to come. There are flaky wedges of flatbread, still warm from the oven. Alongside them for dredging and dipping, there is a tamarind sauce, a tomato chutney and a sugary Thai-style chilli jam. From the list of small plates comes a salad of little gem and pink grapefruit which hits the table with the glorious armpit funk of the fermented fish sauce used in the dressing. It\u2019s both mildly repellent and thoroughly alluring; a plate full of the fresh and the dead. From the more delicate side of the ledger come thick pieces of seared salmon, on a bright yellow sauce of coconut, mustard and turmeric with cubes of pickled root vegetables. It\u2019s all hinged between softness and bite. Smoked mashed potato is pelted with cumin and chilli, formed into cakes, then deep-fried and served on a Thai-inflected chickpea salad, blowsy with pumpkin chutney and dribbled with yogurt spun through ginger. If these descriptions are not making you purse your lips and Google train schedules, then frankly, I despair. Bigger dishes are playful. Southern Indian buttermilk fried turkey demands to be taken seriously. Here come crisply coated bits of bird, on a huge sauce full of star anise and orange zest, alongside candied beetroot. A round of saddleback pork belly is rubbed with five spice and roasted in a wood-fired oven for 12 hours before being finished on the rotisserie. It is served with a big, sticky, honeyed pork jus. It is a plateful fixed somewhere between a slab of Cantonese roasted meat and a fine Cumbrian Sunday roast fed to you by someone who thinks you\u2019re not looking after yourself properly.

It is of a Conservative prime minister purposefully threatening the people of Britain with all kinds of catastrophic consequences unless they and their elected representatives pipe down and do what she demands. Day after day, as 29 March approaches, dire warnings proliferate about the disruptive, dangerous impact of the no-deal Brexit that Theresa May refuses to rule out. NHS chiefs say that hospitals could run out of life-saving drugs. Top company directors, the CBI and the Bank of England warn of gathering economic storm clouds. A Brexit emergency \u201ccrisis command centre\u201d is being created. If there is no deal, EU officials warn, about five million British and EU citizens will be left in indefinite limbo, with their rights to live, work and even drive enveloped in confusion.

      "body": "<p>In January 2017, days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Bernie Sanders appeared unexpectedly on stage at a rally in Macomb county, Michigan, a perennial political battleground in a state that had slipped from the Democrats\u2019 grasp. The crowd began to stir. A woman shrieked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/08/elizabeth-warren-2020-presidential-race-democrats-trump-foil\">Can Elizabeth Warren reclaim her role as Democrats' top foil to Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who at that moment was in the middle of a fiery denunciation of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), looked up. Peering over his half-moon glasses, he saw the Vermont senator, the New Yorker\u2019s \u201cbrother from Brooklyn\u201d, had arrived ahead of schedule.</p> <p>Schumer gestured frantically that Sanders should wait. But it was too late. The senator, with his unruly mop of white hair, had been spotted.</p> <p>A familiar chorus began: \u201c<em>Bernie! Bernie!\u201d</em></p> <p>Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and Trump won the presidency but in Warren, Michigan, the crowd wanted the independent Democratic socialist whose long-shot presidential bid captured the imagination of a new generation of progressive leaders and activists.</p> <p>Two years on, Sanders faces a decision that will likely determine the arc of his more than 40-year career.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s vitally important for this movement and for this country that he finishes what he started</p> <footer> <cite>Nina Turner, Our Revolution</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Should he run again for president, as he has given every impression that he will, the 77-year-old senator would enter not as an ideological crusader with \u201cpie-in-the-sky\u201d ideas but as the leader of an ascendent movement and a top-tier contender not to be underestimated.</p> <p>The possibility of a second run has hung over Sanders since Trump won. The senator has seemed to grapple for months with the decision, even as his team has moved to put the pieces in place for a presidential campaign. But the question has taken on a new urgency as the Democratic field fills with friends and colleagues.</p> <p>\u201cThe people have finally caught up to Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Nina Turner, the president of Our Revolution, the organization that grew out of his 2016 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important for this movement and for this country that he finishes what he started.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f80ec7da549169b70cba3d1e05f7246d2ffb2a55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f80ec7da549169b70cba3d1e05f7246d2ffb2a55/0_710_3048_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders six months after becoming mayor mayor of Burlington, Vermont\u2019s largest city, in 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders six months after becoming mayor mayor of Burlington, Vermont\u2019s largest city, in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donna Light/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The political terrain has shifted remarkably since Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/26/bernie-sanders-launches-presidential-campaign\">announced</a> his run for president in April 2015, with little fanfare and from a grassy patch outside the US Capitol known as the swamp.</p> <p>Many of the 2020 candidates have embraced Sanders\u2019 most popular economic proposals, such as Medicare for all and a $15 minimum wage. He and his allies were also successful in reducing the influence of so-called super-delegates in the party\u2019s presidential-nominating process, a source of controversy in 2016. And, now, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-democrats-now-identify-as-liberal/\">majority</a> of Democrats now consider themselves \u201cliberal\u201d and hold <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx\">more</a> a more positive view of \u201csocialism\u201d than of \u201ccapitalism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, Sanders was the first to recognize that Trump\u2019s strength was rooted in a kind of conservative populism,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster. \u201cHe understood that you have to be populist to beat populism and, initially, he was the one who articulated most clearly progressive populism.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It isn\u2019t old vs new or progressive vs pragmatic\u2019</h2> <p>No candidate enters the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primaries after winning more than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries\">13m</a> votes and raising nearly<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000528\"> $230m</a>, much of it through small-dollar donations. Should he run, he would start with near-universal name recognition, a loyal following, a digital media platform that reaches millions and an unrivaled donor list. Of the declared 2020 contenders, only Trump has more Twitter followers.</p> <p>But Sanders is also now a known quantity with no chance of repeating the insurgent, expectation-shattering campaign of 2016. The race is likely to be more negative and he would almost certainly face more scrutiny. The Clinton campaign ran no attack ads against him during the 2016 primary.</p> <p>\u201cThis time around,\u201d Lake said, \u201che will be the one who has to worry about a surprise insurgent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/05/2020-presidential-election-candidates-national-conversation\">Can candidates define the national conversation for 2020 amid the chaos? | Art Cullen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early polling suggests Sanders has lost some grassroots support.

The voters who flocked to his campaign because they were wary of a \u201cClinton coronation\u201d or who were disillusioned by party politics will likely have more than a dozen choices in 2020, Fallon said. And this time, there is no \u201cestablishment\u201d favorite \u2013 at least not yet.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t old vs new or progressive vs pragmatic anymore,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, the former US secretary of agriculture who served two-terms as Iowa\u2019s governor. \u201cHis challenge in Iowa is to maintain what he has.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders has remained one of the most popular politicians in America. Central to his appeal is the perception that like his accent, he has hardly changed since he left Brooklyn in the early 60s.</p> <p>Like a well-worn record, Sanders has been railing against economic injustice and Wall Street greed since he started running for office nearly fifty years ago. And his early support for gay rights, opposition to international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and a vote against the Iraq war cemented his image as an \u201cuncompromised\u201d progressive champion.</p> <p>\u201cThere are very few people in politics right now as original as he is,\u201d said Abdul El-Sayed, a former Democratic candidate for governor of Michigan.</p> <p>El-Sayed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/02/michigan-governor-race-progressive-candidates\">ran</a> with Sanders\u2019 imprimatur but lost the primary. But he believes the movement is reshaping the party in profound ways. Weeks before the 2018 election, Sanders returned to Michigan to campaign for Gretchen Whitmer, who beat El-Sayed in the primary and went on to become governor.</p> <p>There are no <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/423055-sanders-tears-into-wall-street-democrats-campaigning-against-his\">shortage</a> of Democrats who do not want Sanders to be the party\u2019s standard bearer in 2020. Many in the party say they would prefer a candidate fresh to the national political scene. While some say the long-serving Independent is more focused on waging internecine battles than leading the resistance to Trump. It\u2019s a criticism his team believes is unfair: since the 2016 election, Sanders has joined Senate leadership, toured the Rust Belt with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, Tom Perez, and fought to protect the ACA.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country</p> <footer> <cite>Donald Trump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sanders also faces sharp opposition from those who believe his diagnosis is wrong and from the party\u2019s centrists who say his liberalism threatens Democrats in conservative districts and battleground states.</p> <p>In his state of the union speech on Tuesday, Trump sought to tap into such fears.</p> <p>\u201cWe are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\u201d the president said, as news cameras pivoted to capture Sanders\u2019 reaction. \u201cTonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d</p> <p>The proclamation led to chants of \u201cU-S-A\u201d in the House chamber.</p> <p>Sanders, stone-faced, rested his chin on his hand.</p> <p>The primary will undoubtedly lay bare tensions within the Democratic party. The candidates are historically diverse: female, black, Hispanic, AsianAmerican, gay, millennial.

In 1968, he moved to Vermont, and shortly after made his first foray into politics.</p> <p>The senator rarely speaks about his own life, his fist-thumping speeches typically devoid of the biographical threads Americans have come to expect.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality</p> <footer> <cite>Bernie Sanders</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On a recent visit to South Carolina for Martin Luther King Jr Day, he tried a new approach.</p> <p>\u201cRacial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,\u201d Sanders told a crowd on the steps of the state capitol.

      "bodyText": "In January 2017, days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Bernie Sanders appeared unexpectedly on stage at a rally in Macomb county, Michigan, a perennial political battleground in a state that had slipped from the Democrats\u2019 grasp. The crowd began to stir. A woman shrieked. The Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who at that moment was in the middle of a fiery denunciation of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), looked up. Peering over his half-moon glasses, he saw the Vermont senator, the New Yorker\u2019s \u201cbrother from Brooklyn\u201d, had arrived ahead of schedule. Schumer gestured frantically that Sanders should wait. But it was too late. The senator, with his unruly mop of white hair, had been spotted. A familiar chorus began: \u201cBernie! Bernie!\u201d Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and Trump won the presidency but in Warren, Michigan, the crowd wanted the independent Democratic socialist whose long-shot presidential bid captured the imagination of a new generation of progressive leaders and activists. Two years on, Sanders faces a decision that will likely determine the arc of his more than 40-year career. Should he run again for president, as he has given every impression that he will, the 77-year-old senator would enter not as an ideological crusader with \u201cpie-in-the-sky\u201d ideas but as the leader of an ascendent movement and a top-tier contender not to be underestimated. The possibility of a second run has hung over Sanders since Trump won. The senator has seemed to grapple for months with the decision, even as his team has moved to put the pieces in place for a presidential campaign. But the question has taken on a new urgency as the Democratic field fills with friends and colleagues. \u201cThe people have finally caught up to Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Nina Turner, the president of Our Revolution, the organization that grew out of his 2016 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important for this movement and for this country that he finishes what he started.\u201d The political terrain has shifted remarkably since Sanders announced his run for president in April 2015, with little fanfare and from a grassy patch outside the US Capitol known as the swamp. Many of the 2020 candidates have embraced Sanders\u2019 most popular economic proposals, such as Medicare for all and a $15 minimum wage. He and his allies were also successful in reducing the influence of so-called super-delegates in the party\u2019s presidential-nominating process, a source of controversy in 2016. And, now, majority of Democrats now consider themselves \u201cliberal\u201d and hold more a more positive view of \u201csocialism\u201d than of \u201ccapitalism\u201d. \u201cIn many ways, Sanders was the first to recognize that Trump\u2019s strength was rooted in a kind of conservative populism,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster. \u201cHe understood that you have to be populist to beat populism and, initially, he was the one who articulated most clearly progressive populism.\u201d \u2018It isn\u2019t old vs new or progressive vs pragmatic\u2019 No candidate enters the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primaries after winning more than 13m votes and raising nearly $230m, much of it through small-dollar donations. Should he run, he would start with near-universal name recognition, a loyal following, a digital media platform that reaches millions and an unrivaled donor list. Of the declared 2020 contenders, only Trump has more Twitter followers. But Sanders is also now a known quantity with no chance of repeating the insurgent, expectation-shattering campaign of 2016. The race is likely to be more negative and he would almost certainly face more scrutiny. The Clinton campaign ran no attack ads against him during the 2016 primary. \u201cThis time around,\u201d Lake said, \u201che will be the one who has to worry about a surprise insurgent.\u201d Early polling suggests Sanders has lost some grassroots support. And in surveys conducted by the progressive Daily Kos website, Sanders has trailed senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHis success in 2016 owed a lot to the contours of the race,\u201d said Brian Fallon, the former national press secretary for Hillary Clinton. The voters who flocked to his campaign because they were wary of a \u201cClinton coronation\u201d or who were disillusioned by party politics will likely have more than a dozen choices in 2020, Fallon said. And this time, there is no \u201cestablishment\u201d favorite \u2013 at least not yet. \u201cIt isn\u2019t old vs new or progressive vs pragmatic anymore,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, the former US secretary of agriculture who served two-terms as Iowa\u2019s governor. \u201cHis challenge in Iowa is to maintain what he has.\u201d Sanders has remained one of the most popular politicians in America. Central to his appeal is the perception that like his accent, he has hardly changed since he left Brooklyn in the early 60s. Like a well-worn record, Sanders has been railing against economic injustice and Wall Street greed since he started running for office nearly fifty years ago. And his early support for gay rights, opposition to international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and a vote against the Iraq war cemented his image as an \u201cuncompromised\u201d progressive champion. \u201cThere are very few people in politics right now as original as he is,\u201d said Abdul El-Sayed, a former Democratic candidate for governor of Michigan. El-Sayed ran with Sanders\u2019 imprimatur but lost the primary. But he believes the movement is reshaping the party in profound ways. Weeks before the 2018 election, Sanders returned to Michigan to campaign for Gretchen Whitmer, who beat El-Sayed in the primary and went on to become governor. There are no shortage of Democrats who do not want Sanders to be the party\u2019s standard bearer in 2020. Many in the party say they would prefer a candidate fresh to the national political scene. While some say the long-serving Independent is more focused on waging internecine battles than leading the resistance to Trump. It\u2019s a criticism his team believes is unfair: since the 2016 election, Sanders has joined Senate leadership, toured the Rust Belt with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, Tom Perez, and fought to protect the ACA. Sanders also faces sharp opposition from those who believe his diagnosis is wrong and from the party\u2019s centrists who say his liberalism threatens Democrats in conservative districts and battleground states. In his state of the union speech on Tuesday, Trump sought to tap into such fears. \u201cWe are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\u201d the president said, as news cameras pivoted to capture Sanders\u2019 reaction. \u201cTonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d The proclamation led to chants of \u201cU-S-A\u201d in the House chamber. Sanders, stone-faced, rested his chin on his hand. The primary will undoubtedly lay bare tensions within the Democratic party. The candidates are historically diverse: female, black, Hispanic, AsianAmerican, gay, millennial. And after an election cycle that saw a historic number of women and minority candidates elected, Democrats are excited for a new generation of leaders who represent the diversity of their base. \u201cThe candidate who will be successful is the one who can speak authentically to a multiracial coalition of progressives in the name of racial, social, gender and economic justice,\u201d said Aimee Allison, the founder and president of She the People, a group focused on electing women of color. This is one area where Sanders has faced the most criticism from Democrats who say his class-based view of economic inequities downplays race and gender. The senator has spent two years working to strengthen relationships in communities of color, especially with black and Latino voters across the south and south-west he struggled to attract in 2016. Bakari Sellers, a former state representative from South Carolina, doubted he would sway many black voters in the south. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for someone who doesn\u2019t go to your school to want to come in and be captain of your football team,\u201d he said. Turner, the head of Our Revolution, said Sanders must do a better job of dispelling the notion that he doesn\u2019t understand race and gender issues. \u201cHe has to revisit his 20-year old self, the Bernie Sanders who was fighting at the University of Chicago, who was standing up against segregation \u2013 the Bernie Sanders who was there when Martin Luther King delivered his I Have a Dream speech,\u201d she said. Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941. His family lived in a small, rent-controlled apartment and struggled to get by on the low wage of his father, a Jewish immigrant from Poland who sold paint. As a college student at the University of Chicago, Sanders joined the Young People\u2019s Socialist League and was active in the civil rights movement. In 1968, he moved to Vermont, and shortly after made his first foray into politics. The senator rarely speaks about his own life, his fist-thumping speeches typically devoid of the biographical threads Americans have come to expect. On a recent visit to South Carolina for Martin Luther King Jr Day, he tried a new approach. \u201cRacial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,\u201d Sanders told a crowd on the steps of the state capitol. In his remarks, he recalled attending King\u2019s historic speech and reminded them that its official name was the 1963 \u201cMarch on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\u201d. \u2018Real accomplishment\u2019 Sanders has sought to address other issues that were seen as shortcomings in 2016 \u2013 his record on gun rights and his lack of foreign policy expertise. In the Senate, he led an effort to end US support for the Saudi-led military operations in Yemen. In December, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats in passing the measure, which amounted to an unprecedented rebuke of the president. Last year, in a Republican-controlled Washington, Sanders successfully pressured Amazon to raise minimum wages for hourly workers. He is now turning his attention to McDonald\u2019s and Walmart. \u201cHe can go into communities that have been left behind and say, \u201cI raised wages for hundreds of thousands of American workers,\u2019\u201d said congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California who joined Sanders in the effort. \u201cThat is a real accomplishment.\u201d But Sanders also faces new challenges. He began the year with an apology to former female staffers after two waves of reports described harassment, sexism and gender discrimination in his 2016 campaign. As a result, a handful of aides and advisers will not be a part of a future campaign. And former campaign manager Jeff Weaver has said he will not return to the role if Sanders runs in 2020. As a decision draws nearer, media speculation \u2013 or what Sanders derisively calls \u201cpolitical gossip\u201d \u2013 has intensified. Did he miss his moment? Has he lost his spark? Is he too old? To all of these questions, his advisers and allies believe the answer is a resounding \u201cno\u201d. Campaigning for candidates in 2018, Turner said he drew crowds as large and energized as ever. He was \u201ctireless\u201d, not tired, she said. And as for his age: \u201cBy their standard, Nelson Mandela would never have been president.\u201d Mandela was 75 when be became president of South Africa. Sanders would be 78 when the Iowa caucuses are held in February 2020. In recent weeks, Sanders\u2019 legion of supporters have staged hundreds of gatherings in bars, coffee shops and living rooms across the country to draw him into the race \u2014 and soon. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the blue wave, we\u2019ve got the tidal wave,\u201d said RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of National Nurses United.

      "bodyText": "Simply put, that\u2019s one of the most remarkable individual performances, collective performances, and one of the most amazing two hours of football you\u2019ll ever watch. Sam Kerr. She raised eyebrows ahead of the season being handed a massive contract and marquee status - and she\u2019s returned that investment, as she has all season, in absolute spades today. Player for player the premiers Victory were on paper a better squad (with the exception of Kerr). Coach Jeff Hopkins has been there before, and got it done. But that wasn\u2019t counting for the inspirational turn from the Perth skipper, who led her team brilliantly, scoring three goals, and putting on an assist for her side\u2019s other goal. Terrific performances from Rachel Hill, Leticia McKenna, Shannon May - in fact, there weren\u2019t too many in white and purple who didn\u2019t deliver today. The premiers crash out. And if you missed any of this one, I humbly suggest you scroll back to the beginning and re-live this one from scratch. What. A. Game. 120 min: Thar she blows! And that, quiet honestly, is one of the most remarkable games of football we\u2019ve seen in the W-League. Forget that it\u2019s a final. Forget that it\u2019s against the premiers. That was something very, very special from Perth Glory. Amazing entertainment. 118 min: Ooph, this is globetrotters stuff now. Hill, who also hasn\u2019t stopped running with a tremendous turn and cross to pick out Kerr, centrally. She tries the acrobatic, first-time volley - but the whistle goes for offside. That really would have been the cherry on top, although the shot did flash over the crossbar. Razzle-dazzle stuff from the Glory. 115 min: It\u2019s something that has to be seen to be believed - after nearly two hours in the hot, hot sun, Perth have lofted a long ball to find Kerr, but it\u2019s been cut out. And as the most forward player on the pitch, the league\u2019s marquee has made a 80m recovery run to force Gielnik out for a corner. She dropped the head, and ran, and ran. What an inspiration! She\u2019s like Cristiano Ronaldo. If Ronaldo played for the team as well, that is. 113 min: And after nearly two hours, Bobby Despotovski has decided one of his players can have a rest. Remarkable stuff. He famously said he was a punisher of a coach - on this showing, he\u2019s not wrong. And finally - Mautz, the obvious substitute from about an hour ago, makes way! Perth\u2019s first substitution of the game, and it\u2019s a defender for a forward. 111 min: All of a sudden its McKenna who keeps finding herself in acres of space. She jinks past her marker, but Mason-Jones does well to stand tall and save the shot with her body. They\u2019re out on their feet, the Victory defenders. Somebody stop the fight. 107 min: We\u2019ve never had a hattrick in a W-League finals match. Well guess what - we have now. Leticia McKenna with some brilliant work once again down the left, and she crosses to find an unmarked Kerr in the middle. How\u2019s the fitness, that\u2019s a great late run, and she tucks home with aplomb. It\u2019s a Kerr hat-trick. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?? Extra-time, second half! 105 min: And we\u2019re back underway. Fifteen minutes to salvage this, the Victory. 105 min: I\u2019m struggling to keep up with this one, I\u2019ll be honest. We\u2019ve had shots, we\u2019ve had niggle. Mason-Jones does brilliantly between the sticks to deny Perth a fourth. That definitely could have been curtains. They need a spark the home side - can this rapidly growing crowd lift the home side in the final fifteen? 102 min: He\u2019s not lost a W-League final in four previous matches, but the experienced Jeff Hopkins has a battle on his hands here. He\u2019s played all three subs, his team is down to ten. It\u2019s all down to the players in dark blue now. Can Nairn and Alleway and Dowie lift their teammates? 99 min: Ay, ay, ay. It\u2019s bad to worse for Victory - we\u2019ve got a red card! That\u2019s pure frustration from Sam Johnson, who tangles with Kerr once again, and as she did in the first half, she\u2019s earned herself a yellow card. She lashes out in frustration - my, the import has to be careful, she\u2019s almost slapped the card out of the referee\u2019s hand! A petulant reaction; just pure anger and disappointment for the Victory centre half - but she\u2019s off, and the premiers are down to ten! 97 min: Can you bloody believe this! It\u2019s Hill. It\u2019s Kerr. It\u2019s goal. For the third time today! A drifted ball finds the Australian out wide, she shrugs her marker, and Mason-Jones flies off her line to smother. But it\u2019s far too much composure from the Matilda - and she lifts the ball brilliantly over the advancing \u2018keeper, and lobs home! 96 min: Sheesh - it\u2019s Kerr again! From the resulting corner Victory fail to clear their lines, and off all people a bobbling ball falls to Kerr inside the box - but her lashed finish drifts agonisingly wide. 94 min: Haven\u2019t Hill and Kerr combined well today? The qualities of Kerr are of course well known, but the American Hill has almost threatened to steal the limelight at times today. They combine once more, but for once the American flyer if offside. It\u2019s those two who combine again a minute later, and only a desperate save off the line from Mason-Jones forces a corner! How close was that! Extra-time: underway! 90 min: So, it\u2019s the sub-less Victory against the three-subs Glory; who will have the legs for another 30 minutes? And will we see a decider; or is this one going all the way to penalties? 90 + 8 min: We\u2019re in deep Fergie time, and Perth loft in a freekick - but Mason-Jones moves well to punch clear. And there\u2019s the whistle. What a pulsating finish to this one! We\u2019ve got thirty more minutes! And those fans arriving to AAMI Park ahead of Victory\u2019s A-League game against top of the table Perth Glory are in for a special treat; there are more turns in this one, you just know it. 90 + 6 min: Well, it is all happening here! A long hopeful ball in and Campbell doesn\u2019t claim. She hears the whistle for a foul though, as she was blocked by a Victory player, but Dowie is down in the background. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s happened to the skipper, but she gets to her feet eventually. 90 + 4 min: She lofts it in, Kerr rises, but it\u2019s Alleway who makes contact. It falls inside for the diminutive sub, who tucks home brilliantly, flicking the desperate fingers of Campbell in the Perth goal, and it rifles home! Just moments away from being bundled out. Can you believe that. Victory are level! And we could be heading to extra time. 90 + 2 min: Well defended from Kim Carroll. The 50+ cap former Matilda has been immense at the back for the Glory, and she shows strength to shield the ball dead for a goal kick. Victory with another set piece. The big centre backs lumber forward. Nairn is over it. 90 min: And we\u2019ve got SIX minutes of added time. Fair enough too, with a few lengthy injury stoppages. Six minutes to salvage their season, the Victory - and to fight the curse of the premiers, who have failed to make the final for three consecutive seasons. 89 min: Good determination from the youngster Cooney-Cross who gets her body between two defenders to draw the foul. Nairn with an important set piece. She fires it in - and who\u2019s there to clear? It\u2019s Sam Kerr! She heads clear, it comes back with interest from Mastrantonio - and again, it\u2019s Kerr who blocks the shot and reefs it clear. She\u2019s everywhere, the Glory skipper! 86 min: Wowee! What a turnaround this. Perth with patient possession - May passes backwards and Naughton does well to hold her pass until she can find Kerr. She twists and turns and then digs out an inch-perfect cross to the far post. Not much Mason-Jones could do there once again, as Hill rises best to nod home! They\u2019ve come from behind the Glory!! And the premiers are on the ropes. 83 min: And here\u2019s the final change for Victory - as sixteen-year-old Kyra Cooney-Cross enters the fray, Mindy Barbieri jogs off. You have to imagine this is the largest game of her life; but expect teammate Grace Maher to give her some encouragement; the then Canberra United youngster famously came on for a W-League debut during a grand final as a fifteen-year-old (if my memory serves correctly). 80 min: A nice combination between Kerr and McKenna, with the striker flicking a nice ball into the path of the midfielder, who loads up from long range and it\u2019s a well-struck effort - but it\u2019s equally well-held. Nairn goes down in backplay, and we have another injury respite, as both sets of players get to the shade for drinks and words of encouragement. 77 min: So, what tricks does Jeff Hopkins have left? He\u2019s already used two subs - one enforced with Mason-Jones, one optional with Grace Maher entering the fray. 74 min: I was just thinking they needed a spark from somewhere, the Glory, and wondering why Despotovski hadn\u2019t gone to the bench to shuffle his pack. But he continues to keep faith with his starting XI, and who else - but Captain Kerr who delivers. 71 min: Glory with a chance to counter, and they build well from the back. Again Kerr looks to release Mautz, but Beard runs her opponent down and the moment is lost. They come again, and this time it\u2019s McKenna with a ball in from the right, and who else - and in such fashion - it\u2019s Sam Kerr on the end of it!! She\u2019s ghosted between two defenders, Alleway lunges desperately to get something on it, but she connects poorly. Kerr, reacts, and stays calm - and Mason-Jones with no chance as one the world\u2019s most lethal finishers tucks home. Game on!! 68 min: Some good work from Gielnik down the right, and she combines with Dowie, with both the tall strikers showing great strength, as well as patience, to hold up play, recycle and probe for openings. Eventually the former Roar striker pings in a cross, but is headed well clear by Kim Carroll. Great passage of play. 64 min: Mautz tries to get something going down Perth\u2019s right, but it\u2019s a disappointing contribution from the American. She\u2019s been quiet today, by her high standards - Perth will need more from her, with defender Angie Beard definitely edging that battle. And it breaks for Kerr, who looks to fashion a shot - but who\u2019s there to stop her? Laura Alleway. Great block! 61 min: So a bit of zip going out of the contest; that long break for injury and perhaps the Melbourne heat taking some of the pulsating end-to-end action we saw late in the first half out of the game now. Or is it just the quiet before a late storm? Perth line up for their first corner of the game. It\u2019s again half-cleared, and Hill tries to spectacular curling effort from long range, but it curls over. 56 min: A break in play as Alleway receives some treatment. Hill with a bit of a flailing arm / elbow which makes contact with the face of the defender. Perhaps fortunate not to go into the book there. Nothing intentionally nasty, but it\u2019s caught the defender. 53 min: And almost a carbon copy of the first half, having absorbed a tonne of early pressure in the first five minutes, Perth now begin to fashion chances of their own. Again it\u2019s May looking to get something happening, but Mason-Jones does well to hold the lofted shot. 48 min: Victory with a set piece, and they look for the imposing figure of Alleway, but the big central defender acrobatically stretches for the delivery, and Perth eventually clear. A minute later Nairn lines up another freekick, and she looks to catch Campbell unawares at her near post. Once bitten, twice shy? Absolutely no way the Perth \u2018keeper was going to be caught at her near post by Nairn. Again. 45 min: So we\u2019re back - and an early comfortable collect for Mason-Jones, and the home crowd give her an encouraging applause. Dumont reportedly failed a half-time concussion test. Remarkable then that the shot-stopper had played out the half? We hope she\u2019s okay - she has had some rotten luck injuries, Dumont. So, some big news ahead of the second half - goalkeeper Casey Dumont has succumbed to injury, and Victory have gone to the bench and thrown on Bethany Mason-Jones. She\u2019s not played all season, and only has a handful of W-League caps to her name. What a time to make an entry! 45 min: So, they huffed and they puffed, the Glory - but after 45 minutes they still couldn\u2019t find the equaliser for a goal that came inside 90 seconds! Some niggle and a fair bit of drama near the end of that stanza; Kerr and Alleway with a coming together which was awarded as a foul against the striker, who was otherwise through clear on goal. 45 minutes more of that, please. 43 min: Ooh-ee! Terrific work from May who combines brilliantly with Hill once again, tricking her player before sneaking a one-two. Hill then looks to cross, and the Perth players appeal for a suspected handball in the box! It definitely appeared to strike the arm of Alleway; but was the arm in an unnatural position? They might have grounds to feel aggrieved, the Glory - penalty not given! 40 min: Meanwhile, at the other end it\u2019s Nairn and Dowie who combine brilliantly, but the Englishwoman is deemed offside, so even if her header had gone in, it wouldn\u2019t have countered. A lively end to the stanza - plenty of noise coming from the players and the crowd, especially as Sam Johnson receives a yellow for another foul on Kerr. That\u2019s some battle going on, as well! 36 min: Victory enjoy some possession, but it\u2019s another fast break, and again it\u2019s Hill and Kerr featuring prominently. Hill cuts into the box and looks to pick out the league\u2019s leading marks(wo)man. Kerr tries to dig it out of her feet but is clattered into by Mastrantonio. She goes to ground and appeals for a penalty, in vain - even with two extra referees, nobody fancies it! A few bronx cheers from home fans, but in reality that was one of those that could have gone either way, you suspect. 32 min: So, a very intriguing battle at this stage. They\u2019re not exactly sitting back, the Victory, but they are affording Glory a fair chunk of possession. They\u2019re defending well with two banks of four, but they won\u2019t want to invite a team including somebody like Sam Kerr to attack too often. 27 min: She\u2019s no shrinking violet herself, Nikki Stanton, but she\u2019s caught up in one hell of a running ding-dong with Dowie so far. She\u2019s like an English Matt Simon, the Victory talisman, and eventually is penalised for a \u201crobust\u201d sequence of shoulder-to-shoulder with the American defender. 24 min: Great hands! That\u2019s better from Campbell in the Glory goal, after Ella Mastrantonio seized on a half-clearance and fired a fierce first-time strike on goal. She doesn\u2019t score many, the former Glory midfielder. Don\u2019t think she\u2019d be too popular in her native Fremantle if that one had gone in. 20 min: Hill again the outlet down the left - she\u2019s really rapid, and the former Matilda Allen will need all her experience and guile to handle her. She tries a shot from distance, but it sails harmlessly over the bar. Victory were all over their visitors for the first five minutes, but have Perth settled better since then? 17 min: Great speed from Hill who rounds Teigen Allen with ease. She couldn\u2019t quite find Kerr in the middle, and Victory clear. This is a good little spell for the visitors. Shannon May starting to pull the strings in midfield with some patient passing. 14 min: This is frenetic stuff, as you\u2019d imagine from a semi-final. Kerr again runs at the Victory defence, this time turning provider as she slides a terrific ball to the American Rachel Hill. Dumont is off her line in a flash to smother, but she\u2019s copped a nasty knock to the face for her efforts. She\u2019s back on her feet, the Victory shot-stopper, to applause from the home crowd. 12 min: Freekick just inside the Perth half, for Victory. Nairn lumps long, and Gielnik wins the contest and it breaks kindly for Dowie. The skipper looks to fashion a shot, but she\u2019s well marshalled by the Glory defence. Shot blocked, and it\u2019s scrambled clear! 8 min: First real look at Sam Kerr, who twists and turns to lose the attention of Laura Alleway - what a battle that will be today between two terrific Matildas. She runs from deep, perhaps 40m out and evades the attention of 2-3 Victory defenders to fashion a shot - but it\u2019s well held by Dumont. Something from nothing, that\u2019s why she\u2019s the league\u2019s marquee! 5 min: So a far from ideal start from the visitors. What can Bobby Despotovski do to settle his side? Gielnik now gets a free header inside the box - but it was a tricky angle, and perhaps she had time to control and try to turn and shoot. They\u2019re right on the back foot from the get-go, are Perth. 2 min: My, ooh my! That\u2019s one hell of a start. And poor Eliza Campbell in the Glory goal looks like she would happily let the ground open up and swallow her. It was the veteran American in a benign-enough part of the ground, near the far touchline, from an acute angle - but her mishit cross swerved fiercely towards the near post, and caught the Glory shot-stopper out - flicking the fingers on its way into the roof of the net! 1 min: And we\u2019re underway - Victory in their traditional dark blue, Perth, in their change strip of white, with purple trim. Okay! The players are out on the field. Victory coach Jeff Hopkins boasts a four from four record in W-League finals; not too shabby - between him and the experience of players like Dowie, Nairn and Alleway you\u2019d imagine there\u2019s plenty of calm heads to prepare this Victory squad for today. So, your predictions today? Don\u2019t forget to fire me an email or tweet to get your name up in lights. For mine, as much as I\u2019m hoping Sam Kerr will light up this contest, just so that we can greedily see her for another domestic final, I can\u2019t go past this Victory XI. Too much experience and class across the pitch, and in Natasha Dowie (not to mention Emily Gielnik) they have players capable on their day of winning a game by themselves as well. Hi all! We\u2019re not too far away from our opening fixture of the day, so first some team news. Melbourne Victory: Perth Glory: It feels a long time since Melbourne Victory were a force in the W-League; in reality it\u2019s only four years since their last finals appearance, and five since their previous Championship - but such has been the dominance of their cross-town rivals Melbourne City since their entry to the competition they\u2019ve been very much relegated to the role of poor cousin. Until now. Natasha Dowie has lead from the front, aided by the vastly experienced Laura Alleway at the back, and former Sydney FC duo Casey Dumont and Teigen Allen, and of course the ever-willing Christine Nairn. Standing in their way for the double is of course an intimidating Perth Glory led by the one and only Sam Kerr. They may have only just squeaked into the finals but you get the sense that the league\u2019s inauguaral marquee, voted as a top three player in the world recently, might just find an extra gear today. Kick-off isn\u2019t too far away - we\u2019ll also have an A-League top of the table clash between these two sides, but in male version, a bit later as Tony Popovic and Kevin Muscat\u2019s men go head to head; and stick around for the second of the W-League finals later on as Brisbane Roar play host to Sydney FC. As always we\u2019ll be round the grounds, so look out for AFLW, Big Bash, NBL action and more - all here, on Sunday Sportwatch!",

      "bodyText": "Government ministers have repeated claims that all 1,000 or so refugees in offshore detention would receive medical transfer under the Kerryn Phelps bill \u2013 but failed to explain if that meant they are all sick. The Coalition government is strenuously fighting against amendments to Australia\u2019s medical evacuation rules, which would give doctors more say in who needs to be transported for treatment. Under the amendments Labor originally supported, the minister could reject a transfer on national security grounds, but would need to do so within 24 hours, with an independent health panel set up to review the rejections. On Sunday, David Coleman and Christopher Pyne were the latest government ministers who argued against changes to existing medical evacuation rules, claiming it would result in all Manus Island and Nauru detainees being sent to Australia. But they dodged answering whether or not that meant the 1,000 or refugees and asylum seekers under Australia\u2019s care in the offshore centres were all ill enough to require transfer. Pyne said all refugees and asylum seekers \u201ccould all qualify\u201d for medical transfer to Australia, but dodged if that meant they were all ill. \u201cThe bottom line is: we\u2019re not prepared to weaken border protection,\u201d he told the ABC in a somewhat combative interview. When asked \u201chow it\u2019s got to the point where almost all of them are ill\u201d, Pyne responded that the point was \u201cwe\u2019ve stopped the boats\u201d. When the interviewer told Pyne the original question was not answered, the defence industry minister followed up with another answer on border protection. Pyne said the government\u2019s opposition to changes was the challenge to the home affairs or immigration minister\u2019s use of discretion, a process which already exists, and is already under challenge in the federal court. \u201cWhat they\u2019ll find is that they will be able to appeal the minister\u2019s use of the discretion,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cLabor knows that.

As a compromise to head off a potential defeat, the Coalition government has offered to set up its own medical review panel, which would leave the final decision with the minister. In the mean time, it has continued to push back against the proposed changes, using leaked security agency advice provided to the home affairs department as proof the changes would be detrimental to Australia\u2019s border security. The leak of that advice has been referred to the Australian federal police for investigation.

      "bodyText": "Opponents of a plan to build an Apple store in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square have started a crowdfunding campaign to raise $40m to buy the Yarra Building to protect it from demolition. The fundraising stunt \u2013 which comes with a promise from organisers that they will never call in the pledges made by supporters \u2013 comes as Heritage Victoria is preparing to consider a development application by the Federation Square authority. The Victorian government announced its approval of the plan to build a flagship Apple store in Federation Square in December 2017. The plan, which requires the demolition of the Yarra Building, was met with considerable community opposition, including opposition from Melbourne City Council. Heritage Victoria has received more than 2,000 submissions, mostly opposing the proposal, since the application for demolition and redevelopment was opened for public comment two weeks ago. Submissions close on Wednesday, the day before Heritage Council Victoria, the independent body which determines whether buildings will be listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, is due to hold a directions hearing on whether to list Federation Square. The full hearing is scheduled for April. Brett de Hoedt, the spokesman for community group Our City, Our Square, accused the Federation Square authority of \u201cplaying dirty\u201d by submitting the application before the Heritage Council hearing. De Hoedt said that allowing Apple to build its flagship store in the public square, which also houses the National Gallery of Victoria and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) \u201cwill turn Fed Square into a lobby for Apple\u201d. He said the crowdfunding campaign was designed to protest the commercialisation of the square. \u201cIt\u2019s never been about the architecture, it\u2019s about preserving that public space for the public,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no design that is going to satisfy us.\u201d The Yarra Building has been slated for use as a commercial structure since Federation Square opened in 2002 and was not part of the original design competition, though it was built using the same concepts and materials. Its main tenant is the Koorie Heritage Trust, which will be moved across the square to the Alfred Deakin Building. The Federation Square authority said the Yarra Building has never met financial or visitor expectations and that, if the development permit was not approved, it will \u201cexperience considerable adverse economic impact associated with the decline in commercial activity at Federation Square\u201d. The proposed Apple store would be managed on a 21-year lease and be one of six flagship stores around the world. Apple has redesigned its proposal from the concept unveiled in December 2017 following a series of working groups with the City of Melbourne and various government agencies. The new design is a slightly smaller building, still four storeys high, that resembles a box floating on another glass box, surrounded by more extensive landscaping sloping down to the Yarra River. It was approved, with some conditions, by the Victorian government in September, despite ongoing concerns from the City of Melbourne. A review by the City of Melbourne said the updated plans \u201cstrongly contrasts\u201d with the existing architecture in Federation Square and would \u201cvisually compete\u201d with other landmarks like the Ian Potter Centre, Flinders Street Station, and St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in a way it suggested was inappropriate for a retail building. But in a heritage impact statement completed on behalf of the Federation Square authority, Prof Donald Bates, whose firm originally designed the square, said the space was intended to change with time. De Hoedt said Melbourne would be an ideal site for an Apple flagship store, provided it was placed in an existing commercial district. \u201cHeaven forbid they build it in Docklands and rejuvenate that dump,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Jamaican distance runner Kemoy Campbell was taken to the hospital on Saturday after he collapsed and stopped breathing during the men\u2019s 3,000m at the Millrose Games in New York. Campbell, 28, was acting as the pace-setter during the sixth lap when he fell off the banked track into the infield near where the men\u2019s shot put competition was under way. Spectators watching from trackside and the balcony in the southwest corner of the Armory screamed in vain for the race to stop while track officials tried to resuscitate the 2016 Olympian until the arrival of paramedics, who performed CPR and treated him with an automated external defibrillator as he lay immobile. Once the men\u2019s 3,000m was completed despite the chaotic scene unfolding by the second turn, the meet was suspended for about a half hour as police and EMTs continued to treat Campbell. An eyewitness said the former University of Arkansas star, who competed in the 5,000m at the Rio Olympics and has been hailed as Jamaica\u2019s first world-class distance runner, was breathing and showing a pulse but still unconscious when he was carried out of the arena on a stretcher and transported to NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center across the street in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights neighborhood. A fire department spokesperson did not immediately provide information on Campbell\u2019s condition, nor did competition organizers. After the meet resumed Ethiopia\u2019s Yomif Kejelcha won the prestigious Wanamaker Mile in 3min 48.46sec, a single one-hundredth second off the world indoor record set by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1997.",

Pyne said that was not going to happen. \u201cIt will take time to draft those 40 pieces of legislation and to get them right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so many times over the years, we\u2019ve seen legislation introduced into the parliament to try to fulfil an unnecessary schedule, you know delayed requirement that\u2019s apparently been set by someone and then only a few months later, having to come back to fix that legislation because we got it wrong. \u201cSo we\u2019re not prepared to do that. We want this to be a proper response. We\u2019ve said that we will take action on all 76 of the recommendations of the royal commission. \u201cWe will tread carefully on mortgage brokers because we don\u2019t want to smash competition in the banking sector. \u201cIronically, Labor is taking the side of the big banks by removing competition of the 16,000 mortgage brokers. \u201cWe won\u2019t be doing that. We\u2019ll be treading more carefully and this is exactly why we won\u2019t be rushing legislation into the parliament for a feverish two-week sitting just to please Bill Shorten and the Labor party.\u201d Labor has not ruled out moving a motion to amend the existing sitting calendar, which would need all the support of all the crossbenchers to succeed. All have indicated to Guardian Australia they are open to recalling parliament, with Bob Katter considered the crucial vote. The government has included debate on superannuation as part of the sitting schedule for the next two weeks, which includes legislation which would penalise superannuation fund trustees for breaching best interests obligations.",

      "body": "<p>As I drove down Highway 6 toward the Rocky Mountains on 20 April 1999, hoping to find this high school I had never heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/22/usgunviolence.usa5\" title=\"\">in Columbine</a>, where shots had been reported but no injuries, I had no conception of what I was about to witness. What was happening inside that high school was unimaginable. What it ignited was far worse.</p> \n<p>Who could have known what we were in for? The police weren\u2019t ready: they surrounded the school and waited for demands that never came. There was no active shooter protocol; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/09/lockdown-nursery-rhyme-kindergarten-school-shooting-response\" title=\"\">\u201clockdown drill\u201d </a>was still unconceived and inconceivable. Why would we drill kids to hide from gunmen? None of us had an inkling that the school shooter era had begun.</p> \n<p>The school shooter era. Even 10 years after Columbine, I still couldn\u2019t perceive what we were living through in that way. No one could. It had been going on far too long, but it was hard to predict its endurance or trajectory. While I despise the media scorekeeping \u2013 awarding the killers titles like prizefighters, giving them exactly what they crave \u2013 one stat is worth noting: what was then the most notorious mass murder in recent American history no longer ranks in the top 10. Four of the five deadliest attacks in the US have occurred since then, three of them in the past three years. In a five-day period near the end of last month, the US suffered four mass murders in four different states: Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Florida. This is not going away, it\u2019s getting worse.</p> \n<p>Twenty years later, I am still on this story not just because of what happened, but also because of how the media responded. We got it wrong. Absurdly wrong. We were shocked and horrified and desperate for answers, serving a public hungry for a reason for the \u201cmadness,\u201d so we found an answer. It was wrong.</p> \n<p>Since 20 April 1999, I have studied most of the major mass shootings and some of the smaller ones. I have written about them individually and collectively. I have joined the Academy of Critical Incident Analysis (ACIA) team in studying several incidents, including on-site studies at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/apr/19/broadcasting.usnews\" title=\"\">Virginia Tech</a> after the 2007 shooting and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-active-shooter-harvest-country-music-festival\" title=\"\">Las Vegas</a> in 2017, and an off-site analysis of Norway\u2019s 2011 Workers\u2019 Youth League attack in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/23/utoya-mass-murder-anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\"> Ut\u00f8ya</a>. A troubling trend emerged: many of the mass murderers emulated Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The FBI released more than 1,500 pages of documents about the horror at Sandy Hook elementary school in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/newtown-shooting-quiet-town-shooting\" title=\"\">Newtown, Connecticut</a> in 2012, when Adam Lanza killed 20 first-grade students and six members of staff, as well as his own mother. It details just how obsessively Lanza was following Harris and Klebold. He amassed a hoard of Columbine information on his hard drive, frequented a chat room dedicated to the attack, and role-played the killers in an online game. If only this were an isolated incident.</p> \n<p>I experienced two breakdowns of secondary traumatic stress seven years apart writing <em>Columbine</em>, so I studied the subsequent tragedies at a safe emotional distance and swore I would never plunge back into the scene of a crime. Last year, when a shooting erupted at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/14/florida-shooting-school-latest-news-stoneman-douglas\" title=\"\">Parkland, Florida</a>, I broke that promise, because Parkland seemed different. The Parkland students immediately led an uprising against lax gun laws. Emma Gonz\u00e1lez hit back. David Hogg called out adult America for letting children die. The nation was galvanised, and five weeks later, their band of high school students led one of the largest protests in American history.</p> \n<p>Any reasonable observer outside the US would have concluded long before the Parkland shooting that something had to be done.

Every other reporter in the field had apparently uncovered their motives: the killers had targeted two groups, jocks and black people, and were obviously racists striking back against ruthless bullying.

Journalists began the afternoon with leading questions, and Columbine students acquiesced so easily, because smaller-scale school shootings had already been afflicting us, and there was a widespread \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the shooter profile: bullied loner outcasts.

An exhaustive secret service study found that most of the school shooters during that period were distraught and deeply depressed, with suicidal thoughts or intentions. Most felt a sense of loss or failure, and seemed to be crying out in desperation for a sense of power and a voice. They were rarely targeting the individuals they killed; the victims were collateral damage in the service of an impressive body count. I have taken to calling them spectacle murders, because they are essentially performances \u2013 and without the media, they have no stage. No voice.

The manifesto at <a href=\"https://nonotoriety.com/\" title=\"\">nonotoriety.com </a>is quite modest and sensible, calling on journalists not to stop naming or showing killers entirely, but to \u201cminimise harm\u201d. It asks them to \u201climit the name to once per piece as a reference point\u201d and downplay photos, for example, putting them below the fold in newspapers. Yet even though Anderson Cooper began refusing to name mass killers on his highly rated CNN show <em>AC360</em>, demonstrating how easy it was, very few shows followed. In 2015, People magazine became the first major publication to adopt a No Notoriety policy. In November 2018, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shani/the-buzzfeed-editorial-standards-and-ethics-guide#.glYYEy21PJ\" title=\"\">BuzzFeed</a> announced a new harm-reduction policy directing reporters and editors to end the gratuitous use of the names or images of mass shooters.</p> \n<p>For many outlets, the problem remained that the killers tended to be more interesting than their victims \u2013 not just to journalists, but to readers and viewers. As the recent controversy around the forthcoming Ted Bundy film illustrates, humans will always be fascinated by criminal minds. It\u2019s why cop shows dominate TV and crime fiction sells. We in the media can diminish the killers\u2019 profiles, but as long as the audience craves stories about them, they will become famous.</p> \n<p>In the case of school shootings, that conundrum seemed unsolvable \u2013 until the Parkland kids flipped the script. David Hogg became the first mass shooting victim to become more famous than his attacker. It took him less than 24 hours. Two days later, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez went viral with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/feb/19/after-florida-i-had-lost-hope-then-i-saw-emma-gonzalez\" title=\"\">\u201cWe call BS\u201d</a> speech and was a household name across the US and much of Europe. In her first week on Twitter, she surpassed a million followers. Their attacker is a nobody.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d332f6ed-9ff6-4933-86b6-f468ab02e93d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BNT7wbnxRyQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When writing my book about Parkland, I chose to erase the killer\u2019s name. It was an easy choice. He is insignificant. We need to study these killers as a class, but the FBI has done that. It wasn\u2019t a tough decision, though. The Parkland kids made it easy. I didn\u2019t go to Parkland to cover the gunman, I went because I was fascinated by the students. America was fascinated. The world was fascinated. In November, Archbishop Desmond Tutu bestowed on them the International Children\u2019s Peace prize, calling their campaign \u201creminiscent of other great peace movements in history\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Parkland students decided in the first few days that they needed to speak with one voice, and focus on gun safety. March for Our Lives followed on 24 March 2018. Estimates state that between 1.4 and 2.1 million people marched in the US that day, making it the third or fourth largest one-day protest in American history, equivalent to the largest protest of the Vietnam war era, led by college students, who had been rallying for the better part of a decade. The Parkland uprising was organised by high school students in five weeks. </p> \n<p>When Parkland was attacked last Valentine\u2019s Day, supporting gun safety was considered politically toxic. Suddenly, for the first time in a generation, it is starting to grow politically toxic to <em>oppose </em>it. The NRA is not rolling over and the battle will rage for years, but the Parkland kids have achieved stunning success in the first year. State legislatures reversed the NRA momentum, passing 67 laws tightening access to guns. But the big prize was the November midterms. Democrats finally stopped cowering on gun laws, ran on reforming then, and retook the House of Representatives. Even Republicans in some key swing districts ran on gun safety. They didn\u2019t all win, but the movement exceeded the wildest expectations last February of what they might accomplish.</p> \n<p>The Parkland kids have also helped to solve another problem: robbing spectacle murderers of the spotlight they crave. I was pleased to discover that, while doing media interviews for my book, hardly any journalists could recall the Parkland shooter\u2019s name \u2013 even those who had covered the story. Yet millions of American schoolchildren can name a dozen of the March for Our Lives kids, and follow them daily on social media.</p> \n<p>These survivors have truly eclipsed their killer. The solution was very simple: they did something more powerful.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/parkland-9781787477070.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Parkland: Birth of a Movement</a> by Dave Cullen is published by Riverrun.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "As I drove down Highway 6 toward the Rocky Mountains on 20 April 1999, hoping to find this high school I had never heard of in Columbine, where shots had been reported but no injuries, I had no conception of what I was about to witness. What was happening inside that high school was unimaginable. What it ignited was far worse. Who could have known what we were in for? The police weren\u2019t ready: they surrounded the school and waited for demands that never came. There was no active shooter protocol; the \u201clockdown drill\u201d was still unconceived and inconceivable. Why would we drill kids to hide from gunmen? None of us had an inkling that the school shooter era had begun. The school shooter era. Even 10 years after Columbine, I still couldn\u2019t perceive what we were living through in that way. No one could. It had been going on far too long, but it was hard to predict its endurance or trajectory. While I despise the media scorekeeping \u2013 awarding the killers titles like prizefighters, giving them exactly what they crave \u2013 one stat is worth noting: what was then the most notorious mass murder in recent American history no longer ranks in the top 10. Four of the five deadliest attacks in the US have occurred since then, three of them in the past three years. In a five-day period near the end of last month, the US suffered four mass murders in four different states: Louisiana, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Florida. This is not going away, it\u2019s getting worse. Twenty years later, I am still on this story not just because of what happened, but also because of how the media responded. We got it wrong. Absurdly wrong. We were shocked and horrified and desperate for answers, serving a public hungry for a reason for the \u201cmadness,\u201d so we found an answer. It was wrong. Since 20 April 1999, I have studied most of the major mass shootings and some of the smaller ones. I have written about them individually and collectively. I have joined the Academy of Critical Incident Analysis (ACIA) team in studying several incidents, including on-site studies at Virginia Tech after the 2007 shooting and in Las Vegas in 2017, and an off-site analysis of Norway\u2019s 2011 Workers\u2019 Youth League attack in Ut\u00f8ya. A troubling trend emerged: many of the mass murderers emulated Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The FBI released more than 1,500 pages of documents about the horror at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, when Adam Lanza killed 20 first-grade students and six members of staff, as well as his own mother. It details just how obsessively Lanza was following Harris and Klebold. He amassed a hoard of Columbine information on his hard drive, frequented a chat room dedicated to the attack, and role-played the killers in an online game. If only this were an isolated incident. I experienced two breakdowns of secondary traumatic stress seven years apart writing Columbine, so I studied the subsequent tragedies at a safe emotional distance and swore I would never plunge back into the scene of a crime. Last year, when a shooting erupted at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, I broke that promise, because Parkland seemed different. The Parkland students immediately led an uprising against lax gun laws. Emma Gonz\u00e1lez hit back. David Hogg called out adult America for letting children die. The nation was galvanised, and five weeks later, their band of high school students led one of the largest protests in American history. Any reasonable observer outside the US would have concluded long before the Parkland shooting that something had to be done. In fact, as the death count rose, media and public attention had waned. The nonprofit news organisation The Trace has studied media coverage of these tragedies, and measured a significant decrease in coverage by 2018. Nearly two decades into this epidemic, the US had settled into a state of defeatism. We had good reason. In the wake of Columbine, America was united in one idea \u2013 that something had to change in three obvious areas: police, schools and guns. The police surrounding Columbine High had failed to consider the possibility that the gunmen had no demands. They just wanted to kill people. After considerable analysis, police forces across America upended their response to these attacks with the active shooter protocol. They now neutralise most major attacks within minutes, saving countless lives. Schools responded too, with threat assessment teams, lockdown drills and advance coordination with law enforcement, who now have blueprints to their buildings and alarm codes. The changes were swift, and dramatic, but they were primarily aimed at reducing the death count once bullets were already in the air. On prevention? On minimising the ability of perpetrators to arm themselves to the hilt, US politicians responded with ... nothing. Worse than nothing, they have regressed. Columbine brought great hope for gun control, but almost no meaningful legislation. Politicians of all stripes were afraid of the power of the National Rifle Association (NRA). In 2000, vice-president Al Gore stuck his neck out. He defied the conventional wisdom that gun control was politically toxic, ran on it and lost the electoral college, by a whisker, in two southern states he should have carried easily. Either one would have led to him defeating George W Bush. Guns were blamed, and the Democrats went from squeamish on gun control to terrified. In the media, meanwhile, we carry at least some of the blame for this spiralling problem. What I failed to grasp that day I arrived in Columbine was how we were botching the story \u2013 and the staggering ramifications of mislaid good intentions. I had no idea that I might be playing a role, and bear some responsibility for the children still dying around us two decades later. My first clue came that evening, on my drive home to Denver. I had filed a report by phone to Salon.com in San Francisco. I flipped on the radio for some respite and there was no music.

Most felt a sense of loss or failure, and seemed to be crying out in desperation for a sense of power and a voice. They were rarely targeting the individuals they killed; the victims were collateral damage in the service of an impressive body count. I have taken to calling them spectacle murders, because they are essentially performances \u2013 and without the media, they have no stage. No voice. We play right into their hands. The No Notoriety movement began to gain a foothold about a decade after Columbine, but didn\u2019t really gain momentum until 2015. The manifesto at nonotoriety.com is quite modest and sensible, calling on journalists not to stop naming or showing killers entirely, but to \u201cminimise harm\u201d. It asks them to \u201climit the name to once per piece as a reference point\u201d and downplay photos, for example, putting them below the fold in newspapers. Yet even though Anderson Cooper began refusing to name mass killers on his highly rated CNN show AC360, demonstrating how easy it was, very few shows followed. In 2015, People magazine became the first major publication to adopt a No Notoriety policy. In November 2018, BuzzFeed announced a new harm-reduction policy directing reporters and editors to end the gratuitous use of the names or images of mass shooters. For many outlets, the problem remained that the killers tended to be more interesting than their victims \u2013 not just to journalists, but to readers and viewers. As the recent controversy around the forthcoming Ted Bundy film illustrates, humans will always be fascinated by criminal minds. It\u2019s why cop shows dominate TV and crime fiction sells. We in the media can diminish the killers\u2019 profiles, but as long as the audience craves stories about them, they will become famous. In the case of school shootings, that conundrum seemed unsolvable \u2013 until the Parkland kids flipped the script. David Hogg became the first mass shooting victim to become more famous than his attacker. It took him less than 24 hours. Two days later, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez went viral with her \u201cWe call BS\u201d speech and was a household name across the US and much of Europe. In her first week on Twitter, she surpassed a million followers. Their attacker is a nobody. When writing my book about Parkland, I chose to erase the killer\u2019s name. It was an easy choice. He is insignificant. We need to study these killers as a class, but the FBI has done that. It wasn\u2019t a tough decision, though. The Parkland kids made it easy. I didn\u2019t go to Parkland to cover the gunman, I went because I was fascinated by the students. America was fascinated. The world was fascinated. In November, Archbishop Desmond Tutu bestowed on them the International Children\u2019s Peace prize, calling their campaign \u201creminiscent of other great peace movements in history\u201d. The Parkland students decided in the first few days that they needed to speak with one voice, and focus on gun safety. March for Our Lives followed on 24 March 2018. Estimates state that between 1.4 and 2.1 million people marched in the US that day, making it the third or fourth largest one-day protest in American history, equivalent to the largest protest of the Vietnam war era, led by college students, who had been rallying for the better part of a decade. The Parkland uprising was organised by high school students in five weeks. When Parkland was attacked last Valentine\u2019s Day, supporting gun safety was considered politically toxic. Suddenly, for the first time in a generation, it is starting to grow politically toxic to oppose it. The NRA is not rolling over and the battle will rage for years, but the Parkland kids have achieved stunning success in the first year. State legislatures reversed the NRA momentum, passing 67 laws tightening access to guns. But the big prize was the November midterms. Democrats finally stopped cowering on gun laws, ran on reforming then, and retook the House of Representatives. Even Republicans in some key swing districts ran on gun safety. They didn\u2019t all win, but the movement exceeded the wildest expectations last February of what they might accomplish. The Parkland kids have also helped to solve another problem: robbing spectacle murderers of the spotlight they crave. I was pleased to discover that, while doing media interviews for my book, hardly any journalists could recall the Parkland shooter\u2019s name \u2013 even those who had covered the story. Yet millions of American schoolchildren can name a dozen of the March for Our Lives kids, and follow them daily on social media. These survivors have truly eclipsed their killer. The solution was very simple: they did something more powerful. \u2022 Parkland: Birth of a Movement by Dave Cullen is published by Riverrun.",
