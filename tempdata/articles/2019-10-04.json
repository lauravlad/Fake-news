Let\u2019s give them homes</a>, Editorial, 3 October). As a result of Blair\u2019s cross-departmental initiative introduced in 1997, rough sleeping stood at 532 on any given night in England in 2001. By 2018 it had risen to an estimated 5,000 people, and, as your editorial points out, 726 people, or on average two a day, die on the streets.</p> <p>Yes, a Housing First approach is urgently needed, not least because of the neglect of social housing by successive governments over the last 20 years. A desperate situation has been compounded by draconian cuts since 2010, the impact of universal credit on the most vulnerable, and the cutting to the bone of preventive services to address mental health, drug and relationship problems when they first arise. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that we are creating a welfare system underpinned by punishment, regulation and deterrence, that legitimises the sacrificing of the street homeless.<br><strong>Prof Mike Stein</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Emergency action is needed very soon to house in secure, affordable accommodation the ever rising number of homeless families in temporary accommodation and rough sleepers on the streets. It will take 10 years or more to build enough adequate, truly affordable homes. Some families have already been in temporary arrangements for over 10 years.</p> <p>Young children are spending the vital early years of their education at the mercy of landlords and council officials, who have moved them several times, tearing them out of one community after another.</p> <p>Quantitative easing was used to save the banks. It can also save the homeless. It ought to be used urgently to enable councils to buy and renovate empty and unused properties and let them out at a truly affordable rent. <br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p> <p>\u2022 Liam Byrne (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/homelessness-deaths-liam-byrne\" title=\"\">Homelessness could happen to any of us. This is a crisis</a>, Journal, 2 October) is absolutely right. Poor housing (not just homelessness) in Britain is probably the biggest single cause of human misery, underachievement and loss of potential, not to mention poor health. Reform of housing would almost certainly outperform proper funding of the NHS, the care system, schools and the legal system \u2013 all rightly in politicians\u2019 sights \u2013 in improving the human condition.</p> <p>Come to that, it would probably on its own make the NHS more affordable and hugely improve the performance of the schools system.</p> <p>Yet New Labour almost totally neglected it \u2013 apparently nobody in Tony Blair\u2019s cabinet was interested in it, possibly because none of them had personally experienced any problems; the Tories neglect it because they believe that by providing cheap housing you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/02/nick-clegg-george-osborne-cut-welfare-poorest-boost-tory-popularity\" title=\"\">just create more Labour voters</a>. Of course, Labour does have a housing policy: it\u2019s long, complicated, unreadable and completely unbelievable, especially in view of its invisibility at conference.</p> <p>All that is needed is a simple declaration: by the end of the first Labour parliament, every citizen will be properly housed, no matter what we need to do to achieve it. <br><strong>Jeremy Cushing</strong><br><em>Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 Following your column advising on how best to help the homeless as we encounter them on the street (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/24/homelessness-is-now-part-of-all-our-lives-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help\" title=\"\">G2</a>, 24 September), last Monday morning I asked a woman sitting on the pavement outside a sandwich shop if I could buy her a sandwich. She said: \u201cNo, but a coffee would be good.\u201d When I asked her how she liked it, she said: \u201cJust tell them it is for me \u2013 they know how I prefer it.\u201d</p> <p>I duly bought her the coffee, the staff saying it was her fourth that morning. They clearly disapproved of my action, no doubt regarding it as encouraging a vagabond to squat outside their shop.

Let\u2019s give them homes, Editorial, 3 October). As a result of Blair\u2019s cross-departmental initiative introduced in 1997, rough sleeping stood at 532 on any given night in England in 2001. By 2018 it had risen to an estimated 5,000 people, and, as your editorial points out, 726 people, or on average two a day, die on the streets. Yes, a Housing First approach is urgently needed, not least because of the neglect of social housing by successive governments over the last 20 years. A desperate situation has been compounded by draconian cuts since 2010, the impact of universal credit on the most vulnerable, and the cutting to the bone of preventive services to address mental health, drug and relationship problems when they first arise. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that we are creating a welfare system underpinned by punishment, regulation and deterrence, that legitimises the sacrificing of the street homeless. Prof Mike Stein University of York \u2022 Emergency action is needed very soon to house in secure, affordable accommodation the ever rising number of homeless families in temporary accommodation and rough sleepers on the streets. It will take 10 years or more to build enough adequate, truly affordable homes. Some families have already been in temporary arrangements for over 10 years. Young children are spending the vital early years of their education at the mercy of landlords and council officials, who have moved them several times, tearing them out of one community after another. Quantitative easing was used to save the banks. It can also save the homeless. It ought to be used urgently to enable councils to buy and renovate empty and unused properties and let them out at a truly affordable rent. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty \u2022 Liam Byrne (Homelessness could happen to any of us. This is a crisis, Journal, 2 October) is absolutely right. Poor housing (not just homelessness) in Britain is probably the biggest single cause of human misery, underachievement and loss of potential, not to mention poor health. Reform of housing would almost certainly outperform proper funding of the NHS, the care system, schools and the legal system \u2013 all rightly in politicians\u2019 sights \u2013 in improving the human condition. Come to that, it would probably on its own make the NHS more affordable and hugely improve the performance of the schools system. Yet New Labour almost totally neglected it \u2013 apparently nobody in Tony Blair\u2019s cabinet was interested in it, possibly because none of them had personally experienced any problems; the Tories neglect it because they believe that by providing cheap housing you just create more Labour voters. Of course, Labour does have a housing policy: it\u2019s long, complicated, unreadable and completely unbelievable, especially in view of its invisibility at conference. All that is needed is a simple declaration: by the end of the first Labour parliament, every citizen will be properly housed, no matter what we need to do to achieve it. Jeremy Cushing Exeter \u2022 Following your column advising on how best to help the homeless as we encounter them on the street (G2, 24 September), last Monday morning I asked a woman sitting on the pavement outside a sandwich shop if I could buy her a sandwich. She said: \u201cNo, but a coffee would be good.\u201d When I asked her how she liked it, she said: \u201cJust tell them it is for me \u2013 they know how I prefer it.\u201d I duly bought her the coffee, the staff saying it was her fourth that morning. They clearly disapproved of my action, no doubt regarding it as encouraging a vagabond to squat outside their shop. There are no simple answers, but I shall strive to avoid cynicism and consider small gestures of help in the future.

      "body": "<p>Facebook has quietly rescinded a policy banning false claims in advertising, creating a specific exemption that leaves political adverts unconstrained regarding how they could mislead or deceive, as a potential general election looms in the UK.</p> \n<p>The social network had previously banned adverts containing \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content\u201d, a much stronger restriction than its general rules around Facebook posts. But, <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/facebook-says-trump-can-lie-in-his\">as reported by the journalist Judd Legum</a>, in the last week <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads\">the rules</a> have narrowed considerably, only banning adverts that \u201cinclude claims debunked by third-party fact-checkers, or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organisations with particular expertise\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/should-trump-be-banned-from-twitter\">Should Trump be banned from Twitter?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking programme, it invites independent organisations such as the UK\u2019s Full Fact to verify claims posted to the social network. But the groups, made up mainly of small charities and nonprofits, are heavily constrained in how many claims they can fact-check, meaning they often only verify the most viral cases.</p> \n<p>But even that limit has been lifted for some political adverts. A separate policy introduced by the social network recently declared opinion pieces and satire ineligible for verification, including any website or page \u201cwith the primary purpose of expressing the opinion or agenda of a political figure\u201d. The end result is that any direct statement from a candidate or campaign cannot be fact-checked and so is automatically exempted from policies designed to prevent misinformation. (After the publication of this story, Facebook clarified that only politicians currently in office or running for office, and political parties, are exempt: other political adverts still need to be true.)</p> \n<p>The changes, Legum reported, followed a run of Donald Trump adverts that contained false claims but were not removed under the old rules.</p> \n<p>The new rules could prompt a clash between Facebook and UK regulators. The Advertising Standards Authority does not cover political adverts in Britain, the content of which is largely unregulated, but it does cover all other adverts, including those posted on Facebook. The ASA\u2019s code explicitly bans adverts that \u201cmaterially mislead or [are] likely to do so\u201d, language that is close to that used in Facebook\u2019s previous policies.</p> \n<p>A Facebook spokesman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates. Nor do we think it would be appropriate to prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\u201d</p> \n<p>Facebook\u2019s decision comes as the rival service TikTok takes the opposite stance. In a blogpost, the social network, whose reported 500 million users would make it the largest in the world not owned by Facebook, made clear it would not be hosting any political adverts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d91784ea-cadc-4af5-80bc-f0953ad9b5e6\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>TikTok is a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers. Users film themselves in 15-second clips, typically set to music, and upload them to be viewed by followers and strangers alike. It has been the No 1 app on the worldwide App Store for five consecutive quarters, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/short-video-apps-like-douyin-tiktok-are-dominating-chinese-screens.html\">an estimated 500 million users</a> worldwide.</p>\n    <p>Owned by Chinese startup ByteDance, the app as it is today is a merger of the original TikTok, which was launched internationally in September 2017, and the viral sensation Musical.ly. The latter had already become one of the most popular social media platforms for UK and US teenagers by the time it was purchased by ByteDance in November 2017.

      "bodyText": "Facebook has quietly rescinded a policy banning false claims in advertising, creating a specific exemption that leaves political adverts unconstrained regarding how they could mislead or deceive, as a potential general election looms in the UK. The social network had previously banned adverts containing \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content\u201d, a much stronger restriction than its general rules around Facebook posts. But, as reported by the journalist Judd Legum, in the last week the rules have narrowed considerably, only banning adverts that \u201cinclude claims debunked by third-party fact-checkers, or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organisations with particular expertise\u201d. Under Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking programme, it invites independent organisations such as the UK\u2019s Full Fact to verify claims posted to the social network. But the groups, made up mainly of small charities and nonprofits, are heavily constrained in how many claims they can fact-check, meaning they often only verify the most viral cases. But even that limit has been lifted for some political adverts. A separate policy introduced by the social network recently declared opinion pieces and satire ineligible for verification, including any website or page \u201cwith the primary purpose of expressing the opinion or agenda of a political figure\u201d. The end result is that any direct statement from a candidate or campaign cannot be fact-checked and so is automatically exempted from policies designed to prevent misinformation. (After the publication of this story, Facebook clarified that only politicians currently in office or running for office, and political parties, are exempt: other political adverts still need to be true.) The changes, Legum reported, followed a run of Donald Trump adverts that contained false claims but were not removed under the old rules. The new rules could prompt a clash between Facebook and UK regulators. The Advertising Standards Authority does not cover political adverts in Britain, the content of which is largely unregulated, but it does cover all other adverts, including those posted on Facebook. The ASA\u2019s code explicitly bans adverts that \u201cmaterially mislead or [are] likely to do so\u201d, language that is close to that used in Facebook\u2019s previous policies. A Facebook spokesman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates. Nor do we think it would be appropriate to prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\u201d Facebook\u2019s decision comes as the rival service TikTok takes the opposite stance. In a blogpost, the social network, whose reported 500 million users would make it the largest in the world not owned by Facebook, made clear it would not be hosting any political adverts. \u201cAny paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,\u201d wrote Blake Chandlee, the company\u2019s vice-president of global business solutions. \u201cTo that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level \u2013 including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads.\u201d Chandlee said the decision was prompted by TikTok\u2019s mission \u201cto inspire creativity and build joy\u201d. That same rationale had been cited by the company, which is owned by the Chinese startup Bytedance, to explain why it censored posts that went against the political orthodoxy of Beijing, mentioning topics such as the Tiananmen Square killings or the independence movement in Taiwan. When the Guardian revealed the censorship, TikTok said the rules had since been repealed and replaced with ones that \u201ctake localised approaches\u201d to \u201cprovide an app experience that fosters their creativity\u201d.",
