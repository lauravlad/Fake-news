But Johnson believes that ruling out an extension will focus minds and make a deal more likely.

In line with a commitment in the Conservative election manifesto, Boris Johnson has inserted a provision in the bill making it illegal for the government to agree to extend the transition for a year to two (ie, until December 2021 or December 2022), even though the deal with the EU allows this.</p> <p>Many trade experts think an extension will be necessary because it will be impossible to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020.<strong> Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the new commission president, recently gently suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/27/eu-chief-questions-feasibility-of-boris-johnson-brexit-talks-time-limit\">Johnson might have to rethink his \u2018no extension\u2019 policy</a>, saying that his timetable might not be feasible. But now one of her colleagues, the trade commissioner <strong>Phil Hogan</strong>, has criticised Johnson\u2019s stance in much blunter terms.</p> <p>Hogan, who is Irish and who will oversee the UK-EU trade negotiation in his new job, told the Irish Times <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/johnson-will-abandon-pledge-on-brexit-transition-period-hogan-1.4126850\">in an interview </a>that Johnson\u2019s \u2018no extension\u2019 commitment was a \u2018stunt\u2019 and that in reality Johnson would agree to a longer transition. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the past, we saw the way the prime minister promised to die in the ditch rather than extend the deadline for <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/brexit\">Brexit</a>, only for him to do just that. I don\u2019t believe Prime Minister Johnson will die in the ditch over the timeline for the future relationship either ...</p> <p>At first sight [the clause in the bill ruling out an extension] seems very odd indeed. From our point of view it is important that we move from stunt to substance. It would be helpful if the focus was on content rather than timetables.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another jibe at Johnson, Hogan said that in the next phase of the Brexit talks Britain would have to accept that having your cake and eating it was impossible. He was referring to the phrase, first used by Johnson to sum up his approach to life in general, that became synonymous with the Brexiter belief that the UK could leave the EU but retain most of the benefits of membership. Hogan said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Too much of the debate in the UK over the past four years was based on the false notion that it is possible to make a clean-break Brexit while retaining all the benefits of EU membership. Now that the political deadlock at Westminster is broken the next phase of Brexit needs to be based on realism and hard facts.</p> <p>Any \u2018having our cake and eat it\u2019 rhetoric will not fly. Both sides need to proceed calmly and coherently.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his interview (fuller version <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/phil-hogan-a-no-deal-brexit-would-pour-salt-into-the-wounds-1.4126854\">here)</a> Hogan also restated the EU\u2019s belief that the UK would be worse off outside. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Particularly on goods the UK government has so far avoided any statement of the UK aligning with the EU on regulatory aspects. We all have to come to terms with the reality that Brexit means there will be two markets not a single market.</p> <p>We have to re-erect barriers to trade that EU membership has abolished not because we choose to do so but because the UK chooses to do so. As things stand the UK wants to leave the single market and customs union. This move still baffles me because the full consequences of that decision are still not understood in the UK. Why trade a Rolls Royce for a second-hand saloon?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d2d972739156935b29e0a70c2280b66915284ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d2d972739156935b29e0a70c2280b66915284ff/0_52_3899_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Hogan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Hogan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phanie Lecocq/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T16:32:19.274Z\">at 4.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0a004b8f08c39722642419\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T14:03:30.873Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Toby Perkins</strong> isn\u2019t convinced by the claims that Ian Lavery is seriously considering standing for the leadership.

She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s important that the Labour party listens to the voters who switched their support to the Tories, especially in the north and the Midlands, in working class communities.</p> </blockquote> <p>In a clear criticism of Corbyn, she said Labour needed a leader who was popular in the country at large, not just with the membership.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are big issues, I think, to learn about leadership, where it is not enough to be popular in the party, you\u2019ve got to be popular in the country too ...</p> <p>I think Jeremy Corbyn was a decent man.

So to understand what actually went wrong with this vote, you need to look back further than just 2015, or 2010.

      "bodyText": "Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner, has said that he expects Boris Johnson will have to break his promise not to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020. (See 3.22pm.) Most trade experts think it will be impossible to negotiate a comprehensive UK-EU trade deal within 11 months, and Hogan was only expressing in more robust terms a view already floated by Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president. But Johnson believes that ruling out an extension will focus minds and make a deal more likely. This is what he told MPs on this topic in his speech on the Friday before Christmas opening the second reading debate for the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. He said: There would be nothing more dangerous than extending the implementation period, in a torture that, as we all remember, came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown\u2019s football or Prometheus chained to the Tartarian crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back, as honourable members on both sides of the house will recall, only to be pecked out again, with the cycle repeated forever. This bill, unlike opposition members, learns the emphatic lesson of the last parliament and rejects any further delay. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, has said that the next Labour leader should be credible, competent and popular with voters. (See 11.53am.) Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has published her opening pitch for the Labour leadership. Commentators and critics in the party have not been impressed. (See 12.37pm and 12.44pm.) Clive Lewis, a candidate for the Labour leadership, has said the party should have opposed Brexit more vigorously. (See 9.11am.) However, he has also said he does not want to re-open the Bexit issue now because \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d. (See 1.08pm.) I\u2019m done for the day too. Thanks for the comments. From Wednesday at least we will be in a decade that has a name. I might be wrong, but I get the impression that there has been less discussion than you might expect about the last 10 years as an entity, perhaps because no one could agree what it was called. \u201cThe tens\u201d never really worked as a label, just as \u201cthe noughties\u201d didn\u2019t either. But the twenties - that\u2019s a proper name for a decade. Still, it is surprising to see Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to London, suggesting (even by the use of period typeface) that he hopes they end up like the 1920s. Has he forgotten how that decade ended? Here is some Twitter comment on the Phil Hogan interview. (See 3.22pm.) From Peter Foster, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor From Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit specialist at the Eurasia consultancy From Stewart Jackson, the Tory Brexiter, former MP and former chief of staff to David Davis when he was Brexit secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to rule out extending the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020 is a \u201cstunt\u201d that he will be forced to abandon, according to a leading figure in the European commission. When MPs return to the Commons on Tuesday next week they will resume their debate on the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, the legislation paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. In line with a commitment in the Conservative election manifesto, Boris Johnson has inserted a provision in the bill making it illegal for the government to agree to extend the transition for a year to two (ie, until December 2021 or December 2022), even though the deal with the EU allows this. Many trade experts think an extension will be necessary because it will be impossible to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020. Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president, recently gently suggested that Johnson might have to rethink his \u2018no extension\u2019 policy, saying that his timetable might not be feasible. But now one of her colleagues, the trade commissioner Phil Hogan, has criticised Johnson\u2019s stance in much blunter terms. Hogan, who is Irish and who will oversee the UK-EU trade negotiation in his new job, told the Irish Times in an interview that Johnson\u2019s \u2018no extension\u2019 commitment was a \u2018stunt\u2019 and that in reality Johnson would agree to a longer transition. He said: In the past, we saw the way the prime minister promised to die in the ditch rather than extend the deadline for Brexit, only for him to do just that. I don\u2019t believe Prime Minister Johnson will die in the ditch over the timeline for the future relationship either ... At first sight [the clause in the bill ruling out an extension] seems very odd indeed. From our point of view it is important that we move from stunt to substance. It would be helpful if the focus was on content rather than timetables. In another jibe at Johnson, Hogan said that in the next phase of the Brexit talks Britain would have to accept that having your cake and eating it was impossible. He was referring to the phrase, first used by Johnson to sum up his approach to life in general, that became synonymous with the Brexiter belief that the UK could leave the EU but retain most of the benefits of membership. Hogan said: Too much of the debate in the UK over the past four years was based on the false notion that it is possible to make a clean-break Brexit while retaining all the benefits of EU membership. Now that the political deadlock at Westminster is broken the next phase of Brexit needs to be based on realism and hard facts. Any \u2018having our cake and eat it\u2019 rhetoric will not fly. Both sides need to proceed calmly and coherently. In his interview (fuller version here) Hogan also restated the EU\u2019s belief that the UK would be worse off outside. He said: Particularly on goods the UK government has so far avoided any statement of the UK aligning with the EU on regulatory aspects. We all have to come to terms with the reality that Brexit means there will be two markets not a single market. We have to re-erect barriers to trade that EU membership has abolished not because we choose to do so but because the UK chooses to do so. As things stand the UK wants to leave the single market and customs union. This move still baffles me because the full consequences of that decision are still not understood in the UK. Why trade a Rolls Royce for a second-hand saloon? The Labour MP Toby Perkins isn\u2019t convinced by the claims that Ian Lavery is seriously considering standing for the leadership. (See 9.11am.) It is hard to know if Perkins is right about Lavery\u2019s motives - Lavery has not been giving interviews and, even if he is just engaged in a feint, you would not expect him to say so - but Perkins is almost certainly right about the consequences of Lavery\u2019s name being in the race at the moment. In 2010, when David Miliband was running for the Labour leadership, he ended up nominating Diane Abbott, and urging his supporters to do the same, so that she could end up on the ballot. She became the first black person to contest the Labour leadership, and Miliband thought it was good to be seen to supporting diversity and pluralism. But his team later concluded that this move had backfired because, with Abbott on the ballot, Miliband was no longer about to portray his brother Ed as the most leftwing candidate in the contest. (Those were the days when being the leftwinger in a Labour leadership contest was assumed to be a drawback. Now that is not necessarily the case.) The Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewis has posted a tweet clarifying what he meant when he gave an interview to the Today programme this morning. (See 9.11am.) He said this morning that he thought the party, and Jeremy Corbyn, should have fought more strongly for remain. But that does not mean he wants to re-open the Brexit debate now, he says. He has also posted this about his agenda. I referred to Alastair Campbell as a Labour figure a few moments ago, although of course he was thrown out of the party earlier this year after he revealed he voted Lib Dem in the European elections. He has contrasted his treatment with the former Labour MP Gisela Stuart\u2019s. She said this morning she was still a party member - even though she appeared on a platform with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove during the election campaign, urging people to vote Tory to deliver Brexit. Campbell, a hate figure for some in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s circle because of his work for Tony Blair, has long argued that the decision to expel him was vindictive and unfair. And here is some comment on Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s article from Labour figures - although not ones from her wing of the party. From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications director From the former Labour MP David Clelland From Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future thinktank, and a former Fabian Society general secretary Katwala has posted a whole thread about the notion of progressive patriotism. You can read the whole thing if you click on the tweet above. From Damian McBride, Gordon Brown\u2019s former communications chief who now advises Emily Thornberry Here is a round-up of what some journalists, commentators and academics are saying about Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s article for the Guardian today containing her pitch for the Labour leadership. It is a relatively random sample because many of the usual suspects are (sensibly) still in holiday mode and staying off Twitter. From my colleague Zoe Williams From openDemocracy\u2019s Peter Geoghegan From the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul There is more. If you click on one of those tweets, you should be able to read the thread. Here is his conclusion. From HuffPost\u2019s Rachel Wearmouth From the blogger and commentator Kevin Meagher From the author and former Guardian journalist David Walker From the politics professor Steven Fielding From the politics professor Richard Wyn Jones From the politics professor Matthew Goodwin Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has been tweeting this morning - but without saying anything about her campaign for the Labour deputy leadership that Rebecca Long-Bailey endorsed even though it has not been announced. (See 11.07am.) Jeremy Corbyn is still leader of the Labour party. But in his Today interview this morning Clive Lewis was speaking about him in the past tense (\u201che was an authentic politician\u201d - see 9.11am) and, in an interview on Sky News this morning, Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, also spoke as if Corbyn had already gone. She said it was important for Labour to learn some \u201chard lessons\u201d from its defeat, and to listen to the views of voters who did not support the party. She said: I think it\u2019s important that the Labour party listens to the voters who switched their support to the Tories, especially in the north and the Midlands, in working class communities. In a clear criticism of Corbyn, she said Labour needed a leader who was popular in the country at large, not just with the membership. There are big issues, I think, to learn about leadership, where it is not enough to be popular in the party, you\u2019ve got to be popular in the country too ... I think Jeremy Corbyn was a decent man. And he was very popular in the party. But, as I say, that isn\u2019t enough. I think people are looking for a leader and a programme that\u2019s credible, competent and going to fight for their interests. Labour wasn\u2019t able to achieve that this time. If it focuses, sorts itself out, pulls together like a broad church, not just a collection of factional tribes, then it can start looking to win back voters\u2019 trust. Asked who she would like to see as the next Labour leader, O\u2019Grady refused to say. She wanted to see how candidates performed in the leadership contest, she said. But she said the party should choose a leader with credible policies who could win back trust. I want to see a leader who can communicate, who can come up with credible policies, but also priorities that really will improve the lives of working people ... It\u2019s got to be somebody who can win back trust, communicate well and show true leadership and grit in holding this government to account. In her Guardian article Rebecca Long-Bailey says she will be supporting Angela Rayner for deputy Labour leader. Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has been tipped as a Labour leadership candidate herself but, as the Guardian reported two weeks ago, after the election her allies said she was focusing on the deputy leadership vacancy, leading to speculation that she and Long-Bailey would run on a joint ticket. But last night\u2019s Sky\u2019s Sam Coates said that Long-Bailey\u2019s comment was premature, because Rayner is not yet ready to announce that she is running for the deputy leadership. Long-Bailey and Rayner are friends and they share a flat in London. Rayner may well end up backing Long-Bailey as leader and running for the deputy leadership, but there are some in the party who think that she would make a better leader herself and, if a friendship does rupture under the strain of a leadership contest - well, that won\u2019t be the first time that has happened in the Labour party. I\u2019m describing Clive Lewis as a Labour leadership candidate because he has confirmed that he wants to run, as has Emily Thornberry. Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey also seem all but certain to run. Other people who are seriously considering running, or who at least have not ruled it out, are: Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Yvette Cooper, Ian Lavery, David Lammy and Dan Jarvis. But it is worth pointing out that, to be a candidate on the ballot paper, it is not enough for an MP just to declare that they are standing. They also need the support of 10% of Labour MPs (ie, 21 MPs). It used to be 15%, but the threshold was lowered after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as leader. Under the new rules, candidates also need the support of 5% of constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to be included on the ballot (that\u2019s 33 of them), or 5% of the union/affiliates vote. Luke Akehurst has a more detailed guide to the new rules here, in an article for Politics.co.uk. While Starmer and Long-Bailey, the two frontrunners, should easily be able to meet these requirements, some other candidates hoping to be on the ballot, including possibly Lewis himself, may find it more difficult. Here are some more lines from what Clive Lewis, the shadow Treasury minister and Labour leadership contender, said in his Today programme interview this morning. (See 9.11am.) Lewis said that the explanation for Labour\u2019s election defeat was complicated and that, although Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and Brexit were factors, there were other reasons too, going back years. He said: It is also about the fact that for the last 40 years in this country there has been a decline in those votes in those areas where we collapsed in the general election. And this is something that has been going on for 40 years, and that includes over the period of 1997 to 2010. So to understand what actually went wrong with this vote, you need to look back further than just 2015, or 2010. It is like trying to work out the causes of the second world war by going back no further than 1938. You have to go back to 1914, and possibly beyond. We have to work out why were we not able to connect to people in these heartlands, in the north, in the east Midlands? Why couldn\u2019t we get our message across to them? He said that he knew from personal experience on the doorstep that Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a problem for the party. He restated his call for more internal democracy in the Labour party. He said the party needed to complete a \u201ccomplete analysis\u201d of why it lost the election. That had to happen quickly, he said, and the exercise should not be a sectarian one. He said he supported the inquiry being launched by Labour Together, and he said he hoped it would be rigorous. In his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe Jack Blanchard has a good single-paragraph analysis of Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s article for the Guardian setting out her pitch for the leadership. He says: Beck\u2019s appeal: Somewhat ironically, Long Bailey\u2019s 850-word op-ed rails against New Labour \u201ctriangulation,\u201d yet itself reads rather like a carefully calibrated pitch to the different power bases within the party. It also seems to borrow heavily from several of the leadership bids we\u2019ve already heard. So there\u2019s the essential nod to Labour\u2019s trade union backers (\u201cthey are our roots in every workplace); the Clive Lewis-style hint of more power for party members (\u201cour promise to democratise society will ring hollow if we can\u2019t even democratise our own party\u201d); and the Keir Starmer-ish pledge to left-wingers that Corbyn\u2019s policy agenda will not be abandoned (\u201cwe cannot return to the politics of the past.\u201d) Then there\u2019s the establishment of working-class credentials (\u201cI grew up watching my father\u2019s friends lose their jobs\u201d); and the Lisa Nandy-style vow to return power and patriotic pride to communities (\u201cwe must revive this progressive patriotism.\u201d) If none of that sounds terribly original, well, that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be enough to win. Good morning. I hope you all had a good Christmas. Politics Live is back today, although with parliament still in recess, and much of the UK still in holiday mode, the news agenda is looking a lot thinner than it has been recently. But the Labour leadership campaign has been rumbling on throughout the Christmas period. It is still at the preliminary skirmishes stage, but this morning Clive Lewis, the shadow Treasury minister and one of only two candidates who have confirmed that they are running (the other is Emily Thornberry) gave an interview to the Today programme about what went wrong for Labour at the election. He said on Brexit the party should have fought more strongly for remain. Asked if the party should have adopted an out-and-out remain position, he replied: I think what we have to understand is what Brexit was. For many of us watching Brexit unfold, Brexit was a policy of a faction of the Conservative party and the right of this country that wanted to put globalisation on steroids, if you want, and it was a hard right political project. And I believe that the Labour party had to fight that with all its vigour and to offer an alternative. I don\u2019t believe this was the main reason for what happened to us in the election, but I think one of the things that we have to accept is that if you pick a side, you have to then argue for that side, and argue for it comprehensively.

Lewis was a member of the shadow cabinet until he resigned in 2017 so that he could vote against the bill allowing the government to trigger article 50, starting the process that will lead to the UK leaving the EU. Before the election he also strongly backed Another Europe is Possible\u2019s \u201cRemain, Reform, Revolt\u201d campaign, saying the UK should remain. I will post more from Lewis\u2019s interview, which expands on an article he wrote for the Guardian earlier this month confirming his candidature, shortly. It follows two other Labour leadership developments overnight. Rebecca Long-Bailey has made her opening pitch for the Labour leadership, avoiding any direct criticism of Corbyn but implicitly offering an alternative approach by promising to champion \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d. She did so in an article for the Guardian. My story about it is here, and the article itself is here. In her article Long-Bailey, like Lewis, criticises the party\u2019s Brexit position, saying: \u201cOur compromise solution satisfied too few.\u201d But she does not say what the party should have done instead. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, has confirmed that he is considering standing for the leadership. A spokesman for Lavery told the Daily Mirror: Ian is optimistic about the challenges ahead and knows there is a lot of work to be done to unify the party. He has had a tremendous amount of support and is seriously considering all of his options at present. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens (in so far as there is any), as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",
