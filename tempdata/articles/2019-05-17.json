      "bodyText": "The government and Labour have sought to blame each other after cross-party talks to find a compromise Brexit plan collapsed, leaving any remaining hopes of an imminent solution to the impasse in tatters. While both sides insisted the discussions had taken place in good faith, Theresa May said a sticking point had been Labour splits over a second referendum. Labour in turn said the government had been unwilling to compromise and that May\u2019s imminent departure from Downing Street meant there was no guarantee any promises would be kept by a successor such as Boris Johnson. Nick Boles, the former Conservative MP who helped spearhead efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit in March, said he now feared such a departure was almost inevitable when the EU27\u2019s latest deadline of 31 October is reached. \u201cIt\u2019s game over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only won by one, and it\u2019s very unclear that we would have the same level of Tory support, and for that matter Labour support. We are absolutely convinced that parliament will not find a way to stop no-deal Brexit.\u201d The conclusion to six weeks of intermittent talks, which had angered many Conservative and Labour MPs who feared the nature of the compromise that might result, came with the release of a letter from Jeremy Corbyn to May on Friday. Despite praising the talks as constructive, the Labour leader wrote: \u201cIt has become clear that, while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us. \u201cEven more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.\u201d May\u2019s spokesman said the view was mutual: \u201cIt was clear to the government \u2026 that the talks were not going to reach a successful conclusion.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s letter cited examples of what he said was May\u2019s inability to carry her government on possible compromises, for example ministerial dissent over a possible customs union and the idea of allowing reduced food standards to secure a US trade deal. Speaking in Bristol at a campaign event for next week\u2019s European elections, the prime minister said the negotiations had \u201cmade progress\u201d, but blamed Labour for the lack of an outcome. \u201cIn particular, we haven\u2019t been able to overcome the fact that there isn\u2019t a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or have a second referendum and try to reverse it,\u201d she said. A Downing Street source said Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strong support for a second referendum was a particular sticking point. \u201cIt is clear that the shadow Brexit secretary has fairly strident views on the issue, and he led the Labour team in the negotiations,\u201d the source said. Starmer told the Guardian earlier this week that he believed it would be impossible for any deal to pass without a confirmatory referendum attached. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, echoed the point during a visit to Northern Ireland, saying the talks collapsed because of \u201cdivision in the Labour party over the second referendum\u201d. In a sign of what is likely to be a fierce debate within government in the wake of the collapse, Barclay insisted it would be possible to \u201cmitigate the disruption\u201d of a no-deal Brexit. Labour hit back at this narrative, with Starmer saying May was \u201ctrying to blame everyone but herself\u201d for the collapse of the talks. He tweeted: \u201cShe knows the reality is she couldn\u2019t carry her own side or offer a realistic compromise. Any deal agreed wouldn\u2019t last a day under a new Tory leader.\u201d The tortuous process of discussion, which saw occasional meetings between May and Corbyn and many more involving their frontbench teams and officials, had been widely predicted to come to an end, but the news was still enough to see the pound drop to its lowest level against the dollar since February. Corbyn had come under mounting pressure from within the shadow cabinet to walk away from the talks, including from close allies who feared a stitch-up that would see Labour blamed as the facilitator of a \u201cTory Brexit\u201d. Both sides stressed that some progress had been made, with the prime minister\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Ollie Robbins, in Brussels earlier this week to discuss a joint draft of proposed changes to the political declaration about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU27. But while there were signs the two leaders were not miles apart, a number of Conservative MPs were agitated at the idea of a possible customs union, Corbyn\u2019s key demand, while many in Labour disliked the prospect of a plan not being endorsed by a second referendum. The government intends to press ahead with holding a vote on the withdrawal agreement bill in the week beginning 3 June \u2013 but sources stressed it would include \u201cnew features that reflect some of the discussions\u201d, in the hope of winning over Labour MPs. May also plans to resume talks with the Democratic Unionist party, with which she is in a confidence and supply partnership, about how it could be reassured that accepting the deal would not undermine the integrity of the UK. Government sources also pointed to progress on considering \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Northern Irish border \u2013 one of the central concerns of Brexiters who have held out against the deal. Corbyn said Labour would \u201ccarefully consider\u201d any new proposals, but added: \u201cI should reiterate that, without significant changes, we will continue to oppose the government\u2019s deal as we do not believe it safeguards jobs, living standards and manufacturing industry in Britain.\u201d",

If I commission my builder to create an extension to my home, don\u2019t I have the right to confirm, amend or reject his design before he starts laying the bricks? Tim Shelton-Jones Brighton, East Sussex \u2022 I had hoped that Jeremy Corbyn would get the message from his remain supporters in the local elections but he chose to interpret Labour losses as an indication that the majority of voters wanted Brexit delivered. This has made it impossible for me to vote Labour in the European elections \u2013 widely seen as a proxy referendum \u2013 for fear that my vote be misconstrued as an endorsement of Labour\u2019s current policy on Brexit. The surge in support for Nigel Farage underlines the fact that the EU debacle is now becoming a fight for the soul of this nation and Jeremy Corbyn needs urgently to make clear where Labour stands. Susan Newton Oldham, Lancashire \u2022 Re Polly Toynbee\u2019s opinion piece, I wrote similar misgivings to my MP. His reply caused several eyebrows to be raised at the breakfast table: \u201cI am afraid that I do not think that Jeremy will ever be a strong advocate of this position or of the case for remain. To be fair to him, he has been a Eurosceptic throughout his career.\u201d Ian Garner Keighley, West Yorkshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters \u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Alluding to the rift, Sturgeon said: \u201cEven the Scottish Tories are terrified at the prospect [of a Johnson premiership] because I think they know what it would do to their standing.\u201d She added: \u201cIf we wait too long [for another vote on independence], then we risk untold damage being done to Scotland\u2019s interests, certainly by Brexit, and then possibly the prospect of having somebody like Boris Johnson as prime minister.\u201d Asked what impact a Johnson premiership would have on the independence debate, she said: \u201cIt would lead to many more people thinking that the best future for Scotland is to be independent so that we can protect our interests, that we can take our own decisions, that we can cooperate with other independent countries across the European Union for our mutual interest. In other words, be a normal, progressive, independent country.\u201d She described Johnson as \u201cthe guy who misled people in the Brexit vote, who has only ever put his own interests first \u2026 a complete and utter charlatan in my opinion\u201d. Sturgeon also said she could \u201cfeel a degree of sympathy\u201d for Theresa May on a personal level, but added: \u201cThat said, I don\u2019t think she has played the hand she was given particularly well.\u201d Sturgeon said of the prime minister: \u201cI think she\u2019s taken a lot of decisions that nobody made her take that have made the situation a lot worse.\u201d",
