A decade of austerity has forced even local authorities that, like Leicester, value their cultural institutions highly to make impossible choices. Social care or arts? Children\u2019s services or museums?</p> <p>For over 30 years most regional museum funding has targeted audience engagement. This has unfortunately been at the expense of curatorial and other care for the public asset represented by the collection, even in museums with collections designated by government as being of national importance, albeit not so funded. When shops, pubs and restaurants are closing, museums and their collections are among the few attractions left to draw people into our town and city centres. No other country would have allowed its family silver to tarnish so badly.<br><strong>Dr Ellen McAdam</strong><br><em>Director, Birmingham Museums</em></p> <p>\u2022 The decision by the council in Leicester to replace its four museum curators with the cheaper option of an \u201caudience engagement team\u201d will inevitably lead to a deterioration in the excellent quality of the museums in that city. This decision is quite correctly deplored by the Museums Association and others. Such decisions are blighting other aspects of facilities designed to preserve our heritage.</p> <p>The decision by Worcestershire county council to cut funding for its archive and archaeological services by \u00a3250,000 will mean that specialist archivists will be lost, and this will mean that sources for historical research in the locality will be drastically reduced.</p> <p>Many other councils are making similar decisions to cut funding on museums and archives.

      "bodyText": "Your coverage of the staff restructuring by Leicester museums in response to funding cuts (\u2018Engagement team\u2019 replaces curators at Leicester museums, 14 March) is hardly fair. A decade of austerity has forced even local authorities that, like Leicester, value their cultural institutions highly to make impossible choices. Social care or arts? Children\u2019s services or museums? For over 30 years most regional museum funding has targeted audience engagement. This has unfortunately been at the expense of curatorial and other care for the public asset represented by the collection, even in museums with collections designated by government as being of national importance, albeit not so funded. When shops, pubs and restaurants are closing, museums and their collections are among the few attractions left to draw people into our town and city centres. No other country would have allowed its family silver to tarnish so badly. Dr Ellen McAdam Director, Birmingham Museums \u2022 The decision by the council in Leicester to replace its four museum curators with the cheaper option of an \u201caudience engagement team\u201d will inevitably lead to a deterioration in the excellent quality of the museums in that city. This decision is quite correctly deplored by the Museums Association and others. Such decisions are blighting other aspects of facilities designed to preserve our heritage. The decision by Worcestershire county council to cut funding for its archive and archaeological services by \u00a3250,000 will mean that specialist archivists will be lost, and this will mean that sources for historical research in the locality will be drastically reduced. Many other councils are making similar decisions to cut funding on museums and archives. The deleterious impact of these cuts on research by family historians, genealogists, university students and staff, and others, cannot be overstated.

The prime minister\u2019s plan to bring her Brexit deal back to parliament for a third meaningful vote, before EU leaders gathered on Thursday, was thrown into chaos on Monday, when the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said parliamentary convention meant it would be unacceptable for another vote to be held on an unchanged deal. \u201cThe prime minister will be writing to Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, before the European council begins, in relation to an extension,\u201d the spokesman said. He declined to say how long a delay she would request, or for what purpose, simply insisting, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to wait for that letter to be published\u201d. Asked whether May agreed with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, who described the situation after Bercow\u2019s ruling on Monday as a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, her spokesman said: \u201cIf you were to look back at the speech the prime minister gave, just before meaningful vote two, she said that if MPs did not support meaningful vote two we would be in a crisis. \u201cEvents yesterday tell you that that situation has come to pass.\u201d Cabinet ministers discussed Brexit for about 90 minutes on Tuesday morning, he said. He declined to confirm whether they had agreed on the length of the article 50 extension request, or whether cabinet had signed off on a draft of the letter. Asked whether ministers would be allowed to advocate alternative approaches, as they did during last week\u2019s free vote on extending article 50, he said: \u201cThe letter will set out the position of the British government.\u201d Cabinet ministers, including the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, voted against the government\u2019s motion calling for an extension in last week\u2019s vote, despite Barclay having spoken in favour of it from the dispatch shortly beforehand. Any change to exit day would have to be agreed by parliament, he conceded, as 29 March was specified in the EU Withdrawal Act. \u201cThere would be a requirement to change the date in the Withdrawal Act and there would have to be a statutory instrument which would have to be approved in both Houses of Parliament.\u201d Ministers promised during last week\u2019s Brexit debate that if no deal was agreed by parliament this week, they would hold a debate next Monday about what process could be used to find a consensus on alternatives. Many MPs, including those pressing for a closer future relationship with the EU, interpreted that as a promise of so-called indicative votes, to identify whether a majority might exist for another approach. Barclay insisted on Tuesday the prime minister might still be able to hold another vote on her Brexit deal if she agreed the terms of an article 50 extension with the EU, believing that would satisfy Bercow\u2019s objections. A long extension would mean the UK spending more than \u00a3100m on participating in European parliamentary elections.",

EU officials, meanwhile, were considering offering her a new date for a delayed Brexit to resolve the crisis. Quoting from the guide to parliamentary procedure, Erskine May, Bercow said the question \u201cmay not be brought forward again during the same session\u201d and that it was a \u201cstrong and longstanding convention\u201d dating back to 1604. It must be \u201cnot different in terms of wording, but different in terms of substance\u201d, he said, suggesting there must be a change in what the EU is offering. Bercow\u2019s surprise intervention means May is likely to have to go to Thursday\u2019s Brussels summit with a request for a long extension to article 50, which could mean the UK has to spend more than \u00a3100m on participating in European parliament elections. During the delay, parliament would have to make a decision on how to break the deadlock, potentially with a second referendum, an election or a cross-party proposal for a softer Brexit. Alternatively, government sources suggested May could negotiate a lengthy extension with the EU, with a \u201cget-out clause\u201d enabling it to be cut short if her Brexit deal is passed by parliament before the European parliamentary elections. One option under consideration is some kind of \u201cpaving vote\u201d to set aside the convention if a majority in the House of Commons agreed they wanted to look at the deal again. Sources in Brussels suggested the EU may offer May a helping hand by agreeing on a new delayed Brexit date at the summit, which could allow her to argue next week that the deal is sufficiently different to merit a third vote in parliament. Some hardline Conservative Brexit supporters were pleased that May\u2019s efforts to pass her deal were being frustrated, hoping the EU would veto an extension and the UK would be forced to exit without a deal on 29 March.

The reality is that practically to get it signed off by all parties, we would have had to have a deal concluded by today to get it through before Thursday\u2019s EU council,\u201d said one DUP source. The angriest reaction to Bercow\u2019s announcement came from Conservative Brexiters who had switched to vote for May\u2019s deal and were among those coaxing colleagues to come over the line with them at the next opportunity. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, said the deal was \u201cclearly gathering support\u201d and it was essential that parliament was given another opportunity to vote. The former children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton said it was the \u201cmost serious constitutional crisis I have seen in my 22 years in this house\u201d. \u201cJust when it looked like order was about to finally emerge from the chaos, and there was real momentum building to get sufficient support to back the deal, now Bercow has fashioned a way to reassert the chaos,\u201d he said.",
