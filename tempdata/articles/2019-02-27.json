      "bodyText": "The government has bowed to MPs\u2019 pressure over the post-Brexit rights of EU citizens and reaffirmed pledges to give the Commons a veto on a no-deal departure after the latest parliamentary wrangling over Theresa May\u2019s deadlocked plans. A day that had been heralded as the moment when backbenchers would seize control of the Brexit timetable from the prime minister lost some of its drama after May and her ministers gave way in a series of areas where they were likely to lose Commons votes. The concessions meant that the set of votes on the government\u2019s latest Brexit motion, tabled in lieu of a still-elusive revised departure plan, was the first without a defeat for May. In one development that could gain in significance in the coming days, a Labour frontbench amendment proposing their own Brexit plan was defeated by 323 votes to 240, which under the new party policy should mean Labour will now push for a second EU referendum. In a statement afterwards Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would back a public vote while also pushing for \u201cother available options\u201d, including a general election and Labour\u2019s own Brexit plan. The key government climbdown was on an amendment tabled by the Conservative MP Alberto Costa, which called on ministers to secure the rights and status of EU nationals in the UK even in the event of no deal. It was adopted by the government without a vote, but only after Costa was sacked as a government aide and the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said he backed the plan before May had herself done so. Ministers unofficially accepted another amendment, from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, reiterating May\u2019s commitment on Tuesday that she will allow MPs a vote on extending the Brexit deadline by mid-March if no departure deal has been agreed by then. It had been expected this would mean Cooper\u2019s amendment passing by acclamation. However, a handful of Brexiter Conservatives unexpectedly objected, forcing a vote. The plan was passed by 502 votes to 20. Cooper, who has spearheaded cross-party efforts to ensure MPs are able to block a no-deal departure, praised the government\u2019s agreement as \u201ca very significant change\u201d, but said she and the co-leaders of her campaign would maintain pressure on May to keep to her word. Ministers also agreed to a parallel amendment by the Conservative MP Caroline Spelman on the same subject, which was passed without a vote, as was the plan tabled by Costa. With just five amendments selected by the Speaker, John Bercow, this meant that as well as the Labour and Cooper amendments, only one more was voted on: an SNP-led plan to completely rule out no deal, which was easily defeated. In another, albeit more minor, sign of government confusion, the beleaguered transport secretary, Chris Grayling, was spotted entering the wrong voting lobby before realising his error. The main government concession was announced in the debate\u2019s opening speech by the cabinet office minister David Lidington, May\u2019s de facto deputy. He said the government would back Costa\u2019s amendment, which had been signed by 135 MPs, among them many Conservatives \u2013 a clear sign it would pass anyway. It decrees that the government should guarantee the rights of EU nationals as soon as possible \u201cwhatever the outcome of negotiations\u201d on Brexit. Lidington said: \u201cIn view of the fact our political objectives are the same, the government will accept the amendment today and take it up with the commission.\u201d The concession did not save Costa\u2019s junior government job. Shortly before the debate he stepped down as the parliamentary private secretary to the Scotland secretary, David Mundell. While a Downing Street spokesman said Costa had decided himself to resign due to the \u201clongstanding convention\u201d that MPs on the government payroll do not table amendments to official bills, a source close to the MP said he had effectively been sacked. Costa, the son of Italian immigrants, has been quietly lobbying May over EU citizens\u2019 rights for two years. He later said he did not \u201cgive a stuff\u201d about having to quit his post as PPS, when citizens\u2019 rights were at stake. Adding to the confusion, the home secretary Sajid Javid seemed to pre-empt Lidington\u2019s concession before the debate, using an earlier appearance before the home affairs select committee to say he had no objection to the amendment. On being told that the government disagreed, Javid appeared flummoxed. \u201cWhen did you hear that? From who?\u201d he asked. When told it was the prime minister, Javid replied: \u201cDid you?

Summing up for the government, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said ministers would honour the commitments of Cooper\u2019s amendment. \u201cThey are commitments made by my right honourable friend the prime minister, and the government will stick by them,\u201d he said. Asked by Cooper in an intervention about reported comments from Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, that no deal could still happen even if MPs voted against it, Barclay reiterated his guarantee.",

Of the four big Brexit debates held this year, that was the first that did not involve Theresa May losing a vote. Two things stand out about that final division.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hardcore Tory Brexiters split this evening as only 20 of them supported a move to vote against the Yvette Cooper amendment.</strong> It is estimated that at least 50 Tory MPs (and up to 90, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44530d70-39df-11e9-b856-5404d3811663\">according to today\u2019s Financial Times)</a> support the European Research Group, which represents those Tories pushing for a harder Brexit. Sometimes they operate as a bloc. When May lost the vote two weeks ago, it was because 67 Tories \u2013 mostly ERG supporters \u2013 abstained. But tonight that bloc fractured. It seems that some of the maverick Brexiters pushed for a vote against the wishes of the more mainstream Brexiters in the ERG hierarchy (ie, Mark Francois, an ERG vice chair, according to Ben Bradshaw\u2019s tweet - see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/27/brexit-debate-latest-news-developments-pmqs-chair-jacob-rees-mogg-drops-his-calls-for-wholesale-removal-of-backstop-politics-live?page=with:block-5c76e839e4b01c747a0e5238#block-5c76e839e4b01c747a0e5238\"> 7.43pm.) </a>Continuity ERG versus the Provisional ERG, if you like. It did not matter tonight, but it may be a harbinger of what will happen when May next brings her deal to the Commons.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Theresa May won the final vote handsomely - but only by co-opting the ideas promoted by Yvette Cooper.</strong> The two are rivals; Cooper shadowed May for a long time when May was home secretary. Originally Number 10 said the government would abstain on the Cooper amendment, but in the end the government voted for it. That meant government MPs were voting for a Cooper amendment that essentially restated a commitment given by May in the Commons yesterday in response to a long-running campaign led by Cooper. Truly, their careers are entwined.</li> </ul> <p>Here is the list of <a href=\"https://commonsvotes.digiminster.com/Divisions/Details/616#noes\">the 20 Tory MPs who voted against Cooper.</a> None of them are from the ERG leadership. These are the 20 Tories most likely to vote against May\u2019s deal whatever concessions she achieves.</p> <p>And here is our earlier story on the debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/27/confusion-reigns-over-brexit-amendment-as-tory-mp-alberto-costa-sacked\">Government relents on rights of EU citizens after MP quits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T20:51:36.704Z\">at 8.51pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c76e9b8e4b01c747a0e5249\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T19:50:45.266Z\">7.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs pass Cooper amendment by majority of 482</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Cooper amendment has passed by 502 votes to 20 \u2013 a majority of 482.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T19:51:17.229Z\">at 7.51pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c76e8fee4b01c747a0e5242\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T19:46:52.422Z\">7.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This from the Press Association\u2019s <strong>Ian Jones.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1100844363532460037\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stephen Hepburn, Labour MP for Jarrow, voted against his own party.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The official line is that Williamson\u2019s suspension is a decision taken in the light of a pattern of behaviour by the Derby North MP. But no one could, with a straight face, claim that Williamson\u2019s behaviour is a recent discovery. The truth is that Williamson has been repeatedly indulged by the Labour leadership due to his political proximity to Corbyn, and it will have been a very difficult blow for Corbyn personally to remove the whip from him. What matters is that the scale of anger among Labour MPs and activists, coupled with the risk of further defections to the Independent Group, forced the leadership\u2019s hand ...</p> <p>It also is an indication of the scale of the change wrought on Labour politics by the emergence of TIG. Had seven MPs not left the Labour party on Monday last week to form a breakaway group, then Williamson would still be a Labour MP now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T18:50:24.309Z\">at 6.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c76cf27e4b0822aecfce2e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T17:58:26.187Z\">5.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chris Williamson says he will clear his name because he has 'very strong case'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC\u2019s <strong>Carolyn Quinn</strong> says <strong>Chris Williamson </strong>has also said that he is going to clear his name because he has \u201ca very strong case\u201d and there is no evidence against him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCcarolynquinn/status/1100816238970920960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Suspended Labour MP Chris Williamson says \u201c \u201cI am going to clear my name within the party procedures.

This is a misunderstanding of what the rules are. As the secretary of state for international trade <strong tabindex=\"-1\">[Liam Fox]</strong> told the House of Commons on 14 January this year: </p> <p>\u201cSome have suggested that it would be possible under Article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to maintain tariff-free trade as an alternative to the negotiated agreement in a no-deal scenario. There are two immediate problems facing that suggestion. The first is that it would require the agreement of the EU and be based on the expectation of a future trade agreement or customs union to be operable in WTO law. Although it might be argued, as I am sure many in the house would, that that would be in the economic interests of the EU27, we all know from experience that the politics of the EU can take precedence over economic pragmatism. In the political atmosphere of no deal, it would be difficult to cultivate the good will necessary for that to proceed. Secondly, that suggestion would not deal with all the regulatory issues \u2013 the non-tariff barriers \u2013 that are so important to many businesses.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Yvette Cooper,</strong> the Labour MP who has led efforts to ensure MPs get a vote on ruling out no deal, asks for an assurance that the government will be bound by any vote of parliament.</p> <p>Lidington says what May said about this yesterday had been agreed by cabinet.</p> <p>He says he will say more on this shortly.</p> <p><strong>Ken Clarke</strong>, the Tory pro-European, says it is important to know if the government will vote in favour of extending article 50 if its deal gets defeated.

It sounded a bit like it, because that would explain his decision to opt for a portmanteau PMQs strategy, lobbing attack lines at Theresa May on a very wide range of economic and welfare policies. It sounded a bit like a medley of Labour conference greatest hits. The problem with this approach is that it is hard to get anything to stick, and most of the exchanges felt like a high-scoring draw, with May firing back with her own CCHQ talking points. Corbyn\u2019s point about increasing food bank use and welfare changes being to blame was powerful, but because his questions were wide-ranging, rather than focused, May got off rather lightly. (If you ask about universal credit, you are entitled to an answer. If you try to shoehorn UC, plus the two-child limit, plus the benefit cap, plus Sure Start centres into your questions, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you just receive a broad-brush response.) That said, it was interesting that Corbyn felt confident enough to start with an attack on May\u2019s record on economic growth (which is conventionally seen as more of a Tory issue than a Corbyn one). And Corbyn\u2019s peroration (ie, his sixth question) was first-class. This is the one that his office clips for YouTube and other social media, and for that audience it is all that matters. As May pointed out in her response, not everything he said may have passed the factcheck test, but it was enough to make the outing a Corbyn success.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c767ec5e4b02ea1bd8e4f2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T12:17:44.454Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn asks about the food bank in Hastings. Demand there has gone up by 80%. A significant proportion of referrals relate to benefit changes. Last week the Resolution Foundation said child poverty was on course to reach record limits. Will May end the two-child limit and the benefit cap, and restore Sure Start centres.</p> <p>May says welfare should be fair for claimants, but also for taxpayers. Absolute child poverty is at a record low. A child growing up in a home where parents work is less likely to be in poverty. Will May accept that work is the best route out of poverty.</p> <p>Corbyn says it clearly is not working, because people doing two or three jobs have to access food banks. May used to talk about the just about managing. But they are not managing. Child poverty is up, pensioner poverty is up, homelessness is up, manufacturing is in recession, and austerity is not over. People in low income are getting poorer while the rich getting richer. And the government\u2019s handling of Brexit is making things worse. Are any of these burning injustices a priority for the prime minister?</p> <p>May says manufacturing is not in recession. And Corbyn is wrong about the lowest earners; they have seen the highest rise for 20 years because of the national living wage. Income tax has been cut, and fuel duty frozen. She says Labour voted against these tax cuts. It is working people who always pay the price of Labour. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c767e09e4b02ea1bd8e4f23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T12:12:43.768Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says the richest have seen their incomes grow, while the poorest are getting poorer. Will May commit to ending the benefit freeze?</p> <p>May say the top 1% pay 28% of income tax. That is higher than under Labour. Income inequality is lower than under Labour. And the lowest earners have had their fastest pay rise for 20 years under the national minimum wage.</p> <p>Corbyn says the Tories opposed the principle of the minimum wage. Will the PM intervene to make sure staff working in government departments get the London living wage. This month Amber Rudd admitted universal credit is driving people to food banks. Or does May think rising poverty is a price worth paying.</p> <p>May says changes are being made to universal credit. For example, the taper rate has been cut. The seven-day wait has been cut. And there is an overlap for people on housing benefit. While the government was making those changes, Labour opposed them.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c767d61e4b01c747a0e4ba9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T12:09:36.541Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> says he hopes the tensions over Kashmir can be eased, and that no lives will be lost.</p> <p>The Bank of England says growth this year will be the lowest for a decade.

This rules out a no-deal Brexit and calls for greater environmental protections after Brexit.</p> <p>4) The Angus Brendan MacNeill amendment.

This states the commitments Theresa May gave yesterday about MPs being able to vote to extend article 50 on 14 March if no deal has been agreed and MPs have voted to rule out no deal.</p> <p>10) The Anna Soubry amendment. With backing from the Lib Dems, and from Independent Group MPs, this calls for a second referendum.</p> <p>11) The Lib Dem amendment. This says the government should set up a \u00a37.5bn Brexit support fund \u201cto mitigate job losses causes by Brexit uncertainty\u201d.</p> <p>12) The John Baron amendment.

The right thing to do is to have that people\u2019s vote and we need to extend article 50 for as long as we need for that process to take place.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c75f512e3071da3cdd83b033ac7e8eb36c0e23e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c75f512e3071da3cdd83b033ac7e8eb36c0e23e2/775_1046_1671_1003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Blackford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Blackford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c764a8be4b0bf6ca5d8425a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-27T09:18:35.316Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg drops his calls for wholesale removal of backstop</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May still claims she can persuade MPs to support her Brexit view. A common view at Westminster is that, given the unprecedented scale of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/15/theresa-may-loses-brexit-deal-vote-by-majority-of-230\">her defeat by a majority of 230 in January, </a>she is pushing optimism well beyond all reasonable bounds and that she is now mired in delusion. But there are some shreds of evidence to suggest that her strategy of running down the clock, pushing all sides to the point where they are so desperate for a deal that they will compromise, is working and we heard a very good example on the Today programme about half an hour ago. <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, who as chair of the European Research Group represents the 50-plus Tories who are most in favour of a hard Brexit, conceded that he is shifting. He admitted that he is not quite as hostile to the backstop as he used to be.</p> <p>Until recently many hardline Brexiters were demanding the wholesale removal of the backstop from the withdrawal agreement. Indeed only last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/23/brexit-latest-news-developments-pmqs-may-corbyn-wont-be-able-to-use-vote-next-week-to-stop-no-deal-liam-fox-claims-politics-live?page=with:block-5c48917ae4b051f53796697f#liveblog-navigation\">during a big speech in Westminster,</a> Rees-Mogg himself said: \u201cAs long as the backstop is there, I will not vote for the deal.\u201d That was the same day he suggested that May should suspend parliament rather than give in to demands to extend article 50. But now Rees-Mogg seems relatively relaxed about the possible extension of article 50 that could happen following May\u2019s announcement yesterday and, in his Today interview, he admitted that he was softening his position on the backstop. You could tell he was engaged in a U-turn because he started talking in Latin to obscure what he was up to. He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can live with the de facto removal of the backstop, even if it isn\u2019t de jure. What do I mean by that? I mean that if there is a clear date that says the backstop ends, and that that is in the text of the treaty, or equivalent to the text of the treaty - if it were to be an appendix to the treaty; bear in mind, the Irish backstop is in itself an appendix to the treaty. So if you had a further appendix that said, \u2018This will not go beyond a particular date\u2019, and a short date, not a long date, then that would remove the backstop in the lifetime of parliament. That would have a reasonable effect from my point of view ...</p> <p>A changed deal is a changed deal. Of course, I would be open to considering that. </p> </blockquote> <p>This does not mean May is anywhere close to getting her deal through parliament. But it is a shift, and it may turn out to be significant.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Sajid Javid, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee.</p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>The Metropolitan police and the National Crime Agency give evidence to the Lords EU home affairs committee on security in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p><em>12pm</em>: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> <p><em>Around 1pm: </em>MPs begin the latest Brexit next steps debate.

      "bodyText": "The voting turned out to be more interesting than we expected. Of the four big Brexit debates held this year, that was the first that did not involve Theresa May losing a vote. Two things stand out about that final division. Hardcore Tory Brexiters split this evening as only 20 of them supported a move to vote against the Yvette Cooper amendment. It is estimated that at least 50 Tory MPs (and up to 90, according to today\u2019s Financial Times) support the European Research Group, which represents those Tories pushing for a harder Brexit. Sometimes they operate as a bloc. When May lost the vote two weeks ago, it was because 67 Tories \u2013 mostly ERG supporters \u2013 abstained. But tonight that bloc fractured. It seems that some of the maverick Brexiters pushed for a vote against the wishes of the more mainstream Brexiters in the ERG hierarchy (ie, Mark Francois, an ERG vice chair, according to Ben Bradshaw\u2019s tweet - see 7.43pm.) Continuity ERG versus the Provisional ERG, if you like. It did not matter tonight, but it may be a harbinger of what will happen when May next brings her deal to the Commons. Theresa May won the final vote handsomely - but only by co-opting the ideas promoted by Yvette Cooper. The two are rivals; Cooper shadowed May for a long time when May was home secretary. Originally Number 10 said the government would abstain on the Cooper amendment, but in the end the government voted for it. That meant government MPs were voting for a Cooper amendment that essentially restated a commitment given by May in the Commons yesterday in response to a long-running campaign led by Cooper. Truly, their careers are entwined. Here is the list of the 20 Tory MPs who voted against Cooper. None of them are from the ERG leadership. These are the 20 Tories most likely to vote against May\u2019s deal whatever concessions she achieves. And here is our earlier story on the debate. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The Cooper amendment has passed by 502 votes to 20 \u2013 a majority of 482. This from the Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones. And here is Yvette Cooper on the decision of some Brexiters to oppose her motion. This is from Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw. Here is the text of the Yvette Cooper amendment that MPs are now voting on. At end, add \u201c; and further notes in particular the commitment of the prime minister made in this house to hold a second meaningful vote by 12 March and if the house, having rejected leaving with the deal negotiated with the EU, then rejects leaving on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement and future framework, the government will, on 14 March, bring forward a motion on whether parliament wants to seek a short limited extension to article 50, and if the house votes for an extension, seek to agree that extension approved by the house with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension.\u201d These are from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. Bercow has just announced the tellers. The tellers for the noes are Peter Bone and Sir Christopher Chope \u2013 confirming that it is hardcore Brexiters who have forced the division. Caroline Spelman formally withdraws her amendment. Alberto Costa moves his, and it goes through on the nod. And Yvette Cooper moves her amendment. John Bercow, the speaker, takes the vote by acclamation, but some MPs object. So he calls a division. The government is not voting against this amendment, so it will go through easily. But presumably some Brexiters are voting against to make a point. The SNP amendment has been defeated by 324 votes to 288 \u2013 a majority of 36. This is from my colleague Peter Walker. MPs are now voting on the SNP amendment. This is what it says: Line 1, leave out from \u201chouse\u201d to end and add \u201cis determined not to leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and future framework under any circumstances, and regardless of any exit date\u201d. The defeat of the Labour amendment means that, in theory, the party is now committed to backing a second referendum. This is what Sir Keir Starmer said in the debate earlier: I want to underline the commitment that we made on Monday, that if amendment (a) [Labour\u2019s] is defeated and the prime minister still refuses to negotiate a close economic relationship, Labour will support or table an amendment in favour of a public vote. That public vote would include a credible leave option and remain. It could be attached to the prime minister\u2019s deal \u2013 what I have called a lock against a damaging Tory Brexit - or it could be attached to any deal that managed to win a majority in the House of Commons. The Labour amendment has been defeated by 323 votes to 240 \u2013 a majority of 83. Chris Leslie, who left Labour last week to join the Independent Group, has criticised Labour for not supporting the second referendum amendment backed by his new grouping. (See 11.53am.) It was not called, and so won\u2019t be put to a vote, but his point is that if Labour had supported it, it might have been. He said: Labour\u2019s failure to support the cross-party amendment tabled by the Independent Group \u2013 that would have helped pave the way for a public vote \u2013 ensured the opportunity was missed. Instead the Labour leadership are stuck repeating their already-rejected approach, sending confused signals about what their Brexit policy actually is. Turning back to Chris Williamson, this is from HuffPost\u2019s Arj Singh. MPs are now voting on the Labour amendment. This is what it says. Line 1, leave out from \u201chouse\u201d to end and add \u201cinstructs ministers (a) to negotiate with the EU for changes to the political declaration to secure: i. a permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU; ii. close alignment with the single market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations; iii. dynamic alignment on rights and protections; iv. commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation; and v. unambiguous agreement on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European arrest warrant and vital shared databases; and (b) to introduce primary legislation to give statutory effect to this negotiating mandate.\u201d In the Commons Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is now winding up for the government. Alberto Costa, the Conservative MP, says the government has accepted his amendment. Will the PM be writing to Donald Tusk to ask if the EU will agree to let the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement be \u201ccarved out\u201d, so that if there is no deal, that part can stand? Barclay says the government will write to the EU institutions to ask if they will agree to this. Barclay says government will ask the EU to keep the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement if the whole of the agreement falls in the event of no deal. Barclay also says the government will accept the Cooper amendment. (See 2.18pm.) He says, if there is a Commons debate on extending article 50, the motion will be amendable. And he restates the commitments given yesterday by Theresa May on MPs getting a vote on extending article 50, if May\u2019s deal is not agreed. Barclay says he hopes this gives Cooper the assurances she wants. (See 5.22pm.) Yvette Cooper intervenes. She says she has seen reports on Twitter saying that Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said the UK could leave the EU without a deal, even if the Commons voted otherwise. Barclay says he is not aware of these comments. But he says he has set out the government\u2019s position. Turning back to Chris Williamson, these are from Channel 4 News\u2019 Michael Crick. In the Commons Matthew Pennycook, the shadow Brexit minister, is winding up for Labour. He says it has \u201clong been obvious\u201d to many Labour MPs that the UK will have to extend article 50. Yet, until yesterday, Theresa May refused to accept that, he says. Despite the French president\u2019s stern words today about extending article 50, MEPs who follow Brexit dealings closely argue that they ultimately won\u2019t count for much because Berlin will have the final say. \u201cIn the end the Germans will take the initiative to ensure a negotiated Brexit,\u201d said the Greek MEP Giorgos Kyrtsos, who sits on the conservative European People\u2019s party working group that is following the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. He told the Guardian: Germany is well aware that a hard exit will mean loss of exports and already it\u2019s growth rate is falling ... like Brussels it doesn\u2019t think it can afford a hard Brexit either economically or psychologically. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Turning back to Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, says if article 50 is extended, it should only be for a couple of months. The EU has had enough of Brexit, he suggests. Here is his Facebook post in full. If the UK parliament rejects her deal, Theresa May would like to extend the negotiating period. In my firm opinion, if this happens, this can never be longer than a couple of months so that a cross-party majority can be found. But certainly not 21 months! The Union has been taken hostage by the Brexit already for too long. The UK has had almost two years to make up its mind, now it is time to decide: A deal, no deal or stay. For the Union it is high time that we can spend our energy on more positive projects and the in depth reforms Europe desperately needs. This is from the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Liz Bates, who broke the story about Chris Williamson telling a meeting that Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to complaints about antisemitism. Stephen Pollard, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, also thinks the suspension of Chris Williamson is an indirect consequence of the Independent Group defections last week, or at least that of Luciana Berger. The New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush has written a good blogpost on the suspension of Chris Williamson. Here is an extract. The official line is that Williamson\u2019s suspension is a decision taken in the light of a pattern of behaviour by the Derby North MP. But no one could, with a straight face, claim that Williamson\u2019s behaviour is a recent discovery. The truth is that Williamson has been repeatedly indulged by the Labour leadership due to his political proximity to Corbyn, and it will have been a very difficult blow for Corbyn personally to remove the whip from him. What matters is that the scale of anger among Labour MPs and activists, coupled with the risk of further defections to the Independent Group, forced the leadership\u2019s hand ... It also is an indication of the scale of the change wrought on Labour politics by the emergence of TIG. Had seven MPs not left the Labour party on Monday last week to form a breakaway group, then Williamson would still be a Labour MP now. The BBC\u2019s Carolyn Quinn says Chris Williamson has also said that he is going to clear his name because he has \u201ca very strong case\u201d and there is no evidence against him. Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner has just doorstepped Chris Williamson outside the Red Lion pub at Westminster. Williamson told Rayner that the complaint was now being handled within the party\u2019s disciplinary process and that he would be \u201cworking to clear my name\u201d. When it was put to him that John Mann had called him an enabler of antisemitism within the Labour party, Williamson said: I\u2019ve made my comment. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more I can say now. Asked if he thought he would be readmitted to the party, or if he had been reassured by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office that he would be allowed back in, Williamson terminated the interview by saying that he had to go back into the pub to return his glass. My colleague Owen Jones, who, unlike some of the Labour MPs welcoming the decision to suspend Chris Williamson, is on the Corbynite wing of the party, is also saying the party has done the right thing. And Labour MPs are speaking out in favour of the move too. Here are tweets from three of them. Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, has also welcomed the decision to suspend Chris Williamson. The Labour MP Richard Burden has welcomed the party\u2019s decision to suspend Chris Williamson for saying Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic,\u201d about complaints of antisemitism. Back in the Commons, Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who has led efforts to ensure MPs get a vote on blocking a no-deal Brexit, has just finished her speech. She started by saying her husband, the former shadow chancellor turned Strictly Come Dancing star, Ed Balls, is currently climbing Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief. She said that had prompted family jokes about whether that was harder than trying to reach agreement on Brexit. As the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul points out, she said her cross-party campaign had led to significant changes from the government; no deal was no longer the default option if Theresa May\u2019s deal got voted down, Cooper said. But she said she would like Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, to confirm some of these assurances in his speech winding up. She said she would like him to confirm that, if the PM\u2019s deal gets voted down, a no-deal Brexit is not the default option. She said she wanted confirmation that, when MPs debated extending article 50, the motion would be amendable. And she said she wanted confirmation that, if the EU changed the length of the proposed article 50 extension, MPs would get the chance to vote on the final proposal. She said, if these assurances were given, the Spelman amendment would not be put to a vote. See 2.18pm. (Confusingly, the Spelman amendment is basically the old Cooper amendment.) But Cooper said she would put her amendment (see 2.18pm) to a vote. Her amendment restates what May offered yesterday on MPs getting a vote on extending article 50, but Cooper said it was important to have this written down and added to the text of the motion. A Labour party spokesperson said: Chris Williamson is suspended from the party, and therefore the whip, pending investigation. Williamson had been issued with a \u201cnotice of investigation for a pattern of behaviour\u201d, but a decision was later taken by the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, to suspend him. The Labour party has suspended Chris Williamson, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. This is the fourth big Brexit debate the Commons has held this year. We have had the first meaningful vote debate (MV1), which led to MPs voting down the deal by a majority of 230; the first next steps vote (NS1), which saw MPs passing the Brady amendment, as well as an amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit; and the second next steps vote (NS2), which saw MPs voting down the main government motion because the ERG refused to support May. Today\u2019s debate (NS3) is (so far) the least dramatic by some measure. Following the government\u2019s decision to accept the Costa amendment, there does not seem to be much risk of Theresa May being defeated tonight. But in Brexitland the news never entirely runs dry, and it has not been without interest. Here are the main points. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, announced that the government would back Alberto Costa\u2019s amendment on citizens\u2019 rights - even though Theresa May dismissed it yesterday. (See 3.16pm and 3.21pm.) Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said this made it hard to see why Costa was forced to quit his job as a parliamentary private secretary. Starmer said: It\u2019s a vignette on how Brexit has been going, but I think the question that the house is struggling with is why [Costa] has been forced to resign in the circumstances where the government is accepting his amendment. Lidington described a no-deal Brexit as \u201cchaotic\u201d. He said: I do not believe that the other governments of the European Union have either an economic interest or a strategic interest in seeing a chaotic departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union. He confirmed that, if MPs were to vote for an article 50 extension for one period of time, but the EU were to insist on an alternative timescale, MPs would get the chance to vote on the final plan. (See 3.04pm.) He said: The matter would come back to the house and there would be an opportunity for members to put forward amendments to urge particular courses of action ... Frankly I just do not see any circumstance in which, if there were a period that had been agreed with the EU or had the potential to be agreed, the government would not bring this back to the house. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said that if Labour\u2019s motion is defeated tonight, it will back giving voters a choice between a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d and remain in a referendum. (See 3.57pm.) HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh says this might not be as straightforward as it sounds. Starmer said he did not think May would achieve any real change to the withdrawal agreement between now and 12 March, by when she is due to hold the next meaningful vote. He said: I\u2019m afraid it seems an expectation that between now and 12 March, there\u2019s going to be a change to the deal and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. For all the talk of discussion here and in Brussels, the stark truth is this, not one word of the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration has changed since it was signed off on 25 November of last year, not one word, that\u2019s 94 days, three months ago. The expectation that in the next 14 days all of that is going to change, seems to me extremely unlikely and not going to be fulfilled. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative Brexiter, hinted that he was relaxing his opposition to May\u2019s deal. Speaking in an intervention, he said it would not be necessary to \u201cunpick the withdrawal agreement\u201d. He went on: We could, under international law, have a conditional interpretative declaration stating the backstop is not permanent. If we get that and if the attorney general changes his mind will he join me in urging all my Brexiteer colleagues to vote for this agreement. Because the choice is no longer perhaps between an imperfect deal and no deal \u2013 it is between an imperfect deal and no Brexit. In the debate Stephen Gethins, the SNP\u2019s Europe spokesman, says Theresa May refuses to sack cabinet ministers who disagree with her publicly. Yet the government has sacked Alberto Costa for tabling an amendment that it now support, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s an extraordinary state of affairs,\u201d he says. Dame Caroline Spelman says she will not be pressing her amendment (see 2.18pm) to a vote tonight. Downing Street has insisted that Alberto Costa was not been sacked as a parliamentary private secretary. \u201cHe resigned from the government,\u201d the Number 10 spokesman said. The spokesman went on: You will be aware that there is a longstanding convention that members of the government payroll, including PPSs, don\u2019t table amendments to government bills. Clearly this is an issue that he feels very strongly about, and so he has chosen to resign. The government will not oppose Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment confirming the commitment to hold a vote on extending article 50 if the deal has not been passed by mid-March, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has said \u2013 but only because they think it doesn\u2019t add anything new. Asked about Cooper\u2019s amendment, the spokesman said: We would consider that amendment not to be necessary because it simply confirms the words the PM delivered from the dispatch box yesterday. On that basis it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d oppose something which simply confirmed the prime minister\u2019s own words. Dame Caroline Spelman, the Conservative former cabinet minister, is speaking now. She says she thinks the government and Labour frontbenches are \u201cwithin touching distance\u201d of an agreement. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry asks Starmer if he agrees with Martin Wolf in the Financial Times today (paywall), when he said: \u201cIf democracy means anything, it is the right to change a country\u2019s mind.\u201d Starmer says he does agree. And he points out that David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, used to say the same himself. And that\u2019s it. Starmer has finished. Labour\u2019s Gareth Snell (one of the most leave-sympathetic MPs in the party) asks what sort of deal Starmer would like to see on the ballot paper that would persuade him to vote for it, not remain. Or is Labour\u2019s policy remain at any cost? Starmer says Labour is pressing an amendment tonight that proposes a Brexit deal. Starmer says if Labour\u2019s amendment is defeated, Labour will put forward an amendment for a public vote. It will include an option for a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d, and remain. Starmer confirms Labour backs giving voters a choice between a \u201ccredible leave option\u201d and remain in a referendum if Labour\u2019s amendment is defeated tonight. He says an MP suggested earlier that a second referendum would be a mistake because it would generate social unrest. But this is about stopping no deal, and a no-deal Brexit could provoke disorder too, he says. He also says he does not think MPs should talk up the risk of disorder, because that could encourage it. And he also says that parliament should not be put off wanting to do the right thing by a threat. Here is the Guardian story about Emmanuel Macron\u2019s comment earlier, saying France will block a Brexit delay unless there is a \u201cnew choice\u201d by Britain. This is from Politico Europe\u2019s Tom McTague. Here is the text of the Jeremy Corbyn letter to all MPs about Labour\u2019s amendment (pdf). Jeremy Corbyn has written to all MPs in the Commons, including Tories, inviting them to back Labour\u2019s Brexit amendment, and offering them a briefing on it from Labour\u2019s team if they want one. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. Sir Oliver Letwin asks Starmer for an assurance that Labour is willing to be flexible. Starmer says Labour is playing its part in the cross-party talks. But he says he is \u201ccautious\u201d about the likelihood of there being an agreement within the next 14 days. Back in the Commons Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, intervenes and asks Starmer if he noticed that, when Lidington was going through Labour\u2019s five Brexit demands, he did not seem to disagree with any of them. Clarke says this shows why the two main parties need to cooperate on Brexit. Starmer says he will not comment on what has been said in private talks. The campaign which represents EU nationals in the UK, the3million, says what Theresa May said about the Costa amendment in the Commons yesterday (see 3.21pm) was wrong. Starmer says, in this job, he spends a lot of time looking at borders. He says the border in Ireland is not just about goods crossing from one country to another. It is not just a technical exercise. It is something that has guaranteed peace, he says. Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, says the UK has obligations under an international treaty (the Good Friday agreement) relating to the Irish border. Starmer welcomes what Grieve said. Starmer says that when MPs vote again on the deal, it will be the same deal as the one they previously rejected. Referring to Theresa May\u2019s announcement about a work stream looking at alternative arrangements for the border in Ireland, he says this will not make people change their minds. Any country would want to streamline their customs arrangements, he says. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now. He starts by reading out, to laughter from MPs, what happened at the home affairs committee when Sajid Javid, the home secretary, revealed that he did not know what Theresa May had said about the Costa amendment. (See 11.19am.) Starmer welcomes the government\u2019s decision to back the amendment. But he demands to know why Alberto Costa was sacked for tabling it since it is now government policy. This is what Theresa May told MPs yesterday in response to Jeremy Corbyn asking her about the Costa amendment. As I covered in my statement, the EU does not have the legal authority to do a separate deal on citizens\u2019 rights without a new mandate. This is a matter, unless it is part of the withdrawal agreement \u2013 obviously, we have negotiated something within the withdrawal agreement; good rights for citizens within the withdrawal agreement \u2013 for individual member states. We have taken up the issue with individual member states. A number of them have already given good guarantees to UK citizens and we are encouraging those that have not to do so. And this is what the Costa amendment says. At end, add \u201c; and requires the prime minister to seek at the earliest opportunity a joint UK-EU commitment to adopt part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens\u2019 rights and ensure its implementation prior to the UK\u2019s exiting the European Union, whatever the outcome of negotiations on other aspects of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d Lidington now turns to the Costa amendment. He says the government takes the need to protect citizens\u2019 rights very seriously. He says, if there is no deal, what happens to UK nationals on the continent will be a matter for individual countries. Some countries have offered satisfactory assurances, but others have not, he says. He says access to healthcare is a particular issue. He says the EU has been clear that it will not allow just the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement to stand on its own. He says the government will accept the amendment today, because its political objectives are the same as Costa\u2019s. It will take this up with the EU, and see if they can be persuaded to adopt the position that they have adopted up to now. Lidington announces that the government is accepting the Costa amendment on citizens\u2019 rights, even though Theresa May dismissed this yesterday. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks Lidington\u2019s answer to Liz Kendall (see 3.04pm) was significant. Nick Boles, a Conservative opposed to a no-deal Brexit, asks for an assurance that MPs will get to vote on the length of the article 50 extension, if the length agreed by the government with the EU is different from the length originally proposed in the motion passed by parliament. Lidington says MPs will get the chance to have their say, because the next steps vote due to take place under the EU Withdrawal Act means they will get a further vote. Sir Oliver Letwin intervenes to say he thinks Lidington\u2019s answer was helpful, and he says he hopes that settles the matter. Anne Main, a Conservative, says the EU would only grant an extension for a reason. What would the reason be, if MPs had again voted down the deal? Lidington says he is being asked to go \u201cdeeper into the realms\u201d of the hypothetical. Lidington turns to the amendments. Referring to the Cooper amendment, he summarises what Theresa May said yesterday. It replicates, almost word for word, what the Cooper amendment says. He says these are commitments made by the prime minister, \u201cand the government will stick to them\u201d. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Tory MP who backed the original Cooper amendment, thanks Lidington for what he said \u2013 not that he doubted the word of the PM, he adds. He says he thinks there is no need for the Cooper amendment to be put to a vote now. Yvette Cooper asks if the government would vote for any legislation to change the exit day brought forward as a result of the vote promised by the prime minister. And she asks about the length of an extension. Lidington says the government would want a short extension, but that it would have to be negotiated with the EU. He says, if the government was bringing forward legislation following a vote in parliament, it would support that legislation. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall asks what would happen if the EU only offered the UK a long extension. Lidington says the default position is for the UK to leave. He says he does not believes that the other governments of the EU have either an economic or strategic interest in seeing a chaotic Brexit. He says the vote promised by the PM yesterday would be in addition to the next steps vote promised anyway under section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act. So MPs would get the chance to urge particular courses of action, he says. Anna Soubry, the former Tory MP who now sits as an Independent Group MP, says the no-deal document (pdf) published yesterday was an accurate summary of the information presented to cabinet about what would happen under no deal. She says she knows, because she saw the original papers. Antoinette Sandbach, the Tory pro-European, says some small businesses may have been misled by claims from Brexiters that, if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal, it would be able to continue trading on tariff-free terms for up to 10 years, under article 24 of the WTO\u2019s general agreement on tariffs and trade. Lidington agrees. He says Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said those claims are wrong, and this point was repeated in the no-deal document published by the government yesterday. This is what the document (pdf) said: One argument that has been put forward in relation to our future economic relationship with the EU is that the UK can simply rely on the provisions under Article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) to have tariff-free trade with the EU for a 10-year period. This is a misunderstanding of what the rules are. As the secretary of state for international trade [Liam Fox] told the House of Commons on 14 January this year: \u201cSome have suggested that it would be possible under Article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to maintain tariff-free trade as an alternative to the negotiated agreement in a no-deal scenario. There are two immediate problems facing that suggestion. The first is that it would require the agreement of the EU and be based on the expectation of a future trade agreement or customs union to be operable in WTO law. Although it might be argued, as I am sure many in the house would, that that would be in the economic interests of the EU27, we all know from experience that the politics of the EU can take precedence over economic pragmatism. In the political atmosphere of no deal, it would be difficult to cultivate the good will necessary for that to proceed. Secondly, that suggestion would not deal with all the regulatory issues \u2013 the non-tariff barriers \u2013 that are so important to many businesses.\u201d Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who has led efforts to ensure MPs get a vote on ruling out no deal, asks for an assurance that the government will be bound by any vote of parliament. Lidington says what May said about this yesterday had been agreed by cabinet. He says he will say more on this shortly. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says it is important to know if the government will vote in favour of extending article 50 if its deal gets defeated. Or will it vote for no deal? That must have been discussed at cabinet, he says. Lidington says Clarke is asking him to comment on \u201ca hypothetical whipping decision on a hypothetical vote\u201d. He says he hopes that will not take place, because he hopes MPs vote for May\u2019s deal. Politico Europe\u2019s Charlie Cooper, who has been listening to the debate, does not accept the argument that the ERG are softening their objections to the withdrawal agreement. (See 9.18am.) Lidington says an abrupt departure from the EU would provide a shock to the economy. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says President Macron said an article 50 extension would have to be for a purpose. The obvious purpose is for a referendum, she says. Lidington says, in talks with the government, the EU has always said it would want to know the reasons for an article 50 extension. So there is nothing surprising in what Macron said, he says. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks about President Macron\u2019s comment about not accepting the request for an article 50 extension without a clear justification. (See 1.33pm.) Lidington claims there is no difference between that and what Theresa May has said. Back in the debate Lidington says it would be a mistake for MPs to think that EU leaders spend all their time thinking about Brexit. There are other issues they want to address, he says. The DUP has put out a statement saying that it will back the Costa amendment. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, said: Part two of the draft withdrawal agreement on citizens\u2019 rights is one of the elements which should be supported right across the House of Commons. It is right therefore that this aspect should be agreed with the European Union whatever the outcome of negotiations are. It is the sensible thing to do and it is the right thing to do. The amendment has already received significant cross-party support from both leave and remain supporters alike. It is one that I would hope will be passed by the House of Commons and that the European Union would respond positively to this move and ensure that fears around citizens\u2019 rights can be laid to rest once and for all at the earliest possible opportunity. You can read the full text of the Costa amendment, and all other amendments, here, on the order paper (pdf). This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. Amendment C is the Spelman one and amendment F is the Cooper one. (See 2.18pm.) But the Cooper amendment is essentially just a summary of what Theresa May promised yesterday about MPs getting a possible vote on extending article 50, and so it is hard to see why ministers would not back it. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has put out a statement condemning the treatment of Alberto Costa. She said: The sacking of Alberto Costa for supporting citizens\u2019 rights prolongs the anxiety and uncertainty that over 5 million people have faced for two-and-a-half years. Alberto Costa\u2019s amendment was a sensible measure trying to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK and our own British citizens in the EU. These people are our friends and our neighbours and they don\u2019t deserve to be treated as a political football kicked between the Home Office and No 10. The SNP\u2019s Tommy Sheppard asks what the government\u2019s policy will be if there are votes on accepting a no-deal Brexit, or extending article 50. Lidington says he is being asked to comment on a hypothetical situation. He is focused on getting a deal, he says. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks about the PM\u2019s commitment to let MPs vote on extending article 50 if there is no deal by 14 March. Would MPs be able to table amendments changing the length of the article 50 extension? Lidington says it is up to the Speaker to decide what amendments are called. But he says, if there were no deal, section 13 of the EU Withdrawal Act would still apply (the clause that says MPs should get a vote on what happens next, on an amendable motion). David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, is opening the debate for the government. The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake asks Lidington to confirm that the government\u2019s view of the Costa amendment is. The home secretary said he approved of it, Brake says, but Alberto Costa was sacked for tabling it. Lidington says he will address this in due course. The Brexit debate is starting now. John Bercow, the Speaker, announces that he is five calling amendments. Here they are, in the order in which they will be put to a vote. 1) The Labour amendment. This requires the government to negotiate changes to the political declaration in line with the five Brexit demands set out in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s recent letter to Theresa May. It does not mention a second referendum. 2) The SNP amendment. This says the UK should not leave the EU without a deal \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d. 3) The Caroline Spelman amendment. Jointly tabled with Jack Dromey, this would create time for a Commons debate tomorrow on the Yvette Cooper bill allowing the Commons to legislate to rule out a no-deal Brexit. 4) The Alberto Costa amendment. This says the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement should be implemented even if there is no deal. 5) The Yvette Cooper amendment. This states the commitments Theresa May gave yesterday about MPs being able to vote to extend article 50 on 14 March if no deal has been agreed and MPs have voted to rule out no deal. Voting will start at 7pm. If all amendments get put to a vote, and if there is a vote on the main motion, the voting will carry on until about 8.30pm. But, in practice, the main motion will probably go through on the nod, and it is quite possible that some or all of the backbench amendments could get pulled (depending on what assurances are given from the dispatch box). It could all be over by about 7.30pm. This is from Reuters. The European Union is ready to respond to any UK request for an extension to the Brexit timetable, and problems such as the European parliament elections can be overcome if there is the political will, Romania\u2019s minister for European affairs said. George Ciamba told Reuters on Wednesday that Romania, as the current holder of the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, was still making plans for a disorderly Brexit but was more optimistic after Theresa May paved the way for a delay beyond the planned Brexit date of 29 March. These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. He thinks Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman may have redefined the nature of the commitment given by Labour on Monday about backing a second referendum. But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is saying she would agree to an article 50 extension, according to Deutsche Welle\u2019s Maximilian Hofman. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, says the EU should not agree to extend article 50 without a \u201cclear objective\u201d, Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam reports. \u201cSenior ministers believe that the European Union will insist on a Brexit delay of up to two years if Britain fails to agree a deal in the next few weeks\u201d, Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil report in the Evening Standard. \u201cSeveral sources have told the Standard they do not think the sort of \u201cshort, limited extension\u201d of article 50 suggested by Theresa May in the Commons yesterday would be permitted by Brussels.\u201d The fate of a backbench amendment seeking to guarantee EU citizens\u2019 rights is up in the air after the home secretary backed it and then the MP who tabled it was sacked from the government, Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Sajid Javid said the government would support the amendment laid by the Tory MP Alberto Costa to ringfence EU citizens\u2019 future rights under a no-deal Brexit, hours after Theresa May dismissed it as unworkable. But less than an hour after Javid made his comments, Costa was sacked from his post as parliamentary private secretary to the Scottish secretary, David Mundell. Here is Lisa\u2019s full story. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. The Tory MP Alberto Costa has been sacked from his post as a parliamentary private secretary in the Scotland Office over his bid to get EU citizens\u2019 rights ringfenced in the event of no deal. (See 11.19am and 11.53am.) He was asked to resign after tabling an amendment calling on Theresa May to seek an urgent meeting with the EU to do a side deal securing the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals settled in the EU. \u201cIt seems ridiculous for the government to be sacking a parliamentary private secretary over an amendment that has cross party support and the support of upwards of 60 Tory backbenchers and Sajid Javid,\u201d said a source. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, devoted his two questions at PMQs to Brexit. He started by urging May to rule out a no-deal Brexit and he accused her of \u201cblackmailing\u201d the country with the prospect of what might happen if her deal is not agreed. Theresa May said that there were only two ways to remove the threat of no deal. She would not revoke article 50, she said. So the only way to remove the threat of no deal was to vote for her deal, she said. Blackford said there was another option; article 50 could be extended to allow for a second referendum, he said. He said May was fooling no one. Parliament will not be bullied into a very bad choice of accepting her very bad deal or no deal at all. May said another referendum would not solve the problem. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, says Chris Williamson\u2019s apology (see 12.44pm) is insufficient. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, says yet again the media had verbatim reports from cabinet yesterday. Wouldn\u2019t it just be easier to televise these meetings? May says Bone has talked about being promoted to cabinet. Perhaps the two issues are linked, and he wants to be on TV the whole time. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. Earlier during PMQs May said Corbyn should suspend Chris Williamson over his comment about Labour being too apologetic about antisemitism allegations., Williamson himself has just issued this apology on Twitter. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says the prospects of May being able to get the changes she wants to the withdrawal agreement have been undermined by yesterday\u2019s events. He says he does not know what an article 50 extension would achieve. May says she is continue to press for legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement. She says the government does not want to extend article 50. The SNP\u2019s Angela Crawley asks why carers are being penalised under universal credit. May says she will get the relevant minister to write to Crawley about this. John Whittingdale, the Tory former cabinet minster, says it is five years since the annexation of Crimea by Russia. Will the government increase sanctions to force it to withdraw. May says the government has condemned and continues to condemn the annexation of Crimea. Labour\u2019s Stephen Hepburn asks about the availability of a cystic fibrosis drug. May says the NHS has to get value for money. It has made a generous offer to the drug company, Vertex. Talks are still underway with the company. Justine Greening, the Tory former education secretary, asks May if she supports the restoration of maintenance grants for students. May says this is being considered by the review of student funding currently underway. Labour\u2019s Bambos Charalambous asks about crime in his Enfield Southgate constituency. His constituents do not feel safe. Will May increase police funding? May says Met funding is going up. She says Charalambous should take this up with the Labour mayor of London. PMQs - Snap verdict: Is Jeremy Corbyn expecting an early election? It sounded a bit like it, because that would explain his decision to opt for a portmanteau PMQs strategy, lobbing attack lines at Theresa May on a very wide range of economic and welfare policies. It sounded a bit like a medley of Labour conference greatest hits. The problem with this approach is that it is hard to get anything to stick, and most of the exchanges felt like a high-scoring draw, with May firing back with her own CCHQ talking points. Corbyn\u2019s point about increasing food bank use and welfare changes being to blame was powerful, but because his questions were wide-ranging, rather than focused, May got off rather lightly. (If you ask about universal credit, you are entitled to an answer. If you try to shoehorn UC, plus the two-child limit, plus the benefit cap, plus Sure Start centres into your questions, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you just receive a broad-brush response.) That said, it was interesting that Corbyn felt confident enough to start with an attack on May\u2019s record on economic growth (which is conventionally seen as more of a Tory issue than a Corbyn one). And Corbyn\u2019s peroration (ie, his sixth question) was first-class. This is the one that his office clips for YouTube and other social media, and for that audience it is all that matters. As May pointed out in her response, not everything he said may have passed the factcheck test, but it was enough to make the outing a Corbyn success. Corbyn asks about the food bank in Hastings. Demand there has gone up by 80%. A significant proportion of referrals relate to benefit changes. Last week the Resolution Foundation said child poverty was on course to reach record limits. Will May end the two-child limit and the benefit cap, and restore Sure Start centres. May says welfare should be fair for claimants, but also for taxpayers. Absolute child poverty is at a record low. A child growing up in a home where parents work is less likely to be in poverty. Will May accept that work is the best route out of poverty. Corbyn says it clearly is not working, because people doing two or three jobs have to access food banks. May used to talk about the just about managing. But they are not managing. Child poverty is up, pensioner poverty is up, homelessness is up, manufacturing is in recession, and austerity is not over. People in low income are getting poorer while the rich getting richer. And the government\u2019s handling of Brexit is making things worse. Are any of these burning injustices a priority for the prime minister? May says manufacturing is not in recession. And Corbyn is wrong about the lowest earners; they have seen the highest rise for 20 years because of the national living wage. Income tax has been cut, and fuel duty frozen. She says Labour voted against these tax cuts. It is working people who always pay the price of Labour. Corbyn says the richest have seen their incomes grow, while the poorest are getting poorer. Will May commit to ending the benefit freeze? May say the top 1% pay 28% of income tax. That is higher than under Labour. Income inequality is lower than under Labour. And the lowest earners have had their fastest pay rise for 20 years under the national minimum wage. Corbyn says the Tories opposed the principle of the minimum wage. Will the PM intervene to make sure staff working in government departments get the London living wage. This month Amber Rudd admitted universal credit is driving people to food banks. Or does May think rising poverty is a price worth paying. May says changes are being made to universal credit. For example, the taper rate has been cut. The seven-day wait has been cut. And there is an overlap for people on housing benefit. While the government was making those changes, Labour opposed them. Jeremy Corbyn says he hopes the tensions over Kashmir can be eased, and that no lives will be lost. The Bank of England says growth this year will be the lowest for a decade. Is that because of May\u2019s policies? May says a report say UK growth will be higher than Germany\u2019s. Borrowing is down, she says. Corbyn says May may not have had time to look at the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts. It says there is a one in four chance of a recession. Manufacturers have cut jobs. Is May\u2019s shambolic Brexit to blame, or her lack of an industrial strategy. May says there has been consistent growth, quarter by quarter. Under Labour there would be capital flight and \u00a31,000bn borrowing. Julian Knight, a Conservative, asks May to agree that Birmingham council should sort out the bin strike. It shows what would happen under a hard-left government. May says this is a matter for Labour-controlled Birmingham to sort out. It shows what a hard-left Labour government would be like. Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma asks when May will \u201ccall time\u201d on the Brexit \u201cfarce\u201d and hold a referendum. May says she answered 82 questions on Brexit in the Commons yesterday. She repeats the promises she made yesterday about a possible vote on extending article 50. Theresa May starts by saying she is deeply concerned by the rising tensions between India and Pakistan. The government is monitoring developments closely, and hopes tensions can be deescalated. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. There are 12 main amendments to the Brexit motion being debated today (plus an amendment to an amendment). You can read them all on the Commons order paper here (pdf), starting on page 6. Here is a summary of what they say. 1) The Labour amendment. This requires the government to negotiate changes to the political declaration in line with the five Brexit demands set out in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s recent letter to Theresa May. It does not mention a second referendum. 2) The Caroline Spelman amendment. Jointly tabled with Jack Dromey, this would create time for a Commons debate tomorrow on the Yvette Cooper bill allowing the Commons to legislate to rule out a no-deal Brexit. 3) The Caroline Lucas amendment. This rules out a no-deal Brexit and calls for greater environmental protections after Brexit. 4) The Angus Brendan MacNeill amendment. This calls for article 50 to be revoked. 5) The SNP amendment. This says the UK should not leave the EU without a deal \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d. 6) The Plaid Cymru amendment. This says article 50 should be extended. 7) The Alberto Costa amendment. This says he citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement should be implemented even if there is no deal. 8) Another Caroline Spelman amendment. This says there should be a debate on Tuesday 19 March to allow MPs to choose between a range of Brexit options. 9) The Yvette Cooper amendment. This states the commitments Theresa May gave yesterday about MPs being able to vote to extend article 50 on 14 March if no deal has been agreed and MPs have voted to rule out no deal. 10) The Anna Soubry amendment. With backing from the Lib Dems, and from Independent Group MPs, this calls for a second referendum. 11) The Lib Dem amendment. This says the government should set up a \u00a37.5bn Brexit support fund \u201cto mitigate job losses causes by Brexit uncertainty\u201d. 12) The John Baron amendment. This says extending article 50 does not take no deal off the table. John Bercow, the speaker, will announce which amendments he has selected at the start of the debate, at around 1.45pm (after the urgent question). He will definitely call the Labour one, and there is a good chance he will call the SNP\u2019s and Alberto Costa\u2019s too, with possibly one or two others. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart on the Costa amendment. (See 11.19am.) Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons home affairs, and he came rather unstuck when he was asked if the government would be backing the Alberto Costa amendment today. Costa, a Conservative MP, has tabled an amendment saying the citizens\u2019 rights part of the withdrawal agreement should be implemented even if there is no deal. PoliticsHome\u2019s Nicholas Mairs has the clip I will post a summary of the amendments that have been tabled shortly. Labour has said Chris Williamson should apologise for his comment about the party being \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. (See 9.53am.) A party spokesman said: These comments are deeply offensive and inappropriate, and fall below the standards we expect of MPs. Downplaying the problem of antisemitism makes it harder for us to tackle it. Chris Williamson should apologise immediately and withdraw his remarks. The Electoral Commission has released its latest figures for political donations. In the last three months of 2018 \u00a310.4m was given to political parties - \u00a31.9m more than in the previous quarter. Most of it, \u00a37.4m went to the Conservatives, who received more than four time as much in donations as Labour (\u00a31.6m). The increase is almost certainly linked to speculation about a possible early election. There are more details on the Electoral Commission website here. Yesterday the arch Corbynite MP Chris Williamson was reprimanded by Labour party officials after he helped to arrange a screening in parliament of a film defending Jackie Walker, the activist suspended from the party over comments about antisemitism. This morning Williamson is in the headlines again after the Yorkshire Post uncovered a video of him saying Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d over antisemitism allegations. On Sky\u2019s All Out Politics the Labour MP Phil Wilson said Williamson should be suspended from the party for his comments. Wilson said: I think it is just outrageous, really. And I think he should be suspended from the Labour party. I actually spoke to Tom Watson [the Labour deputy leader] about this this morning, and Tom is [of] the same view. Tom, I know, is writing to the general secretary of the Labour party to express his concerns about it. I just think it\u2019s outrageous. There has got to be tough action taken on people like this in the Labour party. And when you have got a member of parliament expressing these views, I don\u2019t think there is any place for them ultimately in the Labour party. Last night the Labour MP Wes Streeting posted this response on Twitter. The Labour party, and Williamson himself, have not so far commented publicly on the video. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford wants to see article 50 extended into the autumn to allow proper preparation for a second referendum, because \u201cpeople have to see that democracy is taking place\u201d. Blackford told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland show: One of the reasons the prime minister is [considering] delaying article 50 just for a short period is she wants to avoid elections to the European parliament. I\u2019d say let\u2019s prepare for that, let\u2019s give us time, we should be extending article 50 for a reasonable period ... The defining characteristic of this is how long will it take for a people\u2019s vote, which will probably take us into the autumn at the very least ... On the basis of what we know now, on the basis of the lies that were told in the referendum campaign, people have to see that democracy is taking place. The right thing to do is to have that people\u2019s vote and we need to extend article 50 for as long as we need for that process to take place. Theresa May still claims she can persuade MPs to support her Brexit view. A common view at Westminster is that, given the unprecedented scale of her defeat by a majority of 230 in January, she is pushing optimism well beyond all reasonable bounds and that she is now mired in delusion. But there are some shreds of evidence to suggest that her strategy of running down the clock, pushing all sides to the point where they are so desperate for a deal that they will compromise, is working and we heard a very good example on the Today programme about half an hour ago. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who as chair of the European Research Group represents the 50-plus Tories who are most in favour of a hard Brexit, conceded that he is shifting. He admitted that he is not quite as hostile to the backstop as he used to be. Until recently many hardline Brexiters were demanding the wholesale removal of the backstop from the withdrawal agreement. Indeed only last month, during a big speech in Westminster, Rees-Mogg himself said: \u201cAs long as the backstop is there, I will not vote for the deal.\u201d That was the same day he suggested that May should suspend parliament rather than give in to demands to extend article 50. But now Rees-Mogg seems relatively relaxed about the possible extension of article 50 that could happen following May\u2019s announcement yesterday and, in his Today interview, he admitted that he was softening his position on the backstop. You could tell he was engaged in a U-turn because he started talking in Latin to obscure what he was up to. He told the programme: I can live with the de facto removal of the backstop, even if it isn\u2019t de jure. What do I mean by that? I mean that if there is a clear date that says the backstop ends, and that that is in the text of the treaty, or equivalent to the text of the treaty - if it were to be an appendix to the treaty; bear in mind, the Irish backstop is in itself an appendix to the treaty. So if you had a further appendix that said, \u2018This will not go beyond a particular date\u2019, and a short date, not a long date, then that would remove the backstop in the lifetime of parliament. That would have a reasonable effect from my point of view ... A changed deal is a changed deal. Of course, I would be open to considering that. This does not mean May is anywhere close to getting her deal through parliament. But it is a shift, and it may turn out to be significant. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 10.30am: The Metropolitan police and the National Crime Agency give evidence to the Lords EU home affairs committee on security in the event of a no-deal Brexit. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs begin the latest Brexit next steps debate. John Bercow, the speaker, will announce which amendments are being put to a vote. 2.45pm: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and Sir David Natzler, the former Commons clerk, give evidence to the Commons procedure committee about the power of the Commons to demand government papers. 7pm: MPs vote on the Brexit amendments. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit and the debate. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>Think of Westminster as a replicant variant of The Truman Show. A reality show in which the entire cast of grotesques and inadequates believe they are genuinely in power, while the audience of millions enjoys the comedy, the self-inflicted crises and the series-ending cliffhangers. In schools and universities around the world, the programme is hailed as an object lesson in how not to run a country.</p> <p>It\u2019s just about the only explanation that now makes sense. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s one that saves a lot of heartache and existential despair. Consider the evidence. How else could you end up with two party leaders less suited to office, if not for the fact they had been deliberately chosen for their entertainment value? After all, competence makes for spectacularly dull TV.</p> <p>There was a time a few years ago when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs\">prime minister\u2019s questions</a> were almost a box-office draw. Hard to believe, but David Cameron and Ed Miliband were a lukewarm ticket. That good. Now, with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as the main attractions, it has become everybody\u2019s short straw.</p> <p>Ministers and shadow ministers know they are likely to appear in every camera angle. So they shoot up amphetamines behind the Speaker\u2019s chair before taking their seats. Eyes bulge in blank stares, beads of sweat appear and teeth grind as they fight to stay awake throughout the 45-minute session. Backbench MPs have an easier time of it. Barbiturates are openly tossed around like Smarties as everyone seeks their own private oblivion.</p> <p>Then the lack of fun began. Corbyn opened promisingly enough with an attack on May for screwing up the country with a double whammy of austerity and her handling of Brexit. The prime minister mumbled something almost unintelligible \u2013 English is her second language, bollocks being her first \u2013 at being proud of the expansion in the use of food banks. And that was pretty much that.

      "bodyText": "Think of Westminster as a replicant variant of The Truman Show. A reality show in which the entire cast of grotesques and inadequates believe they are genuinely in power, while the audience of millions enjoys the comedy, the self-inflicted crises and the series-ending cliffhangers. In schools and universities around the world, the programme is hailed as an object lesson in how not to run a country. It\u2019s just about the only explanation that now makes sense. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s one that saves a lot of heartache and existential despair. Consider the evidence. How else could you end up with two party leaders less suited to office, if not for the fact they had been deliberately chosen for their entertainment value? After all, competence makes for spectacularly dull TV. There was a time a few years ago when prime minister\u2019s questions were almost a box-office draw. Hard to believe, but David Cameron and Ed Miliband were a lukewarm ticket. That good. Now, with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as the main attractions, it has become everybody\u2019s short straw. Ministers and shadow ministers know they are likely to appear in every camera angle. So they shoot up amphetamines behind the Speaker\u2019s chair before taking their seats. Eyes bulge in blank stares, beads of sweat appear and teeth grind as they fight to stay awake throughout the 45-minute session. Backbench MPs have an easier time of it. Barbiturates are openly tossed around like Smarties as everyone seeks their own private oblivion. Then the lack of fun began. Corbyn opened promisingly enough with an attack on May for screwing up the country with a double whammy of austerity and her handling of Brexit. The prime minister mumbled something almost unintelligible \u2013 English is her second language, bollocks being her first \u2013 at being proud of the expansion in the use of food banks. And that was pretty much that. Five more times the leader of the opposition asked an almost identical question and five times he got the same non-answer. Weirdly, both leaders appeared quite satisfied with their efforts. But there again, a no-score draw probably suited both. Corbyn wasn\u2019t called upon to explain why he considered Chris Williamson\u2019s unapologetic stance on the party\u2019s antisemitism to be so serious that it could only be dealt with by the most extreme punishment of a rap over the knuckles.

Only Labour can turn a major embarrassment into a total humiliation. And May looked chipper because she didn\u2019t have to relive her latest U-turn adventures through the wormhole into an 11th dimension where \u201ca delay is a delay\u201d didn\u2019t mean a delay.

Its decision follows a morning of chaos during whichthe Conservative MP who tabled the amendment proposing the move was forced to quit his government post, and the home secretary said he saw \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with the plan even though Theresa May had dismissed it a day earlier. Just hours after Alberto Costa resigned, the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington told MPs the government supported him and would take his plan up with the EU. \u201cIn view of the fact our political objectives are the same, the government will accept the amendment today and take it up with the commission,\u201d he said. The amendment calls on May to seek \u201cat the earliest opportunity a joint UK-EU commitment to adopt\u201d the part of the withdrawal agreement securing the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals settled in the EU, whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations. While Lidington said the government took the rights of EU citizens including British nationals settled in the bloc \u201cextremely seriously\u201d, he warned that MPs should not \u201cunderestimate the challenge\u201d in persuading the EU. The events leading up to the statement were branded a \u201cshambles\u201d by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, following a clash between MPs and the home secretary over the amendment. Sajid Javid appeared blindsided when he told MPs on a select committee that there was nothing wrong with the amendment only to be told the government had indicated it would not be backing it. \u201cWhen did you hear that?

Costa, the son of Italian immigrants, has been quietly lobbying May over EU citizens\u2019 rights for two years. The home secretary also came under sustained attack for the registration system the government is about to launch nationally for EU citizens. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty described the \u201csettled status\u201d scheme as a shambles and told Javid the basis of registration was discriminatory as it required EU citizens to request rights they already had.

Sweden\u2019s Aftonbladet observed in an editorial that the new Independent Group of MPs were justified in claiming, in their slogan, that British politics is broken. \u201cWithin the ruling Conservative party, there is no majority for any of the exit options that can be accepted by the EU,\u201d the paper said. \u201cIn parliament, there is no support for country crashing out without an agreement. What MPs could perhaps agree on is a kind of soft, Norway-style Brexit \u2013 but that would probably mean the defenestration of Theresa May, so no chance there.\u201d There was, the Swedish paper concluded, \u201cmuch to indicate that there will be no EU exit for the UK at the end of March. But the problem that is Brexit is going to plague British politics for a very long time to come.\u201d",

She triggered article 50 without any clue as to what kind of Brexit could command the confidence of parliament or her party, and she did so without having any conversation with MPs or the country. Instead, the referendum result was taken as an instruction to deliver a hard Brexit, with the UK leaving the single market and the customs union.</p> \n<p>That approach was put to the people in the 2017 general election. It was rejected. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jun/09/theresa-may-election-gamble-fail-conservatives-majority-polls\" title=\"\">May lost her majority</a>. Astonishingly, she ploughed on regardless, maintaining her red lines and trying to deprive parliament of having its say on her deal \u2013 until she was forced into it by members of what is now the Independent Group and my excellent colleague Dominic Grieve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5480f484-cbb1-44bf-a9b9-c2b8675db23d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8CA_KpErcls?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Still, no progress was made, because the government did not have an agreed position on what it wanted from the negotiation \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/06/what-the-cabinet-has-agreed-at-chequers-brexit-meeting\" title=\"\">until Chequers</a>.

We all remember the referendum campaign that Jeremy Corbyn \u201cfought\u201d, and we do not do so fondly. His lacklustre effort was at best ineffectual, and at worst totally sabotaged the campaign.</p> \n<p>The day after the result, he demanded that article 50 be triggered immediately. He adopted the same position as May on the single market and customs union, ruling out participation in either. During the general election he almost ignored Brexit completely \u2013 and then refused to change his position, declining to back a Queen\u2019s speech amendment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/30/chuka-umunna-single-market-amendment-brexit-split-labour-party\" title=\"\">tabled by Chuka Umunna</a>, which backed both (as well as, incidentally, calling for no deal to be ruled out).</p> \n<p>Even when Corbyn moved, he did so through a fog of ignorance. He shifted to back a slightly softer Brexit, but only being part of a customs union with certain conditions, which Brussels would never agree to. He either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care that there are countries that are part of the single market but aren\u2019t in the EU, claiming that one necessitates the other (it doesn\u2019t). He was dragged kicking and screaming towards the notion of a people\u2019s vote, and ended up backing a ridiculous conference resolution that was falsely spun as progress when all Labour did was commit to the public having the final say as an option, not policy.</p> \n<p>It has taken the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/19/joan-ryan-eighth-labour-mp-quits-party-to-join-breakaway-independent-group\" title=\"\">resignation of eight decent members</a> of his party for him to accept a move towards a people\u2019s vote. Even then, it is stuffed full of terms and conditions. He has come off the fence precisely at the time when it may be too late for him to make a difference, and when he has shown so little enthusiasm that there could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/labour-brexit-backlash-expected-second-referendum\" title=\"\">25 or more of his MPs </a>who will refuse outright to back a referendum.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday\u2019s statement from the prime minister was another shameful moment in a Brexit process that has not been short of them. We are used to the sight of Theresa May coming to the House of Commons and spending hours taking questions. What we have not had much of are answers. This was the case again when I asked her whether no deal remains on the table. It clearly is \u2013 despite parliament voting against it, and the views of her cabinet, ministers and sensible backbenchers. My colleagues and I in the Independent Group have spoken in the last week of how our politics is broken. Nothing better illustrates that than the sight of Theresa May refusing to rule out no deal, while Jeremy Corbyn ducks and dives around, trying not to commit to a people\u2019s vote in a way that could actually make it happen. It is worth remembering how we got here \u2013 the sorry saga of the last three years. Take the prime minister first. She triggered article 50 without any clue as to what kind of Brexit could command the confidence of parliament or her party, and she did so without having any conversation with MPs or the country. Instead, the referendum result was taken as an instruction to deliver a hard Brexit, with the UK leaving the single market and the customs union. That approach was put to the people in the 2017 general election. It was rejected. May lost her majority. Astonishingly, she ploughed on regardless, maintaining her red lines and trying to deprive parliament of having its say on her deal \u2013 until she was forced into it by members of what is now the Independent Group and my excellent colleague Dominic Grieve. Still, no progress was made, because the government did not have an agreed position on what it wanted from the negotiation \u2013 until Chequers. Then we had a collective view, until Boris Johnson and David Davis sauntered away from the mess they themselves created. The government kept on kicking the can down the road, delaying the vote on the deal time after time \u2013 until it went down to the biggest defeat in the modern history of parliament. If it is a tale of tragedy on the government side, then on the opposition benches it is best described as farce. We all remember the referendum campaign that Jeremy Corbyn \u201cfought\u201d, and we do not do so fondly. His lacklustre effort was at best ineffectual, and at worst totally sabotaged the campaign. The day after the result, he demanded that article 50 be triggered immediately. He adopted the same position as May on the single market and customs union, ruling out participation in either. During the general election he almost ignored Brexit completely \u2013 and then refused to change his position, declining to back a Queen\u2019s speech amendment tabled by Chuka Umunna, which backed both (as well as, incidentally, calling for no deal to be ruled out). Even when Corbyn moved, he did so through a fog of ignorance. He shifted to back a slightly softer Brexit, but only being part of a customs union with certain conditions, which Brussels would never agree to. He either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care that there are countries that are part of the single market but aren\u2019t in the EU, claiming that one necessitates the other (it doesn\u2019t). He was dragged kicking and screaming towards the notion of a people\u2019s vote, and ended up backing a ridiculous conference resolution that was falsely spun as progress when all Labour did was commit to the public having the final say as an option, not policy. It has taken the resignation of eight decent members of his party for him to accept a move towards a people\u2019s vote. Even then, it is stuffed full of terms and conditions. He has come off the fence precisely at the time when it may be too late for him to make a difference, and when he has shown so little enthusiasm that there could be 25 or more of his MPs who will refuse outright to back a referendum. Can there be any greater failure of leadership? In the Independent Group we are heartily sick of it all, and we know people in the country are, too. It is time for an end to these absurd gambles with the lives and livelihoods of our constituents. We have had another week of these two parties failing to provide direction. Another week of prevarication. Another week closer to the cliff edge. It has to stop now. That\u2019s why as a group, we have tabled an amendment for today\u2019s Brexit debate that would pave the way for a people\u2019s vote. It is supported by the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru. Any MP, from any side, who is prepared to put the national interest first must back it. A week ago, Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and I joined the ex-Labour MPs in taking a stand; in saying loud and clear that our politics is broken and that it has to change. Our problems go deeper and wider than Brexit, but Brexit is the biggest one we face \u2013 an existential crisis for our economy and our society, writ large thanks to the inability of our rotten parties to do their job. High noon is about to arrive. MPs on all sides must now make their stand. \u2022 Anna Soubry is a former Conservative MP who left to join the Independent Group",
