I could not believe that, offered a hopeful vision for a fairer UK, the public had opted for more economic conservatism. In the early hours of Friday 13 December, as the Tories secured their biggest win since the Thatcher era, I recognised the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/labour-voices-on-election-result\" title=\"\">disappointment and disbelief </a>in many of those around me.</p> <p>The Jeremy Corbyn I have known for decades as the MP for my neighbouring constituency is kind, compassionate and thoroughly decent. I regard him as a friend, with a wonderful track record as a constituency MP. To put it politely, these were not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/i-saw-just-how-many-voters-were-hostile-to-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">the qualities that came up on doorsteps </a>as I campaigned in London, Halifax, Bury, Bolton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Watford and elsewhere.</p> <p>The leadership\u2019s failure to deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/10/anyone-but-corbyn-jewish-voters-turn-away-from-labour\" title=\"\">with the stain of antisemitism </a>within the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy\u2019s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public\u2019s distrust. It was not Jeremy\u2019s righteous belief in economic justice that lost Labour this election; it was his perceived worldview, failure of competence, and mind-boggling decision to abdicate leadership on the biggest issue of the day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d60df2110eadfeee432d0e8a999f724240c1e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d60df2110eadfeee432d0e8a999f724240c1e95/0_0_5861_3517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Lammy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Lammy speaking in London earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bowles/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Labour to win back what were once seen as our heartlands, we need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in. This does not mean imitating Boris Johnson\u2019s populist, ethnic nationalism. Many people voted Tory because of a legitimate commitment to leaving the EU, or because they did not like Corbyn or what Labour was offering. But Johnson cynically scapegoated migrants during the campaign, warning that Europeans had treated the UK like \u201ctheir own\u201d country for too long. This is not the first time Johnson has attacked a minority in an attempt to win popularity. In 2018, he compared Muslim women to bankrobbers and letterboxes, which led to a surge in hate crimes. By lurching to the right, Johnson was able to make a Faustian pact and convince Nigel Farage to stand down. This helped him win, but set a very dangerous precedent.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s ethnic nationalism relies on the idea of the nation as the natural home of a people whose ancestors are all from one ethnic group. History suggests that once ethnic nationalism is introduced into a nation\u2019s politics it is difficult to remove and even more difficult to control. Once one group is defined as \u201cthe people\u201d, the next step is often to classify the excluded as second-class citizens. This is hardly a route back to national unity.</p> <p>A new tribalism has gripped the UK. However, recent surveys show that on the most fundamental issues \u2013 climate change, equal pay and the right of women to have careers, faith in science and scientists, the NHS \u2013 we are not divided. On these issues our collective views are converging, and even heading towards a consensus. We need a politics that reflects that. The alternative to Johnson\u2019s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says we can unite around shared values and institutions. To foster this, we need new spaces and places in which the UK\u2019s diverse peoples can engage with each other and belong.</p> <p>Why don\u2019t we start by creating a citizens\u2019 assembly to begin deciding the basis for a new British bill of rights and a codified constitution? Next, who is up for scrapping our unfair voting system and replacing it with something proportional to encourage a new politics of compromise? Then, why not trial a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/labour-would-trial-universal-basic-income-if-elected-john-mcdonnell-says\" title=\"\">universal basic income </a>\u2013 call it the citizens\u2019 fund \u2013 so that all people have the capacity and capital to come together in social clubs, sports teams and other parts of civic life? More controversially, could compulsory national civic service \u2013 compelling young people from all regions, ethnicities and social classes to mix \u2013 remind us what we have in common?</p> <p>Labour will win back the country only if we show the public that we love the UK, too, and are positive about what we have achieved together, and optimistic about the inclusive, multicultural, dynamic society we want to build. The difference is that our national pride manifests itself in hope, rather than fear. While Johnson pulls the country back towards a nostalgic version of Little England, Labour must own the future of a reinvigorated UK.</p> <p>As for which Labour figure I believe is best-placed to lead this hopeful vision, I will consider that over Christmas.</p> <p><em>David Lammy is the MP for Tottenham in London</em></p> <h2>Mary Creagh: \u201cI asked Corbyn why he is still leader given how toxic he is\u201d</h2> <p>\u201cCan I ask why you\u2019re voting Conservative this time?\u201d I asked the woman \u2013 who voted Labour in 2017 \u2013 smiling at me from the doorway of her home, beautifully decorated for Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she beamed. \u201cFirst, education\u2026\u201d \u201cCut by \u00a369m, in real terms, in Wakefield since 2015,\u201d I interjected. \u201cSecond, the NHS,\u201d she continued. \u201cSuffering the longest funding squeeze in its history,\u201d I countered. \u201cThird, Brexit \u2013 I voted Remain but I just want it done.\u201d</p> <p>I was used to Brexit objections, given my own long-standing opposition to it. Paradoxically, I benefited from Lib Dem and Tory Remainers backing me, and the Greens\u2019 generous decision not to stand, which kept the swing against me to 6.5%, lower than in neighbouring seats. But this voter was switching because she trusted the Tories on education and the NHS, even after the photo of a child with suspected pneumonia asleep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/refuses-to-look-at-picture-of-boy-forced-to-sleep-on-hospital-floor\" title=\"\">on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary</a> was in every newspaper. I knew then that we would lose. Labour, the party of the NHS, was no longer trusted with it.</p> <p>The causes of our worst defeat in 80 years are complex \u2013 and simple. A winter election that Jeremy Corbyn should never have agreed to, against the advice of his shadow cabinet and the parliamentary Labour party. In the middle of a Brexit crisis, his indecision on the biggest issue facing the country meant we lost Leave and Remain voters. His leadership ratings were abysmal. Voters didn\u2019t trust him on defence, security and the economy. They hated the party\u2019s infection by antisemitism and saw good MPs bullied out of their seats. They just didn\u2019t like him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e51599b699cc96bd48328551e2dba1cfdb59fb98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51599b699cc96bd48328551e2dba1cfdb59fb98/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Creagh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Creagh speaking after losing her seat at the general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When our \u201call shall have prizes\u201d manifesto was published, people asked where the money was coming from and scoffed at our nationalised broadband idea.

The gap between north and south, rich and poor will grow.</p> <p>So when I saw Jeremy posing for a photo with young people in parliament, I seized the moment. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/50831524/mary-creagh-on-jeremy-corbyn-he-should-be-apologising\" title=\"\">In my accidental exit interview,</a> I asked why he wasn\u2019t apologising to them. Why he was still leader when his personal toxicity, organisational incompetence and political mishandling had led to the catastrophe? How did losing the election mean we won the argument?</p> <p>The answers were indifferent and infuriating. The pre-election trigger ballots to reselect Labour MPs were because he wanted more democracy in the party. The bullying? Mainstream media. Antisemitism? Did I think he wants racism in the Labour party? He was present, but not involved.</p> <p>The Labour party, formed to represent working people, cannot ignore their verdict. We have failed them for four elections in a row. The party does not have a God-given right to exist.</p> <p>Members must decide if we are to be the strong social democratic opposition our country needs, or an ideological vanity project. The next leader must speak not just to members but to voters in Wakefield and Wolverhampton. They must ignore the keyboard warriors and speak to the decent, silent majority who want a leader they can trust.</p> <p>The next leader must reaffirm Labour\u2019s progressive internationalism, kick out the antisemites, rebuild organisational competence and enforce the rules. They\u2019ll need the heart of a lion and a strong stomach for the fight. We need to detoxify and become again a principled opposition that people can trust. We need a courageous, credible, clever and competent person to reshape our movement. Observer readers should join us and help get it right this time.</p> <p><em>Mary Creagh was MP for Wakefield from 2005 to 2019</em></p> <h2>Jon Trickett: \u201cWe need radicalism, social justice and national renewal\u201d</h2> <p>The Johnson government is clearly resolved to use the power of the state in order to drive through a rightwing shift. Our task is both to oppose Johnson but also to advocate the renewal of the country in a way which unites, rather than divides, and which offers a new economy, social justice and democratic reform.</p> <p>We must use the leadership election to debate our future. A blizzard of discrete tax and spend policies which lack any connective narrative or national story will not work.</p> <p>First, we need an analysis. Labour\u2019s concern about impoverished public services, gross inequality and class stratification was surely correct. Our transformative approach should be sustained.</p> <p>It is also clear that many millions of people share the view that we need a big change. How else can we explain the fact that over 17 million people voted to leave the EU?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2fa3b97336c1d1b28350aa5af8b03bb8c7feeea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fa3b97336c1d1b28350aa5af8b03bb8c7feeea3/0_46_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Trickett and Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Trickett having tea with Jeremy Corbyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo has been incubating from as far back as the 2005 election. It is most deeply rooted in those areas which have suffered most from recent economic changes and which are geographically peripheral to the metropolitan growth nodes of the new economy.</p> <p>Too many people in too many communities experience a loss of agency; the power to control their own lives, to make a difference, and to have a voice which can make itself heard.</p> <p>Instead they sense they\u2019re in a place where (bad) changes happen. Loss of control, no apparent economic purpose, and the collapse in social mobility means that your kids and grandkids can\u2019t break out. The communities which I represent lost their coal mines 35 years ago. Their raison d\u2019\u00eatre was stripped away.</p> <p>Of the 533 English constituencies, mine is the 529th worst in terms of social mobility. Children born here can have little expectation of making progress in their lives.</p> <p>Loss of purpose leads to a sense of alienation and to emotional responses such as anger and a deep sense of existential angst.</p> <p>The right has understood this loss of agency. It explains the Brexit slogan of \u201ctake back control\u201d. Of course, these working-class communities will not recover any control with a Tory government.</p> <p>Sadly the Remainer contingents failed to understand the emotional sense evoked by the offer of restored national sovereignty. Instead they sought to overturn the referendum in an apparent further twist of the knife by a social group which had never seemed to listen to or understood the \u201cheld back\u201d regions.</p> <p>Given that the party was seen as tilting towards rejection of the votes of millions, it can hardly be surprising if those millions were suspicious of everything else we said, even though \u2013 taken singly \u2013 our policies were so popular that in some cases even Boris Johnson was using similar language.</p> <p>Where next, then? I would suggest three things. Each will require humility and a listening ear. First, there must be no going back to New Labour, where the alienation from so many communities began. Rather we must retain our central drive towards a transformation of our economic structures.</p> <p>But this must be rooted in a clearer understanding of working-class and left-behind areas. Never again should we present ourselves as knowing better than millions of our erstwhile supporters.</p> <p>Second, we need a connecting national story which explains who we are and where we are heading. This will require us to demonstrate how we will empower communities throughout the country and restore agency to those whose lives are subject to impersonal, often global economic forces. None of this new national story needs mean a return to a sense of an imperial Britain. The future is in internationalism on the one hand and localism on the other, bound together by a strong value-laden principle of solidarity.</p> <p>Third, we need to tackle the wholly dysfunctional, remote and incomprehensible political structures manipulated to their narrow interests by a golden elite group. We need a careful process of building power structures outside the metropolitan centre.</p> <p>It feels to me that progressive federalism with regional devolution in England alongside devomax for the nations is the only realistic way forward.</p> <p>Acting carefully, rooting ourselves in all Britain\u2019s communities with resolve and radicalism but also with economic credibility, we can win again even in this dark hour.</p> <p><em>Jon Trickett is shadow minister for the Cabinet Office and MP for Hemsworth</em></p>",

The manifesto was Labour\u2019s most radical of the century, offering increased spending for the NHS, comprehensive care for under-fives and an emergency programme for investment in housing and transport.

I regard him as a friend, with a wonderful track record as a constituency MP. To put it politely, these were not the qualities that came up on doorsteps as I campaigned in London, Halifax, Bury, Bolton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Watford and elsewhere. The leadership\u2019s failure to deal with the stain of antisemitism within the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy\u2019s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public\u2019s distrust.

Did I think he wants racism in the Labour party? He was present, but not involved. The Labour party, formed to represent working people, cannot ignore their verdict. We have failed them for four elections in a row. The party does not have a God-given right to exist. Members must decide if we are to be the strong social democratic opposition our country needs, or an ideological vanity project. The next leader must speak not just to members but to voters in Wakefield and Wolverhampton. They must ignore the keyboard warriors and speak to the decent, silent majority who want a leader they can trust. The next leader must reaffirm Labour\u2019s progressive internationalism, kick out the antisemites, rebuild organisational competence and enforce the rules. They\u2019ll need the heart of a lion and a strong stomach for the fight. We need to detoxify and become again a principled opposition that people can trust. We need a courageous, credible, clever and competent person to reshape our movement. Observer readers should join us and help get it right this time. Mary Creagh was MP for Wakefield from 2005 to 2019 Jon Trickett: \u201cWe need radicalism, social justice and national renewal\u201d The Johnson government is clearly resolved to use the power of the state in order to drive through a rightwing shift. Our task is both to oppose Johnson but also to advocate the renewal of the country in a way which unites, rather than divides, and which offers a new economy, social justice and democratic reform. We must use the leadership election to debate our future. A blizzard of discrete tax and spend policies which lack any connective narrative or national story will not work. First, we need an analysis. Labour\u2019s concern about impoverished public services, gross inequality and class stratification was surely correct. Our transformative approach should be sustained. It is also clear that many millions of people share the view that we need a big change. How else can we explain the fact that over 17 million people voted to leave the EU? A sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo has been incubating from as far back as the 2005 election. It is most deeply rooted in those areas which have suffered most from recent economic changes and which are geographically peripheral to the metropolitan growth nodes of the new economy. Too many people in too many communities experience a loss of agency; the power to control their own lives, to make a difference, and to have a voice which can make itself heard. Instead they sense they\u2019re in a place where (bad) changes happen. Loss of control, no apparent economic purpose, and the collapse in social mobility means that your kids and grandkids can\u2019t break out. The communities which I represent lost their coal mines 35 years ago. Their raison d\u2019\u00eatre was stripped away. Of the 533 English constituencies, mine is the 529th worst in terms of social mobility. Children born here can have little expectation of making progress in their lives. Loss of purpose leads to a sense of alienation and to emotional responses such as anger and a deep sense of existential angst. The right has understood this loss of agency. It explains the Brexit slogan of \u201ctake back control\u201d. Of course, these working-class communities will not recover any control with a Tory government. Sadly the Remainer contingents failed to understand the emotional sense evoked by the offer of restored national sovereignty. Instead they sought to overturn the referendum in an apparent further twist of the knife by a social group which had never seemed to listen to or understood the \u201cheld back\u201d regions. Given that the party was seen as tilting towards rejection of the votes of millions, it can hardly be surprising if those millions were suspicious of everything else we said, even though \u2013 taken singly \u2013 our policies were so popular that in some cases even Boris Johnson was using similar language. Where next, then? I would suggest three things. Each will require humility and a listening ear. First, there must be no going back to New Labour, where the alienation from so many communities began. Rather we must retain our central drive towards a transformation of our economic structures. But this must be rooted in a clearer understanding of working-class and left-behind areas. Never again should we present ourselves as knowing better than millions of our erstwhile supporters. Second, we need a connecting national story which explains who we are and where we are heading. This will require us to demonstrate how we will empower communities throughout the country and restore agency to those whose lives are subject to impersonal, often global economic forces. None of this new national story needs mean a return to a sense of an imperial Britain. The future is in internationalism on the one hand and localism on the other, bound together by a strong value-laden principle of solidarity. Third, we need to tackle the wholly dysfunctional, remote and incomprehensible political structures manipulated to their narrow interests by a golden elite group. We need a careful process of building power structures outside the metropolitan centre. It feels to me that progressive federalism with regional devolution in England alongside devomax for the nations is the only realistic way forward. Acting carefully, rooting ourselves in all Britain\u2019s communities with resolve and radicalism but also with economic credibility, we can win again even in this dark hour.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is considering restricting its journalists\u2019 use of Twitter. If the plan is approved, top correspondents will be told to move away from using online platforms to break stories or offer instant analysis. The proposal follows criticism of online comments made by staff during the election campaign. Political editor Laura Kuenssberg was attacked by some Jeremy Corbyn supporters for repeating, along with other pundits, a false allegation that a Tory minister\u2019s aide had been punched by a Labour activist. North America editor Jon Sopel has meanwhile been accused of tweets that reveal a critical stance on Donald Trump. Now Fran Unsworth, the director of news and current affairs, is believed to be keen to persuade journalists to end the practice of frequently posting on politics and current affairs. \u201cShe said that it was likely she would meet some resistance, but that she wants to start a debate and was now contemplating asking correspondents to come off Twitter,\u201d said a BBC journalist. Unsworth is thought to have outlined her plans at a party held in the BBC Council Chamber in old Broadcasting House. This weekend, those close to Unsworth say she would only have joked about banning Twitter use altogether, but that she is believed to be serious about at least applying the BBC\u2019s social media guidance more stringently. Speaking to the Guardian last weekend Unsworth acknowledged the journalistic effectiveness of Twitter and said: \u201cWe just need to reinforce our social media rules. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s viable to say take a step back.\u201d Last week, Channel 4 reportedly banned non-political staff from tweeting about current affairs. Phil Harding, the BBC\u2019s former controller of editorial policy, welcomed the possibility of a review of Twitter\u2019s place in BBC news coverage. \u201cThey need to take two steps back and make sure what they are saying is impartial and true, because we need that impartial service badly at the moment,\u201d he told the Observer. Harding, who also edited the Radio 4 Today programme during his years at the BBC, added that a review of coverage priorities was standard after any election. \u201cThe most important thing is that they hang on to the trust, which has fallen away a little. They have to consider whether they need to be in among the first reactors to an event. It is a difficult conversation, but they have to get the balance right,\u201d Harding said. Kuenssberg signed off from Twitter for Christmas on Thursday with apparent relish, writing \u201csee you on the other side (follow @BBCPolitics and @BBCNews if you want to keep up, or sit on your sofa and eat Quality Street and come back in 2020)\u201d. The journalist, who has 1.13 million Twitter followers, has been subjected to a torrent of online abuse over the past month. Her festive good wishes were met by several suggestions her own break should be haunted by the ghosts of the Labour election victory that might have been. Last Monday, Andy McDonald, a member of the shadow cabinet, claimed the BBC had played a part in Labour\u2019s defeat. Similar attacks on BBC impartiality led Huw Edwards, the election night anchor, to write an unprecedented defence of the standards of licence-fee-funded reporting: \u201cProviding a fair and balanced account of a complex election campaign \u2013 with feelings running high on all sides \u2013 is difficult enough. Trying to do so while dealing with relentlessly vitriolic attacks is doubly challenging.\u201d Edwards warned that \u201ctoxic cynicism\u201d about BBC output could undermine the broadcaster as it faces renewed threats from a strengthened Conservative government. Downing Street has promised to consider decriminalising the non-payment of the TV licence fee, making it equivalent to failure to pay any other utility bill, rather than a criminal offence. Edwards also tweeted: \u201cWe are very far from being perfect at @BBCNews \u2013 but the bilge about \u2018bias\u2019 needs a response.\u201d Channel 4\u2019s decision follows mistakes, including an online subtitling error on tweeted video footage that wrongly suggested that Johnson had questioned whether \u201cpeople of colour\u201d, rather than \u201cpeople of talent\u201d, should be allowed into the country under Conservative immigration policy.",
