We have the withdrawal agreement.

      "bodyText": "Brussels has said a vote by UK MPs to block a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances is a meaningless move, with one senior EU negotiator describing it as \u201cthe Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way\u201d. A European commission spokesman offered a withering assessment of the decision by MPs to ignore Theresa May\u2019s assertion that no deal was the default position unless there was a deal in place by the time of the UK\u2019s departure. \u201cWe take note of the votes in the House of Commons this evening,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThere are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both. To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal \u2013 you have to agree to a deal. We have agreed a deal with the prime minister, and the EU is ready to sign it.\u201d MPs voted by 312 to 308 to support a backbench amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit and striking out a phrase in a government-backed motion noting that no deal remained the default position in UK and EU law if an agreement was not ratified. They then voted on the amended motion, which won by a majority of 43. On Thursday, MPs will vote on whether to request an extension of the article 50 negotiating period beyond 29 March until 30 June. But the commission is pushing member states to take an uncompromising position. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, speaking to the European parliament in Strasbourg earlier on Wednesday, questioned whether the EU should offer extra time for talks, leading officials to prepare for all options to be on the table at a leaders\u2019 summit next week. \u201cWhy would we extend these discussions?\u201d Barnier asked. \u201cThe discussion on article 50 is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement. It is there.\u201d During a private meeting before his public comments, Barnier advised senior MEPs that at present there was no consensus among the EU\u2019s member states over an extension, let alone on the conditions that would be attached. At the same time, the EU\u2019s deputy Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, told EU ambassadors that she feared the Commons was \u201cdivorced from reality\u201d. Quoting private remarks by the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, Weyand concurred with his description of the decision to vote for no deal as \u201clike the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way\u201d. Weyand said the second defeat for May\u2019s deal on Tuesday night showed that \u201ca short technical extension\u201d of article 50 talks should be ruled out. A long extension would only be on offer in the event of a general election or second referendum. But France and Germany are among several countries who want to see more flexibility. It is understood the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had let it be known during a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh last month that she would regard an extension until the end of June, by which time European parliament elections will have been held, but MEPs will not have sat, as relatively straightforward. Merkel had said an extension up until the European elections at the end of May was \u201cvery easy\u201d, with a delay until the chamber convenes in July described as \u201ceasy\u201d, sources told the Guardian. The ambassadors concluded at the meeting with Weyand that an extension could be decided only by EU leaders, who will assess the question at the summit next Thursday, and will need to agree unanimously on any response to a request. While various extension times have been mooted \u2013 from five weeks to 21 months \u2013 there is no consensus. Member states have refused to endorse a commission proposal that any extension should be a one-off. The thorny problem of the need for British MEPs in the event of an extension beyond the European elections starting on 22 May was raised during the meeting with ambassadors. The EU\u2019s lawyers said it was a \u201cgrey area\u201d if the UK remained a member state between May and the end of June but that MEPs would almost certainly be needed to be elected after that. The lawyers said a mooted treaty change to avoid such a scenario was not possible as the shortest such revision had taken two and a half years. \u201cThat\u2019s dead,\u201d said a diplomat involved. With Downing Street likely to try to put May\u2019s deal to the Commons again in the coming days, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: \u201cGermany has prepared itself in the best possible way for the worst-case scenario. However, we still hope that we can avoid an unregulated Brexit \u2013 it is still in the hands of the House of Commons to do that.\u201d",

The first was an amendment tabled by Tory backbencher Caroline Spelman and several other MPs to say a no-deal Brexit should never happen. This was passed. MPs then voted on the other amendment, the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d, and rejected it. This left a final vote on the original motion, as amended by the Spelman changes. This passed.</p> \n<h2>So does this rule out no deal for ever?</h2> \n<p>No. The government could theoretically ignore the motion, as it is not binding or legislation. However, this would cause political chaos, and seems unlikely. But \u2013 as Theresa May stressed after the votes \u2013 ruling out no deal is not in the government\u2019s gift.

      "bodyText": "What has been decided? Parliament has said the government should rule out the idea of a no-deal Brexit not just on 29 March, but ever, after a backbench amendment was passed. What votes took place? The government tabled a motion ruling out no deal on 29 March, but two amendments to this were allowed by the Speaker, John Bercow. The first was an amendment tabled by Tory backbencher Caroline Spelman and several other MPs to say a no-deal Brexit should never happen. This was passed. MPs then voted on the other amendment, the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d, and rejected it. This left a final vote on the original motion, as amended by the Spelman changes. This passed. So does this rule out no deal for ever? No. The government could theoretically ignore the motion, as it is not binding or legislation. However, this would cause political chaos, and seems unlikely. But \u2013 as Theresa May stressed after the votes \u2013 ruling out no deal is not in the government\u2019s gift. The only way for this to happen is for a deal to be agreed, for Brexit to be cancelled, or for an extension to article 50 to be agreed to allow more time. What of the Malthouse compromise? It was defeated pretty overwhelmingly, by 374 votes to 164.

We don\u2019t expect a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario, but an extension of Article 50 that will compound the current uncertainty associated with Brexit and probably mean a deterioration in the forecasts and slightly less fiscal room for manoeuvre by the Autumn Budget.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c8933cfe4b0eff8e0fc24b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-13T16:52:14.959Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chakrabortty\">Aditya Chakrabortty</a> says Philip Hammond\u2019s spring statement had one large flaw -- a massive vacuum where the chancellor should have put some new policies.</p> <p>Ah, but what about Brexit uncertainty pinning Hammond in? Not good enough....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You would not have guessed from listening to him that the economy is on the brink of recession, that local councils are going bust, that schools across the land are sending parents begging letters for cash. Analysis by the TUC shows that by 2024, spending on public services will still be \u00a3500 lower per person than it was in 2009.</p> <p>Hammond claims that all he needs is a deal on Brexit to open the sluice gates and get spending, but there is no logical connection between the two. The UK has its own currency, and interest rates are barely off the floor. Now is the time for a government to spend on public housing, on schools and on a welfare system that doesn\u2019t treat claimants as scammers and idlers.

That allocates their funds on the basis of need (particularly for Wales), their geographic challenges and population, and it also shares out extra cash if there is a major England-only spending decision such as the Crossrail project in London.</p> <p>The Treasury said Crossrail was \u201clocal\u201d funding, so handed out \u00a3500m to all three devolved areas.

      "bodyText": "The latest wild developments in Westminster tonight have shown the fundamental flaw in today\u2019s spring statement - Brexit changes everything. The prediction that growth will only be 1.2% this year, the improved borrowing figures, the \u00a326.6bn war chest which the chancellor is itching to open... they could all evaporate if Britain crashes out of the EU in 16 days. Hammond\u2019s call for MPs across the house to come together to find a Brexit solution fell on stony ground -- Parliament looks more divided than ever. Business leaders will reaching the final strands of the end of their very frayed tether, while cash-strapped families will be desperate for austerity to be eased. As Miles Celic, Chief Executive Officer, TheCityUK, puts it: \u201cMPs have said \u2018no to no deal,\u2019 but without an agreement between the UK and the EU, this vote sadly delivers very little. A constructive and practical way forward must be found. Unless the Withdrawal Agreement or some other realistic course of action is agreed very soon, the UK will still crash out, regardless of MPs\u2019 wishes. Brexit is speeding towards the end of the road and there is still no bridge to get to the other side.\u201d That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to cover reaction to the spring statement, and our politics blog will be covering the Brexit crisis again. Goodnight! GW There\u2019s big drama in the House of Commons right now -- MPs have narrowly voted for an amendment rejecting the idea of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, by just four votes. That\u2019s a fresh blow to Theresa May, and possibly makes a Brexit extension even more likely. It\u2019s also creating quite a lot of chaos in Westminster, as the government\u2019s plans take another hit... although this vote doesn\u2019t, on its own, prevent Britain crashing out on teh 29th. Andy Sparrow has all the action here: The Independent highlights several campaign groups who have condemned the government for not ending the benefits freeze early, by tapping into its fiscal headroom. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \u201cThe government should have shown today that it is serious about tackling the rising tide of poverty in the UK. \u201cInstead they chose not to end the freeze on benefits, leaving families in poverty to face rising costs and bear all the risks of economic uncertainty, especially if we leave the EU without a deal.\u201d Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: \u201cThe chancellor could have sent a lifeline to low-income families. \u201cThat he didn\u2019t is evidence of ministers\u2019 refusal to confront the reality that families have been left with too little money to live on after three long years of stagnant incomes and rising price Independent: Spring statement: Philip Hammond accused of failing to ease austerity despite \u00a327bn spending boost The Financial Times points out that Philip Hammond has pledged to spend more, if a Brexit deal is reached: Mr Hammond said leaving the EU with an agreement would give the UK real choices on how much of a \u201cdeal dividend\u201d could be spent on public services or tax cuts. \u201cThat is what I mean by an end to austerity,\u201d he added. After a near-decade of austerity and severe cuts in local authority spending, the UK\u2019s services are showing the strain through crises in the social care system, schools asking parents to donate and a visible rise in rough sleeping. FT: Spring Statement: Hammond pledges end to austerity if Brexit deal is reached But, don\u2019t forget that economic outlook has weakened. The Daily Telegraph says: Rarely has a Chancellor faced such a grim outlook with such little cover. Britain\u2019s economy is in for a beating: growth forecasts for this year were slashed by a quarter. GDP will grow by a mere 1.2pc this year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), down 0.4 percentage points from its previous update in October. It puts the economy on course for its weakest year since 2009. Trade will drag on growth. Employment will rise, but by around 100,000 less than hoped in the years ahead, despite the Chancellor hailing the forecasts. There\u2019s real anger tonight that Hammond didn\u2019t take the opportunity to end the freeze on working age benefits. By keeping the welfare payments unchanged in cash terms, recipients will actually get less once inflation is taken into account. That can be a serious blow to poor families. Resolution Foundation explains: The final year of the freeze on working age benefits, which takes effect next month, will leave a low-income couple with children \u00a3200 worse off next year, rising to \u00a3580 once the full effect of the freeze is included. Overall tax and benefit changes being introduced this April will take \u00a3100 from families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution and give \u00a3280 to those in the top 10 per cent. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University reckons the Chancellor may actually have more flexibility to spend and borrow than the OBR has estimated. The OBR predicts annual GDP growth rates of 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. Contrast this with the Bank of England\u2019s predictions (made only last month by the Bank\u2019s February 2019 Inflation Report) of 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021. Why is OBR so much more pessimistic than the Bank of England for 2020 and 2021? In fact, under the assumption of lower Brexit-related uncertainty (let\u2019s call this the \u2018deal dividend effect\u2019) the Bank predicts even higher GDP growth rates of 2.2% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021. If the Bank is correct and the OBR is wrong in its assessment, then the Chancellor appears to be underestimating the benefits of a deal dividend at a very critical time with further parliamentary voting taking place both today and tomorrow. Alternatively, the cynical reader might conclude that the OBR has already taken into account the adverse (\u2018sledgehammer\u2019) effects of the tariffs announced today... This char shows how the UK\u2019s government\u2019s borrowing requirements have fallen, giving more headroom to borrow within the fiscal rules. Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains how this boosts the war chest that can be opened if no-deal Brexit is avoided. That largely reflects projections of higher income tax receipts (higher earnings growth assumptions) and lower debt interest spending (reflecting lower market expectations of rate rises). The amount of \u2018headroom\u2019 in the fiscal numbers therefore rose (i.e. the extra net spending the Chancellor could engage in before breaking the fiscal mandate) from \u00a315.4bn to \u00a326.6bn. The OBR did warn though that, in the event smooth Brexit is achieved, market interest rates and debt interest payment projections may rise again, i.e. reducing that headroom. Extending Article 50 by a few months would have a damaging impact on the UK\u2019s economy, and erode the chancellor\u2019s headroom to borrow and spend more. So argues Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit: Even though the OBR has slashed its economic growth forecast for 2019, there\u2019s been a marked improvement in the UK\u2019s fiscal ratios, creating more headroom for the Chancellor to loosen fiscal policy if required and allowing him to stick to his declaration of an \u201cend to austerity\u201d. However, there\u2019s a big cloud hanging over these projections, as they all are all conditional on a smooth end-March Brexit transition that parliament pretty much ruled out last night. Mr Hammond expressed a hope that the negotiated Brexit deal will still be passed in the coming weeks, but that is unrealistic. We don\u2019t expect a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario, but an extension of Article 50 that will compound the current uncertainty associated with Brexit and probably mean a deterioration in the forecasts and slightly less fiscal room for manoeuvre by the Autumn Budget. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty says Philip Hammond\u2019s spring statement had one large flaw -- a massive vacuum where the chancellor should have put some new policies. Ah, but what about Brexit uncertainty pinning Hammond in? Not good enough.... You would not have guessed from listening to him that the economy is on the brink of recession, that local councils are going bust, that schools across the land are sending parents begging letters for cash. Analysis by the TUC shows that by 2024, spending on public services will still be \u00a3500 lower per person than it was in 2009. Hammond claims that all he needs is a deal on Brexit to open the sluice gates and get spending, but there is no logical connection between the two. The UK has its own currency, and interest rates are barely off the floor. Now is the time for a government to spend on public housing, on schools and on a welfare system that doesn\u2019t treat claimants as scammers and idlers. Sadly, it won\u2019t be this government. Here are some of our Spring Statement news stories: Philip Hammond made much play of his Brexit war chest - the \u00a326bn of extra spending that will be possible within the government\u2019s fiscal rules, and the boost to business confidence. But it\u2019s too late to avoid damage to the economy, says Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants). \u201cAs to be expected after last night\u2019s vote, the Chancellor\u2019s statement provided little sunshine to cut through the Brexit fog. \u201cIf there is a managed deal, we can expect a significant Brexit dividend with businesses investing, consumers more confident and an uptick in the market. However, much damage has already been done as a result of the ongoing uncertainty. Businesses have taken decisions to relocate assets and cancel planned investments, which are unlikely to reversed even if a deal is reached. Adam Jackson, director of public affairs at Grant Thornton UK LLP, says Philip Hammond has hinted at the likely priorities of this summer\u2019s spending review (assuming\u2019s he\u2019s still chancellor at that stage) taking on \u2018digital giants\u2019 (such as Amazon, Google, Facebook) with an investigation into competition in digital advertising and confirmation that the UK will press ahead with a digital services tax despite it being dropped as an EU-wide proposal (it has not been dropped by a number of EU countries such as France, Spain and Italy) confirming that housing investment and Northern Powerhouse transport infrastructure remains a priority measures to tackle climate change, including mandating zero fossil fuels in all new build homes from 2025 Jackson adds: \u201cThese felt like placeholders; a possible government programme if the UK ever completes the interminable current phase of Brexit decisions. The Treasury says the spring statement offered several new spending and policy commitments for Scotland, which included a \u00a365m share of the \u00a3260m on offer in the new Borderlands growth deal which will straddle the English and Scottish border. Coincidentally boosting the electoral fortunes of the Conservative MPs who have seats on either side of the border, the Treasury said it meant that regional partnership would be getting a total of \u00a3362m. Edinburgh University will get \u00a379m for a new \u201cArcher 2\u201d supercomputer, \u201cproviding researchers with a fivefold increase over the current computing capacity, paving the way for new discoveries in pharmaceuticals, climate science and aerospace.\u201d There would also be reviews of whether the aggregates levy, which is now devolved to Scotland, benefits devolved areas sufficiently; reforms to how VAT is claimed back by government departments after an embarrassing row over a VAT bill for Police Scotland; and efforts to boost oil and gas decommissioning industries. Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution Foundation, says the government has the firepower to end austerity, if it wants to: \u201cIn a speech light on policy, the Chancellor used a \u00a330bn windfall from the OBR to promise sunny uplands if Parliament delivers a smooth Brexit in the months ahead. \u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s \u00a326bn of fiscal firepower is more than enough to bring austerity to an end in the Spending Review later this year. This marks a major shift as the debate in British politics moves to focusing on how much more we should spend, rather than how deeply to cut. \u201cBut despite an improvements to the public finances driven in part by particularly fast earnings growth for high earners, austerity will continue for just about managing families, who face a \u00a31.8 billion hit from the benefit freeze in just three weeks\u2019 time.\u201d This chart, from the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s new report, outlines how future interest tax receipts have strengthened while debt repayment costs have fallen. The spring statement is being criticised for not providing more help to fight poverty and support poorer families. Here\u2019s a video clip of the chancellor announcing that fossil fuel heating systems will be banned by 2025, from new homes. And here\u2019s a reminder that his predecessor tore up plans to make homes carbon neutral, back in 2015. Climate activists have welcomed the government\u2019s pledge to end fossil-fuel heating in new homes by 2025 - which might turn out to be one of the biggest measures today. Hammond told MPs that a new standard will be introduced by 2025 to future-proof new build homes with low carbon heating and energy efficiency measures, That appears to means the end of gas boilers being used to warm new-build houses. Campaign group 10:10 Climate Action\u2019s director, Max Wakefield, backed the move, saying: \u201cAll our homes and buildings must be made efficient, affordable and zero-carbon within the next two decades to address the climate crisis. Ending the scandal of poor quality new homes is a no-brainer that\u2019s good for everyone.\u201d Mel Evans, senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK said the plan to end fossil fuels in new homes \u201cis vital\u201d.... but added that we need bigger thinking to tackle the climate emergency. Conservative MP James Heappey is also impressed (although it\u2019s bad form not to support your own chancellor on these occasions). Heads-up. The Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that UK house prices will be falling by the end of this year. The OBR has downgraded its forecasts for the housing market, due to signs that house price growth has flowed, and subdued turnover in the housing market. It now thinks house price inflation will turn negative, before bouncing back in 2021. This is going to make a serious hole in the government\u2019s tax receipts, as stamp duty has been a lucrative tax in recent years. Greg Hands, Conservative MP for Chelsea, is worried: Back in parliament, Chuka Umunna MP has pointed out that Britain\u2019s economy had been expected to grow at over 2% per year, before the 2016 referendum. Today\u2019s growth forecasts - just 1.2% this year, picking up to 1.6% in 2021 - are sluggish and unimpressive, Umunna points out. Philip Hammond tells MPs (well, those who have hung around in the chamber) that the OBR\u2019s recent downgrade of likely UK productivity growth is to blame. Hammond is being criticised for not ending the freeze on benefits (which means the will continue to shrink in real terms). Heidi Allen MP, who quit the Conservatives to join The Independent Group, says it makes a mockery of \u2018compassionate\u2019 Conservatism. Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, says the government is failing the poorest. \u201cStruggling families are desperate for an end to the freeze on working age benefits, but this Spring Statement leaves them out in the cold once again. Already the freeze has saved the Treasury more than was ever intended, so there can be no ongoing justification for these \u2018stealth cuts\u2019 that mean that the poorest in society have borne the heaviest burden from paying off the deficit. \u201cToday, the Chancellor could have sent a lifeline to low-income families. That he didn\u2019t is evidence of Ministers\u2019 refusal to confront the reality that families have been left with too little money to live on after three long years of stagnant incomes and rising prices. Funding sanitary products for girls in schools may help with one small area of expenditure, but this will have a minimal impact on poverty overall. It leaves in tatters the prime minister\u2019s claim that austerity is over. Hammond\u2019s call for MPs to build a \u2018consensus\u2019 to prevent a no-deal Brexit has caused a stir at Westminster. Is he suggesting giving up on Theresa May\u2019s deal, in favour of a new plan that could be backed by Labour? Labour\u2019s shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, responded to the spring statement by blasting the government\u2019s record: The Chancellor has the nerve to tell those who have suffered most at the hands of his Government, that their suffering was necessary. If austerity wasn\u2019t ideological, why has money been found for tax cuts for big corporations while vital public services have been starved of funding? Austerity was never a necessity, it was always a political choice. So when the Chancellor stands there and says that the end of austerity is in sight, talks of a plan for a brighter future \u2013 how can anyone who has lived through the last nine years believe him? This is a Government that has demonstrated a chilling ability to completely disregard the suffering they have caused. To talk of changing direction after nine years in office is not only impossible to believe, it\u2019s also much too late. Too late for the thousands who have died while waiting for a decision on their Personal Independence Payments. Too late for families who have lost their home due to cuts in housing benefit. Too late for young people losing their lives to knife crime after youth clubs have shut down and police numbers fallen, whatever he has been forced into announcing today. He also urged Hammond to help remove the threat of no deal: Of course Brexit looms large over everything we discuss. Even today, the Chancellor has tried to use the bribe of a deal double dividend or threat of postponing the spending review to cajole MPs into voting for the government\u2019s deal. Publication of the tariffs this morning is clearly part of this strategy. This is a calamitous strategy. It is forcing people into intransigent corners. What we need now is the Chancellor today to commit to vote to take no deal off the table. Then to join me in discussing the options available, including Labour\u2019s deal proposal and yes, if it requires it, taking any deal back to the public. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, has bad news for the government -- it doesn\u2019t currently have enough firepower to handle a no-deal Brexit. So it would have to tear up its borrowing and spending plans, if Britain crashes out without a deal. The Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s verdict is out. The independent watchdog\u2019s top line is that growth has slowed, but the public finances look marginally healthier. Economic growth in the UK and globally has slowed since the Budget in October, leading us to revise down our near-term GDP forecast. But tax receipts have performed better than we expected in the final months of 2018-19 and we judge that much of this buoyancy will endure. Together with downward pressure on debt interest spending from lower market interest rates, this delivers a modest medium-term improvement in the public finances. The Chancellor has banked most of it in lower borrowing, but has spent some on higher planned public services spending. The OBR has also confirmed that the chancellor\u2019s now has over \u00a326bn of extra spending power he could unleash, once a no-deal Brexit is off the table. It says: This is up from \u00a315.4 billion in October, as the fiscal costs of the temporary nearterm cyclical weakness of the economy have been swamped by the fiscal gains from higher income tax and lower debt interest spending. But... the government still isn\u2019t on track to balance the budget by 2025-26 - a whole decade later than George Osborne\u2019s first target. Some reaction from Hammond\u2019s side of the House: But opposition MPs are predictably less impressed: As we suspected, there wasn\u2019t much new in that statement. The economic picture for 2019 has darkened, with growth forecast to only be 1.2%, from 1.6% before. Brexit uncertainty, and the slowdown in the global economy, are both probably to blame. Hammond pointed to faster projected growth in 2021 and 2022 -- but he\u2019d surely agree that we can\u2019t bank on that until MPs have got their act together on Brexit. Also, growth is still seen below 2% per year for the next five years; a poor performance by historical standards. The chancellor\u2019s main message that he could unlock more spending, if MPs backed a deal. Those improved borrowing figures mean he\u2019s got more than \u00a326bn to play with, and a Spending Review planned for this year. With a pointed nod to those who marched through the No lobby last night, he said: \u201cLeaving with no deal would mean significant disruption in the short and medium term and a smaller, less prosperous economy in the long term, than if we leave with a deal. Higher unemployment, lower wages, higher prices in the shops. That is not what the British people voted for in June 2016.\u201d Tonight\u2019s votes will show exactly how many MPs agree with Hammond (Andy Sparrow will be tracking that in Politics Live here). There was welcome news -- money for free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges, the extra cash for knife crime protection, and a focus on climate change prevention. Hammond ends his speech by warning MPs that while the economy is fundamentally robust, it is still overshadowed by Brexit uncertainty. He tells the House: We cannot allow that to continue. It is continuing our economy, and damaging our standing in the world. Tonight we have a choice, he continues. MPs can remove the threat of an imminent no-deal threat. Tomorrow we can map out a way to build a consensus across the house, to exit the EU in an orderly way, and create a relationship that allows Britain to flourish, he continues. Another rumour is confirmed, as Hammond announces \u00a3100m of extra funding to tackle knife crime. The money will go to violence reduction units, and for more police overtime. That follows heavy lobbying from the Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Hammond has confirmed that he is taking action on period poverty. The Treasury will fund the provision of free sanitary products in schools from the next school year [as we reported last weekend]. On the environment, Philip Hammond says fresh standards will be introduced for new housing, to mandate the end of fossil fuel heating by 2025. He also announces a new review into the link between biodiversity and growth. Plus, the government will designate a further 445,000 square kilometres of ocean around Ascension Island as a Marine protected area. On housing, Hammond announce a \u00a33bn \u201caffordable homes guarantee\u201d scheme. As expected, Hammond has announced a review of global tech giants, to ensure they pay a fair share in the UK. He has also asked the competition and markets authority to undertake a study of the digital advertising market. The chancellor also announces \u00a345m to the European Bioinformatics Institute for genomics research. There\u2019s also \u00a381m in a new Extreme Photonics Centre in Oxfordshire to develop a new types of laser. \u201cCutting edge technology\u201d, grins the chancellor (whose gags haven\u2019t been up to their usual standard) Hammond announces \u00a379m for Archer 2, a new supercomputer based at the University of Edinburgh, which is five times faster than previous models. Capable of 10,000 trillion calculations per second, hopefully it\u2019s fast enough to solve the backstop issue, he jokes (this is no time for puns, chancellor) Hammond says PhD level roles will be eliminated completely from visa caps - as part of a push to stimulate research and development in the UK. The government will, as expected, open a consultation on how to replace PFI contracts. Hammond also announces a review of low pay in Britain Philip Hammond\u2019s Brexit War Chest has grown to \u00a326.6bn, up from around \u00a315bn, thanks to the lower borrowing forecast by the OBR. Hammond announces \u00a3260m of funding for the Borderlands region (areas in Southern Scotland and the North of England). Hammond says he wants Britain to embrace the technology of the future, so it can \u201cslay the twin demons of low productivity and low wages\u201d. The upcoming spending review will focus spending on raising productivity, he adds. Leaving Brexit without a deal would deliver a significant short-to-medium term hit to the productive capacity of the UK economy, the chancellor warns. Hammond also says it is \u201cjust wrong\u201d to think there is a simple way of coping with the consequences of no deal. Any fiscal and monetary response would have to be carefully calibrated so as to not simply cause inflation, he explains. Hammond also warns that the progress in repairing the UK economy will be at risk if it cannot agree a \u201csmooth and orderly\u201d exit from the EU. Significant news. Hammond says he will launch a full, three-year spending review before the summer recess - ready for the next budget - if a Brexit deal is agreed. He dangles the prospect of more spending on public services, saying Britain could get a deal dividend. That would come from increased business confidence and a fiscal boost, as less money needing to be set aside for the consequences of no-deal . On borrowing, the 2018-19 deficit will be 1.1% of GDP, Hammond says, down from the 1.2% expected in the October budget. Hammond says the UK will create another 600,00 new jobs by 2023. The OBR has also revised its wage growth up, to at least 3% each year. Onto the growth forecasts. As feared, growth in 2019 has been cut significantly, to just 1.2% from 1.6% in the last budget. But there\u2019s good news too - growth in 2021 and 2022 has been revised up. Here are the new forecasts: 2019: 1.2% compared to 1.6% in last October\u2019s budget 2020: 1.4% compared with 1.4% 2021: 1.6% compared with 1.4% 2022: 1.6% compared with 1.5% 2023: 1.6% compared with 1.6% Philip Hammond is on his feet now, sporting a smart Tory blue tie, to deliver the spring statement. Let\u2019s see what light he can shed on the state of the economy, with less than three weeks until Britain is currently due to leave the EU. The chancellor begins by telling MPs that he knows the House has other pressing issues on its time. Last night\u2019s vote leaves a cloud of uncertainty over the country, the chancellor says. But the economy remains robust and has \u201cdefied expectations\u201d, he continued. Hammond says the UK\u2019s economy has grown for 9 years in a row - the longest of any G7 member. And it\u2019s expected to keep growing for the next five years. He then accuses John McDonnell of living in a \u201cparallel universe\u201d, for predicting the UK would fall into recession. The chancellor has tweeted.... saying he\u2019ll make announcements on infrastructure, technology, housing, skills, and green energy today. Chancellor love to produce a crowd-pleasing surprise or two on these occasions. Brexit uncertainty, though, means any rabbits will probably stay firmly inside Hammond\u2019s hat. We may hear about the \u2018Brexit dividend\u2019 today, but how much do taxpayers actually hand to the EU? A new website lets you find out -- enter your salary, and it calculates how much of your income tax heads to Brussels. Spoiler alert, it might be less than you think..... [Reminder: other levies, such as corporation tax, also help fund the UK\u2019s bill for EU membership] Prime Minister\u2019s Questions is underway now. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: Philip Hammond told the cabinet this morning that the spring statement will set out measures to support an open and competitive economy, according to Theresa May\u2019s spokesman (via Reuters). Hammond also said it will confirm the resilience of the UK economy, and the progress made \u201crepairing the public finances\u201d.... Philip Hammond has emerged from Number 11 Downing Street, and headed to the House of Commons to deliver the spring statement (after Prime Minister\u2019s Questions). As it\u2019s not the budget, we didn\u2019t get a photoshoot with the traditional red box. Just a polite smile for the cameras. Bloomberg Economics have calculated that the chancellor\u2019s war chest - money set aside for a no-deal Brexit - has swelled to over \u00a320bn. That\u2019s up from \u00a315bn in last autumn\u2019s budget, thanks to strong tax receipts in January. If Britain leaves the EU under the withdrawal agreement, it could be spent elsewhere. Bloomberg\u2019s Jess Shankleman explains: U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could next week offer the country an extra 5 billion pounds ($7 billion) to end austerity, but only if Parliament backs a Brexit deal with the European Union. Hammond is expected to receive the windfall to his Brexit war chest when he presents his Spring Statement on Wednesday. He says backing Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal would release extra cash for public services that\u2019s currently held in reserve to mitigate the fallout from a no-deal split. Alison Thewliss, SNP Treasury spokesperson, says Philip Hammond should announce an emergency budget today, to protect the UK from Brexit confusion. I fear such an emergency fiscal event might be needed if Britain crashes out on the 29th March. In the meantime, Hammond will probably keep his powder dry (while hinting at a spending boost if Brexit goes more smoothly). Once upon a time, the Conservative party promised to eliminate Britain\u2019s budget deficit by 2015. They failed (of course), and are now aiming to wipe it out by the middle of the next decade. But we have seen progress on cutting government borrowing. Last October, the OBR estimated that net borrowing could drop to \u00a325.5bn for 2018-2019, down from \u00a3153.1bn in 2009-10 after the financial crisis. As this chart from RBC Capital Markets shows, Britain\u2019s net borrowing requirement are on track for their lowest level since 2002-03. You could argue that this is prudent management of the economy (at least compared to the handling of Brexit). But you could also argue that there is freedom to borrow more to invest, and to tackle the public sector funding crisis. No arguing with this statement, from our parliamentary sketch writer. Rupert Harrison of investment giant Blackrock (and a former chief of staff for George Osborne) says the spring statement forecasts don\u2019t mean very much. Harrison told Sky News that they\u2019re effectively \u2018fantasy forecasts\u2019, due to Brexit uncertainty. If we do get a no-deal Brexit, Philip Hammond will be spending a lot more money on emergency measures. If we get some lifting of the uncertainty, I think there will be more money for public services. Claire Walker, co-executive policy director at the British Chamber of Commerce, says there are worrying signs in the economy. Brexit has already driven business investment down, so Hammond needs to help. This is an opportunity to send a strong and supportive message to businesses at this very tricky time, even though there\u2019s a limit to what he can do. City investors are more concerned by the Brexit mess than the chancellor\u2019s statement. They\u2019ll still be watching at 12.30pm, though, to hear the latest growth and borrowing forecasts. Sam Buckingham, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, explains: Of particular importance will be the latest forecasts for economic growth and public finances. It\u2019s expected the former is to be revised down considerably bearing in mind the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently reduced their forecast for 2019 economic growth for the UK down to just 0.8%, well below the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) previous prediction of 1.6%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Brexit chaos will overshadow the speech: Nevertheless, based on January data the government\u2019s tax income is likely to have worked some way towards reducing the budget deficit. Economic growth remains woefully subdued, at about 0.2% last month, which will make it less likely for the Chancellor to end austerity measures. This would normally be a negative for the pound but a no-deal Brexit vote will trump that. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre, thinks that Philip Hammond should keep his statement as brief as possible: With so much political uncertainty at present it\u2019s difficult to see how he could possibly commit to any large scale spending plans or initiatives at this point in time. Indeed, it may well be best for the Chancellor to simply stand-up and say at this stage he has nothing to say. At the very least he must be relieved the Spring Statement is now just that and no longer a full blown March Budget. Although Hammond\u2019s hands are rather tied, MPs are still hoping to hear some good news in the spring statement. Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern says the chancellor must do more to tackle the problems with universal credit: At the budget, the Chancellor made a big show of accepting changes to the work allowances in universal credit that he argued would help address some of the Osborne-era cuts. In essence, this was just making the cut somewhat less punitive. Hammond has some way to go if he is to make sure that no one is worse off under the new system. The two-child policy remains in place, for example, and we still haven\u2019t had a vote on managed migration. Given that this is allegedly \u2018not a fiscal event\u2019, we can assume there is not much hope. Her colleague Marsha de Cordova has also lobbied the Treasury to help severely disabled people who have lost out under UC. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran wants to see fresh education funding (but isn\u2019t holding her breath). Conservative Guy Opperman would like to see more funding for the Borderlands (the region covering Southern Scotland and Northern England), after the Scottish Government\u2019s pledged \u00a385m overnight. The Treasury\u2019s system for funding devolved areas of the UK is under attack from different directions after the National Audit Office, the spending watchdog, said its decisions were sometimes hard to understand, our Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports. The NAO investigated the controversial way the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments are funded, flagging issues in several areas \u2013 including the Treasury\u2019s opaque ways of sharing out cash, and higher per-head funding of devolved areas. The Treasury provides core funding for the devolved nations worth \u00a3287bn for the five years to 2020/21 through a method called the Barnett formula. That allocates their funds on the basis of need (particularly for Wales), their geographic challenges and population, and it also shares out extra cash if there is a major England-only spending decision such as the Crossrail project in London. The Treasury said Crossrail was \u201clocal\u201d funding, so handed out \u00a3500m to all three devolved areas. The NAO wondered why it then ruled the HS2 high speed rail line to Birmingham was \u201cnational\u201d infrastructure, which triggered payments to the administrations in Edinburgh and Belfast, but not Cardiff. Then there was the notorious decision to give Northern Ireland \u00a3410m for 2018/19 under Theresa May\u2019s deal with the Democratic Unionist party, but no extra money went to Scotland or Wales. Conversely, if the Treasury awards special one-off funding to devolved nations, there is no consequential extra cash for England. The Scottish government said these funding disparities needed to be addressed by the Chancellor in today\u2019s spring statement. It said Scotland should have had \u00a33.3bn extra if the Barnett formula had been properly applied to May\u2019s sweetheart deal with the DUP. \u201cWe have urged the UK government to use the spring statement to provide a proportionate amount of additional finance and flexibility to Scotland in line with the Barnett formula,\u201d a spokesman said. The Barnett formula, which has no legislative basis, has other unexpected quirks, the NAO said. Its calculations showed Northern Ireland got \u00a32,110 per capita more than the \u00a39,080 spent in England last year, Scotland \u00a31,801 more and Wales \u00a31,317 more. However, the Barnett formula does not seem sensitive enough to reflect the fact that because England\u2019s population is rising faster than in the devolved nations, their per capita share was growing at England\u2019s expense. Alan Bermingham, government policy manager for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the NAO\u2019s findings justified Cipfa long-standing criticisms of Barnett. Bermingham says: \u201cIn light of this investigation, we call on government to consider the long-term future of the formula, and to consider an independent needs-based funding system covering all regions of the UK.\u201d. The Treasury denied there was a problem, insisting its funding rules were \u201cclearly set out in the published statement of funding policy, the Scottish government fiscal framework, and the Welsh government fiscal framework. \u201cThe Treasury works closely with all three devolved administrations to ensure they understand how these arrangements have been applied.\u201d The Financial Times says Philip Hammond will launch a consultation into new ways to fund Britain\u2019s infrastructure. This follows Hammond\u2019s decision to end the discredited PFI scheme in last October\u2019s Budget. That creates a question of how the government can team up with the private sector to pay for major project, such as new hospitals and roads. This will show that Hammond\u2019s looking to the future. However, we already know that business investment has been hit by Brexit - major companies will be reluctant to take on potentially risky contracts until they have clarity over the UK\u2019s future. Philip Hammond is expected to take action on another important issue - period poverty. Following pressure from campaigners, the chancellor will fund a scheme to make free sanitary products available from September. My colleague Heather Stewart reported: The chancellor will announce that he is asking Damian Hinds, the education secretary, and Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equalities, to design a scheme that would be implemented in all secondary schools in England. The scheme is expected to mirror one already in place in Scotland. It is understood that the Treasury has not yet carried out a detailed costing, but when the Scottish equivalent was announced last year, it was expected to cost \u00a35m. Full details of the funding will be announced in the spending review, expected later in the year \u2013 but Hammond is expected to make clear that the Treasury will fund it in full, and that availability will not be restricted, for example, to those students eligible for free school meals. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has welcomed Hammond\u2019s plan to give consumers more control over their data held by Big Tech: The Sun is reporting that Hammond will unveil a \u00a3100m funding package for the police, in response to the surge in knife crime. They say most of the new cash will be spent on new violent crime units in seven worst affected UK areas -- London, the West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Manchester. The money will also help pay for police officers overtime. The Sun says: It is a major victory for Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who demanded the cash after the surge in knife killings this year. Chancellor Philip Hammond had offered a new package of \u00a350 million but Mr Javid held out for more. The world\u2019s technology giants may find themselves in the firing line in today\u2019s spring statement. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: A fresh bid to curb the market power of US tech giants will be signalled by Philip Hammond on Wednesday when he welcomes the findings of an independent review calling for government action to ensure companies including Google, Facebook and Apple face stiffer competition. The chancellor will use his annual spring statement to promise action after a review conducted for the Treasury by Jason Furman, Barack Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, concluded that the dominance of the big digital players was curbing innovation and reducing consumer choice. Furman, now a Harvard professor, said a new digital markets unit should be set up in Whitehall staffed by people with technological expertise and equipped with the powers to set and enforce greater competition. The review says individuals should be given more control over their personal data to enable them to switch between platforms more easily, that the biggest tech companies \u2013 Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple \u2013 should have to sign up to an enforceable code of conduct, and that merger policy should be toughened up. \u201cOver the last 10 years the five largest firms have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None has been blocked and very few have had conditions attached to approval, in the UK or elsewhere, or even been scrutinised by competition authorities,\u201d the review said. Here\u2019s the full story: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell released a video clip last night, urging Hammond to end austerity once and for all. Local government is on its knees, child poverty is rising, and people are being driven to food banks by the government\u2019s universal credit system, McDonnell says: Here\u2019s our preview of what to expect today: We\u2019ll be tracking the spring statement here, while Politics Live focuses on Brexit: Good morning. Britain has seen some famous fiscal events over the years. From Hugh Gaitskell introducing charges on dental work and glasses in 1951 (triggering Nye Bevan\u2019s resignation) to Sir Geoffrey Howe hiking taxes in the teeth of the 1981 recession or Gordon Brown announcing \u00a340bn of fresh NHS funding in 2002, chancellors have made the political and economic weather at the dispatch box. But not today. Instead, Philip Hammond\u2019s Spring Statement is likely to be more of a fiscal non-event. For a start, it\u2019s not a full budget - more like an update on the nation\u2019s financial health. Secondly, it\u2019s being overshadowed the full-blown Brexit crisis raging, now that MPs have rejected Theresa May\u2019s deal again. So Hammond\u2019s performance will be more like a palate cleanser, between last night\u2019s Meaningful Vote and a new vote tonight on whether to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn will further steal the limelight when they clash at PMQs at noon, before the chancellor speaks. But what can we expect? Hammond will give MPs the latest growth forecasts. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility may have downgraded its view of 2019, given the recent global slowdown. In October 2018, they projected 1.3% growth for 2018 -- but just last week, the OECD said growth will slide to just 0.8% this year. But the OBR could also bring good news -- the UK may need to borrow less than previously expected, thanks to bumper tax receipts in January. That means Hammond\u2019s \u201cBrexit war chest\u201d - money set aside to protect the economy if a no-deal Brexit occurs - may have swelled from \u00a315bn close to \u00a320bn. The chancellor is expected to tell Parliament that this goody bag could be used on urgent priorities such as schools and hospitals, as long as Britain doesn\u2019t crash out of the EU (something to concentrate MPs minds ahead of tonight\u2019s vote). The statement may also announce some new consultations into the issues facing Britain (productivity problems and climate change, perhaps), or an update on Hammond\u2019s Digital Services Tax. But more wide-ranging changes to tax and spending plans, to reverse the impact of years of painful austerity, must probably wait for another day. The agenda 12.30pm GMT: Philip Hammond delivers the Spring Statement 1.30pm GMT (estimate): OBR publishes its Economic and fiscal outlook",

Christopher Clayton Waverton, Cheshire \u2022 The impasse over Brexit arises from the fact that parliament lent sovereignty to the people and never worked out how to take it back. That is why it is now haunted by one event, the referendum result, and paralysed by fear of two consequences: ignoring that result, and allowing a no-deal Brexit to happen. Theresa May\u2019s deal has no genuine support, so we need a way out of the impasse. Here is one that will do no damage to anyone (maybe it\u2019s a unicorn, but we rationalist remainers are surely entitled to those now): 1) revoke article 50 before 29 March and explain to the nation why; 2) take part in the European elections properly and enthusiastically, to give UK citizens and non-UK EU citizens a chance to pass judgment on this; 3) after the economy has picked up, as it will, hold a general election in the autumn to give UK citizens a second chance to pass judgment. 4) get on with our lives. Charles Turner University of Warwick \u2022 Polly Toynbee rightly says that Jeremy Hunt gave one game away by saying that a second referendum would stop Brexit, but he also gave another away when he said \u201cthe consequences for failure to deliver Brexit would be devastating\u201d for his party \u2013 thus making it clear that he was putting party before the national interest.

May herself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/12/prime-minister-right-blame-eu-brexiteers\" title=\"\">ploughs on</a>. It\u2019s as if someone has popped a grey wig on Munch\u2019s The Scream, then cast it in an ITV drama about the female governor of a category-A prison.</p> <p>Quote of the debate \u2013 arguably quote of the entire Brexit \u2013 went to a Conservative backbencher by the name of Steve Double. \u201cThis is a turd of a deal,\u201d he intoned to the House of Commons, \u201cwhich has now been taken away and polished, and is now a polished turd. But it might be the best turd that we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>For many, the now-reflexive action when they hear this kind of stuff is to inquire \u201cwhy didn\u2019t u put that on the side of ur bus m8???\u201d. And yet, was Steve\u2019s interjection in the actual chamber the moment that well-worn joke format ascended to its purest \u2013 which is to say, its most grotesque \u2013 form? Putting turd all over the side of a bus, having half the country vote for it, and then driving this dirty-protest-mobile past every single warning-sign of the past two and a half years has brought us to this particular precipice. Tuesday night\u2019s Commons spectacle reminded me of <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_8/The_Legion_Club\" title=\"\">one of Jonathan Swift\u2019s last poems</a>, about the Irish parliament \u2013 specifically this bit:</p> <p><em>\u201cLet them, when they once get in,</em><br><em>Sell the nation for a pin;</em><br><em>While they sit a-picking straws,</em><br><em>Let them rave at making laws;</em><br><em>While they never hold their tongue,</em><br><em>Let them dabble in their dung \u2026</em><br><em>We may, while they strain their throats</em><br><em>Wipe</em><em> our arses with their votes.\u201d</em></p> <p>So yup, pretty much all covered by Dean Swift there back in the 1730s, right down to Theresa May\u2019s strained throat. However unique this moment might feel, I suppose we must remember that politicians have been letting down their people for centuries and centuries.</p> <p>Even so, the abysmal calibre of those in whose hands we\u2019re in can feel remarkable. Nigel Dodds! Have you beheld Nigel? If you didn\u2019t know he was the deputy leader of the DUP, you\u2019d say he has the face of a head of geography who has been suspended pending an investigation into accusations he struck a pupil. Or perhaps you prefer Boris Johnson, who stood up to urge to parliament to \u201cbehave as a great country\u201d. Says the guy who\u2019s been behaving like a complete country since prep school. According to that guy, no deal is \u201cthe only safe path to self\u2013respect\u201d. Boris Johnson showing you the only safe path to self-respect is like Paul Burrell showing you the only safe path to dignity, or Hannibal Lecter showing you the only safe path home. With his elite-busting reference to \u201cCarthaginian terms\u201d, Boris is entirely of a piece with Jacob Rees-Mogg, who on Tuesday tweeted simply: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacob_rees_mogg/status/1105413499990274049\" title=\"\">Dies irae, dies illa</a>\u201d.

Four decades of gathering uselessness and mendacity had brought us to this occasion, to which we might as well picture Archer and Onasanya as bookends.</p> <p>If it feels unfair to lump most of the House of Commons in together, please don\u2019t let it. It must not be forgotten that MPs voted 498 to 114 to trigger article 50 two years ago, apparently without a clue what the predictable implications of negotiating against the clock with a much stronger opponent were. Most of those 498 MPs are a reminder than no one in this country should ever suffer from impostor syndrome again. I really do hope to see as many of them as possible at the eventual public inquiry.</p> <p>The story of Brexit since the referendum has in large part been the story of politicians finding out in real time what the thing they had already done actually meant, then deferring the admission or even acceptance of it. We hear a lot about low-information voters, but low-information politicians are the bigger problem. Even this week, Tory Brexiteers Esther McVey and Daniel Kawczynski were spreading arrant lies about <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/esther-mcvey-brexit-twitter-fake-claim-eu-members-euro-2020/\" title=\"\">enforced joining of the euro</a>. It is traditional at these moments to ask if the politicians in question are stupid or liars; in the case of Esther and Daniel, the question is moot as they are both.</p> <p>Westminster has become so unmoored from reality that half of its denizens can\u2019t even remember which lie they told. In the wake of May\u2019s defeat, Tory deputy chairman James Cleverly informed the BBC that she had \u201cinherited this job\u201d, like it was some loss-making family business May had sportingly tried to make a go of, as opposed to the position of prime minister, which she\u2019d remorselessly pursued, to the point of having been too self-interested to even fight for her side in the referendum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/13/conservatives-britain-no-government-theresa-may-brexit\">The Conservatives have left Britain with no real government | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the other side of the house, meanwhile, sat Jeremy Corbyn, who famously wanted to trigger article 50 before anyone else, on the very day after the referendum. Yet on Tuesday he was wittering at the prime minister: \u201cThe clock has been run out on her!\u201d Corbyn now seems to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/13/brexit-second-referendum-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn-independent-group\" title=\"\">back to pushing his phantom Brexit deal</a>, as opposed to the second referendum he briefly suggested was Labour policy. I know rebelling against the leadership is Corbyn\u2019s comfort zone, but it does make you look a historic tit when you are the leadership.</p> <p>As for what happens next, one Tory MP judged: \u201cFuck knows\u201d. Welcome to Fuckknowsville. Population: us. In Westminster, an MP leaving the ERG meeting had called the mood \u201crealistic\u201d before adding: \u201cbut the question is, what is reality?\u201d No. The question is, what is this complete bollocks? Morpheus, but if he was the member for Wycombe? In the north, Nigel Farage\u2019s Leave Means Leave army girds itself to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/01/chris-grayling-nigel-farage-march-leave\" title=\"\">march south from Sunderland to London</a>. And in Brussels, one EU diplomat warned ominously that \u201cbehind the scenes people are increasingly saying it is better to call it quits\u201d, which is diplomatic speak for \u201cso completely done with the UK\u2019s shit\u201d.</p> <p>We might as well play out with former Brexit secretary David Davis, whose appearance before the eventual inquiry will, I fantasise, be lengthy and sensationally uncomfortable. \u201cIf we walk away,\u201d David breezed breezily on Tuesday, shortly before U-turning and voting for a deal he had spent months pissing all over, \u201cWhat can they do? They cannot invade you, can they?\u201d More\u2019s the pity. If only there was an option for \u201cinvasion by competent people\u201d.

It\u2019s as if someone has popped a grey wig on Munch\u2019s The Scream, then cast it in an ITV drama about the female governor of a category-A prison. Quote of the debate \u2013 arguably quote of the entire Brexit \u2013 went to a Conservative backbencher by the name of Steve Double. \u201cThis is a turd of a deal,\u201d he intoned to the House of Commons, \u201cwhich has now been taken away and polished, and is now a polished turd. But it might be the best turd that we\u2019ve got.\u201d For many, the now-reflexive action when they hear this kind of stuff is to inquire \u201cwhy didn\u2019t u put that on the side of ur bus m8???\u201d. And yet, was Steve\u2019s interjection in the actual chamber the moment that well-worn joke format ascended to its purest \u2013 which is to say, its most grotesque \u2013 form? Putting turd all over the side of a bus, having half the country vote for it, and then driving this dirty-protest-mobile past every single warning-sign of the past two and a half years has brought us to this particular precipice. Tuesday night\u2019s Commons spectacle reminded me of one of Jonathan Swift\u2019s last poems, about the Irish parliament \u2013 specifically this bit: \u201cLet them, when they once get in, Sell the nation for a pin; While they sit a-picking straws, Let them rave at making laws; While they never hold their tongue, Let them dabble in their dung \u2026 We may, while they strain their throats Wipe our arses with their votes.\u201d So yup, pretty much all covered by Dean Swift there back in the 1730s, right down to Theresa May\u2019s strained throat. However unique this moment might feel, I suppose we must remember that politicians have been letting down their people for centuries and centuries. Even so, the abysmal calibre of those in whose hands we\u2019re in can feel remarkable. Nigel Dodds! Have you beheld Nigel? If you didn\u2019t know he was the deputy leader of the DUP, you\u2019d say he has the face of a head of geography who has been suspended pending an investigation into accusations he struck a pupil. Or perhaps you prefer Boris Johnson, who stood up to urge to parliament to \u201cbehave as a great country\u201d. Says the guy who\u2019s been behaving like a complete country since prep school. According to that guy, no deal is \u201cthe only safe path to self\u2013respect\u201d. Boris Johnson showing you the only safe path to self-respect is like Paul Burrell showing you the only safe path to dignity, or Hannibal Lecter showing you the only safe path home. With his elite-busting reference to \u201cCarthaginian terms\u201d, Boris is entirely of a piece with Jacob Rees-Mogg, who on Tuesday tweeted simply: \u201cDies irae, dies illa\u201d. To read fan replies humbly begging \u201cgive us a clue Jacob!\u201d (in vain) is to be reminded that all populists secretly hate their people; but these two do it openly. Fans of sledgehammer imagery, meanwhile, may care to note that disgraced former Conservative politician Jeffrey Archer was sitting in the public gallery on Tuesday night, while disgraced former Labour member Fiona Onasanya became the first MP to vote while wearing an electronic tag. Four decades of gathering uselessness and mendacity had brought us to this occasion, to which we might as well picture Archer and Onasanya as bookends. If it feels unfair to lump most of the House of Commons in together, please don\u2019t let it. It must not be forgotten that MPs voted 498 to 114 to trigger article 50 two years ago, apparently without a clue what the predictable implications of negotiating against the clock with a much stronger opponent were. Most of those 498 MPs are a reminder than no one in this country should ever suffer from impostor syndrome again. I really do hope to see as many of them as possible at the eventual public inquiry. The story of Brexit since the referendum has in large part been the story of politicians finding out in real time what the thing they had already done actually meant, then deferring the admission or even acceptance of it. We hear a lot about low-information voters, but low-information politicians are the bigger problem. Even this week, Tory Brexiteers Esther McVey and Daniel Kawczynski were spreading arrant lies about enforced joining of the euro. It is traditional at these moments to ask if the politicians in question are stupid or liars; in the case of Esther and Daniel, the question is moot as they are both. Westminster has become so unmoored from reality that half of its denizens can\u2019t even remember which lie they told. In the wake of May\u2019s defeat, Tory deputy chairman James Cleverly informed the BBC that she had \u201cinherited this job\u201d, like it was some loss-making family business May had sportingly tried to make a go of, as opposed to the position of prime minister, which she\u2019d remorselessly pursued, to the point of having been too self-interested to even fight for her side in the referendum. On the other side of the house, meanwhile, sat Jeremy Corbyn, who famously wanted to trigger article 50 before anyone else, on the very day after the referendum. Yet on Tuesday he was wittering at the prime minister: \u201cThe clock has been run out on her!\u201d Corbyn now seems to be back to pushing his phantom Brexit deal, as opposed to the second referendum he briefly suggested was Labour policy. I know rebelling against the leadership is Corbyn\u2019s comfort zone, but it does make you look a historic tit when you are the leadership. As for what happens next, one Tory MP judged: \u201cFuck knows\u201d. Welcome to Fuckknowsville. Population: us. In Westminster, an MP leaving the ERG meeting had called the mood \u201crealistic\u201d before adding: \u201cbut the question is, what is reality?\u201d No. The question is, what is this complete bollocks? Morpheus, but if he was the member for Wycombe? In the north, Nigel Farage\u2019s Leave Means Leave army girds itself to march south from Sunderland to London. And in Brussels, one EU diplomat warned ominously that \u201cbehind the scenes people are increasingly saying it is better to call it quits\u201d, which is diplomatic speak for \u201cso completely done with the UK\u2019s shit\u201d. We might as well play out with former Brexit secretary David Davis, whose appearance before the eventual inquiry will, I fantasise, be lengthy and sensationally uncomfortable. \u201cIf we walk away,\u201d David breezed breezily on Tuesday, shortly before U-turning and voting for a deal he had spent months pissing all over, \u201cWhat can they do? They cannot invade you, can they?\u201d More\u2019s the pity. If only there was an option for \u201cinvasion by competent people\u201d. They don\u2019t have to be FROM the continent, but they do have to BE continent. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has said that securing EU leaders\u2019 agreement on a Brexit delay up until the end of June will be \u201ceasy\u201d, according to senior diplomatic sources. Attitudes in some of the EU\u2019s capitals towards a possible extension of article 50 have recently hardened, with diplomats complaining that London had been \u201clazy\u201d and taken a positive decision for granted. But the German chancellor let it be known at the recent EU-Arab summit in Sharm el-Sheikh that Berlin will not stand in the way, sources have disclosed to the Guardian. Theresa May told the Commons on Tuesday night after losing by 149 votes, the fourth largest defeat ever on a government motion, that if MPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday, she would bring forward a motion on Thursday asking whether MPs want to seek an extension to article 50. She suggested such an extension would be short, but warned this risked a new cliff-edge in June, signalling the British government is looking at a three-month delay. The EU\u2019s heads of state and government will discuss their terms and conditions for an extension at an upcoming summit should the Commons call on the prime minister to make a request. During talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort last month, Merkel is understood to have insisted that an extension until the European elections on the 23 May would be \u201cvery easy\u201d. A longer delay until 30 June, before the parliament convenes would be \u201ceasy\u201d, she added. A spokesman for the German government declined to comment. Despite the confidence in Berlin at winning over the 27 heads of state and government, who would need to offer their unanimous support once a request is made, officials in Brussels fear Downing Street\u2019s proposal for a delay could still tee up a potential disaster next week with a high risk that the leaders could react in unexpected ways. The heads of state and government have repeatedly taken a tougher line than expected towards the British government. The outright rejection of May\u2019s Chequers proposals at a summit last year in Salzburg was the most notable embarrassment for Downing Street. Officials said that, rather than try to guide leaders\u2019 decision at the summit, Brussels was currently preparing for them to have a free-wheeling debate. \u201cThe messier things are, the greater the chance things are escalated up to the leaders,\u201d one EU source said. EU officials said there was growing \u201cfrustration\u201d at the prime minister\u2019s reluctance to even prepare the way for an extension request. In a letter the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker to Donald Tusk, his counterpart in the European council, said the UK\u2019s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections on 23 May as British MEPs would otherwise need to be elected. Officials representing Tusk informed ambassadors on Monday, however, that they believed an extension until July was still feasible as the European parliament would not have convened until that point. Sources suggested that the European commission, as \u201cguardian of the EU\u2019s treaties\u201d, was simply preparing the ground for a formal infringement notice on the UK should the government not organise elections, but that 23 May was not the outer limit of an extension. A greater concern in Brussels is that the EU\u2019s leaders might rule out any extension unless there is a clear reason beyond simply delaying an inevitable no-deal Brexit. EU sources said that pressure from business is still likely to push leaders towards granting an extension of a few months, but there was a particular concern in the EU\u2019s capitals that by simply waiving it through Brussels could end up being blamed for a no-deal Brexit in the summer. Senior EU officials have warned member states that a very short extension would be \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cresolve nothing\u201d, and be a burden on businesses rather than a help. \u201cThe internal EU debate on extending Article 50 is definitely getting more complicated,\u201d, said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense that a short term extension won\u2019t fix anything, and member states are becoming more anxious about being complicit in agreeing to something that simply makes no- deal more likely in June.\u201d",

Unremarkable not because they weren\u2019t terrifying or upsetting at the time but because such stories are relatively common among black people of my age who grew up in Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/08/conservatives-three-gaffes-karen-bradley-amber-rudd-andrea-leadsom\">Conservatives pack an impressive three gaffes into 24 hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So when I hear that someone has failed at racial etiquette, I generally roll my eyes, whether or not they are a politician. I have seen, heard and felt worse. The pattern is now painfully familiar. In an unscripted moment a public figure uses a term that is either outdated (\u201ccoloured\u201d), offensive (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/02/gerry-adams-defends-n-word-tweet-django-unchained\" title=\"\">nigger</a> \u201d) or just plain odd (\u201cfunny tinge\u201d). Indignation, caffeinated by social media, erupts. The person then doubles down or apologises \u2013 or, as often as not, doubles down and then apologises. I get a phone call from a radio or television outlet asking if I want to come on and talk about it. I don\u2019t.</p> <p>Not because I don\u2019t think it matters. Words have meaning. Politicians have responsibilities. Racism is real. But because the media rarely call to talk about racial disparities in school exclusions, sentencing or poverty. Racism is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/18/racism-more-than-old-white-men-using-n-word\" title=\"\">system of oppression</a> rooted in history, politics, economics and culture. Our understanding of it should not be reduced to a litany of gaffes and flubs any more than it can be relegated to people shouting epithets and wielding baseball bats. These are the most glaring and dramatic manifestations of a broader, deeper problem \u2013 they should not be mistaken for the problem itself. Moreover, people have the right to misspeak, be corrected, offer a proper apology and move on.</p> <p>But over the past few weeks, the relentless parade of remarks, ranging from gauche to grotesque, suggests more than simply individual, off-the-cuff indiscretions. There is only so long one can keep talking about an isolated series of events before one must concede there may be a pattern. This return to the language of the 1970s, in which black people are \u201ccoloured\u201d and Islamophobia is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/08/conservatives-three-gaffes-karen-bradley-amber-rudd-andrea-leadsom\" title=\"\">matter for the Foreign Office</a>, is moving in lockstep with the racial politics of the 1970s, with citizens being deported and non-white people considered foreign.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the easier stuff. The former Labour MP Angela Smith\u2019s description of non-white people as being of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/angela-smith-apologises-for-funny-tinge-remark\" title=\"\">funny tinge</a>\u201d a few weeks ago was very strange. She apologised immediately. That apology would be easier to accept if she had not left Labour to join the Independent Group, insisting that the party was so irredeemably, institutionally racist that she could not bear to remain in it. Having thrown those kind of stones, you retreat to a glass house at your peril.</p> <p>Similarly, the Conservative MP Amber Rudd was actually sympathising with Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott about the racist abuse the shadow home secretary encounters online when she described Abbott as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/03/amber-rudd-refers-diane-abbott-coloured-bbc-interview\" title=\"\">a coloured woman</a>\u201d. Rudd apologised for her \u201cclumsy language\u201d. Clumsy is a bit of an understatement. Rudd was formerly home secretary \u2013 that part of government from which policies around racial justice and equality generally emanate. It was her job to know better. It is hardly reassuring to think that she used to sit across the cabinet table from the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/23/london.race\" title=\"\">opined about</a> \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. In a different context we might give her a break. But this was the right honourable member for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/20/theresa-may-windrush-equality\" title=\"\">Windrush Central</a>. When the stakes were much higher for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/commonwealth-citizens-harassment-british-immigration-policy\" title=\"\">people with far less</a>, whom did she give a break to?</p> <p>Last month the Tory MP Nadine Dorries <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-47120879\" title=\"\">mistook the political journalist Ash Sarkar</a> for the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate Faiza Shaheen; they look nothing alike, but are both of Asian heritage. Dorries, who has also in the past compared <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/09/nadine-dorries-denies-racism-after-comparing-chuka-umunna-with-chris-eubank_n_3044490.html\" title=\"\">Chuka Umunna to Chris Eubank</a> (two men who do not look remotely similar but share African heritage), attempted to deflect attention by referring to antisemitism in the Labour party.

      "bodyText": "Among the unremarkable racial experiences in my life, I have been chased off a train as a teenager by men twice my age and size shouting \u201cnigger\u201d; pursued down a main street in Edinburgh by two men with baseball bats shouting the same word; had racist graffiti scrawled on my house; and had countless people shout at me in the street. Unremarkable not because they weren\u2019t terrifying or upsetting at the time but because such stories are relatively common among black people of my age who grew up in Britain. So when I hear that someone has failed at racial etiquette, I generally roll my eyes, whether or not they are a politician. I have seen, heard and felt worse. The pattern is now painfully familiar. In an unscripted moment a public figure uses a term that is either outdated (\u201ccoloured\u201d), offensive (\u201cnigger \u201d) or just plain odd (\u201cfunny tinge\u201d). Indignation, caffeinated by social media, erupts. The person then doubles down or apologises \u2013 or, as often as not, doubles down and then apologises. I get a phone call from a radio or television outlet asking if I want to come on and talk about it. I don\u2019t. Not because I don\u2019t think it matters. Words have meaning. Politicians have responsibilities. Racism is real. But because the media rarely call to talk about racial disparities in school exclusions, sentencing or poverty. Racism is a system of oppression rooted in history, politics, economics and culture. Our understanding of it should not be reduced to a litany of gaffes and flubs any more than it can be relegated to people shouting epithets and wielding baseball bats. These are the most glaring and dramatic manifestations of a broader, deeper problem \u2013 they should not be mistaken for the problem itself. Moreover, people have the right to misspeak, be corrected, offer a proper apology and move on. But over the past few weeks, the relentless parade of remarks, ranging from gauche to grotesque, suggests more than simply individual, off-the-cuff indiscretions. There is only so long one can keep talking about an isolated series of events before one must concede there may be a pattern. This return to the language of the 1970s, in which black people are \u201ccoloured\u201d and Islamophobia is a matter for the Foreign Office, is moving in lockstep with the racial politics of the 1970s, with citizens being deported and non-white people considered foreign. Let\u2019s start with the easier stuff. The former Labour MP Angela Smith\u2019s description of non-white people as being of a \u201cfunny tinge\u201d a few weeks ago was very strange. She apologised immediately. That apology would be easier to accept if she had not left Labour to join the Independent Group, insisting that the party was so irredeemably, institutionally racist that she could not bear to remain in it. Having thrown those kind of stones, you retreat to a glass house at your peril. Similarly, the Conservative MP Amber Rudd was actually sympathising with Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott about the racist abuse the shadow home secretary encounters online when she described Abbott as \u201ca coloured woman\u201d. Rudd apologised for her \u201cclumsy language\u201d. Clumsy is a bit of an understatement. Rudd was formerly home secretary \u2013 that part of government from which policies around racial justice and equality generally emanate. It was her job to know better. It is hardly reassuring to think that she used to sit across the cabinet table from the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who once opined about \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. In a different context we might give her a break. But this was the right honourable member for Windrush Central. When the stakes were much higher for people with far less, whom did she give a break to? Last month the Tory MP Nadine Dorries mistook the political journalist Ash Sarkar for the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate Faiza Shaheen; they look nothing alike, but are both of Asian heritage. Dorries, who has also in the past compared Chuka Umunna to Chris Eubank (two men who do not look remotely similar but share African heritage), attempted to deflect attention by referring to antisemitism in the Labour party. (A few weeks later, Kirsty Wark confused the two on Newsnight and offered a generous apology accepted by both.) She claimed the confusion derived from their \u201csimilar accents\u201d. One can only assume she gets Johnson, David Cameron and Jacob Rees-Mogg confused for the same reason \u2013 they all talk like the Old Etonian toffs they are. Finally, and most recently, the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, took it to a whole new level. Last week she encouraged the Labour MP Naz Shah, who expressed concern about incidences of Islamophobia in the Conservative party, to seek an adjournment debate so that Leadsom could \u201cdiscuss with foreign ministers whether that would be a useful way forward\u201d. So the way British Muslims are treated within a British political party becomes a matter for the Foreign Office? Leadsom later claimed she had thought the question referred to a global definition of Islamophobia. That would be easier to believe if she did not belong to a government that had just stripped citizenship from a 19-year-old Muslim woman who left the East End to join Islamic State four years ago, has been deporting British citizens for several years and continues to do so. It would also be easier to swallow if she did not belong to a party with a local mayor who allegedly liked a social media image of Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, being murdered. Only she can ever know what she meant to say. But we can all see that what her government and party do is in keeping with her words. Racism is not about politeness \u2013 it\u2019s about power.

With only 17 days left to 29 March, today\u2019s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d<br></li> \n   <li><strong>MPs will vote on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday and, if they reject that, on the possibility of delaying the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union, May said.</strong> She promised Tory MPs they would be given a free vote but some parliamentarians believe the government\u2019s motion is too weak in its opposition to a no-deal Brexit and have tabled an amendment. Some Tory MPs proposed a separate amendment calling for a transition period, but not a backstop. That was quickly dismissed as a \u201cdangerous illusion\u201d by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator.</li> \n   <li><strong>Labour said it would again try to force the government to adopt its Brexit stance.</strong> After May was defeated, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election.</li> \n   <li><strong>Business groups reacted to the day\u2019s parliamentary business with anger.</strong> They called for an extension to Article 50 in order to avoid a disorderly Brexit.

But, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-03-12/debates/2071A524-04FF-4629-8EDB-50AD54C25026/WithdrawalAgreementLegalOpinion\">as you can see from his full quote</a>, Cox also said it would be \u201cunwise\u201d to try to exercise this right. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As I have pointed out to the House, there is a right for the United Kingdom to terminate this agreement. If fundamental circumstances change, in the view of the United Kingdom, it would attempt to resolve the matter within the joint committee and it would attempt to resolve it politically, but if, ultimately, with the sovereign right of this House and of the British government at the time, the United Kingdom took the view that those fundamental circumstances had indeed changed, it would have an undoubted legal right to withdrawal from any treaty.</p> \n   <p>Let us be clear about these kinds of absolute interpretations of black-letter text. A sovereign state has the right to withdraw if a treaty is no longer compatible with its fundamental interests or, to put it a different way, if fundamental circumstances have changed. I would say that apart from that, of course this country could resile from its commitments, but it would be unwise and it would not be in the tradition of this country to do so. In those circumstances, it is perfectly true that the only remedies the [European] Union would have would be to take countermeasures, and no doubt it would pollute the atmosphere for fruitful relationships between us, which is precisely why this country will never do it, and neither would the European Union.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later Cox put it in even stronger terms, saying this approach would just be \u201cwrong\u201d. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are permitted, in a case of fundamental change of circumstances, to withdraw by the law. If such a change of circumstance came about \u2013either because of some fundamental political change in Northern Ireland or some fundamental change of circumstance going to the essential basis of the agreement \u2013 then we would have the right to withdraw. But in all normal, envisageable and predictable circumstances, particularly while we are negotiating a subsequent agreement to the pace and accelerated timetable that this instrument now requires, we would not do so and it would be wrong to do so \u2013 wrong because it would be a breach of our obligations and wrong because this is a law-abiding country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T19:13:23.120Z\">at 7.13pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c8801cae4b0eff8e0fc19f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T19:02:39.499Z\">7.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>MPs are now voting.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c88015ee4b016d23425a79e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T18:59:22.284Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Dominic Grieve, </strong>the former attorney general, says invoking article 62 of the Vienna convention would involve a rather apocalyptic scenario.</p> \n  <p>Barclay says lawyers can always disagree.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c88005de4b016d23425a796\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T18:57:47.376Z\">6.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the Tory MP and ERG chair, intervenes.

First, she told MPs the government would legislate to give the Northern Ireland assembly a say on whether the backstop gets brought into force if new border arrangements are not ready by 2020. If Stormont opposed the backstop, ministers would have to extend the transition instead. Second, she said the government would legislate to ensure Britain maintains the same regulatory standards as Northern Ireland (which, under the backstop, would have to comply with EU standards.)

The practical reality now is that there is no \u201cfurther negotiation\u201d without delaying our leaving date, and we have a choice between this deal or facing the votes that would come later this week on \u201cno deal\u201d and the extension of article 50.</p> \n   <p>There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that though I myself would vote to leave on 29 March, parliament will not. Parliament will vote for extension, and extension leads to further delay, further confusion, and great risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> not happening at all. Extension or revocation of article 50 is absolutely unacceptable, and is a great betrayal of everything we have promised.

(Bold text as in the original.)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> 1. Yesterday\u2019s documents considered individually and collectively <strong>do not deliver \u201clegally binding changes\u201d to the WA or to the protocol.</strong> They fail to fulfil the commitment made by government to the House in response to the Brady amendment \u201cto obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement\u201d.</p> \n   <p>2. They <strong>do not provide any exit mechanism from the protocol which is under the UK\u2019s control.</strong> Any exit by the UK from the protocol cannot take place without the agreement of the EU and therefore the position remains as set out in paras 14-16 of the attorney general\u2019s advice dated 13 November 2018 that \u201cthe protocol will endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement takes its place\u201d, and that the WA \u201ccannot provide a legal means of compelling the EU to conclude such an agreement\u201d. </p> \n   <p>3. The <strong>suggestion that \u201cbad faith\u201d by the EU could provide a legal route for the UK out of the protocol is not credible in practice within any determinate or reasonable timeframe.</strong> The AG\u2019s advice at para 29 was that demonstrably bad-faith conduct on the part of the EU \u201cwould be highly unlikely; all they would have to do to show good faith would be to consider the UK\u2019s proposals, even if they ultimately rejected them.\u201d The threshold for demonstrating bad faith before an international tribunal is very high, and nothing in the documents make this a credible possibility. </p> \n   <p>4. The UK could not unilaterally disapply the protocol by alleging bad faith, but would be bound to submit the dispute to arbitration under part 6 of the WA, and would need a prior finding by the panel of breach on the part of the EU in order to invoke the right under Art.178(2) of the WA to suspend (not terminate) provisions of the WA or protocol. <strong>Any arbitration would be at best a lengthy and uncertain procedure </strong>which under Art.174 requires a reference to the ECJ of any questions of EU law involved. <strong>Even if the arbitration panel found in favour of the UK, para 14 of the joint instrument confirms that it would not enable the UK to exit the backstop. </strong></p> \n   <p>5. The attorney general\u2019s further advice today (12 March 2019) indicates at para 17 that there is a \u201creduced risk\u201d of the UK being trapped in the protocol but this is caveated by the words \u201cat least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU.\u201d We consider that the prospects of such findings against the EU are remote, and note that at para 10 the AG only goes so far as to say that \u201cit is arguable\u201d that the UK could secure termination of relevant obligations under the protocol. <strong>Such faint and remote prospects of escaping from the protocol do not materially change the position the UK would find itself in if it were to ratify the WA.</strong> We agree with the AG\u2019s final para 19 that \u201cthe legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol\u2019s arrangements, save by agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T13:24:06.674Z\">at 1.24pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c87b0a4e4b0eff8e0fc15eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T13:15:57.518Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Steve Baker,</strong> the deputy chair of the ERG, says the UK could find itself trapped in the backstop under this plan, unless it agrees to remain in the customs union.</p> \n  <p>Cox says he does not accept that.

In the light of what he has said, it is very hard to see the Tory European Research Group and the DUP deciding to vote with the government tonight. If they remain opposed, Theresa May will be heading for defeat by a three-figure majority.</p> \n  <p>This could mean that the prospects of May ever getting her deal, or at least a version of it, through parliament are vanishing. This could be a moment that provides a clear shove towards a softer Brexit, or no deal.</p> \n  <p>It is rare for ministers - and Cox is not even a proper member of the cabinet, although he does attend - to issue pronouncements with quite this impact.</p> \n  <p>Others in his position might have been tempted to modify their views in the interests of helping the PM. But, in <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6791053/Hand-heart-Ill-way-beat-backstop-DAN-HODGES-reveals-Attorney-Generals-pledge.html\">an interview with the Mail on Sunday,</a> Cox explained why that did not appeal to him. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have been a barrister for 36 years, and a senior politician for seven months. My professional reputation is far more important to me than my reputation as a politician. If the risk of being trapped in the backstop had not been removed, then I would make it as clear and plain and in exactly the same way as I did on November 13.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure

This would remain the case even if parties were still negotiating many years later, and even if the parties believed that talks have clearly broken down and there was no prospect of a future relationship agreement.</p> \n   <p>I also advised that in the specific case that situation was due to the EU\u2019s want of good faith and best endeavours, because of the difficulties of proof and the egregious nature of the conduct that would be required to establish a breach by the EU of those obligations, it would be highly unlikely that the United Kingdom could take advantage of the remedies available to it for such a breach under the withdrawal agreement.</p> \n   <p>I now consider that the legally binding provisions of the joint instrument and the content of the unilateral declaration reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained within the protocol\u2019s provisions at least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU.</p> \n   <p>It may be thought that if both parties deploy a sincere desire to reach agreement and the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill implied by the amplified duties set out in the joint instrument, it is highly unlikely that a satisfactory subsequent agreement to replace the protocol will not be concluded. But as I have previously advised, that is a political judgment, which, given the mutual incentives of the parties and the available options and competing risks, I remain strongly of the view it is right to make.</p> \n   <p>However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol\u2019s arrangements, save by agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T11:29:41.300Z\">at 11.29am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c878a37e4b016d23425a1d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T10:43:11.931Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg,</strong> the Tory Brexiter and ERG chair, said earlier that his assessment of the value of what Theresa May secured last night would depend to a large extent on the value of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785124/2019-03-11_Unilateral_Declaration.pdf\">the unilateral declaration</a> obtained by the government.

People\u2019s Vote says their views should carry more weight than that of the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, because all three are experts in EU and international law, unlike Cox who specialised in commercial law before he joined the government.</p> \n  <p>Here is their summary.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In our opinion these measures: </p> \n   <p>a. do not allow the UK to terminate the backstop in the event that negotiations over its future relationship with the EU cannot be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and </p> \n   <p>b. do not provide the UK with a right to terminate the backstop at a time of its choosing, or indeed at any time, without the agreement of the EU. </p> \n   <p>The furthest they go is to reiterate the possibility that the backstop might be suspended in extreme circumstances of bad faith on the part of the EU which are highly unlikely to be demonstrated. This was already apparent from the withdrawal agreement, and had been acknowledged in the attorney general\u2019s previous legal advice. </p> \n   <p>Looking at the measures individually: </p> \n   <p>a. <strong>The joint EU-UK instrument relating to the withdrawal agreement </strong>reduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately, and in bad faith, held in the backstop indefinitely. That was only ever a very limited risk. The far greater risk of being held in the backstop indefinitely as a result of the failure of good faith negotiations remains unmitigated. </p> \n   <p>b. <strong>The UK\u2019s unilateral declaration</strong> goes beyond the joint instrument only in suggesting that the UK might seek to disapply the backstop as a whole if negotiations had failed because of bad faith on the part of the EU. It does not suggest that there are any circumstances other than proven bad faith in which the backstop might be disapplied. Whether or not the UK\u2019s understanding of the withdrawal agreement is correct will be a matter for the Court of Justice of the EU, which is likely to be sceptical not least because the UK\u2019s declaration goes beyond the terms of the joint instrument.</p> \n   <p> c. <strong>The joint EU-UK statement supplementing the political declaration</strong> has no effect whatsoever on the withdrawal agreement but merely explains certain of the parties\u2019 aspirations for the future negotiations and the future relationship. </p> \n   <p>Taken as a whole, these measures do not come close to meeting the [European Research Group\u2019s] test of clearly worded, \u201ctreaty level\u201d provisions which unambiguously override the stipulation of the withdrawal agreement that the backstop shall remain unless and until the UK and the EU agree otherwise. </p> \n   <p>It is crystal clear that the measures do not alter the fundamental legal effect of the backstop, as previously and correctly explained by the attorney general. The backstop will endure indefinitely, unless and until superseded by another agreement, save in the extreme and unlikely event that in future negotiations the EU acts in bad faith in rejecting the UK\u2019s demands.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T10:53:08.538Z\">at 10.53am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c877cd6e4b0eff8e0fc1383\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T09:33:19.792Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1105400704246652929\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cabinet source sounding pessimistic about tone of legal advice - \u2018probably won\u2019t be enough to get it over the line\u2019</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1105400704246652929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c87754ce4b0eff8e0fc1366\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T09:24:44.290Z\">9.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What are the new Brexit documents that have been agreed?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government motion that MPs will vote on tonight (which is <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP190312.pdf\">on the order paper [pdf],</a> starting on page 6) asks MPs to approve five documents.</p> \n  <p>The first two are the ones that were agreed at the end of last year - the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration.</p> \n  <p>But then there are three others - agreed last night.

worked hand in hand with our EU partners\u2019 institutions, including the commission and the taskforce led by Michel Barnier. </p> \n   <p>In that work we have insisted that the withdrawal agreement could not be re-written and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until its replaced by future arrangements that achieve the same objective, namely there will be no hard border. </p> \n   <p>However we\u2019ve also said we would be prepared to offer guarantees and further assurances to the UK of our good faith and intentions. </p> \n

Here are three.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 - How many MPs will Theresa May win over with the concessions she won last night? </strong>Some 118 Tories voted against her deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/15/brexit-vote-parliament-latest-news-may-corbyn-gove-tells-tories-they-can-improve-outcome-if-mays-deal-passed-politics-live?page=with:block-5c3e4106e4b03740e8745867#block-5c3e4106e4b03740e8745867\">in the first meaningful vote in January. </a>Many of them, worried by the prospect of Brexit being \u201cstolen\u201d by the second referendum campaign, seem to be keen to find reasons why they can be persuaded to vote for her deal now. There don\u2019t seem to be any Westminster observers who expect May to win the vote tonight (assuming it is not delayed for 24 hours, as Iain Duncan Smith said it should be, to give everyone more time to read the new documents), but she could lose by a lot less than the record 230-vote government defeat we saw in January.</p> \n  <p><strong>2 - Will May do well enough to persuade MPs, and the EU, that she has a chance of getting her deal over the line in a third meaningful vote? </strong>It is impossible to know for sure what the benchmark will be, not least a figure that might look potentially disappointing now (a defeat by 100-odd votes) could, by 7pm, look rather different, because context and expectations will have changed. But if May only loses by 50 (implying she would only need to change the minds of 25 MPs in a third vote), that will probably feel like a very good result. And it is hard to see how she will spin a defeat by 150 or more as anything other than another disaster.</p> \n  <p><strong>3 - Will May retain the initiative, or will parliament start to take control?</strong> If May loses tonight, MPs are expected to vote later this week to extend article 50. Some MPs want to use this as the start of a process that will see them finding a Commons majority for a softer Brexit. May, of course, wants to head them off by getting her deal through. This issue won\u2019t be resolved by the end of today, but we may have a better idea as to whether parliament, or the prime minister, is getting the upper hand.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c876788e4b016d23425a0eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T08:05:46.563Z\">8.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston predicts that May\u2019s deal will be voted down by another big margin because she has failed to secure guarantees on the backstop.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1498276767163730/posts/2295458034112262/\">Writing on Facebook</a> he says: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That means too few Tory Brexiter MPs will change their mind that her form of Brexit is a pact with the EU that no proudly independent nation could ever sign.</p> \n   <p>Even Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP MPs, who are desperate to cease their opposition to the PM\u2019s deal and really want to back the PM at the last, will struggle to justify doing so.</p> \n   <p>Which means I can see no route to victory for her and meaningful vote tonight - which I would expect her to lose by another significant margin.</p> \n   <p>If so, she would face decisions of moment for all of us and for herself.</p> \n   <p>Would she work with parliament to take a no-deal Brexit off the table - or stick to her own official policy and work against MPs who want a different Brexit or even no Brexit at all?</p> \n   <p>And would she take this latest and perhaps greatest diplomatic and political humiliation on the chin, as she has so many others, and battle on.</p> \n   <p>Or could she decide that she has done what she can to execute the revealed will of the British people to leave the EU, against the constant opposition of MPs from all sides, and it may now be time for another prime minister to finish the job.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c876560e4b0eff8e0fc12f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T07:55:59.241Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Starmer added: \u201cAs people read through this document they are going to say \u2018look in reality it hasn\u2019t really changed anything\u2019.</p> \n  <p>He said the changes that the prime minister claimed to have secured were already in the withdrawal agreement.

The risk with all these compromises is that they end up looking friendless.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stating that it is now highly unlikely that the UK will leave the EU at the end of March, he said that a longer extension was not popular with the public.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the aim is the so-called technical extension, the public would accept it, however what\u2019s also being discussed is if she cannot get a deal through and a majority of the public though not the majority of leave voters don\u2019t want to leave without a deal, so therefore they\u2019ll want the extension. But the kind of extension the EU potentially has in mind is rather a long one and so far the polls suggest the public aren\u2019t minded to back the idea of us still being in the EU at the end of 2020.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked what the results of a second EU referendum might be, Curtice said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Would a very close to call. On average across the UK at as a whole it\u2019s 53% for remain 47% for leave but much of the movement since 2016 comes from the views of those who did not vote in 2016. They are 2 to 1 in favour of remain but there\u2019s very little evidence that leave voters have switched so the question is whether these voters who didn\u2019t vote in 2016 would turn out this time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T08:39:23.358Z\">at 8.39am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c87600ee4b0cf92e5a553c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T07:31:53.658Z\">7.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>is urging MPs to reject the deal claiming that May\u2019s efforts to renegotiate her deal have failed. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1105367225051996161\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Since her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the Prime Minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused&nbsp;to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support.<br><br>That\u2019s why MPs must reject this deal today.</p>\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1105367225051996161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T08:38:29.364Z\">at 8.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c875f6de4b0cf92e5a553bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T07:28:21.215Z\">7.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Duncan Smith said the ERG\u2019s legal team were combing through the new assurances agreed last night to see whether or not the words of the document match the words from the statement.

It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n      <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n      <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n      <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n      <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

Defeat by a narrow margin, of fewer than say 50 votes, could allow her to have another go in a third meaningful vote.</p> \n  <p>Received wisdom in Westminster is that a loss by more than about 50 votes would be a catastrophe, because it suggests May\u2019s deal is irretrievably unpopular.<br></p> \n  <p>In that case, she could come under intense pressure from former remainers, from cabinet downwards, to let parliament decide on the next steps \u2013 by which they mean seek a softer Brexit. Under Conservative party rules May cannot be challenged until December, but she could decide she has finally run out of road and step aside.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Might we still get a public vote of some sort?</strong></h2> \n  <p>It is possible, particularly if there is a long-ish extension to article 50, giving advocates of a referendum time to rally support in parliament.</p> \n  <p>As it stands, it appears unlikely there would be a majority for the idea, with around 10 Conservative MPs willing to support it, and up to 30 Labour MPs willing to defy the whip to vote against.</p> \n  <h2><strong>So should we start stockpiling?</strong></h2> \n  <p>Not quite yet. It is highly likely that if May\u2019s deal is voted down again, MPs will agree a delay to Brexit this week. The EU27 are likely to follow suit, provided they are able to see some way ahead by which a majority in parliament could be found.</p> \n  <p>Any extension of article 50, particularly a short one, would only set up another cliff-edge a few weeks or months ahead. Some ministers believe that could finally be the thing that brings Brexiters into line behind May\u2019s deal. If not, a so-called \u201cno-deal by accident\u201d remains a serious risk.</p> \n  <p><strong>Heather Stewart\u2019s </strong>full guide to the week ahead is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/08/the-brexit-state-of-play-a-guide-to-next-weeks-crucial-votes\">here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/08/the-brexit-state-of-play-a-guide-to-next-weeks-crucial-votes\">The Brexit state of play: a guide to this week's crucial votes</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c874e9be4b0cf92e5a5537e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-12T06:22:07.938Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">How the papers covered last night's deal</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The news that May had reached an agreement in Strasbourg came late, with some papers featuring older Brexit stories on the front pages of their first edition papers, or splashing on the latest news from the Ethiopian Airlines clash, before updating to the more recent Brexit news for later editions.</p> \n  <p>The papers variously covered the news with scepticism and triumphalism.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close down this live blog now, so here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Theresa May suffered another humiliating defeat as MPs overwhelmingly rejected her Brexit deal for a second time. The prime minister had hoped assurances she gained from EU leaders on Monday would win round MPs who were concerned about the UK becoming stuck in the backstop. But she lost by 149 votes in the Commons after the attorney general said such a risk remained. The vote made a no-deal Brexit more likely, according to the president of the European Council. Donald Tusk said: \u201cOn the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement ... With only 17 days left to 29 March, today\u2019s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d MPs will vote on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday and, if they reject that, on the possibility of delaying the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union, May said. She promised Tory MPs they would be given a free vote but some parliamentarians believe the government\u2019s motion is too weak in its opposition to a no-deal Brexit and have tabled an amendment. Some Tory MPs proposed a separate amendment calling for a transition period, but not a backstop. That was quickly dismissed as a \u201cdangerous illusion\u201d by the EU\u2019s chief negotiator. Labour said it would again try to force the government to adopt its Brexit stance. After May was defeated, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election. Business groups reacted to the day\u2019s parliamentary business with anger. They called for an extension to Article 50 in order to avoid a disorderly Brexit. Tusk said such a request must be accompanied by a \u201ccredible justification\u201d. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleague Heather Stewart has the full story: The UK is moving closer to crashing out of the European Union without a deal, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has said, adding that both sides should now focus on defining their future relationship after Brexit. We hope naturally that in the coming 17 days we would still be able to avoid a disorderly exit. But we must now wait and see how the political situation in Britain develops and must not speculate. The British lower house has it all in its own hands. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley has said he would like to see a no-deal option left on the table when MPs vote on it tomorrow. He told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight: Anyone who has embarked on any sort of negotiation to get any sort of result will always have that last option available to them. To remove it weakens your negotiating team, weakens the options that you have. I say this to all Members of Parliament: If you vote to remove this from the prime minister\u2019s arsenal, essentially she will have to blink again. The education minister, Nadhim Zahawi, agreed, saying: As a responsible Member of Parliament representing Stratford-upon-Avon, I think the right thing to do for my constituents and the country is to keep no deal on the table because the only way to secure a good deal is if you can walk away from it. Tory tensions are coming to the fore this evening. The Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, has chosen to make public his frustration at his party colleague, Jacob Rees-Mogg, claiming that \u2013 despite the backbencher\u2019s well-known pro-Brexit position \u2013 he voted against leaving the EU this evening. Here\u2019s a look at the front pages of some of tomorrow\u2019s newspapers. No prizes for guessing what story they carry. The majority of them \u2013 including the Guardian, the Financial Times and the Times \u2013 focus on the scale of May\u2019s defeat and her loss of control and authority in the Commons. The Daily Telegraph has a not-too-dissimilar take, though it focuses more on May\u2019s apparent determination to stay on as prime minister, despite the repeated rejection of her central policy. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express each go one further and bemoan what they see as the frustration of Brexit. The Mail is in no doubt whom it blames, though \u2013 at least on the strength of the copy on its front page \u2013 the Express is a little more measured. The Daily Mirror and the Scotsman look forward \u2013 to the likelihood that Brexit will be delayed and Wednesday\u2019s planned vote on a no-deal scenario. An interesting line \u2013 unconfirmed, it should be noted \u2013 from ITV News\u2019 Robert Peston: This could be interpreted by some as political positioning for a possible leadership campaign. Of course, that would require either Theresa May\u2019s resignation or her removal by Parliament, since her own backbenchers could not force her out until December this year at the earliest. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, reacted to Tuesday\u2019s decision in an article for El Pa\u00eds. He said he profoundly regretted the rejection, which would serve only to \u201cprolong the uncertainty just over two weeks\u201d before Brexit was due to happen. He wrote: [British] MPs neither ratified the withdrawal agreement, nor managed to reach a basic consensus on the real, existing possibilities: a no-deal exit or staying in the European Union. But he said Spain was well prepared for any eventuality and wished to reassure both Spaniard and Britons. On a day like today, the important thing is that Spain has done its job. Spaniards are ready for any scenario, with or without a deal. The Spanish government\u2019s number one priority has always been the same: To offer rigour, certainty and security to this process \u2013 especially for citizens and economic actors \u2013 and to strengthen the foundations of our future relationship with a country to which we are bound by profound links of many different kinds. Sinn F\u00e9in say tonight\u2019s rejection of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal brings into focus the Tories\u2019 \u201cdisregard\u201d for the Good Friday Agreement. The republican party\u2019s president, Mary Lou McDonald, has said: The British Parliament voted by a landslide to reject the withdrawal agreement and Theresa May\u2019s latest proposals. The scenes tonight show the absolute disregard for the people of Ireland, for our rights, our economy and the Good Friday Agreement that is at the heart of the Tory Brexit agenda. Sinn F\u00e9in and the majority of parties across this island, know there is no good or sensible Brexit. The withdrawal agreement is imperfect but it is the only deal on offer. The \u2018backstop\u2019 contained is a guarantee that no hard border will be imposed on this island and protects the Good Friday Agreement. We are 17 days away from Brexit and the uncertainty and confusion continues. A crash-out Brexit would be a unthinkable for the peace process, jobs, trade and to the loss of people\u2019s rights and quality of life, particularly in border communities. Despite giving assurances to Theresa May, the EU has made clear that the withdrawal agreement is not going to be reopened for negotiation. There is now a need to intensify planning for a no-deal crash with an imperative to ensure no return to a hard border, protections of our agreements and safeguarding the rights of citizens. Here are some terrific pictures from the House of Commons photographers. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. And this is from a spokesman for Donald Tusk, the president of the European council. We regret the outcome of tonight\u2019s vote and are disappointed that the UK government has been unable to ensure a majority for the withdrawal agreement agreed by both parties in November. On the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement. Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is difficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse, it can only be found in London. The EU, for its part, continues to stand by the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, which serves to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market unless and until alternative arrangements can be found. With only 17 days left to 29 March, today\u2019s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be ready if such a scenario arises. Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU27 will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU27 will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth functioning of the EU institutions will need to be ensured. This is from the Danish PM, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen. This is from the DUP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson. This is from Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament and the EPP\u2019s candidate for next president of the European commission. This is from Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen. The Conservative MP Dame Caroline Spelman and Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey have tabled an amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit for good. This is word for word the same as the Spelman/Dromey amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit that was passed at the end of January. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the ERG, has said that some of his colleagues will be tabling an amendment proposing the Malthouse compromise plan B - essentially a transition, without the Irish backstop. This is the idea that Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, was championing in the debate earlier. (See 6.37pm.) But Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said after watching some of the debate (and Johnson\u2019s speech?) that the Malthouse compromise plan B is not on offer and that it was a \u201cdangerous illusion\u201d to think otherwise. (See 6.30pm.) Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that the fact that \u201ca handful of DUP MPs held more sway over Scotland\u2019s future than our own national parliament\u201d demonstrates more clearly than ever that the case for Scottish independence Sturgeon said that May and her government \u201cshould be hanging their heads in shame\u201d after the outcome of the vote which she described as \u201centirely predictable\u201d. Calling for May to rule out no-deal and call a second EU referendum, she added: Ruling out no deal and extending article 50 would stop the clock on Brexit and enable another referendum on EU membership to be held. We will support any such referendum, provided it has the option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper. Scotland\u2019s needs and voice have been ignored by the UK government throughout the Brexit process, and today a handful of DUP MPs held more sway over Scotland\u2019s future than our own national parliament \u2013 that demonstrates more clearly than ever that the case for Scotland becoming an independent country has never been stronger. We will continue to stand up for Scotland and to reflect our nation\u2019s overwhelming vote to remain in the EU. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that giving MPs a free vote on no deal was \u201ca disgraceful dereliction of duty\u201d, adding: The prime minister must finally act in the interests of all four nations of the UK - and not just her own party - by whipping her MPs to vote against a no-deal Brexit and extend article 50. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Business organisations are furious at parliament\u2019s failure to agree a Brexit deal. Here are some of the things they have been saying. From Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI From Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors Our politicians have yet again failed to find a way to break the impasse. They are becoming adept at saying what they don\u2019t want, but it\u2019s still hard to see where the desire for compromise lies. If an extension is sought, both the government and the opposition must state in precise terms what they are hoping to achieve from it. Recurring short extensions aren\u2019t an appetising prospect for businesses. From Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce It is profoundly obvious that neither government nor many businesses are ready for a disorderly exit \u2013 and this must not be allowed to happen on 29 March, whether by default or by design. Businesses have been failed over and over again by Westminster in recent months, but allowing a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March would take political negligence to new extremes. From Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses While parliament dithers, debates and delays, the reality is that there are just 17 days to go and small firms are still blindly in the dark about how they will be operating post 29 March. Small businesses are increasingly frustrated. While these political games have been playing out, small firms have been made to suffer - unable to invest, plan, hire and grow. From Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Today\u2019s vote leaves us perilously close to the \u2018cliff edge\u2019. No-deal would be catastrophic for the automotive industry. It would end frictionless trade, add billions to the cost of manufacturing and cost jobs. UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk. Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table. From the National Farmers\u2019 Union The outcome of the vote means there is no realistic possibility of achieving an orderly departure from the EU on March 29. A no-deal exit from the EU would be a catastrophe for British farming and food production. From Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium It is the most vulnerable who will feel the impact of a no deal Brexit most \u2026. There are no winners in a no-deal Brexit that systematically disintegrates the supply chains of these islands. Politicians of all shades must put people before politics and economics before ideology to find an agreement. These are from Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, responding to the defeat. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s statement responding to the defeat. May said Tory MPs will be given a free vote on rejecting a no-deal Brexit. She confirmed that MPs would get a vote on ruling out no deal tomorrow, followed by a vote on extending article 50 if no deal is rejected. She signalled that she would not support no deal herself. She said: I have personally struggled with this choice as I am sure many other honourable members will. I am passionate about delivering the result of the referendum. But I equally passionately believe that the best way to do that is to leave in an orderly way with a deal and I still believe there is a majority in the house for that course of action. And I am conscious also of my duties as prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the potential damage to the union that leaving without a deal could do when one part of our country is without devolved governance. She revealed that the vote tomorrow will just be on rejecting a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. The motion will not rule out the principle of no deal for good. It will say: That this house declines to approve leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework on the future relationship on 29 March 2019; and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this house and the EU ratify an agreement. She said the government would publish new information tomorrow about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. To ensure the house is fully informed in making this historic decision, the government will tomorrow publish information on essential policies which would need to be put in place if we were to leave without a deal. These will cover our approach to tariffs and the Northern Ireland border, among other matters. She said she \u201cprofoundly\u201d regretted the defeat. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, is still taking questions. MPs have been repeatedly trying to get her to say what length article 50 extension the government will propose, if the debate goes ahead on Thursday, but she has refused to say. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Europe editor, Alberto Nardelli. And here is the Press Association list of the 75 Tories who voted against the deal. Adam Afriyie (Windsor), Lucy Allan (Telford), Richard Bacon (South Norfolk), Steve Baker (Wycombe), John Baron (Basildon and Billericay), Guto Bebb (Aberconwy), Crispin Blunt (Reigate), Peter Bone (Wellingborough), Suella Braverman (Fareham), Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire), Conor Burns (Bournemouth West), William Cash (Stone), Rehman Chishti (Gillingham and Rainham), Christopher Chope (Christchurch), Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland), Damian Collins (Folkestone and Hythe), Robert Courts (Witney), Richard Drax (South Dorset), James Duddridge (Rochford and Southend East), Iain Duncan Smith (Chingford and Woodford Green), Charlie Elphicke (Dover), Michael Fabricant (Lichfield), Michael Fallon (Sevenoaks), Mark Francois (Rayleigh and Wickford), Marcus Fysh (Yeovil), James Gray (North Wiltshire), Chris Green (Bolton West), Justine Greening (Putney), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Sam Gyimah (East Surrey), Mark Harper (Forest of Dean), Gordon Henderson (Sittingbourne and Sheppey), Philip Hollobone (Kettering), Adam Holloway (Gravesham), Eddie Hughes (Walsall North), Ranil Jayawardena (North East Hampshire), Bernard Jenkin (Harwich and North Essex), Andrea Jenkyns (Morley and Outwood), Boris Johnson (Uxbridge and South Ruislip), Gareth Johnson (Dartford), Joseph Johnson (Orpington), David Jones (Clwyd West), Daniel Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham), Pauline Latham (Mid Derbyshire), Phillip Lee (Bracknell), Andrew Lewer (Northampton South), Julian Lewis (New Forest East), Ian Liddell-Grainger (Bridgwater and West Somerset), Julia Lopez (Hornchurch and Upminster), Jonathan Lord (Woking), Craig Mackinlay (South Thanet), Anne Main (St Albans), Esther McVey (Tatton), Anne Marie Morris (Newton Abbot), Sheryll Murray (South East Cornwall), Priti Patel (Witham), Owen Paterson (North Shropshire), Tom Pursglove (Corby), Dominic Raab (Esher and Walton), John Redwood (Wokingham), Jacob Rees-Mogg (North East Somerset), Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury), Andrew Rosindell (Romford), Lee Rowley (North East Derbyshire), Grant Shapps (Welwyn Hatfield), Henry Smith (Crawley), Royston Smith (Southampton, Itchen), Bob Stewart (Beckenham), Ross Thomson (Aberdeen South), Michael Tomlinson (Mid Dorset and North Poole), Craig Tracey (North Warwickshire), Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Berwick-upon-Tweed), Shailesh Vara (North West Cambridgeshire), Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet), John Whittingdale (Maldon). Here is the Guardian list of how MPs voted. The Commons website with the division lists seems to have crashed. But here are the figures for how MPs voted for the deal by party. For Conservatives: 235 Labour: 3 Independents: 4 Against Labour: 238 Conservatives: 75 SNP: 35 Independents: 17 Lib Dems: 11 DUP: 10 Plaid Cymru: 4 Green: 1 Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks if the no-deal vote tomorrow will be at 7pm, as you would expect, and if the vote on Thursday will be at 5pm, as you would expect. Leadsom says it will be for MPs to decide. Bercow says the business motion says tomorrow\u2019s vote should be at 7pm. The Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake asks if there will be protected time for the debate tomorrow. Tomorrow Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is making his spring statement. That will start at 12.30pm, and could easily run for up to three hours. So, if the main debate ends at 7pm, MPs could be left with just three hours or so to debate a no-deal Brexit. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, says MPs can amend the business motion. Here are the previous biggest government defeats. Today\u2019s will be the fourth biggest in the democratic era. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a short business statement confirming the no-deal debate will take place tomorrow. The division lists are up on the parliamentary website. Here is the overall result. The list of ayes is here. And the list of noes is here. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee, asks what arrangements will apply on Thursday to allow for manuscript amendments then. Bercow says the hours will be different, because the sitting hours are different, but the principle will be the same; he will try to facilitate what MPs want. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP, says people urgently need clarification as to what will happen in a few weeks\u2019 time. She says the PM\u2019s proposal of a motion tomorrow sounded unclear. Will it be tabled in time for MPs to table amendments, so the vote can be clear cut? And will the government confirm that the vote on extending article 50 will go ahead on Thursday? John Bercow, the Speaker, says he thought May was clear those votes were going ahead. He says he will allow MPs to submit manuscript amendments to tomorrow\u2019s motion by 10.30am tomorrow. A list will be produced. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks if there is any precedent since, say, the American war of independence of a PM being defeated twice, but continuing with the same policy. Bercow says it is usually unwise to say something is unprecedented. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, told May today that the SNP would engage with the government on a sensible way forward. But that must include a second referendum, he says. SNP says May must now accept case for second referendum. Jeremy Corbyn says the house must unite around a proposal that can be negotiated. That plan has been put forward by Labour, he says. He says Labour will put its plan forward again. May has run down the clock. Maybe we should have a general election, he says. Corbyn says Labour will again try to get MPs to back its Brexit plan. May says she has struggled with this. She is conscious of the need to honour the referendum. But she also knows how important it is to get a deal. She says the government motion will say that a no-deal Brexit remains the government\u2019s default, unless there is a deal. She says, if MPs vote to leave without a deal, that will become government policy. If MPs reject the plan, there will be a vote on Thursday on extending article 50. But voting for an extension does not solve the problems the government faces. The EU will want to know if the UK wants to revoke article 50 or if it wants a referendum. Those are choices the house must now face. Theresa May is making a statement now. She says two weeks ago she made a series of commitments about what would happen if she lost the vote. She stands by those commitments in full. Tomorrow there will be a debate and vote on leaving the UK with no deal. This is a matter of profound importance. It will be a free vote for Tory MPs, she says. May says Tory MPs will get a free vote tomorrow on a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s deal has been defeated again by 391 votes to 242 - a majority of 149. The result should have been announced by now. Normally divisions take 15 minutes. It is not clear why it is taking so long. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh In January 202 MPs voted for the deal. From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole From Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw From Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam This is from the Labour MP Paul Sweeney. From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From Labour\u2019s Maria Eagle The SNP\u2019s Hannah Bardell has tweeted a picture. This is from Labour\u2019s Jon Trickett. Jacob Rees-Mogg was raising a point that he raised with Geoffrey Cox, when the attorney general made his statement to MPs earlier (see 1.29pm), in his intervention a few minutes ago. (See 6.57pm.) Rees-Mogg was trying to get Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, to confirm that article 62 of the Vienna convention allows a country to abandon a treaty in extreme circumstances. Cox did say that. But, as you can see from his full quote, Cox also said it would be \u201cunwise\u201d to try to exercise this right. He said: As I have pointed out to the House, there is a right for the United Kingdom to terminate this agreement. If fundamental circumstances change, in the view of the United Kingdom, it would attempt to resolve the matter within the joint committee and it would attempt to resolve it politically, but if, ultimately, with the sovereign right of this House and of the British government at the time, the United Kingdom took the view that those fundamental circumstances had indeed changed, it would have an undoubted legal right to withdrawal from any treaty. Let us be clear about these kinds of absolute interpretations of black-letter text. A sovereign state has the right to withdraw if a treaty is no longer compatible with its fundamental interests or, to put it a different way, if fundamental circumstances have changed. I would say that apart from that, of course this country could resile from its commitments, but it would be unwise and it would not be in the tradition of this country to do so. In those circumstances, it is perfectly true that the only remedies the [European] Union would have would be to take countermeasures, and no doubt it would pollute the atmosphere for fruitful relationships between us, which is precisely why this country will never do it, and neither would the European Union. Later Cox put it in even stronger terms, saying this approach would just be \u201cwrong\u201d. He said: We are permitted, in a case of fundamental change of circumstances, to withdraw by the law. If such a change of circumstance came about \u2013either because of some fundamental political change in Northern Ireland or some fundamental change of circumstance going to the essential basis of the agreement \u2013 then we would have the right to withdraw. But in all normal, envisageable and predictable circumstances, particularly while we are negotiating a subsequent agreement to the pace and accelerated timetable that this instrument now requires, we would not do so and it would be wrong to do so \u2013 wrong because it would be a breach of our obligations and wrong because this is a law-abiding country. MPs are now voting. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, says invoking article 62 of the Vienna convention would involve a rather apocalyptic scenario. Barclay says lawyers can always disagree. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory MP and ERG chair, intervenes. He says he thinks Geoffrey Cox has extended his advice on how the Vienna convention could be used to ensure the UK does not get stuck in the backstop. Barclay says exceptional circumstances could change the way the UK entered into an agreement. If the UK took the reasonable view that the protocol (ie the backstop) was no longer needed, then it could argue it was no longer necessary. Article 62 of the Vienna convention allows the termination of a treaty in certain circumstances. He says in the unlikely event that this were to happen, the UK would continue to respect things like citizens\u2019 rights. Barclay says the attorney general has given ministers new advice saying in certain circumstances the UK could unilaterally leave the backstop. The Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope thinks the government will lose by a majority of around 150 votes. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is winding up now. He says this deal will allow the country to move forward. It will deliver the protections MPs asked for. And, on Gibraltar, the PM has been clear that the government stands behind sovereignty for Gibraltar, and that will never change. Starmer says he never thought the government would get into such a bad position. Labour MPs should take no joy in the mess the government has got into, he says. After this vote, MPs will have to come together to find a solution, he says. Starmer says ministers repeatedly said MPs would get a detailed plan for the future trade deal when they voted on the withdrawal agreement. But the government has not delivered that, he says. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is winding up now for Labour. He says the government has been trying to get by from day to day. He says Theresa May promised votes on a no-deal Brexit, and on extending article 50, to avoid defeat. But events have caught up with May, he says. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and ERG chair, has said most ERG members who attended the group\u2019s meeting will vote against the deal, the Mail\u2019s Claire Ellicott reports. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, the Tory MP Steve Double described the PM\u2019s deal as a \u201cpolished turd\u201d, but possibly the best available. Here is the Boris Johnson quote where he told MPs they could get a transition without signing the withdrawal agreement - the claim that seemed to provoke Michel Barnier to tweet a rebuttal. (See 6.30pm.) Johnson told MPs: I\u2019m not in favour of crashing out, as many call it. The Malthouse compromise indicates the way forward; the UK observes single market rules and customs duties, we restrain our right to compete for three years, whilst we negotiate a free trade deal. I believe the EU would be open to this. This is from Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. He is referring to the Malthouse compromise notion that the UK could effectively get all the benefits of a transition, without having to sign the withdrawal agreement. (Technically, this is Malthouse compromise plan b, or MCB as some Brexiters call it.) Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, made exactly this argument only about half an hour before Barnier posted his tweet. (See 5.30pm.) Barnier may well be responding to him directly. Barnier tells MPs not to believe the \u201cdangerous illusion\u201d that they can get a transition without a withdrawal agreement. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. We have now got 22 named Tory switchers - or 23 if we include David Davis. (See 6.02pm.) According to the Times\u2019 Sam Coates, Sky News are expecting the government to lose by more than 100 votes. Michael Fabricant, the Tory Brexiter who voted against the deal, is still voting against it. Earlier I said he was voting in favour. That was my mistake. Sorry. My colleague Jessica Elgot has more from the ERG meeting. And the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Liz Bates reckons David Davis will vote for the deal. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, Davis was not commenting as he left the ERG meeting. This is from Damien Moore, another Tory switcher. That makes 22 switchers. Sir Hugo Swire is switching too. That takes us up to 21 Tories who have changed their minds and who are now backing the PM. That is not quite a flood yet, but if May continues to pick up support at this rate between now and 7pm, the result could be closer than some of us assumed earlier. Tracey Crouch, the Conservative former minister, voted against the deal in January, but will vote for it tonight. She explains why in a post on her Facebook page. Here is an excerpt. I am not comfortable with the flawed withdrawal agreement to say the very least but following the attorney general\u2019s statement to parliament today, I am tonight minded to support the deal. It is not perfect but this Brexit is better than the very real risk of no Brexit at all. Even with this flawed deal we stay in the game and have the chance to fight again. Allowing those who oppose the will of the people to take control of the agenda would be a betrayal of 17.3m people who would never trust any of us ever again. The Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick is now saying he will vote against the deal. Earlier (see 2.56pm) we had him down as voting in favour. The Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar says there are several Labour MPs who in principle would be happy to vote for the deal but who don\u2019t want to stick their necks out to vote for a deal that will fall. Johnson refers to the threat that parliament might take control of government business. But that would upend hundreds of years of constitutional practice, he says. He says he is not in favour of \u201ccrashing out\u201d. He favours the Malthouse compromise plan; under this, the UK would comply with EU rules for three years, while it negotiated a new trade deal. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, is speaking in the debate now. He says he had hoped that the EU would make the wholly reasonable changes the UK wanted. But the EU refused to do that. Like Adam and Eve, they sewed a fig leaf that failed to cover the embarrassment of the UK, he says. He says the backstop is based on the UK staying in the customs union. Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP from Northern Ireland, says Johnson during the referendum promised Brexit would allow the UK to take back control. Has he ever visited places like South Armagh? How does he think they will be able to take back control without backstop? Johnson says he has visited those places. He says there is no need for a hard border in Ireland. He says when he was in government he was told there was a minimal legal risk of the backstop being used. But no one would say that now. This deal has now reached the end of the road. If it is rejected tonight, I hope that it will be put to bed. He says the UK can leave without a deal. There will be difficulties, but that is \u201cthe only safe route out\u201d of the EU. This is from Andrew Bridgen, the hardline Tory Brexiter, explaining why he is not joining those Brexiter colleagues who are planning to vote for the deal because they fear the alternative will turn out to be a softer Brexit, or no Brexit at all. Bridgen told the Press Association: The fact is, if they vote for the withdrawal agreement, we\u2019re heading for a Hotel California Brexit where we\u2019ve checked out, but we never actually get to leave. Seeing that trap, it\u2019s politically expedient to vote for the deal tonight, and the nation will be sighing a big sigh of relief, and then in a few months\u2019 time when they realise the trap they\u2019ve let us fall into in perpetuity, there will be a big backlash. Sinn F\u00e9in has accused the DUP of ignoring the interests of Northern Ireland. Commenting on the DUP\u2019s decision not to vote for the deal tonight, Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader in Northern Ireland, said: The business community, the farming community, the civil service, educationalists and trade unionists have all warned in recent weeks about the dire consequences of a no-deal crash on our economy. The DUP continues to ignore these warnings, just as they ignore the fact that the majority of people in the north voted against Brexit in the first place. This blinkered strategy is reckless in the extreme. It is driving us all towards a no-deal crash that would be catastrophic. At this critical time the DUP have a choice to make. It is time to put people\u2019s jobs, livelihoods and peace first before selfish party political interests. The DUP has 10 MPs. Sinn F\u00e9in has seven, but of course that is often overlooked because they do not take their seats. The European Research Group is meeting now. And the meeting is being filmed, CityAM\u2019s Owen Bennett reports. Andrew Mitchell, the Tory former chief whip and former international development secretary, is going to vote for the deal he voted against eight weeks ago, Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall reports. The Commons Hansard with the full text of Geoffrey Cox\u2019s statement on his legal advice, and his response to MPs\u2019 questions, is up on the Hansard website now. As the afternoon goes on, the debate transcript will appear. Normally speeches go up about three hours after they were delivered. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. From Newsnight\u2019s Nick Watt Speaking in Strasbourgh, the European commission vice-president, Jyrki Katainen, said if the deal was rejected the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d moved closer and his advice was \u201cfasten your seatbelt\u201d. He told reporters: Depending on the vote in the Commons, we are either moving forward to orderly withdrawal or hard Brexit is closer again, more close than ever it has been. So, keep your hands on the wheel, look forward and fasten your seatbelt. In the Commons Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, says he is a member of the ERG. They are called \u201cextremists\u201d, or equivalent to Momentum. But they just want to implement the referendum result, he says. Johnny Mercer, another Tory who voted against the deal in January, will be backing the PM this evening. He explains why here. Theresa May is heading for another clear defeat on her Brexit plan. MPs will vote at 7pm, but the assurances that she negotiated late last night (see 9.24pm for details) have done very little to shift opinion from the vote in January, which she lost by an unprecedented majority (for a government defeat in the democratic era) of 230. The DUP is planning to oppose May for a second time, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, which represents up to 80 or so Tories committed to a harder Brexit, has suggested that ERG will also vote against. (See 3.11pm.) The ERG is meeting later to try to agree its line. At least 12 Tories who voted against May in January have said they will back her today (see 2.56pm), and more switchers are likely to declare before 7pm, but unless there is an avalanche of vote-shifting, May is still heading for a very heavy defeat in triple figures. The only uncertainty has been created by the clear nervousness among Brexiters that, if they kill the deal tonight, parliament might end up imposing a much softer Brexit, or a referendum. (See, for example, Mark Pritchard at 2.09pm) At Westminster May\u2019s position has never seemed weaker. The government says a vote against the deal will be followed, tomorrow, by a vote on a no-deal Brexit, and then a vote on extending article 50, but there is also a lot of speculation about whether today\u2019s events will also end up bringing down May\u2019s premiership. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has published legal advice saying, despite the assurances obtained by May last night, the UK could still be trapped in the backstop. (See 11.12am.) A panel of lawyers assembled by the Brexit-backing European Research Group of Conservative MPs has rejected the last-ditch concessions secured by May from the EU27 on the Northern Ireland backstop. May has urged MPs to back her deal so that they can deliver on the result of the EU referendum. Struggling through her Commons speech, because she was losing her voice, just as she did in her disastrous 2017 conference speech, May said: It was not this house that decided it was time for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, it was the British people. It falls to us here to implement their decision, their desire for change, their demand for a better, more open, more successful future for our country. Today is the day that we can begin to build that future ... The time has come to deliver on the instruction we were given. The time has come to back this deal and I commend this motion to the House. May has announced three measures intended to assure Northern Ireland that it would not lose out through the backstop proposals. First, she told MPs the government would legislate to give the Northern Ireland assembly a say on whether the backstop gets brought into force if new border arrangements are not ready by 2020. If Stormont opposed the backstop, ministers would have to extend the transition instead. Second, she said the government would legislate to ensure Britain maintains the same regulatory standards as Northern Ireland (which, under the backstop, would have to comply with EU standards.) And, third, she said the government would legislate to ban any expansion of North/South cooperation in Ireland through the withdrawal agreement, instead of through the Good Friday agreement. Jeremy Corbyn has told MPs that there is a majority in the Commons for a softer Brexit. Responding to May in the debate, he said: I believe there is a majority in this house for the sort of sensible, credible and negotiable deal that Labour has set out and I look forward to parliament taking back control so that we can succeed where this government has so blatantly failed. Those people all around this country who at the moment are very, very concerned for their future, their communities, their jobs, in the case of EU nationals their very right to remain in this country, as indeed for British nationals living across the EU - parliament owes it to them to get some degree of certainty by rejecting the prime minister\u2019s proposal and bringing forward what we believe to be a credible set of alternatives. Parliament should do its job today and say no to the prime minister. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said the revised Brexit deal does not undermine the backstop nor reopen the withdrawal agreement. Zac Goldsmith, the Tory who voted against the deal in January, says he is still trying to decide how to vote. He is worried about the impact of the deal not going through being even worse. In the Commons Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, is speaking now. He says a no-deal Brexit could be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. MPs must vote against it, he says. The DUP, who have 10 MPs, are voting against the deal, rather than abstaining, the FT\u2019s Laura Hughes reports. This is from the Tory MP Derek Thomas explaining why he has gone from opposing the deal to supporting it. Sir Bill Cash, the veteran Brexiter, chair of the European scrutiny committee and chair of the ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d, is speaking in the debate in the Commons chamber now. He starts by saying that \u201cwe\u201d will be voting against the deal \u2013 implying he is speaking on behalf of the ERG. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech. The Conservative MP Ben Bradley has written an article for the Guardian explaining why he has changed his mind, and why is is going to back the PM\u2019s deal now. Here is an extract. The situation we now find ourselves in is materially different to back in January. Last time we said \u201cno\u201d and we asked May to do better, knowing we had the time and the scope to do that. We have achieved something, and the proposal today is better than what we had in January. The practical reality now is that there is no \u201cfurther negotiation\u201d without delaying our leaving date, and we have a choice between this deal or facing the votes that would come later this week on \u201cno deal\u201d and the extension of article 50. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that though I myself would vote to leave on 29 March, parliament will not. Parliament will vote for extension, and extension leads to further delay, further confusion, and great risk of Brexit not happening at all. Extension or revocation of article 50 is absolutely unacceptable, and is a great betrayal of everything we have promised. The deal is far from perfect, but it does absolutely and finally take those risks off the table. By agreeing to it, we will leave, it will be on 29 March, and we live to fight on and win a better future relationship that is in Britain\u2019s interests. And here is the full article. Corbyn says it it thanks to Labour that MPs are getting a meaningful vote. He pays tribute to Sir Keir Starmer and his shadow Brexit team. He says he thinks there is a majority in the Commons for the sensible, negotiable deal. Parliament should do its job, and reject the PM\u2019s deal, he says. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has more from the Jacob Rees-Mogg Sky News interview. The Tory MP Scott Mann, who voted against the deal in January, has joined the switchers (see 2.56pm) saying they will now back the deal. Back in the chamber Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Theresa May. He says May said that if the UK remained committed to matching EU rules on workers\u2019 rights, there was a risk rights could be reduced, not enhanced. But that is not right, Corbyn says; he says EU rules are a floor, not a ceiling. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the ERG, has just told Sky News that he has not yet decided how he will vote tonight. He will discuss it with ERG colleagues at a meeting later. The ERG has already issued a statement saying MPs should not back the deal. (See 1.38pm.) Asked if he thought the ERG would abstain, or vote against, Rees-Mogg replied: I would be surprised if many people want to abstain on an issue of this importance. May managed to get through her speech, despite her voice sounding close to packing up, and at times she even managed a flash of humour. But the verdict of the commentariat is damning. Here is a flavour of what people are saying. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson From the Financial Times\u2019 Lionel Barber From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh In the chamber May is winding up her speech now. She says now is the time to get this done. This is what MPs were sent to parliament to do, she says. She says MPs were sent here to serve. They cannot serve the country by overturning the will of the people, by prolonging a debate that people want to see settled, or by refusing to compromise. The British people have been clear; they want MPs to deliver Brexit, she says. The time has come to deliver on the instruction we were given. The time has come to back this deal. The Tory MP Sir Robert Syms, who voted against the deal in January, has just told May that he will vote for the deal this evening. Given that the clock is ticking, there are millions of people working in businesses up and down this country that want the most certain outcome, and voting for this deal today is the best way of delivering that. Voting the deal down will lead to more uncertainty. None of us know where we\u2019re going to end up. So I, for one, will be supporting the government and prime minister. The Spectator has got a list of 10 Tory MPs who were rebels in January but who have now changed their minds. Their names are: Ben Bradley, Nigel Evans, Robert Halfon, Greg Hands, John Lamont, Johnny Mercer, Mike Penning, Mark Pritchard, Derek Thomas, Martin Vickers. Syms takes the total to 11. Colleagues tell me Sir Graham Brady is also switching, meaning that we have got the names of 12 Tories who voted against in January who are voting for tonight. The Labour MPs Caroline Flint and Jim Fitzpatrick are also expected to vote for the deal tonight, having voted against it in January. That gives May 14 switchers \u2013 which reduces the size of the majority against her by 28. May says the government will legislate to ensure that regulatory standards in Great Britain remain the same as in Northern Ireland. This will address concerns that the backstop could lead to regulatory divergence between NI and GB. The government has already promised to do this, but May is now committing to make this a legislative obligation. May says the government will legislate to ensure that regulatory standards in Great Britain remain the same as in Northern Ireland. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says May should make her deal subject to a confirmatory vote. May says people expressed their views in the referendum. People have changed their minds, some MPs should. May says there is no evidence that people have changed their minds. May claims public opinion on Brexit has not changed. Actually, the evidence suggests opinion has shifted - but only very slightly. Here is a graph from What UK Thinks, which tracks polling data on this. Labour\u2019s Roberta Blackman-Woods asks why May is placating the Brexiters on her side, and not reaching out to opposition MPs instead. May says the response she is getting suggests she cannot be accused of reaching out to Brexiters. She says she has sought to hold meetings with Labour. Ben Bradley is another Tory MP who voted against the deal in January who is saying he will vote for it tonight. The president of the European parliament has responded to Geoffrey Cox\u2019s advice that the risk of the UK being trapped in the backstop remains by saying the EU can now make no further concessions. The legal issues identified by the attorney general are \u201can internal problem of the UK\u201d, Antonio Tajani told reporters. There could be no further reconsideration of the deal by the EU27. \u201cWe are very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is impossible to change our position.\u201d Anna Soubry, who recently defected from the Tories to the Independent Group, says this is \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. The problem has been May\u2019s refusal to depart from her red lines, she says. May says she has to deliver on the referendum. And she has to honour the manifesto that she and Soubry both stood on in 2017, she says. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s justice and home affairs spokesperson, says May is wrong to say the joint instrument will have the same legal standing as the withdrawal agreement. May says they both have legal standing. May is now summarising what the latest changes to the agreement have achieved. This passage repeats some of what she said in her statement in Strasbourg last night. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Helen Whately, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that, if MPs were to vote for an extension of article 50, the EU could set conditions. May agrees. She says all EU members would have to agree. May says she is sure she has secured the very best changes available. May is summarising the changes made to the withdrawal agreement since January. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle asks if May will now admit she should have reached out to other parties. May says MPs comprehensively rejected the Labour plan for Brexit. She says she has reached out to Labour on this issue. Sir Edward Leigh, a Tory Brexiter who has been arguing for some time that a unilateral declaration could make the deal acceptable, asks May to confirm that the unilateral declaration is binding on the EU. May says the EU has not objected to it. John Lamont, a Scottish Conservative, says he voted against the deal in January. But he implies he is backing May now. He says businesses need certainty. The DUP has confirmed it will not back the PM\u2019s deal at this point. This is from Arlene Foster, the party leader. Mark Pritchard, a Tory Brexiter, says he voted against the deal last time, but will vote for it tonight, unenthusiastically. That is because there has been a material change to the backstop, he says. [The PM] will know I didn\u2019t support the withdrawal agreement at the last vote and today I will support it, forgive me prime minister, unenthusiastically because I completely agree with her that there is the danger that Brexit will be lost. There doesn\u2019t appear to be the votes in this House for no deal. There certainly seems to be, could be, the votes in this House for an extension of article 50. None of those would deliver Brexit. They would frustrate and delay it and possibly stop it altogether. May says failure to vote for the deal could lead to there being no Brexit. John Woodcock, the independent MP, says Jean-Claude Juncker said last night that this would be the end of the road. (See 10.06am.) There would be no further negotiation. Does May accept that? May says that is what Juncker said. Theresa May is opening the debate now. She sounds extremely hoarse - almost worse than she did during her disastrous conference speech in 2017 (when she struggled to get through because her voice was fading.) Making a joke about it, she says MPs should hear what Jean-Claude Juncker sounds like. John Bercow, the Speaker, says he has not selected any of the amendments. That means MPs will move straight to the vote on the government motion at 7pm. In the Commons MPs are now debating the business motion, setting out the timetable for the debate. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, rises to speak. He says just five hours have been set aside for the debate. That is not enough, he says. And this timetable will not help the government win. He says if people feel they are being hurried, they are less likely to back the government. He urges the government to allow an extra day for the debate. He says he will not vote against the business motion, but he wants to make the point. John Bercow, the Speaker, says no one has tabled an amendment saying an extra day should be allowed. The business motion goes through on the nod. Here is another Tory MP who voted against the deal in May but who plans to vote with Theresa May tonight. It is Greg Hands, the former international trade minister. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, told RTE News she would be talking to Theresa May today about the latest Brexit developments. As the Press Association reports, Foster said huge decisions have to be made and this is a pivotal moment. She said she would prefer if there was more time to take the decisions, adding that she had sympathy for those calling for tonight\u2019s meaningful vote to be delayed until tomorrow. The Tory Brexiter Nigel Evans, who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal in January, has said he will back her tonight. He explained: I told the prime minister that I will be supporting her tonight. It\u2019s not ideal; it\u2019s not the best deal that I would have loved, but I do fear that if we don\u2019t get this through tonight, there is the risk that on Thursday parliament will instruct her to get an extension to article 50, and that is something I don\u2019t want to see happen. What she\u2019s got back from Strasbourg certainly reduces the risk of us being caught in the backstop, and if they try and trap us in then we now have a legal entity that allows us to get out. It is a step in the right direction. Evans has always been one of the more pragmatic, compromise-minded of the Tory Brexiters, and so his move will not be a good guide as to how some of his more hardline colleagues will vote later. John Bercow, the Speaker, brings the Cox statement to an end. There are still MPs who want to speak, but he says there is not time, because dozens of MPs want to speak in the debate later. Cox says the UK can use the leverage of the backstop as a powerful argument against the EU, because it will not want the UK to remain in it any more than the UK will want it to endure. This is what Nigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s leader at Westminster, said in his question to Geoffrey Cox a few minutes ago. We know already from the Irish government and others what they see as the ultimate destination of Northern Ireland \u2013 the backstop is the bottom line. From what the attorney general is saying today, provided there is no bad faith, the fact is that Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom could be trapped if it is a question that the EU does not agree with the United Kingdom to a superseding agreement. The Conservative MP Charles Walker, a member of the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee, has told the World at One that Theresa May should call an election if she loses the vote tonight. UPDATE: Here is another quote from Walker\u2019s interview. If it doesn\u2019t go through tonight, as sure as night follows day, there will be a general election within a matter of days or weeks. It is not sustainable, the current situation in parliament. In a statement accompanying the publication of his \u201cstar chamber\u201d report (see 1.18pm), the Tory Brexiter and ERG member Sir Bill Cash says: In the light of our own legal analysis and others we do not recommend accepting the government\u2019s motion today. Not supporting the deal is not necessarily the same as voting against. The DUP may be heading in this direction too. (See 1.21pm.) With mass Tory/DUP abstentions, May would still almost certainly lose, but the scale of the defeat would be much reduced. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the ERG, asks what penalties would fall on the UK if a future parliament ignored its obligations under the backstop. Cox says, as a law officer, he would not recommend breaking the law. But if circumstances changed fundamentally, the UK would be able to withdraw from the backstop. A sovereign country can resile from a treaty if circumstances change fundamentally. But he also says that it would be unwise for the country to ignore its legal obligations. This country would not do it, he says. Cox says, if circumstances were to change fundamentally, the UK could resile from a treaty. From Sky\u2019s Ed Conway The DUP will definitely not back the deal tonight, Sky\u2019s David Blevins reports. At the last vote, in January, the DUP voted against the deal. From this quote to Blevins, it is not clear if the DUP will actually vote against it or abstain. Here is the full text of the assessment of the new assurances from the ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d. (Bold text as in the original.) 1. Yesterday\u2019s documents considered individually and collectively do not deliver \u201clegally binding changes\u201d to the WA or to the protocol. They fail to fulfil the commitment made by government to the House in response to the Brady amendment \u201cto obtain legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement\u201d. 2. They do not provide any exit mechanism from the protocol which is under the UK\u2019s control. Any exit by the UK from the protocol cannot take place without the agreement of the EU and therefore the position remains as set out in paras 14-16 of the attorney general\u2019s advice dated 13 November 2018 that \u201cthe protocol will endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement takes its place\u201d, and that the WA \u201ccannot provide a legal means of compelling the EU to conclude such an agreement\u201d. 3. The suggestion that \u201cbad faith\u201d by the EU could provide a legal route for the UK out of the protocol is not credible in practice within any determinate or reasonable timeframe. The AG\u2019s advice at para 29 was that demonstrably bad-faith conduct on the part of the EU \u201cwould be highly unlikely; all they would have to do to show good faith would be to consider the UK\u2019s proposals, even if they ultimately rejected them.\u201d The threshold for demonstrating bad faith before an international tribunal is very high, and nothing in the documents make this a credible possibility. 4. The UK could not unilaterally disapply the protocol by alleging bad faith, but would be bound to submit the dispute to arbitration under part 6 of the WA, and would need a prior finding by the panel of breach on the part of the EU in order to invoke the right under Art.178(2) of the WA to suspend (not terminate) provisions of the WA or protocol. Any arbitration would be at best a lengthy and uncertain procedure which under Art.174 requires a reference to the ECJ of any questions of EU law involved. Even if the arbitration panel found in favour of the UK, para 14 of the joint instrument confirms that it would not enable the UK to exit the backstop. 5. The attorney general\u2019s further advice today (12 March 2019) indicates at para 17 that there is a \u201creduced risk\u201d of the UK being trapped in the protocol but this is caveated by the words \u201cat least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU.\u201d We consider that the prospects of such findings against the EU are remote, and note that at para 10 the AG only goes so far as to say that \u201cit is arguable\u201d that the UK could secure termination of relevant obligations under the protocol. Such faint and remote prospects of escaping from the protocol do not materially change the position the UK would find itself in if it were to ratify the WA. We agree with the AG\u2019s final para 19 that \u201cthe legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol\u2019s arrangements, save by agreement. Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the ERG, says the UK could find itself trapped in the backstop under this plan, unless it agrees to remain in the customs union. Cox says he does not accept that. He says the timetable in the agreement means the EU would have to work towards getting an alternative. And he says the UK could not stay in the customs union, because it would not be able to negotiate trade deals. The ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d has published its assessment of the new assurances, and it is not convinced, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyers, asks Cox if he agrees this deal provides \u201cinsufficient protection for Northern Ireland to continue as part of the United Kingdom\u201d. Cash, chair of the ERG\u2019s \u201cstar chamber\u201d, says the new assurances do not offer enough protection to Northern Ireland. Cox says he does not agree on this point. He says he hopes he can still persuade Cash to back the deal. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn, chair of the Brexit committee, asks Cox to confirm that, if the UK wanted to suspend the backstop, it would have to get the arbitration panel to agree. And any matters of EU law would be referred to the European court of justice. Cox says Benn is just explaining what the agreement says. But Benn cannot claim that what was agreed last night means nothing. These are \u201cimportant amplifications\u201d, he says. And, even though it is unlikely that any case would get to an arbitration panel, the fact that the rules have changed could change conduct. The Scottish National party\u2019s Joanna Cherry says today the emperor has no clothes, \u201cnot even a codpiece\u201d. Today\u2019s legal opinion makes it clear that the risk of being kept in the backstop remains the same. This means what has been obtained falls far short of what was required by the Brady amendment (which called for the backstop to be replaced), or what the ERG demanded. Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, says Cox has shown he is an independent adviser to government. That is what he should be. Cox says the EU has a new obligation to find an alternative to the backstop within 12 months. That is a new obligation, he says. And that means if the parties do not \u201cintensify their efforts\u201d to find a solution they will be in breach of the good faith obligation. Cox is responding to Thomas-Symonds. He says he wants to know what Labour\u2019s view of the backstop is. Are they for or against? If they can\u2019t say, people will accuse them of \u201cpolitical opportunism\u201d, he says. He says it is not true to say there is nothing new in what was agreed overnight. The new documents significantly reduce the risk of EU bad faith being able to keep the UK in the backstop. He says the house must assume its responsibilities. People are \u201cyearning\u201d for the Commons to vote for the deal, he says. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, says Cox said in the Mail on Sunday (see 11.49am) that he would not change his opinion if there was no change to the risk of being trapped in the backstop. To be fair to Cox, he has not changed his view, he says. He says the final paragraphs of Cox\u2019s advice \u201csink\u201d any hopes of the government being able to claim that it has obtained a unilateral right to exit the backstop. He says other lawyers, like Philippe Sands (see 12.25pm) and David Anderson (see 9.44am), have said the same. He says if trade talks break down because two sides cannot reach an agreement in their mutual interests, that is not bad faith. Cox says what was agreed last night strengthens the UK\u2019s case if the EU were to fail in its endeavours to agree an alternative to the backstop. But ultimately MPs will have to make a political judgment, he says. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is now making his Commons statement about his legal opinion, which has now been published. (See 11.12pm.) He says what was agreed last night improves the withdrawal agreement. He lists the three documents published last night. (See 9.24am.) He says the legal risk of the UK being stuck in the backstop remains unchanged. But the house has to make a political judgment about whether the agreement is justified, he says. This is from the FT\u2019s Laura Hughes. The key Commons business is about to start. At 12.30pm Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will make a statement on his legal advice. That should run for at least an hour. Then, after a 10-minute rule bill, MPs will vote on the business motion setting the timetable for the debate. Normally that goes through on the nod, but there could be a mini row about MPs not being given enough time to consider the new documents. Then, perhaps shortly before 2pm, Theresa May will open the debate. But before she does the Speaker, John Bercow, will announce what amendments he is accepting. There are 10 on the order paper (pdf), although Bercow said last night that he might accept manuscript amendments (amendments submitted today, and hence not printed on the order paper). Jeremy Corbyn will respond to May. Then the debate will continue until voting starts at 7pm. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. Here is another legal opinion saying that what was agreed last night does not significantly alter the impact of the backstop. It is from the law professor Philippe Sands and Sir David Edward QC. And this is from my colleague Heather Stewart on cabinet. This is from Politico Europe\u2019s Tom McTague. At the Brexit select committee Stephen Barclay has faced questioning from Jacob Rees-Mogg which bodes ill for the fate of the government\u2019s plan later today. Rees-Mogg appears very unconvinced that the tweak to the backstop provides the exit mechanism he and other Tory Brexiters seeks. He told Barclay: This has been advertised as a unilateral ability. It\u2019s not unilateral. Barclay responded with this: What is unilateral is what we are asserting, is our interpretation. And the fact this is not disputed by the EU becomes common ground that goes before the arbitrators. So this is not saying this is a unilateral exit in the regard you\u2019re referring to. What it is saying is the ability to trigger our interpretation is what the unilateral declaration is referring to. This seemed to mean, Rees-Mogg countered, only that the UK was able to ask to leave the backstop, something that was \u201cblindingly obvious to anyone since the withdrawal agreement was produced\u201d. He added: \u201cBut the ability to ask is not the same as the ability to leave, is it?\u201d The Tory Brexiter Andrew Bridgen, one of the most hardline opponents of Theresa May\u2019s deal, said \u201cnothing has changed\u201d as he left the meeting where she was addressing backbenchers after about five minutes, the Press Association reports. Here is the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth on what Theresa May has been telling Tory MPs in a private meeting this morning. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about the publication of the attorney general\u2019s advice. In the Brexit committee John Whittingdale, the Tory former culture secretary and a leading Brexiter, said he thought the final paragraph of the attorney general\u2019s opinion (see 11.12am) was \u201cpretty terminal\u201d. France\u2019s Europe minister has said the deal Theresa May will present to the Commons this evening is \u201cthe best Brexit solution\u201d. Nathalie Loiseau tweeted that the EU had \u201cprovided all the necessary clarifications. It is now up to the UK: a soft exit, or a brutal divorce.\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, called the crunch vote \u201cthe last chance to avoid a no-deal\u201d. George Ciamba, the European affairs minister of Romania, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said that while the EU should \u201cnot pre-judge the outcome of the vote\u201d, a disorderly exit would be \u201cthe worst scenario\u201d. These are from my colleague Jessica Elgot on whether Labour MPs will vote with the government tonight. The publication of Geoffrey Cox\u2019s new legal advice may turn out to be a decisive moment in this saga. In the light of what he has said, it is very hard to see the Tory European Research Group and the DUP deciding to vote with the government tonight. If they remain opposed, Theresa May will be heading for defeat by a three-figure majority. This could mean that the prospects of May ever getting her deal, or at least a version of it, through parliament are vanishing. This could be a moment that provides a clear shove towards a softer Brexit, or no deal. It is rare for ministers - and Cox is not even a proper member of the cabinet, although he does attend - to issue pronouncements with quite this impact. Others in his position might have been tempted to modify their views in the interests of helping the PM. But, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Cox explained why that did not appeal to him. He explained: I have been a barrister for 36 years, and a senior politician for seven months. My professional reputation is far more important to me than my reputation as a politician. If the risk of being trapped in the backstop had not been removed, then I would make it as clear and plain and in exactly the same way as I did on November 13. This is from Owen Paterson, the former cabinet minister and a leading member of the European Research Group. This is from Sunday Business\u2019s Hugh O\u2019Connell. In the Brexit committee Hilary Benn, the Labour chair, asks Barclay to confirm that the new deal does not eliminate the risk of the UK being trapped in the backstop. Barclay says what is important is the interplay of different parts of the deal. The pound has fallen following the publication of Geoffrey Cox\u2019s legal advice, Bloomberg reports. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. There is a live feed here. Here is the full text of Geoffrey Cox\u2019s new legal advice. And Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter and ERG vice-chair, does not seem to be warming to May\u2019s deal, the Scotsman\u2019s Paris Gourtsoyannis reports. But the Tory Brexiter John Redwood sounds as if he is still in the no column. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, won\u2019t say how he will vote tonight, the Mail\u2019s Jason Groves reports. Speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, joked of his late evening talks with the British prime minister: Allow me to tell you a secret: I didn\u2019t sleep much because of Mrs May last night. He added: \u201cLast night we reached an agreement with the British government about the conditions and consequences of Brexit.\u201d And what I said last night that it was a second chance but there wouldn\u2019t be a third. So I hope very much that the members of the parliament of the UK today support the approach that has been adopted and adopt the agreed text representing the agreement that has been reached. Germany\u2019s EU minister, Michael Roth, called on MPs to back the deal when it comes before the Commons on Tuesday evening. \u201cWe welcome the agreement last night,\u201d Roth told reporters before a meeting in Bucharest. This is a far-reaching compromise for the European Union. It is utmost important [to maintain] the integrity of the single market and [have] no new border between Norther Ireland and Ireland. I very much hope the House of Commons will adopt the deal because I don\u2019t see further chances of negotiations ... Everyone should take the responsibility which is necessary for the United Kingdom and the EU27. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, tweeted: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has published his legal advice (pdf) on the assurances obtained by Theresa May. Here is his conclusion. In my letter of 13 November 2018, I advised that the protocol [ie, the backstop] would endure indefinitely in international law and could not be brought to an end in the absence of a subsequent agreement. This would remain the case even if parties were still negotiating many years later, and even if the parties believed that talks have clearly broken down and there was no prospect of a future relationship agreement. I also advised that in the specific case that situation was due to the EU\u2019s want of good faith and best endeavours, because of the difficulties of proof and the egregious nature of the conduct that would be required to establish a breach by the EU of those obligations, it would be highly unlikely that the United Kingdom could take advantage of the remedies available to it for such a breach under the withdrawal agreement. I now consider that the legally binding provisions of the joint instrument and the content of the unilateral declaration reduce the risk that the United Kingdom could be indefinitely and involuntarily detained within the protocol\u2019s provisions at least in so far as that situation had been brought about by the bad faith or want of best endeavours of the EU. It may be thought that if both parties deploy a sincere desire to reach agreement and the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill implied by the amplified duties set out in the joint instrument, it is highly unlikely that a satisfactory subsequent agreement to replace the protocol will not be concluded. But as I have previously advised, that is a political judgment, which, given the mutual incentives of the parties and the available options and competing risks, I remain strongly of the view it is right to make. However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the protocol\u2019s arrangements, save by agreement. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and ERG chair, said earlier that his assessment of the value of what Theresa May secured last night would depend to a large extent on the value of the unilateral declaration obtained by the government. (See 8.49am.) Here are two legal views. From Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex From Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU\u2019s legal service And, if you\u2019re really committed, Holger Hestermeyer, a reader in international dispute resolution at King\u2019s College London, has a Twitter thread exploring the different types of unilateral declaration. (Warning - not for the faint-hearted.) Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will give a statement to MPs, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has confirmed. This will happen at 12.30pm unless there is an urgent question, which would come first. Nick Boles, a Conservative MP committed to avoiding a hard Brexit, has used a Twitter thread to deliver an ultimatum to his Brexiter colleagues. Theresa May is planning to address Tory MPs at 11.30am, the Times\u2019 Sam Coates reports. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and one of the MPs pushing for a second referendum, has issued this statement through the People\u2019s Vote campaign saying he does not believe the concessions obtained by May will allow the UK to unilaterally leave the backstop. He said: I have had the chance to look at the document produced last night and I\u2019m quite clear in my mind it does not allow the UK to terminate the backstop in the event of a breakdown in negotiation; it does not allow the UK to terminate the backstop at a time of its own choosing. The advice issued today from Lord Anderson, Jason Coppel and Sean Aughey [see 9.44am] reinforces my view. In parliament today I will continue to argue that the agreement does not bear any relationship to what we were offered in the last referendum of 2016. It is significantly different and therefore it should go back to the people \u2013 they have a right to vote on this and decide whether to go ahead. This is from David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, who voted against the deal last time. Last night Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, said that the EU would not be willing to offer the UK a better deal. He said: In politics, sometimes you get a second chance. It is what we do with the second chance that counts. Because there will be no third chance. There will be no further interpretation of the interpretations and no further assurances on the reassurances. But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and ERG chair, has said \u201cthere must be a chance\u201d of a further renegotiation with the EU. He said: I would never take the EU saying \u2018there will be no change\u2019 at face value, because they said there would be no second round, and there has been. Ultimately it has to be decided by the council of ministers. So I think this is closer to the deal, but if the prime minister was to ask for more, there must be a chance, yes. He also said the ERG would be meeting at 6pm to decide how it would vote. I don\u2019t operate on gut feeling. We\u2019ve got to decide legally whether this works or not. We\u2019re [the ERG] a very collegiate body. We\u2019re not like the government, where the prime minister decides and then the whips go out and tell people what to do. We\u2019ll have a meeting at 6 o\u2019clock and we will debate the issues surrounding this. I think on this issue, in reality, MPs will make up their own minds. Leave Means Leave, which favours a very hard Brexit, has dismissed the concessions obtained by May. In a statement its vice-chair, Richard Tice, said: The new documents agreed by the prime minister and Mr Juncker should be ignored. Exit is NOT unilateral nor effective: the UK would have to prove bad faith (which is almost impossible) and convince an arbitration panel of EU folk, still subject to ECJ [European court of justice], in order to leave. The prime minister is conning us all. This agreement still means Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of UK. This is still the worst deal in history, MPs should vote this terrible deal down, believe in Britain and Let\u2019s Go WTO [World Trade Organization]. The DUP are also sympathetic to calls for tonight\u2019s vote to be delayed, to allow MPs more time to study the concessions (see 9.24am), the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Here is the full text (pdf) of the People\u2019s Vote legal opinion mentioned earlier. (See 9.44am.) The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a second referendum, has this morning released an 11-page legal opinion (pdf) saying the changes secured by May would not allow the UK to leave the backstop unilaterally. It has been drafted by Lord Anderson QC, Jason Coppel QC and Sean Aughey. People\u2019s Vote says their views should carry more weight than that of the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, because all three are experts in EU and international law, unlike Cox who specialised in commercial law before he joined the government. Here is their summary. In our opinion these measures: a. do not allow the UK to terminate the backstop in the event that negotiations over its future relationship with the EU cannot be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and b. do not provide the UK with a right to terminate the backstop at a time of its choosing, or indeed at any time, without the agreement of the EU. The furthest they go is to reiterate the possibility that the backstop might be suspended in extreme circumstances of bad faith on the part of the EU which are highly unlikely to be demonstrated. This was already apparent from the withdrawal agreement, and had been acknowledged in the attorney general\u2019s previous legal advice. Looking at the measures individually: a. The joint EU-UK instrument relating to the withdrawal agreement reduces the risk that the UK could be deliberately, and in bad faith, held in the backstop indefinitely. That was only ever a very limited risk. The far greater risk of being held in the backstop indefinitely as a result of the failure of good faith negotiations remains unmitigated. b. The UK\u2019s unilateral declaration goes beyond the joint instrument only in suggesting that the UK might seek to disapply the backstop as a whole if negotiations had failed because of bad faith on the part of the EU. It does not suggest that there are any circumstances other than proven bad faith in which the backstop might be disapplied. Whether or not the UK\u2019s understanding of the withdrawal agreement is correct will be a matter for the Court of Justice of the EU, which is likely to be sceptical not least because the UK\u2019s declaration goes beyond the terms of the joint instrument. c. The joint EU-UK statement supplementing the political declaration has no effect whatsoever on the withdrawal agreement but merely explains certain of the parties\u2019 aspirations for the future negotiations and the future relationship. Taken as a whole, these measures do not come close to meeting the [European Research Group\u2019s] test of clearly worded, \u201ctreaty level\u201d provisions which unambiguously override the stipulation of the withdrawal agreement that the backstop shall remain unless and until the UK and the EU agree otherwise. It is crystal clear that the measures do not alter the fundamental legal effect of the backstop, as previously and correctly explained by the attorney general. The backstop will endure indefinitely, unless and until superseded by another agreement, save in the extreme and unlikely event that in future negotiations the EU acts in bad faith in rejecting the UK\u2019s demands. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The government motion that MPs will vote on tonight (which is on the order paper [pdf], starting on page 6) asks MPs to approve five documents. The first two are the ones that were agreed at the end of last year - the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration. But then there are three others - agreed last night. They are: (3) the legally binding joint instrument titled \u2018Instrument relating to the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community\u2019, which reduces the risk the UK could be deliberately held in the Northern Ireland backstop indefinitely and commits the UK and the EU to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020; This runs to five pages, and the full text is here (pdf) (4) the unilateral declaration by the UK titled \u2018Declaration by Her Majesty\u2019s Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the Northern Ireland Protocol\u2019, setting out the sovereign action the UK would take to provide assurance that the backstop would only be applied temporarily; This just runs to three paragraphs and the full text is here (pdf). (5) the supplement to the framework for the future relationship titled \u2018Joint Statement supplementing the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\u2019, setting out commitments by the UK and the EU to expedite the negotiation and bringing into force of their future relationship. This runs to three pages, and the full text is here (pdf). In addition, the EU released two other documents last night - a statement to the European commission explaining what had been agreed (pdf) and a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, to Donald Tusk, president of the European council (pdf) explaining the agreement and - crucially - saying that if the UK does not take part in the European elections, it must be out of the EU by 23 May. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has pronounced. It is only one word (so far) and, in keeping with his habit of making codpiece jokes at the despatch box, it involves a reference to genitalia. But he was not referring to the deal. He was responding to this tweet, from the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow. Leo Varadkar has described last night\u2019s agreement between Theresa May and Juncker as \u201cpositive\u201d. Ireland\u2019s prime minister who had to cancel a trip to Washington to convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting at 7pm last night said the agreement was \u201clegally binding\u201d, \u201ccomplementary to the withdrawal agreement\u201d and did not undermine the Irish border backstop. Here are the main points from his televised statement a few minutes ago. Varadkar welcomed what was agreed last night and urged MPs to vote for the deal. He said: In the context of tonight\u2019s vote in Westminster, the outcome of yesterday\u2019s meeting with Prime Minister May and President Juncker is positive. I hope and trust the withdrawal agreement will now be endorsed by the House of Commons. He said the withdrawal agreement had not been reopened and the backstop had not been undermined. He said: [These] documents are complementary to the withdrawal agreement and political declaration and aim to provide an additional layer of interpretation, clarification and elaboration to the United Kingdom ahead of a further vote in Westminster ... In discussions with the UK, the government has worked hand in hand with our EU partners\u2019 institutions, including the commission and the taskforce led by Michel Barnier. In that work we have insisted that the withdrawal agreement could not be re-written and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until its replaced by future arrangements that achieve the same objective, namely there will be no hard border. However we\u2019ve also said we would be prepared to offer guarantees and further assurances to the UK of our good faith and intentions. Indeed we\u2019ve offered such reassurances on many occasions, the instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. It does not re open the withdrawal agreement or undermine the backstop or its application. It says we will work together in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures the objectives of the protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border are met. He said the EU was committed to exploring alternatives to the backstop. He said: We are also committed to exploring alternatives in a timely way in the event that the overall future relationship cannot be concluded in a satisfactory and a timely manner. But it does not call into question that the backstop will apply unless and until better arrangements are agreed, with all parties in good faith and best endeavours to that aim. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who chairs the European Research Group, which represents up to 80 Tories pushing for a harder Brexit, is on the Today programme now. Q: What is your reaction to the deal? Rees-Mogg says he is waiting to see. A group of lawyers set up by the ERG (the so-called Star Chamber) will examine it at 9am. And Geoffrey Cox\u2019s advice will be important too. He says the key thing is that the UK can get out of the backstop. Q: Are you disposed to look at this favourably? Rees-Mogg says he is a Conservative. He is always disposed to be favourable to a Conservative government. He says he is not sure that the agreements with the EU make a big difference. That is why he wants to know if the unilateral declaration from the UK is really unilateral. And he says he will be very interested in what the DUP says. Q: Can you vote for it tonight? Rees-Mogg suggests if the unilateral declaration is genuinely unilateral, then he could. But he says it will depend what the DUP and the star chamber will say. He stresses that he is not a lawyer. And, repeating the point made by Iain Duncan Smith earlier (see 7.18am), he says it would be better to delay tonight\u2019s vote to allow MPs time to look at the new documents in detail. This is from Sky\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway. Q: A general election is a real possibility, isn\u2019t it? Gove says he does not accept that. And that\u2019s it. He has finished. Today\u2019s John Humphrys puts it to Gove that Varadkar said the withdrawal agreement remained unchanged. Gove says its terms remain unchanged. But there has been an addition. Chapter one of a book may be unchanged, but chapter two may change the story, he says. Q: Do you know as a fact that the attorney general shares your view on this? Gove says he does not know what the attorney general\u2019s legal advice will say. Q: Will Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, appear before MPs? Gove says that\u2019s a matter for the speaker, but there are ways of ensuring he can be made to appear, he says (ie, an urgent question). Gove implies Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will takes questions on the deal in the Commons later. The Today programme interrupts the interview to broadcast a statement from Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM. Varadkar says the outcome last night was \u201cpositive\u201d. He says he hopes MPs will vote for the deal now. He says Ireland insisted that the backstop would have to apply until replaced by new arrangements to avoid a hard border. But the EU always said it did not want the backstop to be permanent. The assurances offered last night underline that, he says. He says the EU is also committed to exploring alternatives in a timely way. Gove says May has not failed. She has succeeded in doing what she set out to do. Q: What happens if MPs vote to extend article 50 later this week? What is the plan B? Gove says if people choose not to support \u201cthe enhanced withdrawal agreement\u201d, and if they vote against no deal, there will be \u201ca lengthy period of uncertainty\u201d. He says the EU may agree to an article 50 extension. But it may impose conditions, and we do not know what those conditions could be. Gove says, if MPs vote to extend article 50, the EU could impose conditions. Gove says if the UK were kept in the backstop the UK would have unfettered access to EU markets. But EU nationals would not be free to come to the UK. EU fishermen would not have access to UK waters. But UK fishermen would be able to sell their fish to the EU. This would be \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d for the EU, he says. Gove says, if MPs do not back this deal, then the UK could end up leaving without a deal. Q: So why the rush? Iain Duncan Smith says you should wait. (See 7.18am.) Gove says it is \u201cmake your mind up time\u201d now for MPs. He says the government has made the changes demanded by MPs to the backstop. And MPs wanted alternative arrangements, to ensure the backstop is not needed. The government has secured an agreement that the EU will work on this. Q: Will Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, says this is legally binding? It is legally binding, Gove says. Q: Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, told this programme earlier this was not legally binding. Gove says no one is denying that the new interpretive instrument has equal legal standing to the withdrawal agreement. Q: But the withdrawal agreement remains in place. Gove says it is clearer than every before that, if the EU were to act in bad faith, the UK could prove that in court, and it would be free. Q: The new agreement \u201creduces the risk\u201d of the UK being trapped in the backstop. It does not remove it, does it? Gove says, if the EU tried to keep the UK in the backstop, the UK could use international law to extricate itself. Q: Only if the EU were acting in bad faith? Gove says this is an improvement on what was on offer in January. As in any contract, if one side (the EU) acts in a way not in accordance with its obligations, the other side (the UK) can go to court and win. And he says the EU has not objected to the UK\u2019s unilateral declaration. That means it has standing, he says. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and the most senior Brexiter in cabinet, is being interviewed on the Today programme. Q: Will there definitely be a vote tonight? Yes, says Gove. (Which sounds definite - although the last time he promised on the Today programme a vote would go ahead, it was later pulled.) Gove says government is rejecting calls for Brexit vote to be delayed. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. In what is going to be of intense drama, and news overload, it is always helpful to step back and think about what are the big issue that are going to get resolved today. Here are three. 1 - How many MPs will Theresa May win over with the concessions she won last night? Some 118 Tories voted against her deal in the first meaningful vote in January. Many of them, worried by the prospect of Brexit being \u201cstolen\u201d by the second referendum campaign, seem to be keen to find reasons why they can be persuaded to vote for her deal now. There don\u2019t seem to be any Westminster observers who expect May to win the vote tonight (assuming it is not delayed for 24 hours, as Iain Duncan Smith said it should be, to give everyone more time to read the new documents), but she could lose by a lot less than the record 230-vote government defeat we saw in January. 2 - Will May do well enough to persuade MPs, and the EU, that she has a chance of getting her deal over the line in a third meaningful vote? It is impossible to know for sure what the benchmark will be, not least a figure that might look potentially disappointing now (a defeat by 100-odd votes) could, by 7pm, look rather different, because context and expectations will have changed. But if May only loses by 50 (implying she would only need to change the minds of 25 MPs in a third vote), that will probably feel like a very good result. And it is hard to see how she will spin a defeat by 150 or more as anything other than another disaster. 3 - Will May retain the initiative, or will parliament start to take control? If May loses tonight, MPs are expected to vote later this week to extend article 50. Some MPs want to use this as the start of a process that will see them finding a Commons majority for a softer Brexit. May, of course, wants to head them off by getting her deal through. This issue won\u2019t be resolved by the end of today, but we may have a better idea as to whether parliament, or the prime minister, is getting the upper hand. ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston predicts that May\u2019s deal will be voted down by another big margin because she has failed to secure guarantees on the backstop. Writing on Facebook he says: That means too few Tory Brexiter MPs will change their mind that her form of Brexit is a pact with the EU that no proudly independent nation could ever sign. Even Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP MPs, who are desperate to cease their opposition to the PM\u2019s deal and really want to back the PM at the last, will struggle to justify doing so. Which means I can see no route to victory for her and meaningful vote tonight - which I would expect her to lose by another significant margin. If so, she would face decisions of moment for all of us and for herself. Would she work with parliament to take a no-deal Brexit off the table - or stick to her own official policy and work against MPs who want a different Brexit or even no Brexit at all? And would she take this latest and perhaps greatest diplomatic and political humiliation on the chin, as she has so many others, and battle on. Or could she decide that she has done what she can to execute the revealed will of the British people to leave the EU, against the constant opposition of MPs from all sides, and it may now be time for another prime minister to finish the job. Starmer added: \u201cAs people read through this document they are going to say \u2018look in reality it hasn\u2019t really changed anything\u2019. He said the changes that the prime minister claimed to have secured were already in the withdrawal agreement. And he likened the unilateral agreement on the backstop to an individual\u2019s own interpretation of their household insurance policy. Starmer said: Everything is now going to rest, I think, on the attorney general, who is going to give his advice this morning. If he concludes there isn\u2019t significant change I really don\u2019t see that there is a basis for him to change his advice.\u201d He needs to make a statement in the House of Commons so that he can then face questions so we can all quiz him. Starmer was asked whether Labour would back the deal if Cox said legal assurances had been secured on the backstop. He didn\u2019t give a straight answer. In statement Starmer has set out why he thinks the agreement remains unchanged: Shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is doing the rounds of broadcast interviews to argue nothing much has changed. Speaking on Today, Starmer called on Geoffrey Cox to make a statement in parliament about what he now makes of the deal. He said Cox\u2019s advice would be \u201ccentral\u201d. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve says he\u2019ll be voting against. Polling guru John Curtice of Strathclyde University has been analysing the potential public response to May\u2019s deal changes announced overnight. He told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme: When you look at public opinion and ask people what they most want it\u2019s either leaving without a deal or having another referendum. The public is polarised. One of the problems our politicians are facing is they try to make these attempts of coming up with a compromise that would satisfy the majority, but the centre ground on the Brexit issue is very thinly populated. The risk with all these compromises is that they end up looking friendless. Stating that it is now highly unlikely that the UK will leave the EU at the end of March, he said that a longer extension was not popular with the public. If the aim is the so-called technical extension, the public would accept it, however what\u2019s also being discussed is if she cannot get a deal through and a majority of the public though not the majority of leave voters don\u2019t want to leave without a deal, so therefore they\u2019ll want the extension. But the kind of extension the EU potentially has in mind is rather a long one and so far the polls suggest the public aren\u2019t minded to back the idea of us still being in the EU at the end of 2020. Asked what the results of a second EU referendum might be, Curtice said: Would a very close to call. On average across the UK at as a whole it\u2019s 53% for remain 47% for leave but much of the movement since 2016 comes from the views of those who did not vote in 2016. They are 2 to 1 in favour of remain but there\u2019s very little evidence that leave voters have switched so the question is whether these voters who didn\u2019t vote in 2016 would turn out this time. Jeremy Corbyn is urging MPs to reject the deal claiming that May\u2019s efforts to renegotiate her deal have failed. Duncan Smith said the ERG\u2019s legal team were combing through the new assurances agreed last night to see whether or not the words of the document match the words from the statement. He told Today: If these assurances are correct then it does get to deal with this over arching issue of the backstop. It is important because separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom is a political no-no for anyone who believes in the union. If the EU still has the possibility of keeping us in a backstop, basically as rule takers, without having any say in it whilst paying money, then that means they control all of the negotiation and it means we will be served up what they want and we won\u2019t be able to negotiate. If, however, it is correct that this backstop is now both temporary and we can leave it at the moment of our choosing, then that means we become a balanced partner in the negotiation. And that is how critical this really is. This is very technical and we need to know, first and foremost what the attorney general\u2019s view [is]. Does it changes his opinion? And we would like to see him at the dispatch box because he needs to be cross examined by members of parliament. Former Tory leader and leading Brexiter, Iain Duncan Smith, says individual MPs will have to make their own decisions about how to vote after listening to the legal advice. Speaking to the Today programme he called for a 24-hour delay in the meaningful vote to have time to digest the deal and cross examine the attorney general Geoffrey Cox in the Commons. The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, is urging MPs to back the deal. Former minister Sam Gyimah, who resigned over Brexit, isn\u2019t going to back it. Brexiter backbencher, Nadine Dorries, is waiting for guidance from the attorney general and the ERG legal team but she now appears minded to support the deal. She tweets: \u201cI am really hopeful that when the text has been scrutinised that it may just take us over the line A good deal has always been better than a bad deal.\u201d Former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd has written a piece for the Guardian in which he argues that the idea the Commonwealth can save Brexit Britain is the \u201cnuttiest of nutty arguments\u201d. If Britain proceeds with giving effect to what future historians will legitimately describe as the longest suicide note in history by leaving the union, the cold, hard reality is that the mathematics simply don\u2019t stack up in terms of credible economic alternatives to Europe. Much as any Australian, Canadian and New Zealand governments of whichever persuasion would do whatever they could to frame new free-trade agreements with the UK, the bottom line is that 65 million of us do not come within a bull\u2019s roar of Britain\u2019s adjacent market of 450 million Europeans. As for India, good luck! India\u2019s trade and commerce bureaucracy is the most mercantilist and outright protectionist in the world. They virtually single-handedly sank the Doha round in 2009. In the same year, as prime minister of Australia, I launched a free-trade negotiation with Delhi. But a decade later, those negotiations remain at a standstill. The Australian economy is only 50% the size of Britain\u2019s. A substantive India-UK FTA is the ultimate mirage constructed by the Brexiteers. It\u2019s as credible as the ad they plastered on the side of that big red bus about the \u00a3350m Britain was allegedly paying to Brussels each week. Not. So as a former chair of the Commonwealth ministerial action group, it\u2019s my melancholy duty to report that the idea the old (or for that matter newer) Commonwealth could possibly substitute for Britain\u2019s current economic arrangements with Brussels is an illusion. Full story is here. Conservative MP for Windsor Adam Afriyie has been reading the new EU withdrawal documents this morning, and he seems unimpressed. If you would like to read the changes that have been made to the Brexit withdrawal agreement (because what else are you going to read while eating your Cornflakes on a Tuesday morning?), you can see them here: The Independent Group of MPs has responded to the Brexit motion to be debated today. What happens this week? Theresa May will bring her Brexit deal back to parliament for MPs to be given the chance to accept or reject it in the so-called meaningful vote two. After the government\u2019s historic defeat by 230 votes on 15 January, the prime minister promised to hold cross-party meetings \u201cto identify what would be required to secure the backing of the house\u201d. She has since announced \u00a31.6bn for a towns fund in the hope of winning over Labour MPs from leave-voting areas, and new promises on workers\u2019 rights, including the opportunity to vote on new EU directives on the labour market. Most of the government\u2019s focus, however, has been on trying to persuade the EU27 to provide \u201clegally binding guarantees\u201d on the Irish backstop. On Monday night the government said it had secured those changes. What happens if May loses the vote? It depends how badly. Defeat by a narrow margin, of fewer than say 50 votes, could allow her to have another go in a third meaningful vote. Received wisdom in Westminster is that a loss by more than about 50 votes would be a catastrophe, because it suggests May\u2019s deal is irretrievably unpopular. In that case, she could come under intense pressure from former remainers, from cabinet downwards, to let parliament decide on the next steps \u2013 by which they mean seek a softer Brexit. Under Conservative party rules May cannot be challenged until December, but she could decide she has finally run out of road and step aside. Might we still get a public vote of some sort? It is possible, particularly if there is a long-ish extension to article 50, giving advocates of a referendum time to rally support in parliament. As it stands, it appears unlikely there would be a majority for the idea, with around 10 Conservative MPs willing to support it, and up to 30 Labour MPs willing to defy the whip to vote against. So should we start stockpiling? Not quite yet. It is highly likely that if May\u2019s deal is voted down again, MPs will agree a delay to Brexit this week. The EU27 are likely to follow suit, provided they are able to see some way ahead by which a majority in parliament could be found. Any extension of article 50, particularly a short one, would only set up another cliff-edge a few weeks or months ahead. Some ministers believe that could finally be the thing that brings Brexiters into line behind May\u2019s deal. If not, a so-called \u201cno-deal by accident\u201d remains a serious risk. Heather Stewart\u2019s full guide to the week ahead is here. The news that May had reached an agreement in Strasbourg came late, with some papers featuring older Brexit stories on the front pages of their first edition papers, or splashing on the latest news from the Ethiopian Airlines clash, before updating to the more recent Brexit news for later editions. The papers variously covered the news with scepticism and triumphalism. The Express echoed May\u2019s order to MPs: \u201cNow get behind this deal and let\u2019s unite Britain\u201d, several papers, including the Guardian (\u201cMay secures \u2018improved\u2019 deal - but will it be enough?\u201d) asked whether the 11th-hour manoeuvring will be enough to win over her anti-Europe MPs and convince them to vote for her deal today. And the FT highlighted the last-minute nature of the deal, saying: \u201cAfter days of bruising talks and the near collapse of negotiations on Sunday, Mrs May made a dramatic final effort to win over some of the 100 Conservative Eurosceptic MPs who have threatened to derail her deal and her premiership.\u201d Here\u2019s the full wrap of how the papers covered the news. The prime minister arrived back at Downing Street in the early hours of Tuesday morning after returning from talks with EU leaders Strasbourg. May is expected to chair a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, will publish an update of his legal advice on the deal, in light of the changes on Tuesday morning. The motion will be debated in the Commons in the afternoon, until 7pm. Votes are held in the evening. What have they said about the changes to the deal? Labour \u201cThis evening\u2019s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised Parliament, and whipped her MPs to vote for,\u201d said Jeremy Corbyn last night. \u201cSince her Brexit deal was so overwhelmingly rejected, the prime minister has recklessly run down the clock, failed to effectively negotiate with the EU and refused to find common ground for a deal Parliament could support.\u201d The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, cast doubt on whether the changes would actually be legally binding, saying: \u201cIt sounds again that nothing has changed.\u201d He said: \u201cIf all that\u2019s happening is to turn this letter into an interpretative tool for legal purposes, I remind the house what the prime minister said on 14 January about this letter. DUP The leader of the Democratic Unionist party, Arlene Foster, whose MPs the prime minister relies on to get legislation through parliament, said: \u201cThese publications need careful analysis. We will be taking appropriate advice, scrutinising the text line by line and forming our own judgement.\u201d Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of the Democratic Unionist Party said: \u201cAll of this will need to be taken together and analysed very carefully.\u201d Tory Eurosceptics Steve Baker, an ERG member and former Brexit minister, said the government had put \u201ca very good gloss on something that falls short\u201d. But he later added: \u201cNow we have the outline of what has been agreed, I look forward to the full text and the opinion of the team of lawyers we have set up to advise us \u2026 it\u2019s good to see rising enthusiasm and reference in legal text to the Malthouse compromise.\u201d Good morning, politics-watchers. It\u2019s going to be a big day! Last night, in what the papers variously called a \u201clast-minute\u201d, \u201c11th-hour\u201d, and \u201cdramatic final\u201d effort, Theresa May secured changes to her Brexit deal, which will go before the parliament for a vote today. If it feels like we\u2019ve been round this roundabout before, you\u2019re not crazy. Today\u2019s vote follows the historic defeat of May\u2019s deal by 230 votes in January, which hinged in large part on objections to the backstop. After that defeat, May promised MPs that she would secure a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop, a time-limit or its replacement with an alternative arrangement, such as a technological fix. May declared in Strasbourg that the guarantees she secured from the EU achieves this, gaining the \u201clegally binding changes\u201d parliament wanted to ensure the EU cannot trap the UK in the Irish backstop and a permanent customs union. It is unclear if the motion will pass the House today, with May needing to persuade dozens of hardline Europsceptics in the Conservative and Democratic Unionist party, whose refusal to back the original agreement led to the record Commons in January. If the deal does not pass, MPs will be granted a vote on Wednesday on whether to proceed to a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and another on Thursday on whether to extend article 50. It\u2019s going to be dramatic day.
