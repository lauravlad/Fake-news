I couldn\u2019t believe that what Michael did was a bad thing up until six years ago. So I understand.

They had met briefly as kids but have recently found support from each other as a way of feeling less isolated. They pointed out, for those who might question their motivations, that there was no compensation for appearing in the documentary. \u201cWe can\u2019t change what happened to us,\u201d Wade, now 36, said. \u201cThe feeling is what can we do with that now.\u201d They\u2019ve both received death threats from Jackson fans, who today have flooded Twitter with attempts to discredit the pair. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s really hard for them to believe because, in a way, not that long ago, I was in the same position they were in,\u201d Wade said. \u201cEven though it happened to me, I still couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t believe that what Michael did was a bad thing up until six years ago. So I understand. We can only accept and understand something when we\u2019re ready, and maybe we\u2019ll never be ready. Maybe we will. So that\u2019s their journey.\u201d Leaving Neverland will air on HBO and Channel 4 later this year",

      "bodyText": "A backbench plan to ward off a no-deal Brexit by extending article 50 is in the balance amid concerns from Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, who fear it could be seen as an attempt to frustrate Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. It appears likely that the Labour front bench will support the amendment to the government\u2019s Brexit deal tabled by Yvette Cooper. Cooper\u2019s amendment has already won the backing of more than 70 cross-party MPs, among them a number of Conservatives. This month an earlier Cooper amendment to restrict the chances of no deal was passed with the support of 20 Conservatives, However, while just three Labour MPs went against the party line in that vote, there is speculation that more could rebel on Tuesday. The new amendment, which seems likely to be among those selected for a vote, would guarantee parliamentary time for a private members\u2019 bill drafted by Cooper that would extend article 50 to the end of 2019 if Theresa May failed to secure a deal by late February. Some Labour MPs representing seats that voted leave in the 2016 referendum have warned that the plan could appear to be endlessly extending the Brexit process for no reason. Labour sources said some MPs \u2013 over and above the half a dozen or so who have voted with the government on May\u2019s Brexit plan \u2013 had come to the whips\u2019 office to express reservations about the Cooper amendment. Some are concerned that it could be used to pave the way for a second referendum, and they are expected to study the amendment over the weekend before coming to a final position. Lisa Nandy, who represents Wigan, where 64% voted leave in 2016, said she would back an extension of article 50 if there was a clear justification, such as the idea of a citizens\u2019 assembly, which she supports, but was otherwise wary. Nandy said: \u201cWithout a clear reason, people will understandably think we\u2019re just kicking this into the long grass and the ongoing chaos is making it impossible for local businesses.\u201d Another obstacle would be what to do with European elections due to take place in late May if Brexit were delayed beyond then, Nandy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet heard any convincing explanation that would avoid us then having to campaign to re-elect MEPs to a parliament we were supposed to have left months earlier. That just strikes me as completely unsustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I haven\u2019t dismissed the amendment out of hand, as avoiding no deal is clearly important, but there are serious problems with it as it currently stands.\u201d On Friday, Andrea Leadsom became the first leave-backing cabinet minister to acknowledge that the Brexit deadline could be extended beyond 29 March, though only briefly. The leader of the Commons, who is in charge of guiding Brexit legislation through parliament, told BBC\u2019s Newsnight that a short extension was feasible: \u201cI am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something, then that would be feasible.\u201d The parallel issue of a possible second Brexit referendum remains the subject intense debate within Labour, with a senior ally of Jeremy Corbyn warning that it could badly affect the relationship between politicians and the public. Ian Lavery, the MP for Wansbeck and Labour\u2019s national campaigns coordinator, said that while the idea was still possible under party policy as a way to end an otherwise intractable Brexit impasse, he was worried about the consequences. \u201cWe should be in no doubt that asking the voters to vote again on an issue they have already given an answer, until they come up with the right answer, risks serious damage to the relationship between many citizens and politicians at Westminster,\u201d he wrote in an article for the Guardian. Earlier in the week, a planned cross-party amendment for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d was dropped by its organisers, who said the lack of explicit Labour front-bench backing meant it was unlikely to pass. However, the Commons order paper for Tuesday\u2019s crucial series of votes on the next stages for Brexit now features three new amendments tabled by Labour MPs seeking the same. On Saturday, campaigners from the People\u2019s Vote campaign were promising to hold events in about 100 places across the UK to maintain the pressure for a second referendum.",

Scullion announced his decision on Australia Day, while the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was addressing the national citizenship ceremony in Canberra. Scullion was elected senator for the Northern Territory in 2001 and was the leader of the National party in the Senate. He has been a cabinet minister and the minister for Indigenous affairs since 2013, holding the position under the Abbott, Turnbull, and Morrison governments, and was minister for community services for the last year of the Howard government. In a statement, Scullion thanked Morrison and the deputy prime minister, Nationals leader Michael McCormack, for asking him to stay on as Indigenous affairs minister until the election was called. \u201cIt has been my privilege to have served as the minister for Indigenous affairs over the last five years,\u201d he said. \u201cI am grateful that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have welcomed me in every corner of this continent that I have visited, and worked with me in providing local and national solutions.\u201d The announcement comes one week after the shock resignation of senior Liberal frontbencher Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, who said she was quitting politics for the \u201cvery personal reasons\u201d of wanting to spend time with her two young children and to try for a third. Her seat of Higgins in inner-city Melbourne covers an area that swung heavily to Labor in the November state election. The human services minister, Michael Keenan, announced his resignation on Friday, saying he would not recontest his seat of Stirling in Western Australia, which he has held since 2004. \u201cI have always worked hard as a member of parliament and as a minister, but after doing this for 15 years, I cannot commit to another term,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cOver the Christmas break, it became very clear to me personally that times have changed and that this decision was the right one for my family and myself.\u201d Keenan said he has been \u201can absent father\u201d and with a fourth child \u2013 a newborn \u2013 it was \u201cunworkable\u201d for his family. \u201cWhilst politics is a proud vocation, it is also difficult and exhausting business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressures on family life are formidable, as are the constant rigours of being an effective member of parliament, as well as a minister in the government.\u201d Keenan has previously held the justice and counter-terrorism portfolios.

      "bodyText": "Jos Buttler described England\u2019s hopes of one day topping the world rankings as having been given a reality check during the first Test in Barbados. Speaking after the wicketless third day, during which Jason Holder powered his way to a dominant double century from No 8, the England vice-captain accepted the team selection was \u201cpotentially\u201d wrong in hindsight. But as well as praising the bowlers for their efforts, Buttler insisted the blame for England\u2019s current predicament lies squarely at the feet of a batting unit that collapsed to 77 all out on day two and leaves them staring at defeat. \u201cYesterday was a poor reflection on us as a side,\u201d said Buttler. \u201cTo get to No 1 in the world that\u2019s nowhere near good enough. It\u2019s a good reality check as a side, in terms of where we are at.\u201d Holder\u2019s unbeaten 202 in an unbroken stand of 295 with his fellow Bajan and close friend, Shane Dowrich (116 not out), represented his career highlight to date and there was a touching moment after the close when he was embraced by his mother, Denise, in the stands. Holder said: \u201cIt was a very pleasing day \u2013 best days I\u2019ve had in Test cricket. To top it off would be 10 wickets, make sure we start this series with victory over England. \u201c[The plan was] to grind them down \u2013 there is lots of time left and for us it was to keep them there in the heat and on their legs \u2013 credit to us.\u201d During his four years as captain Holder has wrestled for authority over a West Indies side that has struggled results-wise and been dogged by regional politics. But now, amid a golden run of form with bat and ball, his mandate has never been stronger. Holder added: \u201cIt was a slow start to my career and very tough at first as well. It was about just finding a way to understand the dynamics of Test career. \u201c[Former captain] Clive Lloyd is someone I hold in high regard and he always said it took him three years to learn Test cricket. \u201cTo get the performances in now that I am is very pleasing. I just want to keep pressing forward for this West Indies team.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Richard Nixon once said there can be no whitewash at the White House. But it would be fair to say there is now a white flag. It was metaphorically waved by Donald Trump in a chilly yet sunny Rose Garden on Friday when he declared an end to the partial government shutdown after 35 tortuous days. The US president did not get his wall. All those federal government workers missing pay cheques and queueing at food banks, also those long lines at airports and fears over passenger safety, all that rubbish piling up in national parks, all the political pain inflicted on Trump and Republicans was for nothing. He wanted $5.7bn and he got $0. So why cave now? There are three likely reasons. First, there was the political pressure. Asked how he went bankrupt, a character in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises answers: \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201d The bad news built gradually over Christmas and the new year, then suddenly on Friday as a shortage of air traffic controllers caused significant flight delays and I-regret-voting-for-Trump interviews reached a crescendo.

The day began with the potentially catastrophic arrest of his longtime adviser Roger Stone as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia. How better to knock Stone out of the headlines than by ending the longest government shutdown in American history.

The same principle applies in every form of work where human beings immerse themselves in what they do, not least in the simple business of writing. So it was with Hugh McIlvanney, who died on Thursday aged 84, who remains the most distinct, widely cherished sportswriter Britain has produced and whose work was always marked by such a powerful sense of character, place and a vivid internal life. As a reader it was this quality that stood out. McIlvanney rarely if ever wrote about himself. But you felt you knew him all the same, maintaining a quiet intimacy with that sandpapery wit and warm, challenging presence, expressed through a language of sportswriting McIlvanney himself helped to coin.

No doubt many will look back now on YouTube at the wonderfully narrated documentary The Football Men, a study of those old Lanarkshire greats that communicates above all a love of people and place, the cities and surfaces from which they emerged. At the start of the first episode there is an interlude where the film takes you out to one of the mines and you hear the clank and the rattle and scrape of the machinery, and then you hear the McIlvanney voice, which seems to emerge out of the same cacophony.

      "bodyText": "Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa should be disqualified from his positions as vice-president of Fifa and president of the Asian Football Confederation if Hakeem al-Araibi is returned to Bahrain, the head of the World Players Association has said. Al-Araibi, a Bahraini refugee who has permanent residency in Australia, has spent two months in Thai detention after he was arrested on an erroneously issued Interpol red notice at the request of Bahrain \u2013 the country he fled. Brendan Schwab, executive director of the World Players Association, which represents about 85,000 athletes worldwide, said sport\u2019s relatively recent codification of human rights protections meant al-Araibi\u2019s situation was \u201csimple\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear in our submissions [to Fifa] that there is a proactive duty to act,\u201d Schwab told the Guardian. He said Salman had until 8 February \u2013 the deadline for Bahrain to file its formal extradition papers to a Thai court \u2013 to show he was fit to hold office. \u201cIf not, he should be disqualified and is clearly not qualified to stand for election,\u201d Schwab said. The Thai government has refused to bow to pressure from international governments, human rights groups and world football bodies. Football organisations including Fifa and Football Federation Australia have issued increasingly strongly worded statements calling for Al-Araibi\u2019s release, but they and the AFC have avoided asserting their influence on Salman, a member of the Bahrain royal family and the target of criticism by Al-Araibi in 2016. Al-Araibi believes he was arrested because of his criticism, which came as Salman was campaigning to become Fifa president \u2013 a role he is seeking again in this year\u2019s Fifa election. The World Players Association has written to Salman, but has received no response. Salman has said nothing publicly about Al-Araibi\u2019s case, despite intense lobbying because of the power he holds in football and as a member of the Bahraini royal family. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had, in two months, a statement from Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa,\u201d Schwab said. \u201cThat must surely disqualify him from holding the position he has. \u201cHe\u2019s preventing [the appointment of] someone who could use that position to bring about the outcome that\u2019s needed.\u201d The AFC communications office has repeatedly declined to answer questions or provide a comment from its president, saying only that it is working with Fifa. At an Asian Cup pre-game news conference with the Socceroos on Friday, AFC officials stepped in to shut down questions from the media about Al-Araibi, SBS reported. Schwab said every executive in football, including Fifa president Gianni Infantino, had the same obligations, and they should also face disqualification if nothing was done. Al-Araibi\u2019s detention was a test case for the human rights policies developed and codified across sporting organisations following revelations about the abuse of migrant workers in Qatar. \u201cThe game faces a fork in the road,\u201d Schwab said. \u201cWe\u2019ll either have a situation where Hakeem is saved and the game\u2019s rhetoric and commitments about human rights are meaningful, or we have the horrific alternative that despite these commitments, a player can be subject to the most fundamental human rights abuses, of refoulement.\u201d The football analyst and former Socceroos captain Craig Foster has lobbied intensely for Al-Araibi\u2019s freedom, and on Friday wrote directly to Infantino. In response to a letter from Fifa sent directly to the Thai prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, Foster said it was a \u201cwelcome first step\u201d but more had to be done to fulfil the world governing body\u2019s human rights obligations. \u201cThe circumspection of football politics has contributed in large part to Mr Hakeem\u2019s life and liberty being in imminent danger and it will be no comfort once his immediate future is either spent in a Thai prison, or experiencing a recurrence of the torture in Bahrain that he suffered in 2012, to say that we \u2018tried\u2019,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThis is not a case about extradition. It is about refoulement.\u201d Foster outlined seven actions required as a minimum for Fifa to fulfil its obligations, including having a Fifa official present at al-Araibi\u2019s legal appearances, and threats of sporting sanctions against Bahrain. The Bahraini government last week told the Guardian there was no threat to al-Araibi\u2019s life, that Bahraini trials were \u201cindependent and transparent\u201d, and that claims of prisoner abuse were investigated. The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, said Bahrain\u2019s comments were \u201cabsurd\u201d and multiple reports and investigations had documented \u201cpersistent failures in the Bahrain justice system\u201d, with numerous instances of detainee abuse and torture.",

      "body": "<p>By now, it has become a familiar sight: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r hugging his staff, eyes twinkling, applauding his players and celebrating the return of Manchester United, as we used to know them. Quick, incisive football, willing to take on anyone and, more often that not, coming out on top.</p> \n<p>Solskj\u00e6r has even taken to chewing furiously on his gum, Sir Alex Ferguson-style, with the wrappers scattered round his feet, and at this rate the only possible regret for his club is that they did not tire of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho earlier.</p> \n<p>This was their eighth straight win since Solskj\u00e6r was handed the role on a caretaker basis and the case for him taking over properly is building all the time, particularly now his restorative qualities appear to stretch to Alexis S\u00e1nchez, who scored the opening goal on his return to his former club. A lesser team would have wilted in the face of some concerted pressure from Arsenal, and perhaps Mourinho\u2019s United would have, too. Not the current side, though. Solksj\u00e6r\u2019s team have rejuvenated, epitomised by the transformation of Victor Lindelof in the heart of their defence, Paul Pogba in midfield and assorted others.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/25/fa-cup-fourth-round-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Solskj\u00e6r was once part of the best counterattacking side in English football. He seems to be building the modern team the same way and United\u2019s second and third goals, converted by Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial, were another reminder of the days when Ferguson led the team into battle with Arsenal. So was the moment, late on, when Marcus Rashford clashed with Sead Kolasinac, locking foreheads like two angry stags, and the subsequent melee when Lingard was extremely fortunate to avoid his second yellow card of the night. A coin was thrown from the crowd, though it still felt small-fry compared to the hostilities when these teams used to meet.</p> \n<p>Solskj\u00e6r, of course, will remember the years when it was the biggest occasion in English football. It is a bit different now, with Granit Xhaka against Lingard not quite the same as Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane, and two managers who greeted one another with an embrace, as opposed to the days when a handshake between Ferguson and Ars\u00e9ne Wenger involved no eye contact and only the briefest touch of flesh on flesh. Solskj\u00e6r, in keeping with the modern rivalry, was even gentlemanly enough to instruct Luke Shaw to kick the ball out when Sokratis suffered the knee injury that ended his evening prematurely.</p> \n<p>Apart from the late bust-up, the only flicker of malevolence came on the occasions when Sanchez had the ball and Arsenal\u2019s crowd reminded their former player what they thought of him. Even that, however, lacked real spite, quite possibly because the fans who were making their displeasure voluble must have known enough about the Chilean to realise he might take pleasure in turning down the volume. S\u00e1nchez celebrated his goal with fists raised but did not go in for any shushing gestures. No need to rub it in, after all, when nothing will have hurt his former club more than his goal, wriggling past Petr Cech to score with the kind of skill that has been seen only fleetingly during his year as a United player.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0906f86857d3bc952ff73398bd93e4ddac6b1210\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0906f86857d3bc952ff73398bd93e4ddac6b1210/0_106_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Lingard scores the second goal with a precise finish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Lingard scores the second goal with a precise finish.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Arsenal, that was a devastating period bearing in mind S\u00e1nchez\u2019s goal was followed three minutes later by Lingard scoring from one of their swift counterattacking thrusts. Both times it was Romelu Lukaku with the decisive pass and, for the first one in particular, the striker\u2019s through ball was expertly weighted, completely deceiving the Arsenal defenders.</p> \n<p>Lukaku spent a lot of the night drifting into the space that Kolasinac, Arsenal\u2019s left-back, vacated on his forward forays. It left Arsenal vulnerable on the break and Lingard\u2019s finish, so calm and collected, was a beauty.</p> \n<p>There was no power in Lingard\u2019s shot. No attempt to put his laces through the ball, the old-fashioned way. He simply controlled Lukaku\u2019s pass, opened up his foot and rolled the ball into the bottom corner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"445efc2f-538b-42aa-8838-6f09dbfa5731\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Arsenal</b></p>\n    <p><b>Petr Cech:</b> <b>6&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>A tough night for the man who has become Arsenal's cup keeper in&nbsp;<br>his farewell season.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ainsley Maitland-Niles: 5</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Chosen to play right back in the absence of Beller\u00edn but&nbsp;the lack of positional security showed.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Sokratis Papastathopoulos: 6&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Injured early and clearly frustrated to jar his leg on the way&nbsp;<br>down from an aerial challenge.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p><b>Laurent Koscielny: 6&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Received lengthy treatment after he was battered by an&nbsp;accidental kick the side of his face.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Sead Kolasinac: 6</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>A difficult night with Lukaku making his presence felt down&nbsp;his flank.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Granit Xhaka: 5&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>Not enough protection to the defence from midfield, then ended up&nbsp;<br>at centre-back.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Lucas Torreira: 5&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Struggled to muster his best levels of intensity or influence&nbsp;<br>the game.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Alex Iwobi: 6&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Helped Arsenal to get a goal back but otherwise skittered about to&nbsp;<br>little effect.&nbsp;<b><br></b></p>\n    <p><b>Aaron Ramsey: 8&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Effervescent.

      "bodyText": "By now, it has become a familiar sight: Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r hugging his staff, eyes twinkling, applauding his players and celebrating the return of Manchester United, as we used to know them. Quick, incisive football, willing to take on anyone and, more often that not, coming out on top. Solskj\u00e6r has even taken to chewing furiously on his gum, Sir Alex Ferguson-style, with the wrappers scattered round his feet, and at this rate the only possible regret for his club is that they did not tire of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho earlier. This was their eighth straight win since Solskj\u00e6r was handed the role on a caretaker basis and the case for him taking over properly is building all the time, particularly now his restorative qualities appear to stretch to Alexis S\u00e1nchez, who scored the opening goal on his return to his former club. A lesser team would have wilted in the face of some concerted pressure from Arsenal, and perhaps Mourinho\u2019s United would have, too. Not the current side, though. Solksj\u00e6r\u2019s team have rejuvenated, epitomised by the transformation of Victor Lindelof in the heart of their defence, Paul Pogba in midfield and assorted others. Solskj\u00e6r was once part of the best counterattacking side in English football. He seems to be building the modern team the same way and United\u2019s second and third goals, converted by Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial, were another reminder of the days when Ferguson led the team into battle with Arsenal. So was the moment, late on, when Marcus Rashford clashed with Sead Kolasinac, locking foreheads like two angry stags, and the subsequent melee when Lingard was extremely fortunate to avoid his second yellow card of the night. A coin was thrown from the crowd, though it still felt small-fry compared to the hostilities when these teams used to meet. Solskj\u00e6r, of course, will remember the years when it was the biggest occasion in English football. It is a bit different now, with Granit Xhaka against Lingard not quite the same as Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane, and two managers who greeted one another with an embrace, as opposed to the days when a handshake between Ferguson and Ars\u00e9ne Wenger involved no eye contact and only the briefest touch of flesh on flesh. Solskj\u00e6r, in keeping with the modern rivalry, was even gentlemanly enough to instruct Luke Shaw to kick the ball out when Sokratis suffered the knee injury that ended his evening prematurely. Apart from the late bust-up, the only flicker of malevolence came on the occasions when Sanchez had the ball and Arsenal\u2019s crowd reminded their former player what they thought of him. Even that, however, lacked real spite, quite possibly because the fans who were making their displeasure voluble must have known enough about the Chilean to realise he might take pleasure in turning down the volume. S\u00e1nchez celebrated his goal with fists raised but did not go in for any shushing gestures. No need to rub it in, after all, when nothing will have hurt his former club more than his goal, wriggling past Petr Cech to score with the kind of skill that has been seen only fleetingly during his year as a United player. For Arsenal, that was a devastating period bearing in mind S\u00e1nchez\u2019s goal was followed three minutes later by Lingard scoring from one of their swift counterattacking thrusts. Both times it was Romelu Lukaku with the decisive pass and, for the first one in particular, the striker\u2019s through ball was expertly weighted, completely deceiving the Arsenal defenders. Lukaku spent a lot of the night drifting into the space that Kolasinac, Arsenal\u2019s left-back, vacated on his forward forays. It left Arsenal vulnerable on the break and Lingard\u2019s finish, so calm and collected, was a beauty. There was no power in Lingard\u2019s shot. No attempt to put his laces through the ball, the old-fashioned way. He simply controlled Lukaku\u2019s pass, opened up his foot and rolled the ball into the bottom corner. Two-nil down, Arsenal were in deep trouble but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal, two minutes before half-time, gave the home side a new sense of hope. Aaron Ramsey created the danger in a congested penalty area. As the pass was flicked across the six-yard area, Alexandre Lacazatte could not get a full touch of the ball. Aubameyang was next in line and scored with a simple finish. Arsenal would have been level a minute into the second half had it not been for a superb one-handed save from Sergio Romero to keep out Ramsey\u2019s header and supply more evidence for those who believe David de Gea\u2019s understudy has legitimate credentials to be recognised as the outstanding second-choice goalkeeper in the English game. The tie had ignited and the second half was an absorbing spectacle, interrupted only by the nasty blow suffered by Laurent Koscielny after challenging Lukaku, falling to the ground and accidentally taking his opponent\u2019s studs to the side of his face, leaving him with a gash below his left ear. Koscielny, bloodied and bruised, was unable to continue after eight minutes of treatment on the pitch and that meant Arsenal had lost both their centre-halves. Unai Emery had to be adventurous, bringing on a midfielder, Matteo Guendouzi, as Koscielny\u2019s replacement and also introducing Mesut \u00d6zil in the hope the German could conjure up some magic. Instead, United broke forward again in the 82nd minute. Pogba, driving through the middle, had the first attempt and Martial turned in the rebound after Cech had kept out the first shot. Koscielny\u2019s injury meant ten minutes of stoppage time but United were never likely to be caught and their renaissance under Solskj\u00e6r continues. Bristol City see off Bolton to progress Niclas Eliasson\u2019s brilliant first-half goal proved the winner in a stirring FA Cup fourth-round tie as Bristol City edged out Bolton 2-1 at Ashton Gate. The visitors took a sixth-minute lead when defender Mark Beevers was given the freedom of City\u2019s penalty area to shoot home unmarked with a sweet right-footed half-volley from a Luca Connell cross. But the advantage lasted less than two minutes. City winger Callum O\u2019Dowda was allowed time to control a chip to the edge of the box on his chest before sending a low volley past the diving Remi Matthews. The result extended City\u2019s unbeaten run in all competitions to 12 matches.",

With a one-year-old baby in tow, the Tipenes had no knowledge of the industry, only a vague sense that death could be done better. They were just 21.</p> <p>\u201cI was very hesitant, I used to make him leave his work clothes in the garage before he came into the house. I was scared, scared of helping him,\u201d says Tipene, sitting in a lush teal armchair in her Onehunga office, her four-week-old newborn asleep in her arms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/jan/24/netflixs-fyre-festival-masterclass-influencers\">Netflix\u2019s Fyre festival film offers a masterclass in how not to influence people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family only recently moved out of their home above the undertakers, and Kaiora says she still feels most comfortable in the upstairs flat, where the staff and some aunties are sharing kai (food), while the Tipene children play and work around them.</p> <p>\u201cI started talking to the bodies while I was working with them, having little chats. That\u2019s how I was able to overcome the whole morbid feeling \u2026 it passed and like Francis, this became my passion.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a passion that has made the Tipenes into global television stars, after Netflix picked up a locally produced documentary series on the couple\u2019s working lives: The Casketeers. The first season \u2013 tasteful, moving, candid and hilarious \u2013 saw the humble family became celebrities in New Zealand, and they are now recognised everywhere they go in the small island nation of less than 5 million people.</p> <p>The Spinoff called the show \u201c<a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/tv/14-01-2018/the-casketeers-is-an-instant-kiwi-classic/\">an instant Kiwi classic</a>\u201d, while Radio New Zealand described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2018633594/the-casketeers-putting-the-fun-into-funerals\">an unexpected runaway success</a>\u201d. The Netflix acquisition has upped the game \u2013 even if the family themselves don\u2019t quite get what the fuss is all about. \u201cIt\u2019s just Netflix eh?\u201d says Kaiora, looking bemused. \u201cWe\u2019re not much into all that stuff\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being M\u0101ori, the images of our loved ones are very sacred, and they shouldn\u2019t be exposed in vain</p> <footer> <cite>Kaiora Tipene</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the summer holidays in New Zealand and Kaiora, 35, has five children to look after (all boys), a glamorous Woman\u2019s Day photo shoot and an inbox clogged with requests from people around the world wanting her and Francis to direct their funerals, or open branches of Tipene funerals in their country.</p> <p>\u201cA trip to Alaska was tempting,\u201d says Kaiora with her big, warm smile that invites you to tell her everything. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward to say, but business is good.\u201d</p> <p>After three years of sweet-talking from friend and television producer with Southern Pictures, Annabelle Lee-Mather, the Tipenes agreed to film a pilot episode of The Casketeers.</p> <p>Kaiora told a very reluctant Francis that a straight-up, realistic portrayal of their work could be good for the industry, and help \u201ceducate\u201d people about modern-day death in New Zealand, and particularly M\u0101ori grief practices: open-caskets, sleeping with the body, and fiery send-offs on marae (tribal meeting grounds).</p> <p>The producers told the family their personal lives (weight-loss programs, pregnancies and biscuit thefts) would have to be part of the mix \u2013 a doco on their work required levity, Kaiora says: \u201cthe dark and the light\u201d. It is this combination that has won them so many fans.</p> <p>\u201cBeing M\u0101ori, the images of our loved ones are very sacred, and they shouldn\u2019t be exposed in vain, or having any disrespect. Francis was initially a hard no. I saw some benefits, I felt funeral directors were misperceived.\u201d</p> <p>For Kaiora, the greatest motivation for agreeing was the chance to break down lingering taboos, and introduce viewers to a warmer, funnier side of life\u2019s only certainty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"690579ae3e3e7a6dcfe829a5d6735bde59ce6e23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/690579ae3e3e7a6dcfe829a5d6735bde59ce6e23/0_0_5748_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The casketeers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaiora Tipene: \u201cI started talking to the bodies while I was working with them ...

The babies, that young mother being shot in season one \u2026 we do need to have that banter to balance our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Lee-Mather says the doco\u2019s global success is extra special as it was funded by <a href=\"https://www.tmp.govt.nz/\">Te M\u0101ngai P\u0101ho</a> \u2013 an Indigenous funding body tasked with promoting M\u0101ori language and culture.</p> <p>Te reo is used frequently and casually throughout the seasons, with subtitles provided.

      "bodyText": "It had just gone midnight when Kaiora Tipene touched her first dead body, after receiving a call from her overwhelmed husband to assist with dressing cadavers. It was Francis\u2019s sudden and startling passion for the funeral industry that had brought the young couple from the isolated town of Kaitaia, in rural Northland, to New Zealand\u2019s largest city, Auckland. With a one-year-old baby in tow, the Tipenes had no knowledge of the industry, only a vague sense that death could be done better. They were just 21. \u201cI was very hesitant, I used to make him leave his work clothes in the garage before he came into the house. I was scared, scared of helping him,\u201d says Tipene, sitting in a lush teal armchair in her Onehunga office, her four-week-old newborn asleep in her arms. The family only recently moved out of their home above the undertakers, and Kaiora says she still feels most comfortable in the upstairs flat, where the staff and some aunties are sharing kai (food), while the Tipene children play and work around them. \u201cI started talking to the bodies while I was working with them, having little chats. That\u2019s how I was able to overcome the whole morbid feeling \u2026 it passed and like Francis, this became my passion.\u201d It\u2019s a passion that has made the Tipenes into global television stars, after Netflix picked up a locally produced documentary series on the couple\u2019s working lives: The Casketeers. The first season \u2013 tasteful, moving, candid and hilarious \u2013 saw the humble family became celebrities in New Zealand, and they are now recognised everywhere they go in the small island nation of less than 5 million people. The Spinoff called the show \u201can instant Kiwi classic\u201d, while Radio New Zealand described it as \u201can unexpected runaway success\u201d. The Netflix acquisition has upped the game \u2013 even if the family themselves don\u2019t quite get what the fuss is all about. \u201cIt\u2019s just Netflix eh?\u201d says Kaiora, looking bemused. \u201cWe\u2019re not much into all that stuff\u201d. It\u2019s the summer holidays in New Zealand and Kaiora, 35, has five children to look after (all boys), a glamorous Woman\u2019s Day photo shoot and an inbox clogged with requests from people around the world wanting her and Francis to direct their funerals, or open branches of Tipene funerals in their country. \u201cA trip to Alaska was tempting,\u201d says Kaiora with her big, warm smile that invites you to tell her everything. \u201cIt\u2019s awkward to say, but business is good.\u201d After three years of sweet-talking from friend and television producer with Southern Pictures, Annabelle Lee-Mather, the Tipenes agreed to film a pilot episode of The Casketeers. Kaiora told a very reluctant Francis that a straight-up, realistic portrayal of their work could be good for the industry, and help \u201ceducate\u201d people about modern-day death in New Zealand, and particularly M\u0101ori grief practices: open-caskets, sleeping with the body, and fiery send-offs on marae (tribal meeting grounds). The producers told the family their personal lives (weight-loss programs, pregnancies and biscuit thefts) would have to be part of the mix \u2013 a doco on their work required levity, Kaiora says: \u201cthe dark and the light\u201d. It is this combination that has won them so many fans. \u201cBeing M\u0101ori, the images of our loved ones are very sacred, and they shouldn\u2019t be exposed in vain, or having any disrespect. Francis was initially a hard no. I saw some benefits, I felt funeral directors were misperceived.\u201d For Kaiora, the greatest motivation for agreeing was the chance to break down lingering taboos, and introduce viewers to a warmer, funnier side of life\u2019s only certainty. \u201cI like that we can all let it out with each other. We do cry and we do yell at each other a lot \u2013 we\u2019re probably too honest,\u201d says Kaiora, who doesn\u2019t see any of the episodes before they air, and admits they can sometimes cause problems when true feelings \u2013 and favourite employees \u2013 are revealed. \u201cBut I feel that without any of those moments, we wouldn\u2019t be able to move through our difficult cases. The babies, that young mother being shot in season one \u2026 we do need to have that banter to balance our lives.\u201d Lee-Mather says the doco\u2019s global success is extra special as it was funded by Te M\u0101ngai P\u0101ho \u2013 an Indigenous funding body tasked with promoting M\u0101ori language and culture. Te reo is used frequently and casually throughout the seasons, with subtitles provided. The Tipene family and some of their staff are fluent speakers, and Kaiora and Francis are often called on to perform cultural practices for bereaved families, including karakia (prayers) and karanga (spiritual summons). Lee-Mather says the portrayal of the Tipenes is unlike any M\u0101ori story seen on the global stage, and the Indigenous beliefs and practices around death have fascinated viewers, and broadened their understanding of life in New Zealand. \u201cI feel like Francis is the ultimate counterpoint to Jake \u2018the muss\u2019 Heke from Once Were Warriors. I am so proud we can show this other representation of a M\u0101ori man that is Francis and how wonderful he is,\u201d says Lee-Mather. \u201cThe show is taking the taboo of death away, and making it less frightening and less scary. It has given people an opportunity to talk with their families, ask questions and get a better understanding of it. It is the only thing we all know with certainty \u2013 we\u2019re all going to die.\u201d \u2022 The Casketeers is now showing on Netflix",

Churlish because Mueller\u2019s follow-up on Friday presented evidence of how the Trump campaign, through Roger Stone, was involved in the secret coordination of the release of those emails. Stone \u2013 himself the longest-serving of Trump\u2019s political advisers \u2013 reported to Trump campaign officials on the impending and frequent email dumps from WikiLeaks, otherwise known in the indictment as \u201cOrganization 1\u201d.

Speaking to the Guardian before the launch of a new teacher recruitment and retention strategy next week, Damian Hinds argued that outdated attitudes among school leaders, especially men, may be holding back the adoption of practices such as flexible working. The national strategy, which Hinds said is the first of its kind for schools in England, aims to reshape the profession by lessening traditional burdens on teachers such as marking and lesson planning, as well as more recent encumbrances including email overload and data entry. Hinds\u2019 proposals include what he calls a \u201cjob share Match.com\u201d to help teachers who want to work part-time find someone to fill the gap. \u201cPart of my job is making sure that everybody else knows how hard teachers work,\u201d Hinds said, adding that he wanted to encourage parents \u201cnot to never email a school or a teacher, because that can be important, but to exercise some restraint, knowing that there many other things that teachers have to do\u201d.

The Norwegian scored with a creative attack against Hungary\u2019s Richard Rapport but most of his wins have been achieved by trademark endgame grinds, notably in Wednesday\u2019s 10th round when the 28-year-old eked out the point in a 76-move marathon against Vishy Anand which looked level when they reached king, rook, knight and four pawns each.

The great Russian who confidently deposed Garry Kasparov in 2000 has only 3.5/11, has won only once, has self-destructed several times by rash attacking play, has slumped to No 15 in the live rankings, and has looked a shadow of the man who created the ultra-solid Berlin Wall as an opening weapon.

The needle between them, mostly conducted via Twitter barbs, dates back to Wijk aan Zee 2011 when the Dutchman won as Black in only 22 moves, and for years boasted of his plus score against the champion. Carlsen levelled their lifetime score at Bilbao 2016, then had another bad experience at Wijk 2017, where he failed to find an obvious way to mate in three or win Giri\u2019s queen. After their world blitz game last month, in which Giri fell into his opponent\u2019s prep and flagged with mate imminent, Carlsen told Norwegian television \u201cThere are many who have fantasies as to what is the best way to start the day. This is mine\u201d. Giri has been behind the leaders for most of the way at Wijk but had a dramatic stroke of luck in Friday\u2019s round 11 when the reigning US champion Sam Shankland resigned a totally drawn ending where his king could create a defensive fortress despite Giri\u2019s extra bishop. Wijk leaders with two rounds left are Carlsen and Giri 7.5/11, Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) 7, Anand and Ding Liren (China) 6.5.

Firms across the economy are bracing for the possibility of the UK leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal after parliament resoundingly rejected Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement. The Basel-based company said on Friday it imported 120m packs of medicines to the UK from the continent each year but suggested a no-deal Brexit would affect supplies. \u201cFollowing parliament\u2019s vote, the risk of the UK exiting the EU without a deal is increased and this will be hugely impactful for patients, particularly around the supply and safety of medicines,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe are building increased inventories across our portfolio of medicines in the UK.\u201d The French cosmetics company L\u2019Or\u00e9al, owner of brands ranging from Lanc\u00f4me to Maybelline, also revealed on Friday that it was stockpiling products in the UK in preparation for Brexit. Novartis, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest drugmaker by revenues, makes a large number of medicines ranging from treatments for cancer through to anti-inflammatories, including Voltarol, and the Ritalin drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is a major supplier to the NHS. Novartis called for the government to \u201cimplement a comprehensive continuity plan rapidly\u201d to ensure drugs continued to reach patients, with a particular focus on clarity of customs arrangements and minimising disruption at the border. Pharmacists have been told that the NHS is preparing for the use of alternative transport routes and the prioritisation of medicines as part of Brexit contingency planning. The head of the UK\u2019s pharmaceutical association warned in October that stockpiling by companies would not be enough on its own to cope with leaving without a deal. Martin Sawer, who leads the Healthcare Distribution Association, said patients might need to think about ensuring they had enough of their own stocks, although NHS bosses have warned this could itself lead to shortages. Novartis urged NHS trusts and pharmacists to refrain from stockpiling medicines so supplies could be managed centrally. This would minimise \u201cthe risk of medicine shortages across the UK\u201d, it said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe recognise the vital importance of the medicine supply chain as we exit the EU. \u201cThe government has secured additional capacity on a variety of routes including ferries into and out of Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Immingham and Felixstowe, where medicines will be prioritised. \u201cWe have asked manufacturers to build up six weeks\u2019 additional stocks of medicines and we are confident that, if everyone does what they should do, the supply of medicines will be uninterrupted in the event of exiting the EU without a deal.\u201d Novartis, which currently employs 1,500 people in the UK, also warned that regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU after Brexit would have \u201cfar-reaching implications for the way the life sciences sector operates and its ability to develop and deliver medicines for UK patients\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A prominent \u201cconversion therapy\u201d advocate, David Matheson, has come out as gay after spending what he said were decades of his life entrenched in homophobia. Matheson was a practitioner of the practice also known as \u201cex-gay therapy\u201d or reparative therapy\u201d, which promotes the false idea that being gay is something that should, and can, be \u201ccured\u201d. These therapies have been denounced by major medical bodies including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the UK\u2019s National Health Service. Matheson said he knew his work had helped some people, but was certain he had hurt some people too. \u201cNot that I would excuse myself, but any shortcomings I had as a therapist came from too narrow a view of what \u2018emotionally healthy\u2019 can look like.\u201d Matheson said on Facebook. \u201cThey came from my own homophobia and narrow-mindedness. I am truly sorry for those flaws and the harm they have surely caused some people. And I\u2019m sorry for the confusion and pain my choice may be causing others.\u201d Matheson, a Mormon, affirmed his sexuality this week after the LGBT advocacy group Truth Wins Out reported on a leaked private conversation between Matheson and \u201cconversion therapy\u201d advocate Rich Wyler. After the private conversation was made public, Matheson wrote a Facebook post to affirm he was gay. Matheson said in the post he realized last year that he had to make a change in his life and divorced his wife of 34 years, in part because he felt he could no longer ignore his desire to have a relationship with a man. \u201cWhat you can take from this is that my time in a straight marriage and in the \u2018ex-gay\u2019 world was genuine and sincere and a rich blessing to me,\u201d Matheson wrote. \u201cI remember most of it with fondness and gratitude for the joy and growth it caused in me and many others.\u2019\u201d Matheson told the Salt Lake Tribune\u2019s podcast Mormon Land that he was exposed to homophobia as a youth in the Mormon church and found solace in therapy he received to deal with his own same-sex attraction. He said the benefits of that therapy, and his desire to help men like himself, drove him to become a therapist. Conversion therapy usually uses the talk therapy technique, but there have been documented instances of counselors using extreme \u201caversion treatments\u201d such as electric shock treatment and medication. Matheson has said he never used \u201caversion treatments\u201d. \u201cTo the men whose internalized homophobia I colluded with or who went away from therapy feeling that really was kind of hurtful to me, I am so sorry,\u201d Matheson said. \u201cI got into this because I really had a sense of compassion and love to this community\u201d Matheson said the Mormon church has improved its position on LGBT issues since the 1970s, but added that he wasn\u2019t sure it had acknowledged the stress that comes from being a gay Mormon. The Mormon church has in recent years clarified that it does not consider same-sex attraction a sin, but its policy dictates that people cannot participate in homosexual behavior and also participate in the church. Matheson said that by the time he began studying therapy, he had become consumed by the ideology that being gay is a sin. \u201cEven though it was a deep part of me, I had turned against that part of me,\u201d Matheson said. \u201cSo, I was buying hook line and sinker this idea that people can change.\u201d",

When Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer, his place was taken by his foreign minister, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has intensified his mentor\u2019s approach of responding to the economic downward spiral by concentrating power, ruling by decree and political repression. How has Venezuela fared under Maduro? Lacking Chavez\u2019s charisma and personal popularity, and having been bequeathed an already crippled economy, Maduro has dealt with discontent largely by neutralising other branches of government. He has packed the country\u2019s supreme court with loyalists who simply overturned laws passed by the national assembly that the president opposed, including a measure freeing political prisoners.

It was a way of bypassing the opposition-led national assembly, elected in the country\u2019s last free poll, in May 2016. Maduro\u2019s own attorney general objected and has since fled to Colombia. Street protests against the move were crushed, with more than 110 dead. In 2018 with the economy in freefall, hunger has become epidemic, and up to a tenth of the population (an estimated 4 million people) having fled the country. Several members of Maduro\u2019s inner circle have been implicated in drug trafficking. In an attempt to consolidate his power, Maduro called an early election in May but turnout was below 50% and the UN, EU and Organization of the American States, rejected the election as rigged. It was Maduro\u2019s defiant inauguration on 19 January that precipitated the current showdown. Who is Juan Guaid\u00f3? The young face of the opposition is almost unknown both inside and outside Venezuela, and was thrust on to centre stage by chance. Guaid\u00f3 was made chairman of the national assembly on 5 January because it was the turn of his party, Voluntad Popular (People\u2019s Will). At 35, he is a junior member of the party but its leaders are either under house arrest, in hiding or in exile. His relative obscurity has been an advantage in a country where the opposition has generally failed to distinguish itself, losing its nerve at critical moments, succumbing to infighting, and getting involved in a failed coup against Ch\u00e1vez in 2002. Guaid\u00f3 stakes his claim to the presidency on a clause in the constitution that states that the chair of the national assembly is allowed to assume interim power and declare new elections in 30 days if the legislature deems the president to be failing to fulfil basic duties or to have vacated the post. What is the US role in all this? Donald Trump has a weakness for autocrats, but Maduro has been an exception. With little personal interest in Latin America, he has allowed policy towards Venezuela to be steered by hawks in his administration \u2013 including Vice-President Mike Pence and the national security adviser, John Bolton \u2013 and in the Senate. The Republican senator Marco Rubio, whose Florida electorate includes an increasing number of Venezuelan exiles, has been an important influence, and appears to have suspended criticism of Trump in return for hardline policies towards Cuba and Venezuela. Diplomats at the state department advocating dialogue, have been overruled in favour of a policy orientated around regime change. Trump himself has mused about a military option, and the unanswered question is how the administration hopes to follow through on its gambit to recognise Guaid\u00f3 in the absence of mass defections in the armed forces. That does not seem to have been thought through. The US has already imposed significant sanctions on Maduro\u2019s ruling circle. A full oil embargo would bring more devastation to the Venezuelan people and could backfire on the US economy.

For anti-fascists and counter-protesters, the language was generally the same: the activists were \u201crioting\u201d and threatening the free-speech rights of the TWP. \u201cThe message to commit violence against the \u2018Nazis\u2019 was clear,\u201d he wrote in the reports, recommending they all be prosecuted.</p> <p>Ayres, however, concluded he could not determine if the white supremacist men he identified were \u201csolely responsible for any specific injuries\u201d. That includes men who he determined, based on video evidence, were holding knives. For more than a dozen of them, there was not enough evidence of any crimes, he wrote.</p> <p>Sean Wurzburg, a TWP affiliate, Ayres wrote, was \u201cobserved holding what appears to be a folding blade knife in his right hand when he initially engaged with\u201d a counter-protester. He continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Moments later they are observed rolling in the bushes \u2026 and Wurzburg was seen making some downward thrusting motions. [The protester] sustained a stab wound to the \u2026 abdomen. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Wurzburg is solely responsible for the wound that [the protester] sustained. What is known, is that Wurzburg and [the protester] were in physical confrontation, Wurzburg had what appeared to be a folding knife in his hand [and] during the fight Wurzburg is seen making downward thrusting motions before they separate.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI was unable to specifically place Wurzburg as solely responsible for any specific injuries on those protestors who were known to be injured,\u201d Ayres concluded, saying it was \u201cunknown if Wurzburg committed any crimes\u201d.</p> <p>Ayres\u2019 separate report on this stabbing victim said the victim \u201caggressively tackled Wurzburg, taking an advantageous top position after taking Wurzburg to the ground near the bushes\u201d, and that after the confrontation, the victim \u201ccollapsed due to a stab wound\u201d.</p> <p>Ayres recommended the victim be charged with 13 separate criminal offenses, including \u201cassault with a deadly weapon (flag pole) and battery on Sean Wurzburg\u201d; conspiracy; false imprisonment; brandishing a weapon; participating in a riot; inciting a riot; participating in an unlawful assembly; possessing a prohibited weapon; disturbing the peace; wearing a mask or disguise to evade police, unlawfully carrying a banner \u201cexceeding thirty inches\u201d; carrying a flag pole handle that was \u201cgreater than one-fourth inch in thickness\u201d; and carrying \u201cprohibited signs\u201d.</p> <p>Wurzburg declined to comment when reached by phone.</p> <p>Similarly, Ayres wrote that the TWP affiliate Derik Punneo \u201cpossessed a lawful knife, came under attack from the protestors and defended himself from the attacks\u201d. Ayres summarized:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Punneo had a knife in his right hand at some point during Event \u2026 [and] was in the immediate area of [a counter protester, who] did suffer from numerous stab wounds; Punneo was in the immediate area of [Yvette] Felarca and Felarca suffered cuts to one arm; Punneo had close physical interaction with [another counter protester] on two separate occasions (within a moment of each other) and [this counter protester] did suffer a large gash across his left upper chest; a knife, similar to the one Punneo was holding \u2026 was located in the bushes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ayres concluded: \u201cI was unable to specifically place Punneo as solely responsible for any specific injuries on those protestors.\u201d</p> <p>Ayres recommended no charges for Punneo but did urge a litany of felony charges against the three stabbing victims. The CHP later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/california-police-white-supremacists-counter-protest\">interviewed Punneo in jail</a> after his<a href=\"https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/skinhead-stumble-unrelated-domestic-battery/content?oid=21970866\"> arrest</a> for an unrelated allegation of domestic violence.

      "bodyText": "The testimony of a California police officer leading the inquiry into a series of stabbings at a neo-Nazi rally indicated that he targeted leftwing activists and victims rather than focusing his investigation on armed white supremacists. The officer, Donovan Ayres, a 12-year-veteran of the California highway patrol, admitted he pursued information on the political affiliations and online activity of leftwing activists and victims. He testified Tuesday as a key witness in the state\u2019s ongoing case against three anti-fascist activists charged with assault and \u201crioting\u201d during a brawl between neo-Nazis and counter-protesters at the state capitol in June 2016. Ayres was tasked with investigating the violence that erupted at the event, including the stabbing and beating of at least eight anti-fascist protesters. But his testimony in a packed courtroom earlier this week, along with hundreds of pages of reports he wrote, have revealed the officer\u2019s acquiescence to the neo-Nazis and the way he repeatedly advocated they not face any criminal consequences. Ayres told the court that he filed a search warrant to access the Facebook accounts of the leftist protesters and anti-fascists, but chose not to seek equivalent information about neo-Nazi suspects \u2013 an extraordinary move for a law enforcement leader investigating far-right violence. He also resisted describing the political affiliations of individual men on the neo-Nazi side. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely troubling that a police officer wouldn\u2019t [seek] to get all the information available about all the actors involved in the violent episode,\u201d said Mike German, a former FBI agent and expert on the far right who reviewed some of Ayres\u2019 documents for the Guardian. \u201cLaw enforcement should always look at who has a history of violence \u2026 The victims of the most egregious violence were counter-protesters.\u201d The CHP and the prosecutors declined the Guardian\u2019s request for a comment. Officer Ayres did not respond to multiple inquiries. The 26 June 2016 rally in Sacramento was organized by two white supremacist groups: the Traditionalist Worker party (TWP) and an affiliated California entity, the Golden State Skinheads. The event attracted a mass of leftwing counter-protesters from around northern California. Ayres was assigned to a \u201ctactical team\u201d positioned on the roof of the Capitol. From there, he witnessed the chaotic melee between the protesters and counter-protesters below, which resulted in at least eight stabbings and dozens of other injuries. After the event, Ayres and other CHP officers began interviewing anti-fascists who were stabbed, meeting some of them at the hospital. Ayres also began his inquiry into their political backgrounds. Police seek \u2018AntiFa\u2019 and \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 records Three months after the stabbings, the CHP wrote search warrants for the Facebook accounts of anti-fascists. The agency was seeking information on \u201cseveral hundred protestors\u201d who \u201cillegally assembled \u2026 with the stated messages to prevent Traditionalist Worker\u2019s Party from exercising their rights to assemble and speak their message\u201d, it said. The protest groups include \u201cAntiFa\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, CHP wrote in the warrant, adding that it was seeking \u201cprivate messages\u201d, \u201cmetadata\u201d, \u201cfriend\u201d lists, information about past and future events and other material about people linked to antifa and protest pages. Ayres also conducted extensive surveillance of the political activities of the anti-fascists, digging up some protesters\u2019 ties to Native American and Chicano groups. Ayres wrote up more than 120 individual reports on everyone present at the capitol on 26 June. For anti-fascists and counter-protesters, the language was generally the same: the activists were \u201crioting\u201d and threatening the free-speech rights of the TWP. \u201cThe message to commit violence against the \u2018Nazis\u2019 was clear,\u201d he wrote in the reports, recommending they all be prosecuted. Ayres, however, concluded he could not determine if the white supremacist men he identified were \u201csolely responsible for any specific injuries\u201d. That includes men who he determined, based on video evidence, were holding knives. For more than a dozen of them, there was not enough evidence of any crimes, he wrote. Sean Wurzburg, a TWP affiliate, Ayres wrote, was \u201cobserved holding what appears to be a folding blade knife in his right hand when he initially engaged with\u201d a counter-protester. He continued: Moments later they are observed rolling in the bushes \u2026 and Wurzburg was seen making some downward thrusting motions. [The protester] sustained a stab wound to the \u2026 abdomen. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Wurzburg is solely responsible for the wound that [the protester] sustained. What is known, is that Wurzburg and [the protester] were in physical confrontation, Wurzburg had what appeared to be a folding knife in his hand [and] during the fight Wurzburg is seen making downward thrusting motions before they separate. \u201cI was unable to specifically place Wurzburg as solely responsible for any specific injuries on those protestors who were known to be injured,\u201d Ayres concluded, saying it was \u201cunknown if Wurzburg committed any crimes\u201d. Ayres\u2019 separate report on this stabbing victim said the victim \u201caggressively tackled Wurzburg, taking an advantageous top position after taking Wurzburg to the ground near the bushes\u201d, and that after the confrontation, the victim \u201ccollapsed due to a stab wound\u201d. Ayres recommended the victim be charged with 13 separate criminal offenses, including \u201cassault with a deadly weapon (flag pole) and battery on Sean Wurzburg\u201d; conspiracy; false imprisonment; brandishing a weapon; participating in a riot; inciting a riot; participating in an unlawful assembly; possessing a prohibited weapon; disturbing the peace; wearing a mask or disguise to evade police, unlawfully carrying a banner \u201cexceeding thirty inches\u201d; carrying a flag pole handle that was \u201cgreater than one-fourth inch in thickness\u201d; and carrying \u201cprohibited signs\u201d. Wurzburg declined to comment when reached by phone. Similarly, Ayres wrote that the TWP affiliate Derik Punneo \u201cpossessed a lawful knife, came under attack from the protestors and defended himself from the attacks\u201d. Ayres summarized: Punneo had a knife in his right hand at some point during Event \u2026 [and] was in the immediate area of [a counter protester, who] did suffer from numerous stab wounds; Punneo was in the immediate area of [Yvette] Felarca and Felarca suffered cuts to one arm; Punneo had close physical interaction with [another counter protester] on two separate occasions (within a moment of each other) and [this counter protester] did suffer a large gash across his left upper chest; a knife, similar to the one Punneo was holding \u2026 was located in the bushes. Ayres concluded: \u201cI was unable to specifically place Punneo as solely responsible for any specific injuries on those protestors.\u201d Ayres recommended no charges for Punneo but did urge a litany of felony charges against the three stabbing victims. The CHP later interviewed Punneo in jail after his arrest for an unrelated allegation of domestic violence. One man on the white supremacist side is now facing charges, but not for the stabbings. Punneo could not be reached for comment. German, the former FBI agent and a Brennan Center fellow, said Ayres\u2019 language was alarming: \u201cThat word \u2018solely\u2019 is carrying a lot of water to try to protect these people from responsibility.\u201d Ultimately, Ayres did not recommend charges for any of the far-right men for the stabbings. Ayres did recommend criminal charges against all 100 counter-protesters he identified, including eight stabbing and beating victims and those not accused of any violence. Prosecutors ultimately chose to charge three anti-fascists: Yvette Felarca, a 48-year-old Berkeley teacher and well-known leftwing organizer, and two indigenous activists, Michael Williams, 58, and Porfirio Paz, 21. Paz and Williams stand accused of committing assaults with \u201csticks\u201d. Felarca is facing a charge of felony assault \u201cby means of force likely to produce great bodily injury\u201d for an encounter with Nigel Walker, a demonstrator who showed up at the rally carrying a flag with what Ayres described as a \u201cwhite power, white nationalist type symbol\u201d. Walker taunted and provoked anti-fascist activists, Ayres recalled, waving the flag and shouting, \u201cAntifa, here I am!\u201d Shaky footage presented by prosecutors shows the five-foot-tall Felarca bumping into Walker, briefly shoving and prodding him, and grabbing his backpack as a crowd surrounded them. Other protesters begin confronting Walker, and a police officer threw Felarca to the ground. Paris Coleman, the prosecutor on the case, argued the felony wasn\u2019t about the \u201cactual pulling\u201d of the backpack, but the fact that Felarca knowingly \u201cdragged\u201d Walker to harm\u2019s way: \u201cShe knew what was going to happen,\u201d Coleman said. Paz, Williams and Felarca were engaged in a free speech protest, their lawyers have said, and maintain that the neo-Nazis attacked them. A judge ruled Friday that the cases against the three anti-fascists could move forward, but agreed to downgrade Paz\u2019s assault charges from a felony to a misdemeanor. \u2018Thanks for protecting white supremacists\u2019 Ayres\u2019 hours-long testimony during the hearing this week provided new insight into the officer\u2019s thinking, with remarks that at times sparked laughs and jeers from the crowd of anti-fascists supporting the protesters facing potential prison time. On the stand, Ayres declined to refer to TWP organizers and supporters as Nazis, and judge Stacy Boulware Eurie noted he seemed to be showing \u201chesitation\u201d with the characterization. \u201cThat language wasn\u2019t used in my assessment,\u201d Ayres said. Instead, he called them the \u201cpermitted party\u201d, since TWP had obtained a permit to hold the event. Ayres also resisted describing the political affiliations of individual men on the neo-Nazi side, even though he extensively documented their white supremacist paraphernalia and TWP ties in his reports. He said \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d when asked about the beliefs of numerous men, including Jonathan Jordan, a man who, according to Ayres\u2019 own report, attended with the TWP and did the \u201cHitler salute\u201d. Ayres also admitted in court that he utilized a wide range of sources for footage of the event during his investigation, including neo-Nazi and white supremacist websites. Defense lawyers criticized the questionable sourcing, and eventually, the judge said she, too, was \u201cconcerned about the authentication of the video\u201d of Felarca and Walker. Ayres also detailed his observations on the day of the rally. He explained that he had become worried about Walker. \u201cHe was by himself, and this was a concern for me,\u201d Ayres testified. \u201cI tried to call out to him to tell him not to enter, that it wouldn\u2019t be safe.\u201d Ayres described the anti-fascists\u2019 flags as weapons \u2013 a \u201cclub/stick\u201d with a flag \u201cattached\u201d to it \u2013 \u201cemblematic of anarchist beliefs\u201d and direct evidence of their violent criminal offenses. But when asked if he considered Walker\u2019s flag attached to a long stick to be a weapon, Ayres said no. The defense lawyers questioned whether the officer, from his vantage point on the roof, was able to observe key conflict moments involving the protesters facing prosecution. \u201cI could not see what was directly beneath me,\u201d he said. When questioned about the Facebook warrants, Ayres admitted he did not send similar search warrants for TWP Facebook accounts, but he did not elaborate on his reasoning. \u201cThis officer had real trouble being neutral,\u201d the defense attorney Linda Parisi told the court at the end of Tuesday\u2019s four-hour hearing. \u201cThe people he is seeking to protect are people who engage in hate \u2026 white supremacists, white nationalists, Nazis.\u201d The Sacramento case follows controversies across the US in the last two years over the way law enforcement has dealt with violence between white supremacist and anti-fascist groups. Civil rights activists have accused law enforcement departments in Portland, Berkeley and Washington DC of aggressively investigating and prosecuting anti-fascists who oppose the growing far-right movement. Authorities have disproportionately targeted the left, critics say, even though white supremacists have perpetuated mass shootings and other deadly attacks . Coleman, the prosecutor, argued it didn\u2019t matter whether Ayres was \u201cbelievable or disbelievable\u201d, and that he called the officer to court for the purpose of authenticating a video. As Coleman exited the hearing, an attendee had a message for him: \u201cThanks for protecting white supremacists.\u201d",

The Freedom Forum, the private foundation that established the Newseum and finances it, announced on Friday the sale of the glass-and-steel building to the Johns Hopkins Foundation for $372.5m. Positioned down the street from the US Capitol, the monument to the first amendment has been a reliable presence for tourists and passersby since 2008. It had previously been housed in the more modest surroundings of Rosslyn, Virginia. \u201cThis was a difficult decision, but it was the responsible one,\u201d Jan Neuharth, the Freedom Forum\u2019s chair and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to continuing our programs \u2013 in a financially sustainable way \u2013 to champion the five freedoms of the first amendment and to increase public awareness about the importance of a free and fair press.\u201d Neuharth added that the group would \u201cexplore all options\u201d to find a new location in the Washington area. The Baltimore-based university Johns Hopkins will meanwhile expand its presence in the US capital. The Newseum\u2019s financial troubles have been widely reported, with talk of a possible sale first being made public a year ago in light of stagnant fundraising and significant debt. The announcement of its pending closure at its current location capped off a grim week in US journalism, with widespread layoffs at several media organizations, including Gannett, HuffPost and BuzzFeed. The Newseum is one of the few museums in the US dedicated exclusively to journalism and the first amendment. Unlike most of Washington\u2019s museums, which as government-funded facilities are free of charge, the privately owned Newseum charged an entrance fee of nearly $25 per person.

      "bodyText": "The co-founder of a gynaecological cancer charity has had a cervical smear test on live television in a bid to combat the stigma around a health check that can potentially save thousands of lives. Chloe Delevingne, the older sister of the models Cara and Poppy Delevingne and co-founder of the Lady Garden gynaecological cancer fund, has been campaigning to raise awareness on cervical cancer prevention after a smear test discovered abnormal cells when she was 21. \u201cIt is a bit nerve-wrecking, but you just need to relax and talk to the doctor about it,\u201d she said on BBC Two\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show. \u201cIt\u2019s not painful, it\u2019s just weird,\u201d she said during the procedure on Friday. The 30-second smear test can identify abnormal cells that could potentially develop into cervical cancer. However, recent figures show that cervical screening is at its lowest levels in two decades, with one in three women not taking their screening tests every three years as recommended for women aged 25 to 49 or every five years for women aged 50 to 64, according to the NHS. Delevingne\u2019s decision to undergo the procedure live on television comes after a survey published earlier this week suggested that young women were put off smear tests due to feelings of embarrassment and concerns about being hurt. The charity Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust found that those aged 25 to 35 were also put off by the idea of a stranger examining them. About 220,000 women are diagnosed with cervical abnormalities every year in the UK and there were 854 deaths from cervical cancer in England in 2016. Theresa May encouraged women to take smear tests during her weekly PMQs in the House of Commons on Wednesday. When asked to back the life-saving tests, May said she understood that they could be uncomfortable and even painful but called on all women to make sure they took up the offer of a test. She said: \u201cI, as a prime minister, can stand here and say this, I know what it\u2019s like to go through a cervical smear test. \u201cIt is not comfortable. Sometimes, for some, it will be embarrassing. Sometimes it\u2019s painful, but those few minutes can save lives, so I would encourage all women to take up their smear tests.\u201d",

As the Hotel du Vin chain grew and hotels were opened in towns such as Harrogate, Tunbridge Wells and Birmingham, a growing number of sommeliers were introduced to his open-minded attitude. He told me during a conversation in around 2000: \u201cI like to give my staff the freedom to express themselves and to learn. So they choose most of the wines they sell, just as the chefs choose the dishes they prepare.\u201d</p> <p>He had no time, either, for the traditional sommelier style of telling diners what they should be drinking.

How can I help you choose a wine that\u2019s right for you if I don\u2019t know how much you want to spend, what you really like?

His only passions were cycling and the city\u2019s football team, and it was a European quarter-final match between St \u00c9tienne and Liverpool at Anfield in 1977 that changed Gerard\u2019s life. Aged 20, he crossed the Channel for the first time to watch it, and almost instantly decided to move to the UK.</p> <p>With no qualifications and less than fluent English, Gerard was grateful to get a job washing dishes on the Isle of Man.

After winning the UK (1989 and 1992) and European sommelier championships (1996), it took him six attempts to land the international title in 2010. In a competition that is held every three years, that meant nearly two decades of intense training, including sessions with a sports psychologist. Alongside these gladiatorial contests, he also studied for both an MBA in wine (2007) and an MSc in wine management (2017).</p> <p>Despite his French roots and the strong Gallic accent he maintained throughout his life, Gerard developed strong ties to his adopted country. Indeed, he shocked the French organisers of the World Sommelier Competition by insisting on the playing of God Save the Queen rather than the Marseillaise. \u201cI have a British passport,\u201d he explained. He always championed wines from new and lesser-known regions, and examples that offered value for money.

      "bodyText": "Greek MPs have ratified a landmark accord allowing the country\u2019s tiny northern neighbour Macedonia to change its name, in a momentous development for the stability of a region all too often riven by wars, nationalist populism and memories of blood-soaked mutual suspicion. After one of the most contentious votes in Greek history, Nikos Voutsis, the president of Athens\u2019 300-seat parliament, announced the result at 3.35pm local time (1335 GMT). In all, 153 MPs declared support for a deal that not only renames the strategic Balkan state North Macedonia, but ends an abstruse diplomatic dispute that has raged for almost 30 years. The result paves the way for the former Yugoslav republic to join Nato and eventually the EU \u2013 alliances hitherto blocked by Athens. Rushing to congratulate his Greek counterpart, Alexis Tsipras, the Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, tweeted: \u201cTogether with our peoples we reached a historical victory. Long Live the Prespa Agreement! For eternal peace and progress of the Balkans and in Europe.\u201d Tsipras called it \u201ca historic day for Greece that ends an issue that was a burden for our foreign policy\u201d. The vote \u2013 two weeks after MPs in Skopje ratified the constitutional amendments needed to change their country\u2019s nomenclature \u2013 followed five days of acrimonious debate in Greece, where nationalist sentiment had reached fever pitch. In and outside the parliament, opponents had deplored the pact as an act of unprecedented betrayal. Iron- and crowbar-wielding protesters attempted to storm the building during a demonstration that drew tens of thousands last week. MPs were labelled traitors and several in Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party received death threats by text message. Surveys on the eve of the vote showed more than 60% of Greeks opposed the accord. Few believed the deal \u2013 struck between the two nations\u2019 leftist governments last year \u2013 would get this far. Dimitris Orfanoudakis, a farmer who had travelled from Crete with his flag-draped teenage son, Giorgos, to join the protests, summed up the mood: \u201cIt is treason and it has to stop.

Internationally, both leaders have been praised for their courage in defying nationalist sentiment on the ground. But what European officials see as \u201ca unique and historic opportunity\u201d to settle a dispute that has defied solution for decades, has tested the two politically. \u201cTsipras submitted to pressure from the Europeans, especially [Angela] Merkel,\u201d said Panos Kammenos, who heads the populist rightwing Independent Greeks party, the ruling leftists\u2019 junior partner in government until it pulled out in protest over the accord.

      "body": "<p>Although he failed to emerge from an Airbus waving it, MP Mark Francois had in his hand a piece of paper. \u201cMy father, Reginald Francois, was a D-day veteran,\u201d he thundered to the news cameras on Friday, shortly before ripping up the aforementioned document. \u201cHe never submitted to bullying by any German. Neither will his son.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving aside the somewhat bathetic description of Rommel\u2019s Atlantic Wall defences as \u201cbullying\u201d, can you guess what Mark\u2019s piece of paper actually was? Certification of a history doctorate? (He amusingly already holds an MA in war studies.) A letter from his future self reading simply \u201cDon\u2019t be a thermonuclear dick, Mark \u2013 it ends badly\u201d?</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid not. The document was in fact a widely reported missive from the German CEO of Airbus, Tom Enders, who employs 14,000 people in this country and supports a further 110,000 jobs in the supply chain. This week he expressed intense frustration that \u201cmore than two years after the result of the 2016 referendum, businesses are still unable to plan for the future \u2026 If you are still really sure that Brexit is best for Britain,\u201d Enders concluded, \u201ccome together and deliver a pragmatic withdrawal agreement.\u201d Or, as Francois counter-reasoned: \u201cTom Enders was a German paratrooper in his youth.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested that the Queen should, if necessary, suspend parliament to stop things not going his way</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Incredibly, given this competition, Quote of the Week must still go to Nadine Dorries, who went on telly to express contempt for Brexit-cautious MPs \u201cwho really don\u2019t care about their careers going up in flames\u201d. Did the erstwhile gobbler of kangaroo testicles just say that out loud? To hear Nadine speak at the best of times feels like intruding on private stupidity, but even by her standards, this is eye-catching from the member for Mid-Bedfordshire. It can\u2019t really be that Nadine should have been in parliament for almost 14 years without anyone informing her that politicians are in fact SUPPOSED to act out of a higher sense of duty than personal career advancement.</p> <p>Far more believable is the idea that someone has actually flipped her wiring, so that the things Nadine ought to say remain only secret thoughts, while her inner monologue is now broadcast in all its epoch-illuminating glory. Hilarity ensues. Or possibly catastrophe. Ask me again in 63 days.</p> <p>Indeed, as the Brexit clock ticks down, Nadine may well be regarded by future historians as the archetypal thinker of the era. Even at this incredibly late hour, vast swaths of parliament are doggedly placing self-interest above national interest, apparently bolstered by some vague belief that Britain is too big to fail. Or, as Holly Golightly liked to think of Tiffany\u2019s, that nothing very bad could ever happen to you there. If they hold fast to their current priorities and shun the personal inconvenience of compromise, no deal could very conceivably be stumbled into.</p> <p>Of course, there would be no stumbling about it for some. Consider the lavishly preposterous MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, Daniel Kawczynski, who this week took it upon himself to announce that he has written to the Polish prime minister and requested \u201cformally\u201d that Poland veto any request by the UK to extend article 50. We can\u2019t be sure what formal channels this MP believes himself to be operating within, but openly demanding that foreign powers subvert the will of the UK legislature did seem to be the second hottest take on parliamentary sovereignty in as many days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f03e5f625bdd745362fdc27ad2f1b237045bf0d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f03e5f625bdd745362fdc27ad2f1b237045bf0d2/0_285_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson Speechepa07296555 Britain\u2019s former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson delivers his Brexit speech at the JCB headquarters in Rocester, Britain, 18 January 2019.

Great to see that prorogation has officially entered the game, as yet another reminder that Brexit is rarely about the things it says it is about. Nothing says \u201cI believe passionately in parliamentary sovereignty\u201d quite as convincingly as demanding that the sovereign shut down parliament.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg believes Britain could surf the wave of no deal. He\u2019s really very like Patrick Swayze in Point Break in that respect \u2013 except with an opera coat, no charisma and zero personal exposure to the 50-year storm. Yet people continue to misread him as dependably as his father used to misread the future. At Wednesday\u2019s event, the economist Roger Bootle introduced him as \u201ca modest man \u2026 too modest, almost, for his own good\u201d. To which the only sane reply is: lololololololol. If you had to distil into one personage the British people\u2019s gibbering historical deference to terrible ideas advanced by low-to-middlebrow post-feudal shitlords who openly detest them, this plastic aristocrat would be it. Rees-Mogg is the logical end of whole centuries of barking up the wrong tree. In the most recent <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2019/01/tim-bale-johnson-and-rees-mogg-are-still-in-with-a-shout-in-the-race-to-succeed-may.html\" title=\"\">leadership polls</a> of Tory members, obviously, he trailed only Boris Johnson.</p> <p>And so to Brexit\u2019s best-paid influencers.

That works out at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/23/david-davis-part-time-business-cabinet-jcb\" title=\"\">\u00a33,000 an hour</a>, which feels like the sort of rate that might be expected if your workplace was a glass coffee table in Riyadh.

I wonder if it says something about Britain that its Greatest Inventor makes vacuum cleaners and hair dryers and so on. Nothing wrong with that, of course \u2013 we all need them.

The document was in fact a widely reported missive from the German CEO of Airbus, Tom Enders, who employs 14,000 people in this country and supports a further 110,000 jobs in the supply chain. This week he expressed intense frustration that \u201cmore than two years after the result of the 2016 referendum, businesses are still unable to plan for the future \u2026 If you are still really sure that Brexit is best for Britain,\u201d Enders concluded, \u201ccome together and deliver a pragmatic withdrawal agreement.\u201d Or, as Francois counter-reasoned: \u201cTom Enders was a German paratrooper in his youth.\u201d Incredibly, given this competition, Quote of the Week must still go to Nadine Dorries, who went on telly to express contempt for Brexit-cautious MPs \u201cwho really don\u2019t care about their careers going up in flames\u201d. Did the erstwhile gobbler of kangaroo testicles just say that out loud? To hear Nadine speak at the best of times feels like intruding on private stupidity, but even by her standards, this is eye-catching from the member for Mid-Bedfordshire. It can\u2019t really be that Nadine should have been in parliament for almost 14 years without anyone informing her that politicians are in fact SUPPOSED to act out of a higher sense of duty than personal career advancement. Far more believable is the idea that someone has actually flipped her wiring, so that the things Nadine ought to say remain only secret thoughts, while her inner monologue is now broadcast in all its epoch-illuminating glory. Hilarity ensues. Or possibly catastrophe. Ask me again in 63 days. Indeed, as the Brexit clock ticks down, Nadine may well be regarded by future historians as the archetypal thinker of the era. Even at this incredibly late hour, vast swaths of parliament are doggedly placing self-interest above national interest, apparently bolstered by some vague belief that Britain is too big to fail. Or, as Holly Golightly liked to think of Tiffany\u2019s, that nothing very bad could ever happen to you there. If they hold fast to their current priorities and shun the personal inconvenience of compromise, no deal could very conceivably be stumbled into. Of course, there would be no stumbling about it for some. Consider the lavishly preposterous MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, Daniel Kawczynski, who this week took it upon himself to announce that he has written to the Polish prime minister and requested \u201cformally\u201d that Poland veto any request by the UK to extend article 50. We can\u2019t be sure what formal channels this MP believes himself to be operating within, but openly demanding that foreign powers subvert the will of the UK legislature did seem to be the second hottest take on parliamentary sovereignty in as many days. The hottest take, as so often, belonged to Daniel\u2019s European Research Group (ERG) colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, who on Wednesday gave an address during which he suggested that the Queen should, if necessary, suspend parliament to stop things not going his way. Great to see that prorogation has officially entered the game, as yet another reminder that Brexit is rarely about the things it says it is about. Nothing says \u201cI believe passionately in parliamentary sovereignty\u201d quite as convincingly as demanding that the sovereign shut down parliament. Rees-Mogg believes Britain could surf the wave of no deal. He\u2019s really very like Patrick Swayze in Point Break in that respect \u2013 except with an opera coat, no charisma and zero personal exposure to the 50-year storm. Yet people continue to misread him as dependably as his father used to misread the future. At Wednesday\u2019s event, the economist Roger Bootle introduced him as \u201ca modest man \u2026 too modest, almost, for his own good\u201d. To which the only sane reply is: lololololololol. If you had to distil into one personage the British people\u2019s gibbering historical deference to terrible ideas advanced by low-to-middlebrow post-feudal shitlords who openly detest them, this plastic aristocrat would be it. Rees-Mogg is the logical end of whole centuries of barking up the wrong tree. In the most recent leadership polls of Tory members, obviously, he trailed only Boris Johnson. And so to Brexit\u2019s best-paid influencers. What an inevitability to learn that the former Brexit secretary David Davis has walked straight into a \u00a360,000, 20-hour-a-year gig to advise the digger manufacturing firm JCB. That works out at \u00a33,000 an hour, which feels like the sort of rate that might be expected if your workplace was a glass coffee table in Riyadh. Boris Johnson seems to be on ten grand a pop from the same source, suggesting he provides services too grotesque even for metaphorical allusion. It certainly feels more fitting than ever that he made last week\u2019s speech at JCB in front of a great big hoe. Perhaps the best that can be said for JCB\u2019s Brexiteer chairman, Sir Anthony Bamford, is that his business is, at least for now, still headquartered in the UK. News that the leave advocate James Dyson is to relocate his HQ to Singapore is proving harder to spin, particularly given he\u2019s said: \u201cIt\u2019s to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities.\u201d Still, it will be one upside if we\u2019re no longer required to genuflect and defer to Dyson on matters other than suction. I wonder if it says something about Britain that its Greatest Inventor makes vacuum cleaners and hair dryers and so on. Nothing wrong with that, of course \u2013 we all need them. But it\u2019s hardly the premier league of inventions. Oh, you can give it \u201cthe airblade\u201d all you like. But faced with an attacking move by the creators of artificial hearts or water-powered engines, Dyson and his hand-dryers would be hopelessly outclassed. Mark Francois may believe Britain could never be outclassed, even as he talks in a way that might reasonably be expected to appal the actual participants in events over which he has only heavy-breathed. But others on both the leave and remain sides may judge the UK\u2019s self-respect to be hanging by a thread. And that\u2019s where we stand as Theresa May heads into the latest of her crunch weeks \u2013 although Philip Hammond has reinforced the government\u2019s reputation for can-kicking by suggesting that Tuesday\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cthe sort of high-noon moment \u2026 It\u2019s a great British tradition to compromise and find a solution,\u201d he judged on Friday, \u201crather than standing throwing rocks at each other from different sides of the argument.\u201d Mmm. Is Hammond watching the same Brexit you\u2019re watching? The UK\u2019s mad yen for self-dramatisation is a big part of what got us here; perhaps the sense of ourselves as instinctively great at this stuff should be abandoned as the need for a solution moves into its emergency stage. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

The warning comes from the Cabinet Office, which is coordinating training for thousands of staff across Whitehall to help prepare departments for a disorderly departure from the European Union on 29 March.

      "body": "<p>Long before Lord Bamford, the chairman of the machinery manufacturer JCB, invited Boris Johnson to speak at his company earlier this month, the billionaire had bulldozed his way into British politics.</p> <p>Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/24/jcb-paid-boris-johnson-10000-three-days-before-speech\">paid \u00a310,000 by the company</a> three days before he gave his 18 January Brexit-themed speech, which was widely seen as his latest tilt at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/boris-johnson-falsely-denies-issuing-turkey-warning-in-brexit-campaign\">the Conservative leadership</a> and which he peppered with repeated praise for the company\u2019s business acumen and innovation.</p> <p>The payment was disclosed on the new <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/190121/190121.pdf\">register of MPs\u2019 financial interests</a> this week, which also showed that JCB was paying the former Brexit secretary David Davis \u00a360,000 a year as an \u201cexternal adviser\u201d.</p> <p>But while this has caused the odd eyebrow to arch, JCB has a long track record of working closely with top Tories to further the Conservative cause. This was the billionaire Bamford playing to form.</p> <p>First, the tycoon is a director of the Centre for Policy Studies, which will forever be known as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite thinktank. Second, the Brexit-supporting Conservative peer and his family have a long history of writing cheques \u2013 not only to fund the obligatory <a href=\"https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht-virginian.html\">yacht, the private jet and the classic Ferrari collection</a>, but also in support of their favourite political causes and actors.</p> <p>The Bamford family, which was said to be worth \u00a33.6bn in last year\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List, along with JCB have handed over almost \u00a310m in political donations since 2001, according to records held by the Electoral Commission.</p> <p>The vast majority of that largesse has benefited the Conservative party and its MPs \u2013 with former chancellor George Osborne, as well as Johnson and Davis, recorded as receiving donations ranging from \u00a35,000 to \u00a315,000 in the decade to 2010. Around \u00a31.3m was donated to organisations campaigning to leave the European Union.</p> <p>This all chimes with the image of Bamford, who started running JCB in 1975 after his father and company founder \u2013 Joseph Cyril Bamford \u2013 stepped down.</p> <p>Born in 1945, Bamford <em>fils</em> was schooled at Ampleforth College, the North Yorkshire Catholic school, and then Grenoble University in the south-east of France, where he has said he did \u201cmore skiing than anything else\u201d.</p> <p>But he was quickly to grow up, taking control of the company and converting it into a firm that now employs more than 15,000 people and in 2017 had revenues topping \u00a33bn. The company boasts, probably justifiably, that Bamford has presided over JCB winning <a href=\"https://www.jcb.com/en-gb/about/lord-bamford\">30 Queen\u2019s Awards for Innovation and Enterprise</a>.</p> <p>So JCB is a business success, but it is far from just being a British success.

      "bodyText": "Long before Lord Bamford, the chairman of the machinery manufacturer JCB, invited Boris Johnson to speak at his company earlier this month, the billionaire had bulldozed his way into British politics. Johnson was paid \u00a310,000 by the company three days before he gave his 18 January Brexit-themed speech, which was widely seen as his latest tilt at the Conservative leadership and which he peppered with repeated praise for the company\u2019s business acumen and innovation. The payment was disclosed on the new register of MPs\u2019 financial interests this week, which also showed that JCB was paying the former Brexit secretary David Davis \u00a360,000 a year as an \u201cexternal adviser\u201d. But while this has caused the odd eyebrow to arch, JCB has a long track record of working closely with top Tories to further the Conservative cause. This was the billionaire Bamford playing to form. First, the tycoon is a director of the Centre for Policy Studies, which will forever be known as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s favourite thinktank. Second, the Brexit-supporting Conservative peer and his family have a long history of writing cheques \u2013 not only to fund the obligatory yacht, the private jet and the classic Ferrari collection, but also in support of their favourite political causes and actors. The Bamford family, which was said to be worth \u00a33.6bn in last year\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List, along with JCB have handed over almost \u00a310m in political donations since 2001, according to records held by the Electoral Commission. The vast majority of that largesse has benefited the Conservative party and its MPs \u2013 with former chancellor George Osborne, as well as Johnson and Davis, recorded as receiving donations ranging from \u00a35,000 to \u00a315,000 in the decade to 2010. Around \u00a31.3m was donated to organisations campaigning to leave the European Union. This all chimes with the image of Bamford, who started running JCB in 1975 after his father and company founder \u2013 Joseph Cyril Bamford \u2013 stepped down. Born in 1945, Bamford fils was schooled at Ampleforth College, the North Yorkshire Catholic school, and then Grenoble University in the south-east of France, where he has said he did \u201cmore skiing than anything else\u201d. But he was quickly to grow up, taking control of the company and converting it into a firm that now employs more than 15,000 people and in 2017 had revenues topping \u00a33bn. The company boasts, probably justifiably, that Bamford has presided over JCB winning 30 Queen\u2019s Awards for Innovation and Enterprise. So JCB is a business success, but it is far from just being a British success. Plenty of its triumphs have been forged overseas and, specifically, in Europe. JCB Service \u2013 the top of the chain in the group of UK JCB companies \u2013 is owned by a company in the Netherlands, which the UK accounts say is controlled by the Bamford family. Europe accounts for 28% of the more than \u00a33bn revenues booked at JCB Service, the largest single market, India is next with 23%, and the UK third at 19%. But it is not just Bamford\u2019s education, property and business that ties him to jurisdictions outside the British Isles. The register of Lords\u2019 interests shows that Bamford owns a house in Cabasson on the French south coast, where a yacht \u2013 reportedly owned by the tycoon \u2013 is currently moored. On Thursday the JCB private jet touched down in Barbados, which apart from being the venue where England were playing a Test match is also a part of the world in which Bamford has had other ties. Months before he was made a peer by David Cameron, the businessman closed down a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, according to documents seen by the Guardian during the Panama Papers investigation. This had echoes of the previous occasion Bamford had been recommended for a peerage by Cameron, shortly after the Conservatives formed a government in 2010. However, the businessman then withdrew his name from consideration. He told the Telegraph in 2013: \u201cThere was a black mark next to my name with the [Inland] Revenue, but PricewaterhouseCoopers, who had not been my personal accountants, did an in-depth and complete review of my accounts going back 10 years. And actually found that the revenue owed me money. [The allegations were] completely wrong.\u201d Other controversies include a \u20ac39.6m fine for JC Bamford Group in 2000 from the European commission for \u201cvery serious\u201d antitrust violations. The competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said at the time: \u201cIt is shocking that important companies present in all member states still jeopardise the most fundamental principles of the internal market to the detriment of distributors and, ultimately, consumers.\u201d. JCB did not respond to invitations to comment.",

Beer has been flowing at the Griffin brewery <a href=\"https://www.fullers.co.uk/brewery/history-and-heritage\">since the late 1600s</a>. But it is a slice of Britain\u2019s brewing history that, along with other historic London sites, is also a chunk of valuable real estate hemmed in by gentrification.</p> <p>\u201cFuller\u2019s sale of its beer business, including the iconic Griffin brewery in Chiswick, is nothing short of astonishing,\u201d said Paul Hickman, an analyst at investment research firm Edison<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Management have always averred they would never sell the historic brewery, which they have described as Fuller\u2019s \u2018spiritual home\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner has accepted a blockbuster \u00a3250m offer for its entire drinks business from the Japanese beer group Asahi, including its flagship London Pride ale. The company, which has three relatives of the Victorian brewing barons John Fuller, Henry Smith and John Turner on its board, said it had taken the decision to quit beer after 174 years to concentrate on running pubs and hotels. The deal includes the Griffin brewery, its \u201cspiritual home\u201d in west London, on the banks of the Thames, in what is now the upmarket suburb of Chiswick. Simon Emeny, the chief executive of Fuller\u2019s, said: \u201cBrewing has formed an integral part of our history and brand identity, however, the \u2026 driver of our future growth is now our premium pubs and hotels business.\u201d The deal also raised question marks over the future of the London Pride brewery. Beer has been flowing at the Griffin brewery since the late 1600s. But it is a slice of Britain\u2019s brewing history that, along with other historic London sites, is also a chunk of valuable real estate hemmed in by gentrification. \u201cFuller\u2019s sale of its beer business, including the iconic Griffin brewery in Chiswick, is nothing short of astonishing,\u201d said Paul Hickman, an analyst at investment research firm Edison. \u201cManagement have always averred they would never sell the historic brewery, which they have described as Fuller\u2019s \u2018spiritual home\u2019. In addition, London Pride is probably the most successful ale brand in the UK.\u201d A spokesman for Asahi said the Japanese group was committed to making beer at the Chiswick site, which employs 400 people. \u201cBased on the agreement, we will continue to brew beers at the Griffin brewery in Chiswick. It is and always has been the home of London Pride.\u201d However, some redundancies are expected as a result of the deal. The \u00a3250m deal also includes Fuller\u2019s other drinks operations, Cornish Orchards, Dark Star Brewing and Nectar Imports. Other historic London breweries have not survived as property values in the cityhave soared. The Ram brewery in Wandsworth, west London, was sold off by Young\u2019s in 2006 and is being turned into homes and shops, and the Mortlake brewery in south-west London is becoming luxury flats. Analysts speculated that the Griffin site could be worth up to \u00a3100m so could be ripe for even partial redevelopment. Founded in 1845, Emeny became the first outsider to run Fuller\u2019s in 2013.

      "body": "<p>Six years ago, I wrote with a certain amount of sadness a rather gloomy report for the National Trust entitled <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/documents/read-our-natural-childhood-report.pdf\" title=\"\">Natural Childhood</a>. It highlighted the barriers standing in the way of engaging young people with nature: primarily dangers from traffic, parental fears of \u201cstranger danger\u201d, and a growing aversion to exposing children to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/05/closing-schools-spider-children-disconnected-nature-london\" title=\"\">any form of risk</a>. I concluded that we faced the very real danger of a \u201clost generation\u201d, who might never engage with the natural world.</p> <p>Young people were, and still are, we\u2019re told, disconnected from nature, staring at screens when they should be out in the wild. But what I hadn\u2019t predicted back then is that it is these screens that are now enabling our children to join forces to save the natural world. The rise of new technology \u2013 especially social media \u2013 has allowed a new generation to connect with those who share their interests in a way that I never could have believed possible when I wrote Natural Childhood. As one young ornithologist recently told me: \u201cI thought I was the only birder at my school, but on Facebook I found half a dozen others in my local area.\u201d</p> <p>Another budding young naturalist, Abbie Barnes (who climbed Kilimanjaro in the same week she got her A-level results), introduced me to a young man working for conservation in Kenya. When I asked how long they had known each other, Abbie laughed, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve never actually met before, but we\u2019ve connected on social media for the past couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>This enthusiasm can be seen up and down the country and has resulted in some high-profile initiatives partly driven by younger campaigners, many of them involved in Chris Packham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/19/chris-packham-launches-peoples-manifesto-for-wildlife\" title=\"\">People\u2019s Manifesto for Wildlife</a> and People\u2019s Walk for Wildlife, held in London in September 2018. Packham is in no doubt that this generation will make a real difference, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re sharp, informed and very determined. Unleashing the brutal honesty and fabulous ideology of youth is the best chance we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought I was the only birder at my school, but on Facebook I found half a dozen others in my area</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So how did this movement evolve so suddenly and efficiently since my gloomy report? Much of the impetus behind it began at the annual British Birdwatching Fair, or Birdfair, held in Rutland in August, at which people from all over the world gather in England\u2019s smallest county to share their mutual passion for birds.</p> <p>Until recently, one group was conspicuous by its absence: young people between the ages of 16 and 30. Then, thanks to some determined and far-sighted individuals, this began to change. Today, dozens of youngsters visit Birdfair each year, holding debates, swapping stories and forging careers in conservation, environment and the media.</p> <p>Many are members of the organisation <a href=\"https://www.afocusonnature.org/\" title=\"\">A Focus on Nature</a> (AFoN), whose mission is \u201cto connect, support and inspire young people across the UK with an interest in nature and conservation, and provide a voice for the youth conservation movement\u201d.</p> <p>The idea for AFoN actually began at Birdfair, back in 2012, the same year I published my report. A young birder, Lucy McRobert, asked the company Opticron to donate binoculars to young conservationists who might otherwise not be able to afford them. Opticron said yes, and soon the idea of a larger and more ambitious network emerged: connecting young people with more experienced mentors, in areas such as nature writing, wildlife television and conservation. Yet the best guidance often came from the members themselves, who began to develop a peer-to-peer network, offering practical help and advice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8fc07274b7a5132abd952eb6bdbf9e1b28b704b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8fc07274b7a5132abd952eb6bdbf9e1b28b704b/456_214_1959_1175/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bird-watching at an RSPB reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bird-watching at an RSPB reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RSPB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2015, AFoN organised a conference in Cambridge, leading to the publication of the report A Vision for Nature. It contained a thoughtful, clear and workable set of proposals to save our natural heritage, written by the generation who will have to clear up the mess we made.</p> <p>Predictably, despite endorsement from Sir David Attenborough, the report was largely ignored by politicians and the media.

      "bodyText": "Six years ago, I wrote with a certain amount of sadness a rather gloomy report for the National Trust entitled Natural Childhood. It highlighted the barriers standing in the way of engaging young people with nature: primarily dangers from traffic, parental fears of \u201cstranger danger\u201d, and a growing aversion to exposing children to any form of risk. I concluded that we faced the very real danger of a \u201clost generation\u201d, who might never engage with the natural world. Young people were, and still are, we\u2019re told, disconnected from nature, staring at screens when they should be out in the wild. But what I hadn\u2019t predicted back then is that it is these screens that are now enabling our children to join forces to save the natural world. The rise of new technology \u2013 especially social media \u2013 has allowed a new generation to connect with those who share their interests in a way that I never could have believed possible when I wrote Natural Childhood. As one young ornithologist recently told me: \u201cI thought I was the only birder at my school, but on Facebook I found half a dozen others in my local area.\u201d Another budding young naturalist, Abbie Barnes (who climbed Kilimanjaro in the same week she got her A-level results), introduced me to a young man working for conservation in Kenya. When I asked how long they had known each other, Abbie laughed, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve never actually met before, but we\u2019ve connected on social media for the past couple of years.\u201d This enthusiasm can be seen up and down the country and has resulted in some high-profile initiatives partly driven by younger campaigners, many of them involved in Chris Packham\u2019s People\u2019s Manifesto for Wildlife and People\u2019s Walk for Wildlife, held in London in September 2018. Packham is in no doubt that this generation will make a real difference, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re sharp, informed and very determined. Unleashing the brutal honesty and fabulous ideology of youth is the best chance we\u2019ve got.\u201d So how did this movement evolve so suddenly and efficiently since my gloomy report? Much of the impetus behind it began at the annual British Birdwatching Fair, or Birdfair, held in Rutland in August, at which people from all over the world gather in England\u2019s smallest county to share their mutual passion for birds. Until recently, one group was conspicuous by its absence: young people between the ages of 16 and 30. Then, thanks to some determined and far-sighted individuals, this began to change. Today, dozens of youngsters visit Birdfair each year, holding debates, swapping stories and forging careers in conservation, environment and the media. Many are members of the organisation A Focus on Nature (AFoN), whose mission is \u201cto connect, support and inspire young people across the UK with an interest in nature and conservation, and provide a voice for the youth conservation movement\u201d. The idea for AFoN actually began at Birdfair, back in 2012, the same year I published my report. A young birder, Lucy McRobert, asked the company Opticron to donate binoculars to young conservationists who might otherwise not be able to afford them. Opticron said yes, and soon the idea of a larger and more ambitious network emerged: connecting young people with more experienced mentors, in areas such as nature writing, wildlife television and conservation. Yet the best guidance often came from the members themselves, who began to develop a peer-to-peer network, offering practical help and advice. In 2015, AFoN organised a conference in Cambridge, leading to the publication of the report A Vision for Nature. It contained a thoughtful, clear and workable set of proposals to save our natural heritage, written by the generation who will have to clear up the mess we made. Predictably, despite endorsement from Sir David Attenborough, the report was largely ignored by politicians and the media. Since then, however, AFoN committee members have twice been invited to Downing Street to meet environmental advisers and MPs. AFoN is not the only youth organisation to spring up in recent years: others include the Bristol Nature Network and the now-disbanded Next Generation Birders, who in 2017 inspired the Telegraph headline \u201cThe rise of the hipster bird-watcher\u201d. Then there is Mya-Rose Craig, aka Birdgirl, who at 16 years old has already made a real impact in encouraging minority ethnic youngsters to engage with the natural world. So where does AFoN go from here? As the problems facing our environment become ever more acute, it recently launched the #NowforNature campaign, reflecting the importance of social media in getting the message across. AFoN\u2019s earliest members, now in their late 20s and early 30s, are beginning to wield more influence. Some hold positions in conservation organisations, while others work as research scientists, nature reserve wardens, wildlife film-makers, journalists, bloggers and nature writers. They include Matt Williams, public policy officer at the National Trust; Megan Shersby, editorial assistant at BBC Wildlife magazine; and Tiffany Francis, whose first book, Food You Can Forage, was recently published by Bloomsbury; her second, Dark Skies, is due out this year. Lucy McRobert, who stood down as creative director of AFoN in 2016, is now communications manager for the Wildlife Trusts. She organised and helped to run the campaign 30 Days Wild. McRobert is justly proud of what AFoN has achieved and says: \u201cI look forward to seeing the impact our members have, as politicians, business leaders, CEOs, artists, TV producers, land managers and in many other fields.\u201d She has recently taken time out to have her first child, Georgiana, who will come of age in 2036, by which time we will either have messed up the natural world beyond repair, or finally listened to what young people have to say, enabling them to save our planet at the 11th hour. When I look at this generation, and see their commitment, passion, hard work and inspirational actions, I\u2019m inclined to think that they might just succeed.

But all the same, voters chose to return hundreds of pro-remain MPs, from Ken Clarke to David Lammy, who did not pretend their views had changed, regardless of their official party platforms.

Indeed, in a speech earlier this month she had planned to say that no referendum in UK history had ever been challenged, citing the 1997 decision to establish a Welsh assembly as an example where a narrow outcome was respected on all sides. The trouble is, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-46863044\" title=\"\">it wasn\u2019t</a>. The Conservatives opposed the legislation that would have enacted the Welsh result.

It seems referendums are not so sacred after all.</p> <p>Ah, but surely May, Redwood and friends are allowed to change their minds? In the <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/david-davis-asked-by-andrew-marr-about-the-people-vote-on-brexit-1-5678663\" title=\"\">words</a> of that great sage David Davis: \u201cIf a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.\u201d A democratic decision is not etched in stone, fixed for evermore. It is dynamic, with voters and indeed their elected representatives allowed to change their minds in the light of changed facts.</p> <p>We know that May, for one, believes in that principle. If the will of the people were truly inviolable, she would have felt compelled to honour the people\u2019s 2015 instruction to govern for five years with a Tory majority. Instead, she had no qualms about disobeying that instruction \u2013 betraying it, even \u2013 and calling a snap election just two years later, one that would see the people issue a new instruction, directing the Tories to rule with no majority. </p> <p>Perhaps conscious of the weakness of their logic, the will-of-the-people crowd have one last, emotional card to play. Think of it as their very own Project Fear. Betraying the referendum, they say, will empower the far right. But, as the Labour MP Jess Phillips likes to put it, since when did we give the far right a \u201cveto over British democracy\u201d? If we had let them have the casting vote, homosexuality would still be illegal in this country, there would be no black people, and we\u2019d never have gone to war in 1939.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, most of today\u2019s Brexiteers would have shuddered if you\u2019d have suggested a decade ago that Britain\u2019s foreign policy should be determined on the basis of what might best prevent jihadism winning new, radicalised recruits. They\u2019d have called it appeasement. So why do they think Britain\u2019s European policy should now be determined on the basis of what might prevent \u201cTommy Robinson\u201d winning recruits radicalised by a supposed Brexit betrayal?</p> <p>The key point is that a sovereign nation, one truly in control of its destiny, is not bound by such restraints. Not by foreign powers, nor even by the decisions of its own recent past. To think again is not a betrayal of democracy. It is an assertion of it.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

In the words of that great sage David Davis: \u201cIf a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.\u201d A democratic decision is not etched in stone, fixed for evermore. It is dynamic, with voters and indeed their elected representatives allowed to change their minds in the light of changed facts. We know that May, for one, believes in that principle. If the will of the people were truly inviolable, she would have felt compelled to honour the people\u2019s 2015 instruction to govern for five years with a Tory majority. Instead, she had no qualms about disobeying that instruction \u2013 betraying it, even \u2013 and calling a snap election just two years later, one that would see the people issue a new instruction, directing the Tories to rule with no majority. Perhaps conscious of the weakness of their logic, the will-of-the-people crowd have one last, emotional card to play. Think of it as their very own Project Fear. Betraying the referendum, they say, will empower the far right. But, as the Labour MP Jess Phillips likes to put it, since when did we give the far right a \u201cveto over British democracy\u201d? If we had let them have the casting vote, homosexuality would still be illegal in this country, there would be no black people, and we\u2019d never have gone to war in 1939. What\u2019s more, most of today\u2019s Brexiteers would have shuddered if you\u2019d have suggested a decade ago that Britain\u2019s foreign policy should be determined on the basis of what might best prevent jihadism winning new, radicalised recruits. They\u2019d have called it appeasement. So why do they think Britain\u2019s European policy should now be determined on the basis of what might prevent \u201cTommy Robinson\u201d winning recruits radicalised by a supposed Brexit betrayal? The key point is that a sovereign nation, one truly in control of its destiny, is not bound by such restraints. Not by foreign powers, nor even by the decisions of its own recent past. To think again is not a betrayal of democracy. It is an assertion of it. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

In 2014 Nicholas Stride provided secret documents to media about the financial dealings of Russia\u2019s former deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, when he was a contractor for him. Stride says he fled to the UK in 2010 with his Russian-national wife and their two children after they were allegedly threatened and told not to leave Russia. Fearing the UK was not far enough out of reach, the family moved to Australia and say they have spent years living off the grid in the remote Kimberley region in the far north of Western Australia. For several years the family lived essentially in hiding, fearing separation, with neither child able to attend school. \u201cWe travelled non-stop until we reached Broome and soon we found a safe place to live in where a kind family took care of us,\u201d Stride\u2019s daughter, Anya, wrote in a letter in 2017, provided to the Guardian by Stride. \u201cWe were so secluded from the rest of the world for two years that I\u2019d forgotten how to socialise.\u201d Anya Stride, now 18, told the ABC the family ended up \u201chomeless on a beach\u201d and became increasingly desperate when they ran out of money. \u201cMum made bread and we had packs of rice and baked beans \u2026 we lived like that for three months \u2026 off fish and rice,\u201d she said. Stride recently authorised the journalist Michael Weiss to identify him as the source behind a series of reports in Foreign Policy about Shuvalov\u2019s use of offshore accounts and tax havens. Weiss reported that Shuvalov, one of Russia\u2019s richest officials had accumulated a $220m fortune and that he allegedly made extensive use of offshore schemes and a now-defunct bank in Kyrgyzstan. In a 2014 interview Shuvalov denied any wrongdoing. He said he fully complied with Russian law, with his foreign assets held in the equivalent of a \u2018blind trust\u2019.

In March 2018 a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. The prime minister, Theresa May, has said it was almost certainly authorised by the Russian state. In 2006 the Russian critic Alexander Litvinenko was murdered with polonium, a radioactive isotope, put into tea.

His arrival will allow Hazard to revert to his preferred left-sided role, and should add to the armoury of a side who have scored only 13 goals in their last 12 topflight games.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, as a winger, I like to play with top players,\u201d said Hazard. \u201cWith Chelsea I had the chance to play with one of the best in Diego Costa for three years, and Higua\u00edn is one of the best. I also like to play with Olivier (Giroud) when he is playing, with Alvaro (Morata) when he was playing. I just try to have fun with my striker, playing the give and go. If the striker just goes deep, I am going to be in trouble, but Giroud understands this, and that\u2019s why I like to play with him. He is more like a team player than just a striker who scores goal.</p> <p>\u201cDiego was sometimes not this kind of player who you can play a 1-2 with, but in the box he was amazing. He would score a goal and you won and at the end you would have three points. That\u2019s what we need. Higua\u00edn is this kind of player. He can also link with the wingers and the midfield, but he can also be the proper striker. He has scored a lot of goals, when you see his career: Real Madrid, Napoli, Juventus, he has always scored goals. </p> <p>\u201cThis season we have been playing well, but sometimes we miss the one guy just to score one goal. So we had a couple of games where we played well but we didn\u2019t score. We finished with zero goals, but we created a lot of chances. But Higua\u00edn can do that. He is a top striker who can score everywhere.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4af91be4b0a585f6e864b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T11:55:41.849Z\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sounds as if Arnautovic will at least be reintegrated properly after the transfer window has *slammed shut*.</strong> But what a situation ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4af7bfe4b024f0efeae538\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jacob-steinberg\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T11:49:37.066Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u2019s still some doubt over whether Marko Arnautovic will be involved against AFC Wimbledon tomorrow night.</strong> Manuel Pellegrini says the West Ham forward has been training well after being dropped against Bournemouth last week, but the wantaway Austrian\u2019s return in the FA Cup isn\u2019t guaranteed.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s time to wrap this blog up now but be sure to join Rob Smyth later on for minute-by-minute coverage of Arsenal v Manchester United. And given that it is \u2026 wait for it \u2026 DONG! \u2026 five-o\u2019clock, I\u2019ll leave you with today\u2019s edition of The Fiver, which includes poor Thierry Henry, players wearing nappies and a motivational masterclass from Craig Levein. Have a good weekend. It\u2019s UAE 0-0 Australia at half-time in the second Asian Cup quarter-final. Timothy Weah, the son of Liberia President, George Weah, has has said he was frightened before making his goalscoring Celtic debut because fans in Britain are so expectant: I was really scared coming to Celtic because I have heard so much about UK football being tough, the fans expect so much. I was always confident that I would get the hang of things but being young and inexperienced, you come here and there is a lot of expectation and I have to get going because the fans expect so much, coming from PSG and with the name that I have. The debut goal was awesome and I just want to score more goals for the fans and continue to help my team. There is literally nothing I can describe that\u2019s better than scoring at Celtic Park. He has a point about expectancy doesn\u2019t he? It\u2019s one of the factors that has led to the atmosphere steadily getting worse at many grounds where fans turn up, fold their arms, and sit back hoping to be entertained. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case at Celtic, where the Green Brigade in the standing section have helped liven things up, but just generally there is that feel in many British grounds compared to some of those on the continent where it feels fans still want to have a little fun. Get yourself in the mood for tonight\u2019s humdinger in the FA Cup with this brilliant Joy of Six on Arsenal-Manchester United showdowns, by Rob Smyth, including \u201cthe night on which Ferguson finally located United\u2019s G-spot.\u201d Read on to discover which night that was. Some live action shots from the Emirates, where someone appears to be playing tug of war with a very thin piece of rope. This quiz is worth doing just for question nine, which is particularly damning for two well-known pundits: West Ham will help Mark Arnautovic pack his bags and wave him away from the London Stadium if they receive \u00a345m. Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s story: Everton do an awful lot of good work to raise awareness of social issues, be it buying a house to help homeless people, supporting foodbanks or raising money to improve mental health services in Liverpool. Here\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Gomes doing his bit \u2026 Australia kick off against United Arab Emirates in their Asian Cup quarter-final in a few minutes\u2019 time. The winner will face Qatar in the semi-final but it is worth bearing in mind that questions have been raised about the eligibility of some of Qatar\u2019s players. Probably one to keep an eye on \u2026 Rafael Ben\u00edtez doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be putting out his best XI against Watford in the Cup. He knows his club need to guarantee juicy Premier League TV cash if the club are ever to sign another player again. It\u2019s so important. With all the money involved in the Premier League, everyone knows that if you want to grow, if you want to be better, you have to guarantee this money for the next year. To stay in the Premier League is really, really important, but at this stage, if we can go through, we will try to do it. We\u2019re playing at home. Will it be the strongest team in terms of match-fitness? Maybe not. Will it be a team, in my opinion, that can go through or can win the game? Yes, I think so. Pep Guardiola turned up for his press conference sounding a little out of breath. Are there stairs to climb at City\u2019s training ground? He\u2019s asked about whether City can scoop four trophies this season. He\u2019s having none of it. Whenever I see the word fantasy, Baby D kicks off in my head like it\u2019s 1994 again. Roy Hodgson was a bit prickly when asked about potential interest from the Bundesliga leaders in Wilfried Zaha. There has been absolutely no dialogue whatsoever between Borussia Dortmund and Crystal Palace Football Club. If I am going to comment every time a club is linked with Wilf Zaha, I will be talking about it for a long time. Wilf signed a long-term contract with Crystal Palace. He\u2019s very much our player. I\u2019d be very surprised if there were any clubs out there who wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019s very good, but that doesn\u2019t mean to say they are going to try and buy him. You can read more from Roy in this here transfer roundup, which confirms that Bakary Sako is back at Palace, where he is touching his toes and coughing for the doctor before joining on a short-term deal from West Brom: Afternoon readers. Thanks to Nick for getting the weekend started. Some bad news for South Korea fans now in the form of good news for Spurs fans. Qatar have beaten South Korea 1-0 and knocked them out of the Asian Cup! That\u2019s quite the shock, all right, but it does mean that Son Heung-min should be back in London and scampering around for Spurs sooner rather than later. I\u2019m going to take my leave now. It\u2019s been a pleasure. And it\u2019s about to get even pleasurable for you people now that Gregg Bakowski is here to steer you home for the next couple of hours. Leandro Paredes was linked with Chelsea earlier in the transfer window, but he\u2019s now joined Paris Saint-Germain. Crushing BLOW for the Stamford Bridge side as they MISS OUT on LEADING TARGET. Here\u2019s a story about the deal he actually has signed: That\u2019s it \u2013 Qatar are in the Asian Cup semi-finals and will face Australia or UAE! Son Heung-min is coming back to London, in great news for Tottenham and false-nine fans. Qatar lead South Korea! Spurs might get their wish, and the World Cup 2022 hosts might edge to within a game of a huge final for them \u2013 Abdulaziz Hatem has scored 12 minutes from time to make it 1-0! Transfer news! Victor Moses to Fenerbahce! It\u2019s a hefty 18-month loan deal. Moses has been a curious case \u2013 the right man at the right time for Antonio Conte, but in the wilderness before and since. The only sure thing here is that the situation is just awful for all it affects. It was quite a time for the returning oldie shot-stoppers last weekend, wasn\u2019t it? Speroni went back into nets for Palace and we saw Artur Boruc keep a clean sheet \u2013 thanks mainly to Andy Carroll \u2013 for Bournemouth shortly before his own 39th birthday, too. Julian Speroni will retain his place in goal for Crystal Palace against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday despite his high-profile error against Liverpool last weekend, with neither Vicente Guaita or Wayne Hennessey deemed fit enough yet to return to the first-team. Palace secured the young Brazilian goalkeeper, Lucas Perri, on loan from Sao Paulo this week, but the 21-year-old only took part in training for the first time on Friday and will be given time to settle. \u201cI only met Lucas this morning,\u201d said Roy Hodgson. \u201c[The sports director] Dougie Freedman found him on his travels in South America and he made a good impression, so we have loaned him with an option to extend that contract. \u201cMy first impressions back up the impressions Doug had when he met him and saw him play, but it\u2019s a bit early for me to start singing his praises too highly. I\u2019ve only had one training session with him. I\u2019m happy to have a player of that type and quality, a youngster anxious to succeed here in England. Good 21-year-old goalkeepers are hard to find.\u201d Speroni, 39, will be making his 405th appearance for Palace in all competitions in what is likely to prove his final season after a 15-year stint at Selhurst Park. I\u2019m going to this one. I don\u2019t know about \u201cstrong favourites\u201d, but Palace will definitely fancy it. Spurs won\u2019t fancy exiting both domestic cups in the space of 72 hours though \u2013 even if it\u2019s not exactly their fault, it won\u2019t be a great look and will write a few headlines. Which game are you going to this weekend, and why? Please do read this \u2013 our obituary to Hugh McIlvanney, a master of his craft, by Kevin Mitchell: Here\u2019s a line from the Press Association relating to the awful case of Emiliano Sala. The search for him and his pilot has stopped but Lionel Messi is among those asking for it to continue: \u201cLionel Messi has joined calls for the search of the missing plane carrying Cardiff striker Emiliano Sala to be resumed. Guernsey Police called off the search for Sala and pilot David Ibbotson on Thursday afternoon, but the player\u2019s former club Nantes led calls from across football for it to be resumed. \u201cBarcelona star Messi, writing on his Instagram story, said: \u2018As long as there are still possibilities, a hint of hope, we ask you please continue to look for Emiliano. I send all my strength and support to his family and friends. PrayforSala.\u2019 \u201cMessi\u2019s message was accompanied by a photo of his fellow Argentinian.\u201d At half-time in the Asian Cup quarter-final it is goalless between Qatar and South Korea. Can I trouble you with some more Higuain chatter? This time it\u2019s from Gianfranco Zola, who is of course Maurizio Sarri\u2019s assistant. He gave today\u2019s pre-match press conference. Talk about rotating for the cup! I\u2019m sure there are big expectations. I\u2019m also sure Gonzalo is used to it. He\u2019s played for big clubs: Real Madrid, Juventus, Napoli. I\u2019m sure he can handle these expectations. He\u2019s always produced good numbers wherever he\u2019s been. He\u2019s a player who can score in many ways so we hope that he can bring his qualities to this team - at this moment it is very much necessary He\u2019s coming late, but he\u2019s coming in a team that plays a system he knows very well, so this is a big advantage. Here there are the type of players who will help him to do what he can do best. The conditions are good.\u201d Really nice from Stuart James, this, with Newport manager Mike Flynn and Tony Pulis\u2019s brother Raymond. Newport face Middlesbrough tomorrow: You read Andy Hunter\u2019s piece with Accrington a little earlier \u2013 now here is some hot-off-the-wires bullishness from their excellent manager, John Coleman: I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we beat them. I\u2019d be delighted but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. We\u2019re pleased we\u2019re at home, that gives us more of a fighting chance. Derby are the favourites and rightly so, but I was intrigued by how readily all the pundits and the commentators were to write us off. When I was watching that replay [against Southampton], it didn\u2019t matter who was going to win that game, they were going to have a walkover against Accrington, according to the pundits. There\u2019s a little bit of motivation for our players to try to prove them wrong. Lots of people have written us off time and time again and they\u2019ve been left with egg on their faces. We do enjoy trying to confound them. When it all boils down to it, it\u2019s 11 v 11 on Saturday. It\u2019s not their fans versus our fans, it\u2019s not that the fact that they\u2019re a top Championship side with a load of money. At the nitty gritty it\u2019s 11 v 11 and they\u2019ve all got two arms and two legs so we\u2019ll just get on with it.\u201d Yes, a huge game at Carrow Road between Norwich (second) and Sheffield United (fourth, three points behind them). Two sides that you might have expected to fall away, but really haven\u2019t. I think Norwich need to tighten up at the back if they\u2019re to stay the course, but they\u2019ve been mightily entertaining so far. The Blades have, too. What price a goal from former Ipswich striker David McGoldrick? It\u2019s not about football but please have some more McIlvanney brilliance: Which parent should Watford fans choose? Javi Gracia has waded into that one, and may also be talking about league vs FA Cup: Who do you prefer? Do you prefer mummy or do you prefer daddy? It is the same. If you ask Watford supporters whether they want to reach the final or finish seventh, they will say they want to be first in the league, and to win the FA Cup, not seventh. That is our ambition, and that is our target.\u201d Which relative does that make the League Cup? Or the EFL Trophy? Gonzalo Higuain, about whom Eden Hazard speaks a few posts down from this, could well make his Chelsea debut against Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday. He might need some time to get up to speed but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what he can do: Higuain is a proper gladiator of a number nine and an absolutely explosive finisher, and I\u2019ve loved watching him down the years. Marcus Christenson wrote really nicely about him earlier in the week: I am always one of the first people to get tired of big clubs\u2019 fans obsessing over minutiae at the expense of what is a vast, wondrous, infinitely textured world of football \u2013 but I\u2019ll put it out there that Spurs would probably quite like Qatar to beat South Korea. It could mean they get Son Heung-min back for the Watford game in midweek and, given their current absentee list, that could be valuable. Chris Sato emails: \u201cI have also been watching a lot of the Asian Cup. I was impressed with a very young Vietnam side, especially their number 10, who could conceivably make the grade in Europe. Iran look the team to beat, though Japan have been rotating their team through the tournament and are probably just getting into their stride.\u201d South Korea v Qatar kicks off shortly. What\u2019s more important \u2013 Liverpool winning the league or Daniel Sturridge getting a new contract? Might be a tough one to you, but for the man himself (talking to BBC Radio 1 Extra) it\u2019s a no-brainer: I\u2019m staying focused on right now. You\u2019ve got to live in the present, you can never live in the future. I\u2019ve been at Liverpool a long time and I\u2019m happy too. I want to try and help bring the team some success, to win a trophy with them would be amazing. We\u2019ve come close before, finals, almost won the Premier League before but we didn\u2019t quite do it.\u201d I\u2019m back, but far more importantly this is the great Hugh McIlvanney *nailing it*: Those French Fries were, like me in a playground dust-up, entirely insubstantial so I\u2019m nipping out for a sandwich \u2013 back in 10, but we\u2019ll see you right if anything important breaks in the meantime. Here, meanwhile, is some embargoed Spurs reaction from last night. Danny Rose on whether the weight of an 11-year trophy drought is proving insufferable: No. Not really. Obviously we know that we haven\u2019t won a trophy in a while but we are not driving into training thinking about it. We are not training thinking about it. We\u2019ve lost now and it\u2019s not the first thing we are thinking about. We are fully aware that we want to win something but because it has not happened it doesn\u2019t mean it is not going to happen any time soon.\u201d Rose on Harry Fernando Llorente: First of all I am over the moon for Fernando. I hope it has shut a few people up. It\u2019s a good header from him and we are over the moon and because he probably hasn\u2019t featured as much as he\u2019d like but now he is going to get a lot of game time with Harry out and its nice that he\u2019s scored in the right net now and we hope he continues.\u201d Harry Winks on the angst of missing out on another final: Yes. It\u2019s horrible. To get this close to a final and to lose on penalties is always harder than probably losing in 90 minutes. Everyone is proud of ourselves. The way that we fought, the way that we showed our character. It just wasn\u2019t our night.\u201d Eden Hazard is relishing the prospect of playing alongside Gonzalo Higua\u00edn at Chelsea and believes the Argentinian can have a similar positive effect to the departed Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge. Higua\u00edn, who has joined from Juventus on an initial six-month loan with an option for a further 12 months for a fee of 18m Euros, was presented to the crowd prior to kick-off in the Carabao Cup semi-final win over Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday night and could make his debut in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup fourth round tie against Sheffield Wednesday. His arrival will allow Hazard to revert to his preferred left-sided role, and should add to the armoury of a side who have scored only 13 goals in their last 12 topflight games. \u201cFor me, as a winger, I like to play with top players,\u201d said Hazard. \u201cWith Chelsea I had the chance to play with one of the best in Diego Costa for three years, and Higua\u00edn is one of the best. I also like to play with Olivier (Giroud) when he is playing, with Alvaro (Morata) when he was playing. I just try to have fun with my striker, playing the give and go. If the striker just goes deep, I am going to be in trouble, but Giroud understands this, and that\u2019s why I like to play with him. He is more like a team player than just a striker who scores goal. \u201cDiego was sometimes not this kind of player who you can play a 1-2 with, but in the box he was amazing. He would score a goal and you won and at the end you would have three points. That\u2019s what we need. Higua\u00edn is this kind of player. He can also link with the wingers and the midfield, but he can also be the proper striker. He has scored a lot of goals, when you see his career: Real Madrid, Napoli, Juventus, he has always scored goals. \u201cThis season we have been playing well, but sometimes we miss the one guy just to score one goal. So we had a couple of games where we played well but we didn\u2019t score. We finished with zero goals, but we created a lot of chances. But Higua\u00edn can do that. He is a top striker who can score everywhere.\u201d Sounds as if Arnautovic will at least be reintegrated properly after the transfer window has *slammed shut*. But what a situation ... There\u2019s still some doubt over whether Marko Arnautovic will be involved against AFC Wimbledon tomorrow night. Manuel Pellegrini says the West Ham forward has been training well after being dropped against Bournemouth last week, but the wantaway Austrian\u2019s return in the FA Cup isn\u2019t guaranteed. If he\u2019s still moping about not being allowed to move to China, he probably won\u2019t be selected. Millwall v Everton looks a very interesting tie to me. Marco Silva \u2013 neither the second coming nor a fraud, both of which have been variously proclaimed, but just an OK-ish manager \u2013 is under pressure and won\u2019t want to lose at the Den. But towering, goalscoring centre-half Jake Cooper hopes he will! Thanks for this (genuinely). Could we see a UAE v Qatar semi-final, then? Imagine! There is nothing wrong with rotating your squad for the FA Cup, says Chris Hughton, manager of mid-table Brighton: There will always be that balance and as a manager you have to make decisions, and these are big decisions. For where we are at the moment, it\u2019s still very much about stability in the league and picking up league results. When you change a team and you use your squad, it\u2019s not always just about making sure you don\u2019t pick up injuries because you know you\u2019ve got a game on Tuesday night. It\u2019s about the squad and players that are not in the team at the moment that are training hard every day. There is a big value for the squad to keep them involved and for them to be playing some games. You would have players that are very, very close - maybe been on the bench but haven\u2019t played so much - that would be thinking, \u2018if I can\u2019t play a cup game on a Saturday against so-and-so then it\u2019s going to be very difficult for me\u2019.\u201d This is massively worth eight minutes of your time, I really can\u2019t recommend it enough. Watch it and then tell me if *you* can do it on a freezing night in Nunavut: Excited by that, Palace fans? Sako has a hammer of a left foot and is a real talent when fit \u2013 not a bad one to have up your sleeve and, as Dominic says, he can cover more than one position. Crystal Palace are to re-sign the Mali international, Bakary Sako, from West Bromwich Albion with the player currently undergoing a medical at the Premier League club\u2019s Beckenham training centre. Sako had departed Selhurst Park last summer after three injury-affected seasons in south London. Indeed, he had suffered a badly broken ankle in his final appearance for the club, at West Ham a little under a year ago. Palace had still been keen to re-sign the free agent once his contract expired in July, but had already filled their 25-man Premier League squad by the time the summer transfer deadline passed. Sako instead returned to the Black Country, where he had previously excelled for Wolverhampton Wanderers, with West Brom in the Championship but only returned to full fitness in late October and has been restricted to two league starts, scoring a solitary goal in the FA Cup third round victory over Wigan. Sako, who scored six goals under Roy Hodgson last season before that fracture at the London stadium, will return to provide cover both up front and wide, with Palace effectively taking on the last six months of his contract. The 30-year-old\u2019s arrival on a short-term deal will end Palace\u2019s interest in re-signing Yannick Bolasie from Everton. More news: I\u2019m eating, or more correctly eating *from*, a packet of French Fries. I don\u2019t even like them much \u2013 I didn\u2019t realise they still existed! But the canteen had them and my eyes lit up in some sort of weird nostalgia trip. It\u2019s like being in the school playground (or a comments section, haha etc) again. More on Burnley: they have defensive issues, namely at right-back, for the game at City, so we might see James Tarkowski fill in there again. Another chance for City\u2019s kids to make hay? An email from Will, here: \u201cHaving watched Burton v Man City and seen numerous 12-year-olds make their debut. I was wondering if any will be rewarded with a place against Burnley on Saturday. Allow them to be tested by a Premier League team who are not 9-0 down. Who do you think is most likely to feature from the academy?\u201d Ummm ... that Poveda lad? You\u2019ve had a coffee or two now, so get your emails in. What\u2019s occupying your mind ahead of this weekend? Keep it clean and loosely football-ish. This is in today\u2019s paper and it\u2019s excellent, so do take a few minutes for it: Andy Hunter spends a day with Accrington Stanley, who are more than a punchline in a milk advert these days! Will Burnley sign anyone to help with their relegation battle? Possibly, not probably, says Sean Dyche: It\u2019s forever difficult. Possibles, not many probables, at the moment, and that\u2019s just the way it is. January is very tough, everyone knows that, we don\u2019t say it just to throw a line out there, I think it just is. We want the pressure. I wanted to bring in more in the last window. I made that clear to everyone, not because I don\u2019t trust my players or rate them, because I do, but there\u2019s only so much pressure as a manager you can put on players. There\u2019s a different kind of healthy pressure which comes with new signings, with capable signings, because I was a player and you look around and think \u2018I\u2019ve got to look after myself\u2019. That can enhance performances.\u201d For anyone that missed it, the Dons allowed Evans two goals in a woeful 3-0 home defeat to Fleetwood on Tuesday. They did a little better than that against West Ham in the League Cup a few months back, losing 3-1 ... what chance a significant improvement for the third tier\u2019s bottom side when they face off again in the FA Cup? There\u2019s more than one thing to look forward to this weekend. I\u2019ll be specific: there are 10 things, and they are below. Yesterday I saw a suggestion that, even while out of work, Jardim still sees many of the Monaco players when he pops out to buy his (presumably diamond-encrusted) croissants every morning, so they won\u2019t need to spend much time catching up. You might not know it because it\u2019s all but impossible to find on TV in the UK, but the Asian Cup is currently happening. It\u2019s at the quarter-final stage and there are two games coming up today: South Korea v Qatar and UAE v Australia. If I can catch sight or sound of either, I\u2019ll keep you in the loop about how they\u2019re going. By all means send some thoughts about this shortsightedly blackouted competition, too. It\u2019ll educate us! On the subject of Pellegrini \u2013 has he calmed the Arnautovic storm for now? Doesn\u2019t look like the Austrian is going to get his China wish at the moment, and if he does then the Hammers will have precious little time to replace him. But what impact will dropping him last weekend have? Manuel Pellegrini is up with the lark ahead of West Ham\u2019s visit to AFC Wimbledon. And he has words of advice for youngsters Declan Rice and Grady Diangana, who have both signed new deals recently: Diangana deserves it, he has taken a step with the squad of our team \u2013 he was in the under 23s before and now he is working every day with our squad. I think he has a lot of quality and we will see an important player in the future of this club. Now his development will depend on his ambitions and his mind, to try to improve every day. I try always to tell young players that they are in the most dangerous part of their careers, when they think that they have arrived but they have not arrived yet. They have started arriving, but they must improve every day working with professional players. Fortunately for me in all the teams I managed before I\u2019ve had young players to try to develop their qualities. I hope West Ham will be exactly the same. Declan started improving a lot, he played last season, now we have Grady to help to be an important player for West Ham.\u201d Juan Mata couldn\u2019t sign for Arsenal ... could he? Sort the wheat from the chaff in today\u2019s Rumour Mill: Last night we heard the very sad news that Hugh McIlvanney, a genuine legend of sportswriting and inspiration to so many, has died aged 84. A number of memories and tributes are gathered here \u2013 and you can leave your own below the piece: Where\u2019s it all gone wrong for Thierry Henry then? I was down in Monaco last week to watch them play Nice, spoke to him briefly and got the impression he felt things were coming together a little. But I also sensed frustration at quite a few things: his players, the league in general, VAR ... is it the case, perhaps, that there\u2019s a bit of the Roy Keane there? A man who can\u2019t necessarily tolerate the weaknesses or foibles of others? Here we ... here we ... here we jolly well go! It\u2019s time to get our Friday on and it\u2019s a busy one. Our main focus, in terms of matches at least, is the FA Cup fourth round \u2013 with Arsenal hosting Manchester United tonight and plenty more spread throughout the weekend. I\u2019ll start us off by showing you the fixtures: Friday: Bristol City v Bolton; Arsenal v Manchester United Saturday: Accrington Stanley v Derby; Shrewsbury v Wolves; Middlesbrough v Newport; Swansea v Gillingham; Newcastle v Watford; Brighton v West Brom; Doncaster v Oldham; Manchester City v Burnley; Portsmouth v QPR; Millwall v Everton; AFC Wimbledon v West Ham Sunday: Crystal Palace v Tottenham; Chelsea v Sheffield Wednesday Monday: Barnet v Brentford But we can talk about anything else that takes our fancy, too. Thierry Henry is about to be shown the door at Monaco! Chelsea are in the League Cup final! There are some vital Championship games tomorrow, including Norwich v Sheffield United at the top! Tell me what\u2019s getting you talking ahead of this footballing weekend \u2013 email address and Twitter are above.",

      "bodyText": "An entire year group at a European state school in Oxfordshire could be forced to abandon their education in the event of a no-deal Brexit, school leaders have said. Year 11 students at Europa school in Culham, Oxfordshire, are studying for a European baccalaureate (EB), but are currently in limbo, with many believing they will not be able to complete their education if the UK crashes out of the EU. The school teaches a multilingual curriculum and is the only school in the country that offers the EB, a qualification backed by the EU that it would be unable to offer in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThe problem they face is they have not been taking the course that would lead to a GCSE, they\u2019ve studied the European school curriculum. Even if we asked them to go to another sixth form, they\u2019re not prepared or qualified for that,\u201d said Andrew Parker, chair of governors at the school. Last December, parents received a letter from the school advising them to identify alternative schooling if Europa school can no longer offer the EB. Gordon Jowett, whose daughter is in year 11 at the school, said: \u201cWe absolutely adore the school, but it\u2019s a school that\u2019s going to have a whole year group knocked out of it in a rather surreal way. My eldest daughter is in no-man\u2019s land at the moment.\u201d Students who are keen to continue the EB could move to another EU member state, but Parker said such a move would be \u201cdetrimental to family life\u201d. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt they have a strong sense of identity of belonging together and that identity is under enormous strain.\u201d Jowett said: \u201cThe UK is our country. I\u2019m British, my wife\u2019s Italian. We don\u2019t want to move. It\u2019s really frustrating.\u201d The school has pupils from the ages of four to 18. In primary school, students are taught in two languages \u2013 English for half the week and either French, German or Spanish for the remainder of the week. Max Blanfjaar, 15, said he was frustrated and angry with the situation. \u201cI know a few people who are tired of the uncertainty, and people are going \u2013 which is also upsetting to see people you\u2019ve known since you were four basically being bullied away,\u201d he said. Blanfjaar, whose parents are Dutch, is currently studying in both English and Dutch. He said he was drawn to the multiculturalism of the school and did not want to be forced to chose between either language. Emma Harries, 15, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really scary that our future with the EB could be taken away from us.\u201d She said she did not want to go to another school. \u201cThe atmosphere is something you wouldn\u2019t find somewhere else.

      "bodyText": "Around 40 climate activists have staged a peaceful occupation of the Scottish parliament\u2019s debating chamber, urging MSPs to introduce much tougher climate targets. Campaigners with the recently formed direct action group Extinction Rebellion posed as tourists on a visit to Holyrood before staging an hour-long sit-in in the chamber. There were no arrests. Police escorted the protesters from the building through a side entrance and they were greeted by cheers from other campaigners gathered outside the parliament. Extinction Rebellion was launched last October with the backing of 100 academics and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Friday\u2019s occupation was the group\u2019s first direct action in Scotland, after sit-down protests in Parliament Square, Westminster, and at climate talks in Poland. Robert Alcock, a builder and eco-designer who took part in the sit-in, said the group wanted Holyrood to take up far more ambitious CO2 reduction policies geared towards cutting net emissions to zero by 2025, in line with analysis from the International Panel on Climate Change. Extinction Rebellion wants Scotland to convene a citizens\u2019 assembly to decide how to achieve that goal through consensus. It would be made up of 73 members of the public drawn from Holyrood\u2019s 73 single-member constituencies, and have the power to revise the parliament\u2019s climate bills. The Scottish government insists the country\u2019s climate policies, enacted by Holyrood, are among the most ambitious and far-reaching in the world, and the most radical from any UK legislature. Scotland\u2019s first target to reduce CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020 has already been met, and the parties are now debating a fresh target to hit 90% by 2050 in a new climate bill. Asked why Extinction Rebellion was targeting Holyrood rather than oil companies in Aberdeen or the oil refinery at Grangemouth west of Edinburgh, Alcock said: \u201cThis is a very symbolic place because it is representing the people of Scotland, and today is Burns Day, the day of Scotland\u2019s national poet. \u201cWhile it is relatively progressive compared to other countries it comes nowhere near what is necessary to really address the gravity of the climate emergency.\u201d A Scottish parliament spokeswoman said: \u201cAround 40 individuals on a free public tour refused to leave the chamber for approximately 60 minutes before leaving peacefully at 1.30pm. \u201cThe public tour route takes in the debating chamber when parliament is not sitting. There was no impact on parliamentary business.\u201d",

Laura Pitter, senior national security counsel in Human Rights Watch\u2019s (HRW) US program said that one of the problems with material witness laws is that the warrants are \u201cissued in secret so we don\u2019t know what they are based on\u201d. \u201cAnother problem is that the process for challenging the detention is often conducted in secret so we don\u2019t know what the grounds are for even using them in the first place or whether the process has been fair,\u201d added Pitter, who has studied the laws with HRW, particularly its expanded usage after 9/11.

Both are under seal.\u201d In other jurisdictions, usage is less rare. In Hashemi\u2019s home city of New Orleans, the district attorney requested more than 150 material witness warrants over an eight-year period, many of which were filed against crime victims hesitant to testify. Hashemi said she was not at liberty to discuss the exact nature of the case she was detained to testify on, but said she was questioned in front of a grand jury on four separate occasions, which was confirmed by disclosures made in a federal court order on Thursday. Hashemi said the case \u201chad a lot to do with me being an American and where I live, which is the Islamic Republic of Iran, and related to a job situation\u201d. Last week a US government source told Reuters that the grand jury was hearing arguments on Wednesday whether Hashemi\u2019s employer, Press TV, is a \u201cpropaganda outlet\u201d that failed to register with the justice department as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d.

It is a classic hot-button issue, combining \u2013 on the pro-vaccine side \u2013 the elegance and rigour of evidence-based science, with the white-hot primal rage of parental protectiveness. </p> <p>Yet the roots of the anti-vax movement are telling. Like so much that is attached to parenting, and specifically motherhood, the movement is a highly significant cultural development that is siloed and, broadly speaking, ignored until some tragedy happens. I believe this is on the specious grounds that parenting is apolitical \u2013 or more precisely, nothing a mother could think or do could ever have wider contextual meaning. As a parable, but also, a truth, you can write a book about the culture of parenting, and it\u2019ll get stuck in the health section, and nobody will ever notice or read it except by accident, when they will find it has very little information on health.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2019/jan/07/anti-vaccine-movement-lives-risk-measles-mmr-andrew-wakefield\">Is the anti-vaccine movement putting lives at risk? Podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To distrust medicine, or to give it its archaic name, \u201cwestern medicine\u201d, was once the preserve of the hippy left. In the early days of the anti-vax movement, at the turn of this century, those who distrusted vaccinations spanned the political spectrum. Only in the past decade has it become the drum beat of the American right, and it\u2019s only in the past few years that prominent Republicans \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/03/medical-experts-vaccines-safe-chris-christie-rand-paul\" title=\"\">Chris Christie and Rand Paul in 2015</a> \u2013 took it on as a rallying cry. How an issue gets from US campaign literature to a Facebook page in Hebden Bridge is hard to pinpoint; suffice it to say that, from Islamophobia to cases such as baby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/15/charlie-gard-parents-set-up-foundation-with-donations\" title=\"\">Charlie Gard\u2019s</a>, we know that it happens.</p> <p>It dovetails with a generalised anti-science movement: climate-change denial, scorn for any epidemiological data about inequality and its effects, a generalised repudiation of expertise. We tend to look at each trend individually, and through the wrong end of the telescope. Climate-change deniers are funded by the fossil-fuel industry; free market fundamentalists also, conveniently, run hedge funds. And these tawdry explanations seem to make sense but miss the point: it\u2019s not narrow self-interest that drives the fightback against evidence, but rather, an entire worldview.</p> <p>Scientific discovery tends towards the collective: it takes the hive mind to produce it, and the answers it provides tend to be socially located: vaccinate; redistribute; recycle. Science is levelling and pluralistic: it situates authority not with any one person or type of person, but in the disembodied, infinitely accessible space of evidence. Whether it\u2019s a measles jab or a climate model, the far right hates it. Furthermore, when facts have been contested so energetically as to have been effectively obliterated from the terrain, all that is left is feeling; power is restored to the person who feels the most strongly, where that person always believed it belonged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/21/measles-cases-at-highest-for-20-years-in-europe-as-anti-vaccine-movement-grows\">Measles cases at highest for 20 years in Europe, as anti-vaccine movement grows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question is, how did this ideological crankery find an audience? Why haven\u2019t people been more resilient, more wedded to the world of the evidence-base? Here the contexts peel apart: climate-change denial is a lot more comforting to believe than climate-change evidence. In parenting, the established authorities, whether the World Trade Organization or the NHS, have become defined by such caution (don\u2019t sit on new furniture, formula milk gives you cancer) that a wild west mentality has taken over.</p> <p>Experts, after a decade or so of over-statement, have undermined themselves, and everything has to be double-checked on Facebook. Yet the root solution is the same: somehow the credibility of evidence has to radically renew itself; an epidemic of measles may be the most dramatic risk, otherwise, but it will be only the end of a tangled skein.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

But where would be the fun in that? They have surprisingly little to say on this soil-transmitted disease. So we\u2019re already scraping the floor of public safety, for no better reason than that a wild conspiracy theory that in another age would have been discredited, bringing down with it one, maybe two reputations, got lucky with a networked age and a global culture war. It is a classic hot-button issue, combining \u2013 on the pro-vaccine side \u2013 the elegance and rigour of evidence-based science, with the white-hot primal rage of parental protectiveness. Yet the roots of the anti-vax movement are telling. Like so much that is attached to parenting, and specifically motherhood, the movement is a highly significant cultural development that is siloed and, broadly speaking, ignored until some tragedy happens. I believe this is on the specious grounds that parenting is apolitical \u2013 or more precisely, nothing a mother could think or do could ever have wider contextual meaning. As a parable, but also, a truth, you can write a book about the culture of parenting, and it\u2019ll get stuck in the health section, and nobody will ever notice or read it except by accident, when they will find it has very little information on health. To distrust medicine, or to give it its archaic name, \u201cwestern medicine\u201d, was once the preserve of the hippy left. In the early days of the anti-vax movement, at the turn of this century, those who distrusted vaccinations spanned the political spectrum. Only in the past decade has it become the drum beat of the American right, and it\u2019s only in the past few years that prominent Republicans \u2013 Chris Christie and Rand Paul in 2015 \u2013 took it on as a rallying cry. How an issue gets from US campaign literature to a Facebook page in Hebden Bridge is hard to pinpoint; suffice it to say that, from Islamophobia to cases such as baby Charlie Gard\u2019s, we know that it happens. It dovetails with a generalised anti-science movement: climate-change denial, scorn for any epidemiological data about inequality and its effects, a generalised repudiation of expertise. We tend to look at each trend individually, and through the wrong end of the telescope. Climate-change deniers are funded by the fossil-fuel industry; free market fundamentalists also, conveniently, run hedge funds. And these tawdry explanations seem to make sense but miss the point: it\u2019s not narrow self-interest that drives the fightback against evidence, but rather, an entire worldview. Scientific discovery tends towards the collective: it takes the hive mind to produce it, and the answers it provides tend to be socially located: vaccinate; redistribute; recycle. Science is levelling and pluralistic: it situates authority not with any one person or type of person, but in the disembodied, infinitely accessible space of evidence. Whether it\u2019s a measles jab or a climate model, the far right hates it. Furthermore, when facts have been contested so energetically as to have been effectively obliterated from the terrain, all that is left is feeling; power is restored to the person who feels the most strongly, where that person always believed it belonged. The question is, how did this ideological crankery find an audience? Why haven\u2019t people been more resilient, more wedded to the world of the evidence-base? Here the contexts peel apart: climate-change denial is a lot more comforting to believe than climate-change evidence. In parenting, the established authorities, whether the World Trade Organization or the NHS, have become defined by such caution (don\u2019t sit on new furniture, formula milk gives you cancer) that a wild west mentality has taken over. Experts, after a decade or so of over-statement, have undermined themselves, and everything has to be double-checked on Facebook. Yet the root solution is the same: somehow the credibility of evidence has to radically renew itself; an epidemic of measles may be the most dramatic risk, otherwise, but it will be only the end of a tangled skein. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

But for it to gain traction, the stories we tell each other \u2013 and ourselves \u2013 must be as complete as possible.</p> <p>By placing responsibility for initiating empathy-building with Israelis, \u201cbecause they are the stronger party\u201d, Baron-Cohen\u2019s argument for \u201crehumanising the other\u201d makes a rare acknowledgment of the power disparity at the heart of the Israel-Palestine trauma. Rare too is his foregrounding of the Palestinian experience: his story describes the devastation wrought on a people who have paid a huge price for but played no part in the Holocaust.</p> <p>However, for each people to work with the other\u2019s painful history, more needs adding to the mix: that Zionist leaders untruthfully \u201csold\u201d Palestine to desperate European Jews as a \u201cland without a people for a people without a land\u201d; that in Baron-Cohen\u2019s \u201ctwo major waves of antisemitism\u201d, the majority destinations of choice among Europe\u2019s fleeing Jews were English-speaking countries, not Palestine; that millions of Israel\u2019s Jews come from other Middle East countries, with a story largely ignored by Israel\u2019s Holocaust-based narrative.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a more extensive Palestinian experience. Where are the millions of Palestinian refugees and children of refugees within Baron-Cohen\u2019s vision? And though surely unintentional, when he named \u201cIsraelis\u201d as the \u201cstronger party\u201d, he wrote out of the empathy stakes the Palestinian 20% of Israel\u2019s citizens. Always treated as second-class, Palestinian citizens of Israel are now legislatively reduced to interlopers within their own country by the new and nakedly racist nation-state law.<br><strong>Naomi Wayne</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Baron-Cohen writes that \u201cfive Arab armies invaded\u201d Israel in 1948. What actually happened was that Arab armies moved up to the borders allocated to Israel in the UN partition plan to prevent the Israeli army taking over areas allocated to the Arabs. They failed, of course, and as a result Israel expanded its territory by 23% in 1948 at the expense of the Palestinians, and added the rest in 1967.</p> <p>Baron-Cohen\u2019s plea for empathy has a hollow ring to the parents of children deliberately killed by Israeli snipers. No value would be served in the conflict by encouraging Palestinians whose casualties run into thousands to empathise with the tiny percentage of Israelis in former Arab towns near Gaza who are affected by rockets. And clearly, if the Israeli army instituted an empathy programme among its soldiers it could no longer do its job of oppressing Palestinians. <br><strong>Karl Sabbagh</strong><br><em>Author, A Modest Proposal</em><em> \u2026 to solve the Palestine-Israel Conflict</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a mediator with a longstanding interest in empathy in conflict resolution, I agree with Simon Baron-Cohen. The understanding of an enemy\u2019s experience can be transformative. By listening and being listened to, each side, which previously demonised the other, has the opportunity to discover a shared humanity: what seems to divide also unites. Out of this recognition arises a desire to solve problems and reach agreements for the benefit of both.</p> <p>Jo Berry, founder of Building Bridges for Peace and daughter of the late Sir Anthony Berry, who died in the Brighton hotel bombing, states: \u201cIf I empathise with you \u2026 I am going to want for you what I want for me and my loved ones: your human rights, your dignity, your security, all your needs met.\u201d Jo\u2019s work is another \u201cdrop in the desert\u201d, as Baron-Cohen puts it \u2013 along with many groups of like-minded individuals joining together within divided communities and across the world.

By placing responsibility for initiating empathy-building with Israelis, \u201cbecause they are the stronger party\u201d, Baron-Cohen\u2019s argument for \u201crehumanising the other\u201d makes a rare acknowledgment of the power disparity at the heart of the Israel-Palestine trauma. Rare too is his foregrounding of the Palestinian experience: his story describes the devastation wrought on a people who have paid a huge price for but played no part in the Holocaust. However, for each people to work with the other\u2019s painful history, more needs adding to the mix: that Zionist leaders untruthfully \u201csold\u201d Palestine to desperate European Jews as a \u201cland without a people for a people without a land\u201d; that in Baron-Cohen\u2019s \u201ctwo major waves of antisemitism\u201d, the majority destinations of choice among Europe\u2019s fleeing Jews were English-speaking countries, not Palestine; that millions of Israel\u2019s Jews come from other Middle East countries, with a story largely ignored by Israel\u2019s Holocaust-based narrative. There\u2019s also a more extensive Palestinian experience. Where are the millions of Palestinian refugees and children of refugees within Baron-Cohen\u2019s vision? And though surely unintentional, when he named \u201cIsraelis\u201d as the \u201cstronger party\u201d, he wrote out of the empathy stakes the Palestinian 20% of Israel\u2019s citizens. Always treated as second-class, Palestinian citizens of Israel are now legislatively reduced to interlopers within their own country by the new and nakedly racist nation-state law. Naomi Wayne London \u2022 Simon Baron-Cohen writes that \u201cfive Arab armies invaded\u201d Israel in 1948. What actually happened was that Arab armies moved up to the borders allocated to Israel in the UN partition plan to prevent the Israeli army taking over areas allocated to the Arabs. They failed, of course, and as a result Israel expanded its territory by 23% in 1948 at the expense of the Palestinians, and added the rest in 1967. Baron-Cohen\u2019s plea for empathy has a hollow ring to the parents of children deliberately killed by Israeli snipers. No value would be served in the conflict by encouraging Palestinians whose casualties run into thousands to empathise with the tiny percentage of Israelis in former Arab towns near Gaza who are affected by rockets. And clearly, if the Israeli army instituted an empathy programme among its soldiers it could no longer do its job of oppressing Palestinians. Karl Sabbagh Author, A Modest Proposal \u2026 to solve the Palestine-Israel Conflict \u2022 As a mediator with a longstanding interest in empathy in conflict resolution, I agree with Simon Baron-Cohen. The understanding of an enemy\u2019s experience can be transformative. By listening and being listened to, each side, which previously demonised the other, has the opportunity to discover a shared humanity: what seems to divide also unites. Out of this recognition arises a desire to solve problems and reach agreements for the benefit of both. Jo Berry, founder of Building Bridges for Peace and daughter of the late Sir Anthony Berry, who died in the Brighton hotel bombing, states: \u201cIf I empathise with you \u2026 I am going to want for you what I want for me and my loved ones: your human rights, your dignity, your security, all your needs met.\u201d Jo\u2019s work is another \u201cdrop in the desert\u201d, as Baron-Cohen puts it \u2013 along with many groups of like-minded individuals joining together within divided communities and across the world. That is where our hope lies.

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee tells us \u201cBritain, a meritocracy? That\u2019s fantasy\u201d (25 January). That\u2019s a great relief! If Britain is ever to escape from a divisive society that values only the academic qualities that can be measured by examination, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology or languages, it needs also to value the human qualities that underpin a civilised society, such as citizenship, parenting, caring and working life. It is no wonder we have so many millions of disenchanted men and women when they see a meritocratic elite that is rewarded for its academic excellence by far higher pay and positions of influence. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 This week the Guardian published two stories on UK publishing\u2019s failure to improve racial and regional diversity (Publishers failing to improve racial and regional diversity, survey finds, 16 January; UK publishers need to change the story when it comes to race, theguardian.com, 18 January). While both quote statistics with regard to respondents who identify as BAME, and refer to the white upper- and middle-class values that dominate (and limit) the industry, neither mentions the dominance of privately educated employees. I have little doubt that, were the publishing industry (or indeed the Guardian) to take steps to represent the 92% of the UK population who attended state schools, then the current situation would improve significantly.

Tweddle, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey and my recovery is still ongoing. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be 100% again. \u201cThe effects of my accident still interrupt my daily life, and aside from the severe physical injuries at the start, the hardest part of the recovery process has been the psychological element, dealing with and processing the whole accident and the aftermath of what happened. \u201cI said before that I don\u2019t want this accident to define me, and I work hard every day to ensure that isn\u2019t the case. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we have had to seek court proceedings, as we had hoped the makers of the programme might be willing to work with us to settle the case. But I just want to make sure that there is full accountability for people involved in creating shows like this and to help prevent others having to go through what I have for the past three years.\u201d",

In a sense this was not a surprise: the Emerald City is a rugby hotbed, home to the storied Saracens club, plugged in cross-border with teams from British Columbia.</p> <p>The Seawolves were coached to the title by a Canadian stalwart, 55-cap scrum-half Phil Mack. It wasn\u2019t a straightforward ask for the 33-year-old: he continued to lead on the field after taking over off it when the original coach wasn\u2019t granted a visa.</p> <p>\u201cAnybody that\u2019s been in a player-coach role knows there\u2019s some hurdles,\u201d he says now, in a break from pre-season training. \u201cYou\u2019re making decisions for an entire team and it\u2019s difficult. There are really tough conversations to have with the guys you\u2019re not going to pick, when you\u2019re picking yourself.</p> <p>\u201cBut the players checked their egos at the door. The leadership group we have, we have a ton of experience internationally from props out to the wings. So with that group pushing in the same direction it really helped.\u201d</p> <p>In that group is the English full-back or wing Matthew Turner, like Mack an experienced hand on the World Sevens circuit. There is also a new fly-half, the highly rated USA youngster Ben Cima, to replace retiring Australian Peter Smith. A raw-boned pack is once again seasoned with Canadian brawn.</p> <p>Mack is now <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/other-sports/with-new-full-time-coach-seawolves-look-to-build-on-last-seasons-championship-success-in-2019/\">assistant coach to Richie Walker</a>, the former USA women's sevens coach <a href=\"https://www.usmlr.com/news/mlr-kickoff-ep-17-week-one-coming-in-hot-ft-richie-walker-hc-of-seattle-seawolves/\">named to the position</a> late in the day after the South African Anton Moolman also suffered <a href=\"https://www.tukwilareporter.com/sports/seawolves-are-game-ready/\">visa</a> problems.

      "bodyText": "Major League Rugby kicks off its second season this weekend with two new teams to watch. The Toronto Arrows will join Rugby United New York in taking on the Seattle Seawolves, Glendale Raptors, Austin Elite, Houston SaberCats, San Diego Legion, NOLA Gold and the Utah Warriors. Next year, the New England Free Jacks and as yet unnamed teams in Washington and Atlanta are scheduled to join the professional rugby union competition. Prospective teams continue to build in Dallas, Los Angeles, Ohio and elsewhere. Fascinating stories are brewing. Consider two. In Seattle, the Seawolves will open on Sunday against the team they beat in the first championship game, the Raptors from Colorado. Thousands of miles away in wintry Gotham, New York are preparing to enter the fray. Seattle won MLR in year one rather in the way Wasps used to win the English Premiership: they didn\u2019t finish top of the regular-season ladder, losing at home and away to Glendale, but they turned things round on neutral ground in the final. In a sense this was not a surprise: the Emerald City is a rugby hotbed, home to the storied Saracens club, plugged in cross-border with teams from British Columbia. The Seawolves were coached to the title by a Canadian stalwart, 55-cap scrum-half Phil Mack. It wasn\u2019t a straightforward ask for the 33-year-old: he continued to lead on the field after taking over off it when the original coach wasn\u2019t granted a visa. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s been in a player-coach role knows there\u2019s some hurdles,\u201d he says now, in a break from pre-season training. \u201cYou\u2019re making decisions for an entire team and it\u2019s difficult. There are really tough conversations to have with the guys you\u2019re not going to pick, when you\u2019re picking yourself. \u201cBut the players checked their egos at the door. The leadership group we have, we have a ton of experience internationally from props out to the wings. So with that group pushing in the same direction it really helped.\u201d In that group is the English full-back or wing Matthew Turner, like Mack an experienced hand on the World Sevens circuit. There is also a new fly-half, the highly rated USA youngster Ben Cima, to replace retiring Australian Peter Smith. A raw-boned pack is once again seasoned with Canadian brawn. Mack is now assistant coach to Richie Walker, the former USA women's sevens coach named to the position late in the day after the South African Anton Moolman also suffered visa problems. Being an assistant, Mack says, offers a chance to \u201cfocus on my personal game a little bit more, to learn from someone seasoned in coaching and pick up anything I can\u201d. He\u2019ll attempt that in a year which should end with the culmination of his Canada career: a second Rugby World Cup, in Pool B in Japan. Seattle weren\u2019t unbeaten at home in year one but by the end of it they had made Starfire, the Tukwila venue where the Sounders of MLS play cup games, the most forbidding MLR venue. The \u201csold out\u201d signs went up and likely will again, a raucous crowd ready to make things uncomfortable for any visiting team. \u201cAny time you win something you kind of put a target on your back,\u201d Mack says. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be a different challenge, we have to come up with a way to keep that same mentality we had last year, which was pretty humble and we worked pretty hard. \u201cBut when teams come to Starfire it\u2019s a different experience to what the rest of the league is offering and it\u2019s a massive boost to us as players to have that support. It shows what a fanbase Seattle can generate.\u201d Ticketholders and armchair fans thus anticipate a rematch of the championship game in which Mack expects a \u201chighly motivated\u201d Coloradan team to produce fireworks on the pitch, matching those laid on off it. Generating fanbases, of course, is what MLR is all about, particularly in Toronto and New York. What with being a great of the Canadian game, Mack has \u201cloads of friends who play on the Toronto team\u201d and so looks forward to that long trip east. He\u2019s also, \u201clike everybody\u201d, curious \u201cto see what New York\u2019s going to bring to the table.\u201d Rugby United New York, or RUNY, operate out of owner James Kennedy\u2019s construction company office at the bottom of Broadway, opposite Wall Street, a couple of blocks down from Trinity Church where Alexander Hamilton lies buried.

      "body": "<p>What may be one of the oldest known rocks from Earth has been found in the material that Apollo 14 astronauts brought home from the moon nearly 50 years ago.</p> <p>It is thought that the rock, made up of quartz, feldspar and zircon, crystallised deep beneath Earth\u2019s surface about 4bn years ago and was catapulted towards the moon in a collision with an asteroid or comet soon afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an extraordinary find that helps paint a better picture of early Earth and the bombardment that modified our planet during the dawn of life,\u201d said David Kring, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas.</p> <p>Chemical analysis of the 2g fragment suggests it formed more than 12 miles underground in an oxidising environment, which can be found on Earth but not on the moon. A major impact then excavated the rock and blasted it into space, according to a report in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202\">Earth and Planetary Science Letters</a>.</p> <p>At the time of the collision, the moon was three times closer to Earth than it is today. After the rock came to rest on the lunar surface, another impact 3.9bn years ago partially melted and buried it, scientists believe.</p> <p>The final impact that affected the rock happened about 26m years ago when an asteroid slammed into the moon and made the Cone crater, measuring 340 metres wide and 75 metres deep, near the Apollo 14 landing site. </p> <p>That impact resurfaced the rock, which was then collected by the Nasa astronauts. The Apollo 14 crew spent more than 33 hours on the lunar surface in February 1971 and brought home nearly 43kg of moon rocks.</p> <p>The researchers, led by Jeremy Bellucci and Alexander Nemchin at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and Curtin University in Australia respectively, concede that the rock may have formed on the moon, but argue that this would have required conditions not previously seen in lunar samples. </p> <p>To have a lunar origin, the rock would have had to crystallise at tremendous depth where rocks tend to have very different compositions, they write.</p> <p>The Earth formed in the early solar system 4.5bn years ago. The oldest known fragment of Earth rock is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/28/fossils.geology\">zircon crystal from Western Australia</a>. The sliver of material, the same width as two human hairs, has been dated to 4.4bn years old. </p>",

It is thought that the rock, made up of quartz, feldspar and zircon, crystallised deep beneath Earth\u2019s surface about 4bn years ago and was catapulted towards the moon in a collision with an asteroid or comet soon afterwards. \u201cIt is an extraordinary find that helps paint a better picture of early Earth and the bombardment that modified our planet during the dawn of life,\u201d said David Kring, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. Chemical analysis of the 2g fragment suggests it formed more than 12 miles underground in an oxidising environment, which can be found on Earth but not on the moon. A major impact then excavated the rock and blasted it into space, according to a report in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. At the time of the collision, the moon was three times closer to Earth than it is today. After the rock came to rest on the lunar surface, another impact 3.9bn years ago partially melted and buried it, scientists believe. The final impact that affected the rock happened about 26m years ago when an asteroid slammed into the moon and made the Cone crater, measuring 340 metres wide and 75 metres deep, near the Apollo 14 landing site. That impact resurfaced the rock, which was then collected by the Nasa astronauts. The Apollo 14 crew spent more than 33 hours on the lunar surface in February 1971 and brought home nearly 43kg of moon rocks. The researchers, led by Jeremy Bellucci and Alexander Nemchin at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and Curtin University in Australia respectively, concede that the rock may have formed on the moon, but argue that this would have required conditions not previously seen in lunar samples. To have a lunar origin, the rock would have had to crystallise at tremendous depth where rocks tend to have very different compositions, they write. The Earth formed in the early solar system 4.5bn years ago. The oldest known fragment of Earth rock is a zircon crystal from Western Australia. The sliver of material, the same width as two human hairs, has been dated to 4.4bn years old.",

This, we told ourselves, was \u201cthe direction of history\u201d. We must make a clean break with that old conviction. We don\u2019t have a choice. We must now fight for the idea of Europe or see it perish beneath the waves of populism. In response to the nationalist and identitarian onslaught, we must rediscover the spirit of activism or accept that resentment and hatred will surround and submerge us. Urgently, we need to sound the alarm against these arsonists of soul and spirit who, from Paris to Rome, with stops along the way in Barcelona, Budapest, Dresden, Vienna and Warsaw, want to make a bonfire of our freedoms. In this strange defeat of \u201cEurope\u201d that looms on the horizon; this new crisis of the European conscience that promises to tear down everything that made our societies great, honourable, and prosperous, there is a challenge greater than any since the 1930s: a challenge to liberal democracy and its values. \u2022 Copyright: Lib\u00e9ration/Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy.

Signatories included the novelists Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie, the historian Simon Schama and the Nobel prize laureates Svetlana Alexievitch, Herta M\u00fcller, Orhan Pamuk and Elfriede Jelinek.</p> <p>Rushdie told the Guardian: \u201cEurope is in greater danger now than at any time in the last 70 years, and if one believes in that idea it\u2019s time to stand up and be counted.</p> <p>\u201cIn the UK, I hope parliament may yet have the courage to call for a second referendum. That could rescue the country from the calamity of Brexit and go a long way towards rescuing the EU as well.\u201d</p> <p>McEwan said he had signed the manifesto because he was \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about the current moment, \u201cbut try to be hopeful that the zeitgeist will turn\u201d.</p> <p>Pamuk said the idea of Europe was also important to non-western countries. \u201cWithout the idea of Europe, freedom, women\u2019s rights, democracy, egalitarianism is hard to defend in my part of the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe historical success of Europe made it easier to defend these ideas and values which are crucial to humanity all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no Europe besides these values except the Europe of tourism and business. Europe is not a geography first but these ideas. This idea of Europe is under attack.\u201d</p> <p>In theEU elections in May \u2013 the first that will not include Britain \u2013 most observers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/28/how-rising-populism-could-shake-up-european-elections\">predict a rise in support</a> for populist, nationalist or anti-immigration parties. Many of them have made significant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/swedish-election-far-right-on-course-for-sizeable-gains-in-vote\">gains in national elections</a>, as the centre-right and centre-left that have traditionally dominated Europe\u2019s postwar politics retreat.</p> <p>Matteo Salvini of Italy\u2019s far-right League has described the vote as a straight choice between \u201cthe Europe of the elites, banks, finance, immigration and precarious work\u201d and that of \u201cthe people and of labour\u201d, pledging to form a Eurosceptic \u201cItalian-Polish axis\u201d.</p> <p>Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has said the elections are a chance to bid farewell \u201cto liberal democracy\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Liberal values in Europe face a challenge \u201cnot seen since the 1930s\u201d, leading intellectuals from 21 countries have said, as the UK lurches towards Brexit and nationalists look set to make sweeping gains in EU parliamentary elections. The group of 30 writers, historians and Nobel laureates declared in a manifesto published in several newspapers, including the Guardian, that Europe as an idea was \u201ccoming apart before our eyes\u201d. \u201cWe must now will Europe or perish beneath the waves of populism,\u201d the document reads. \u201cWe must rediscover political voluntarism or accept that resentment, hatred and their cortege of sad passions will surround and submerge us.\u201d They write of their regret that Europe has been \u201cabandoned from across the Channel\u201d \u2013 an oblique reference to the drawn-out Brexit process that has arguably brought Anglo-European relations to their lowest point since the second world war. And they say that unless efforts are made to combat a rising tide of populism, the EU elections will be \u201cthe most calamitous that we have ever known: victory for the wreckers; disgrace for those who still believe in the legacy of Erasmus, Dante, Goethe, and Comenius; disdain for intelligence and culture; explosions of xenophobia and antisemitism; disaster\u201d. \u201cAbandoned from across the Channel and from across the Atlantic by the two great allies who in the previous century saved it twice from suicide; vulnerable to the increasingly overt manipulations of the master of the Kremlin, Europe as an idea, as will and representation, is coming apart before our eyes,\u201d the text reads. The 800-word paean was drafted by the French philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. Signatories included the novelists Ian McEwan and Salman Rushdie, the historian Simon Schama and the Nobel prize laureates Svetlana Alexievitch, Herta M\u00fcller, Orhan Pamuk and Elfriede Jelinek. Rushdie told the Guardian: \u201cEurope is in greater danger now than at any time in the last 70 years, and if one believes in that idea it\u2019s time to stand up and be counted. \u201cIn the UK, I hope parliament may yet have the courage to call for a second referendum. That could rescue the country from the calamity of Brexit and go a long way towards rescuing the EU as well.\u201d McEwan said he had signed the manifesto because he was \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about the current moment, \u201cbut try to be hopeful that the zeitgeist will turn\u201d. Pamuk said the idea of Europe was also important to non-western countries. \u201cWithout the idea of Europe, freedom, women\u2019s rights, democracy, egalitarianism is hard to defend in my part of the world. \u201cThe historical success of Europe made it easier to defend these ideas and values which are crucial to humanity all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no Europe besides these values except the Europe of tourism and business. Europe is not a geography first but these ideas. This idea of Europe is under attack.\u201d In theEU elections in May \u2013 the first that will not include Britain \u2013 most observers predict a rise in support for populist, nationalist or anti-immigration parties. Many of them have made significant gains in national elections, as the centre-right and centre-left that have traditionally dominated Europe\u2019s postwar politics retreat. Matteo Salvini of Italy\u2019s far-right League has described the vote as a straight choice between \u201cthe Europe of the elites, banks, finance, immigration and precarious work\u201d and that of \u201cthe people and of labour\u201d, pledging to form a Eurosceptic \u201cItalian-Polish axis\u201d. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has said the elections are a chance to bid farewell \u201cto liberal democracy\u201d. Unlike Eurosceptics in the UK, most European counterparts do not want to leave the EU but to take it over. Leading the charge against the resurgent rightwing populists are the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. While both have been weakened by domestic problems, this week they renewed their countries\u2019 vows of postwar friendship and warned the lessons of their bloody past were being forgotten. EU officials in Brussels believe it is possible there will be a decisive advance for the populists and gains for pro-European parties, or at least a confusing mix of the two, leaving the populists significantly stronger, but still facing a strong, if disunited, majority of pro-European MEPs. The net result is likely to be a far more complex parliamentary makeup, delicate coalition-building, and a European parliament increasingly unable to pass legislation to deal with major challenges, such as immigration and eurozone reform. While they did not make any practical calls to action, the manifesto\u2019s signatories said they \u201crefuse to resign themselves to this looming catastrophe\u201d. They counted themselves among the \u201ctoo quiet\u201d European patriots who understand that \u201cthree-quarters of a century after the defeat of fascism and 30 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, a new battle for civilisation is under way\u201d. Despite its \u201cmistakes, its lapses, and its occasional acts of cowardice\u201d, Europe remains \u201ca beacon for every free man and woman on the planet\u201d, they say, noting with regret the widely held but mistaken belief of their generation that \u201cthe continent would come together on its own, without our labour\u201d. Pro-Europeans \u201cno longer have a choice\u201d, they say. \u201cWe must sound the alarm against the arsonists of soul and spirit that, from Paris to Rome, with stops in Barcelona, Budapest, Dresden, Vienna, or Warsaw, are playing with the fire of our freedoms.\u201d The signatories are: Vassilis Alexakis, Svetlana Alexievitch, Anne Applebaum, Jens Christian Gr\u00f8ndahl, David Grossman, Agn\u00e8s Heller, Elfriede Jelinek, Isma\u00efl Kadar\u00e9, Gy\u00f6rgy Konr\u00e1d, Milan Kundera, Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes, Claudio Magris, Ian McEwan, Herta M\u00fcller, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Orhan Pamuk, Rob Riemen, Salman Rushdie, Fernando Savater, Roberto Saviano, Eugenio Scalfari, Simon Schama, Peter Schneider, Abdulah Sidran, Le\u00efla Slimani, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, Mario Vargas Llosa, Adam Michnik and Adam Zagajewski. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 January 2019 to correct a misquote from the manifesto.",

Anthem is a multiplayer game set on a planet whose gods abandoned it mid-creation, leaving a pantheon of mutated creatures to ravage the beautiful environment and threaten the humans who share it. Clad in a nimble mech-suit with flying jets and a portable arsenal of guns, you soar out over the gorgeous overgrown planet with three other players and hold off the aliens, discovering majestic ruins from the dawn of creation.</p> <p>Anthem is one of many online games competing for players\u2019 long-term attention, designed to be played every day or every week by groups of friends together. But it is made by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/22/gamesblog-live-mike-laidlaw-dragon-age-2\">BioWare</a>, a developer known for role-playing games that immerse a lone player in a rich fantasy that they alone control. Why has the studio decided to make something so different? It is undeniably a risk: the strengths of good single-player games \u2013 an absorbing narrative, player choice, the ability to take your time and explore at your own place \u2013 do not transfer well to the shared world of multiplayer games.</p> <p>I can put my finger on one probable motivation: Destiny, the game that popularised the sci-fi multiplayer shooter (along with slow-burn action-shooter Warframe). Playing Anthem\u2019s opening hours, the echoes of Bungie\u2019s space-opera shooter are at times deafening. The story strikes the same tone of jargon-laden sci-fi drama, and involves a couple of cities\u2019 worth of humans holding out against a planet that has been devastated. Some of the enemy aliens are intimidating, spiky bipeds that bring to mind not just the Fallen and the Cabal, but also Halo\u2019s Covenant creatures. One of the mech-suits, the Storm, is extraordinarily similar to Destiny\u2019s Warlock class in its feel, animations and abilities, floaty jump and all. The capsule city to which you return between missions is a warren of corridors filled with ambient tinkerers and quest-givers. But in the hands, Anthem feels unique; after an hour or two, the obvious comparison recedes and Anthem\u2019s own identity reveals itself.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2drI_iT4NUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2drI_iT4NUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Play revolves not around the guns and how exciting they feel to shoot but around the mechs\u2019 exhilarating movement \u2013 particularly their power of flight. You begin every outing by leaping from the top of the city\u2019s giant protective walls and soaring into the green. Flying in Anthem is brilliant, interwoven seamlessly with shooting so that you never have touch the ground if you\u2019re good enough. You can hover in mid-air for better aim at a distance, or barrel towards a group of monsters, come crashing to the ground in the middle of them and whip out a sword. Flying is so fun that almost everything you do feels epic, whether it\u2019s diving deep into a waterlogged cavern, hovering next to a titanic creature as you fire bullets and rockets at it, or swooping through a waterfall to cool your mech-suit\u2019s jets. Honestly, I was expecting a science-fiction multiplayer game from BioWare to hook me with its story, but not with how immensely fun it feels to play.</p> <p>The addition of flight was a watershed moment in Anthem\u2019s development, says Ben Irving, a lead producer who has been working on it for two years. It created lots of problems for the developers, such as how to balance range and how to get creatures to follow players\u2019 movements. But it was so fun they had to make it work. \u201cLots of shooters have flight, but usually you\u2019ll get into a plane or something,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that situation you can have a different control scheme, but the challenge for us was that if you you jump and start flying, the controls still have to function the same way. It took us a lot of time to try and get the controls to feel seamless between walk, run, sprint, jump, fly, hover, swim.\u201d</p> <p>That fluidity is what makes the game special. \u201cIt\u2019s just so different \u2013 you can get lost in the sensation of flight, carving around corners and through water to cool your jets so you can keep going, seeing how far you can get before touching the ground,\u201d says Thomas Singleton, a producer who joined Anthem last year, with whom I spent an enjoyable day exploring its early missions. \u201cWith this game it\u2019s really important that we get people\u2019s hands on the sticks and have them experience it for themselves. That\u2019s where the game starts to sing and makes you smile.\u201d</p> <p>Out in the wilds, where you are always part of a group of four mech-suited players, Anthem is all about the action. Choosing a tank-like Colossus with big guns and a hefty shield, a zippy Interceptor, the all-rounder Ranger or the elemental Storm suit, you dive from the walls of the city and start looking for trouble. Whether you\u2019re in free exploration mode or on a mission, the world is enticingly packed with things to find: loot-filled caves, hidden areas, unstable relics that need to be shut down, and always plenty of different creatures to shoot. I found the fights far from easy, and understanding each mech-suit\u2019s strengths and working as a team with fellow pilots was the only way through tougher waves of aliens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4824ef58d9db0fcd09e07085311c3aa698647f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4824ef58d9db0fcd09e07085311c3aa698647f76/0_0_1440_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flying high \u2026 the mech-suits in Anthem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying high \u2026 the mech-suits in Anthem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BioWare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In between missions, you return either to a social hub called the Launch Bay with other players, or alone to Fort Tarsis. It is here that BioWare has exercised its traditional storytelling strengths. Tarsis is full of characters to converse with and learn from, companions on your journey. By keeping the story personal and the action communal, Anthem hopes to offer the kind of narrative depth that is usually necessarily absent from multiplayer games.</p> <p>\u201cWe learned from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/15/star-wars-old-republic-review\">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> [BioWare\u2019s Star Wars online RPG] that things like having a group conversation and rolling on who gets the choice isn\u2019t satisfying,\u201d says Ben. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making an online game with a narrative that lives for multiple years, it becomes impossible to have a story that involves individual choice, because you\u2019d have to make 50 stories to account for all the branching. It\u2019s fair to say the level of choice isn\u2019t like a single-player BioWare game. It\u2019s more about picking how you want to relate to our characters, how you reflect who you are.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of a day\u2019s play, the characters and storytelling weren\u2019t what impressed me about Anthem; it is perhaps telling that, a week later, I couldn\u2019t tell you a single individual\u2019s name without referring to my notes. There is intrigue in the setup of a world abandoned while it was still being forged, and the mysterious powers of creation that are still shaping it. But it is the shared adventures, the flight and fighting, that I\u2019m looking forward to revisiting next month when Anthem is released. As an online game, it will doubtless change rapidly over its first year of life, but already there is much of interest to find in its world \u2013 and I\u2019ve rarely played a mech game that feels so freeing and exciting to control.</p> <ul> <li><p>Anthem will be released on 22 February for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

There is intrigue in the setup of a world abandoned while it was still being forged, and the mysterious powers of creation that are still shaping it. But it is the shared adventures, the flight and fighting, that I\u2019m looking forward to revisiting next month when Anthem is released. As an online game, it will doubtless change rapidly over its first year of life, but already there is much of interest to find in its world \u2013 and I\u2019ve rarely played a mech game that feels so freeing and exciting to control. Anthem will be released on 22 February for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A limited demo is available until 27 January.",

      "bodyText": "Davos attendees who hung around for the last day heard behavioural scientist Jane Goodall talking a lot of sense. She called for: \u201clove, compassion and making decisions not based on how this will help my bank account \u2026 but how will it affect future generations.\u201d If only.... Goodall, famous for her pioneering work with chimpanzees, also warned that the natural world needs protection. \u201cAs we destroy the natural environment...we are destroying our own future, our own children and grandchildren. We all care about them, but we\u2019re not thinking about how what we do today is stealing their future.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest retailers and wholesalers have raised their stockpiling efforts to the highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis, according to a key industry report, with little more than 60 days to go before Brexit. According to the latest snapshot from the CBI\u2019s monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses raised the ratio of their stocks to expected sales in January to the highest level since February 2008. The report, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the UK economy, said retailers expected demand to fall and had built up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal. Novartis is the latest firm to warn about the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit, including a shortage of medicines. The Swiss pharmaceuticals company says it is stockpiling drugs in the UK before a possible no-deal, which it warns would be \u201chugely impactful for patients, particularly around the supply and safety of medicines\u201d. Read the full story here: AM Who said deals are never done in Davos? AM Brexit has been a key talking point in Davos, where business leaders have urged clarity from the government amid mounting warnings from firms that a no-deal scenario would be disastrous for jobs and the economy. One businessman who has consistently taken the opposing view is Tim Martin, the founder and chairman of pub group Wetherspoon and a firm supporter of Brexit. Martin has been touring his pubs to promote his vision for a no-deal Brexit, and was interviewed by Guardian columnist Owen Jones in Southend-on-Sea. It\u2019s fair to say they didn\u2019t see eye to eye: AM The climate change protest is breaking up now. And so is the World Economic Forum, in a rather downbeat mood . There\u2019s really not been much drama here today, alas. The early finish means many delegates seem to have skipped sessions, and skipped off. More from the Lagarde panel: The students protesting outside the World Economic Forum are on the right side of history....but are the delegates scurrying past them? Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan, says she\u2019s disappointed that Davos hasn\u2019t provided the \u201cmoral, business and political\u201d leadership needed to fight global warming. It is deeply disturbing that, as the world tinkers on the brink of a climate catastrophe, avoiding further temperature rise is not at the very centre of all of the meetings of CEOs and world leaders. The solutions are in front of them and they need to prioritise solving this crisis, join the youth who are leading the way forward and thus be on the right side of history. Yesterday there were 32,000 school strike students on the streets of Belgium and today children are taking to the streets of Berlin clamouring for an early coal phase-out. The youth are demanding to be heard, the question is, why isn\u2019t the Davos elite responding with the scale and pace required? Short-term business interests and making a greater profit, whatever the cost to others, clearly remains the Davos elites priority. We have no time to waste. Davos delegates are getting a taste of the anger over climate change. As they leave the congress hall, they will see a group of young people holding a climate strike - urging world leaders and business chiefs to wake up to the crisis and Actually Do Something, not just talk about it. It\u2019s led, of course, by Thunberg, who has been doing this every Friday outside the Swedish parliament since September...and other children are joining her around the world. More highlights from Greta Thunberg\u2019s press conference: Economist Mariana Mazzucato is outlining how to encourage innovation, and warning that some popular policy measure are flawed. R&amp;D tax credits sometimes don\u2019t work, she says, because companies use them to fund research they\u2019d have paid for anyway. The smart answer is to use \u201cgranular instruments\u201d - ie rewarding companies who create jobs, rather than basing it on profits. That\u2019s why the patent box beloved of George Osborne doesn\u2019t really work, she explains -- it simply lowers profits and potentially fuels the problem of inequality. Bottom line - businesses invest when their expectations about growth opportunities are high. It\u2019s a mistake to fight technology because you fear it will make some jobs redundant, argues Kganyago. You can\u2019t protect the job of an encyclopedia salesman, because the internet took that job away. You should protect the people, not the jobs, he adds. Fair point. But with a jobless rate of 27%, you can see why South Africa\u2019s unions are worried. Lagarde\u2019s panel has turn to demographics and the world of work. Japan\u2019s ageing society has caused a labour shortage. BoJ central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda says this has forced farms and companies to embrace automation. But South Africa faces a different challenge - trying to get its younger population up to speed for the 4th Industrial Revolution. Lesetja Kganyago, governor of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), says policymakers need to \u201cinvest in the capabilities of young people so they can embrace technologies. If not, the resulting skills gap will hurt its economy. The future of work is going to be different, Kganyago says, so South Africa needs to broaden the skills base, and think differently about the education system. Does the curriculum we have, in various institutions, cater for the needs of the changing economy, so that when these young people come through the educational system they can engage with an economic system that is being drive by technology? Kristalina Georgieva has also got the message that climate change is going to hurt younger generations, (who didn\u2019t create the problem, of course). She tells delegates: When you think about climate, get a photo of your children and grandchildren in front of you. I guarantee you it will change your perspective. I did this and it works. Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank CEO, says global leaders can help fight climate change by eliminating harmful subsidies [on energy and agriculture, for example]. Georgieva says progress has been made - these harmful subsidies have shrunk from $600bn to $300bn, but \u201cwe still have $300bn to go\u201d. She cites Egypt as a good example -they cut subsidies from 7% of GDP to 3%. However, that risks harming vulnerable people (who suffer when petrol prices spike) She insists that moving to a low-carbon economy is good economics, creating new jobs in cutting-edge technology areas. So, those who tell you that low carbon is bad for the economy - don\u2019t bite. Thirdly, we need to provide more support for countries who didn\u2019t create the climate crisis - but are suffering the damage. She cites Niger, Chad, and small island states. Christine Lagarde begins by singling out the issue of climate change (maybe Greta had a word...) Average surface temperature has risen by nearly once degree Celcius since the late 19th century. Most of the warming has occurred in the last 35 years., with the five warmest years on record experienced since 2010. If we don\u2019t make the minimum global effort, which will be hopefully upped next year, to curb emissions, rising temperatures will wipe out whole segments of economies, not to mention the dramatic human damage it will cause. The poorest countries will be most affected, she adds, but advanced economies will not be immune. The final main event of Davos, on the state of the global economy, is underway. But the cavernous congress hall is remarkably empty -- so much that our Larry Elliott has bagged a front row seat. It looks like there\u2019s only few hundred people -- many delegates have already checked out. The panel is being chaired by IMF chief Christine Lagarde. We have World Bank chief Kristalina Georgieva, South Africa\u2019s central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, Japan\u2019s central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, and economics professor Mariana Mazzucato. Thunberg is now addressing the media, repeating her warning about the urgent need to reduce emissions. Three Yale university psychology professors who are experts in well being have an uncomfortable message for the wealth-seeking billionaires in Davos: your brains are lying to you. Laurie Santos, one of the trio, says: \u201cOne reason we are not as happy as we could be is because our minds are lying to us. It asks us to want the wrong sort of stuff. It tells us that more money bring us happiness.\u201d Santos says that more money does lead to happiness but only at relatively low levels of income. \u201cOnce you get much above the poverty line happiness flatlines\u201d. Santos\u2019s colleague Hedy Kober says that if Davos is serious about sustainability and tackling climate change, it should look at the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which measures gross national happiness as an alternative to gross domestic product. Kober says: \u201cIf our goals are happiness and well being, we are doing it wrong.\u201d Questions have turned to how genetic information can be used by private companies like insurers to determine costs/premiums. Hancock points out how insurance firm Sheilas\u2019 Wheels only offered insurance to women on the base that they posed lower risk. That was deemed unlawful by the EU. Hancock says there is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a role for government in deciding what information is and isn\u2019t valid in the provision of insurance (and presumably other services). There\u2019s also a question of who owns genetic data, which Hancock stresses should be controlled under consent of the individual. The health secretary said choice needs to be central to the question of genome sequencing. \u201cNot allowing people to opt out...would be a huge imposition of the state into people\u2019s lives.\u201d Climate activist Greta Thunberg has lived up to her pledge to warn Davos to address the climate crisis. She told us yesterday that she had chosen to trek to Davos to get her message out. And a few minutes ago, speaking on a panel session, she told delegates she was here to tell them that \u201cOur house is on fire\u201d, due to greenhouse gas emissions and rising global temperatures. Thunberg started striking from school last summer to press Swedish MPs to meet their Paris Agreement obligations. At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories, but financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag on climate change. We have failed. Thunberg added that the media haven\u2019t managed to create enough awareness of the urgent problems of climate change. But, it\u2019s not too late.... It\u2019s a simple issue. We need to stop emissions of greenhouse gases. Either we do that or we don\u2019t. Either we prevent 1.5 degrees of warming, or we don\u2019t. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Adults like to say that they want to give their children hope. I don\u2019t want your hope. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. I want you to feel as it the house is on fire, because it is. Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN\u2019s climate change group, backs Thunberg, saying She\u2019s right, we have not panicked enough. You know the tax system is in trouble when even the accountants won\u2019t defend it! Bob Moritz, the chairman of accountancy giant PcW, has told Davos that today\u2019s taxation systems are old, outdated and not fit for the future. They were set up for protectionism, he explains, as countries fought over each other to attract companies. You\u2019re telling us that people want to pay more tax?! Moritz doesn\u2019t go that far, but is damning about the status quo: We want to pay our fair share of taxes, but the reality is the tax laws and regulations we have today are absolutely antiquated and not fit for the multiple stakeholders that we have to focus on. All very worthy. But lets not forget that PwC was roasted by MPs a few years ago for selling tax avoidance on an industrial scale. Talk is cheap (well, as much as anything is cheap in Davos) Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, has delivered a stinging blast at governments for not tackling wealth inequality. We are now in an economy that is really rigged, so that a few get better off and others now. With this kind of extreme inequality, many will remain stuck in poverty, says Byanyima, citing World Bank data which shows the rate of reducing extreme poverty has slowed, and continues to slow. How bad is the situation? Very bad: 3.4 billion people are just a crop failure, or a medical bill away, from falling back into extreme poverty, because they\u2019re earning no more than $5.5 per day. Rich companies, rich people, have been able to write the rules of the economy so they are winners and others are losers. She thinks a universal basic income would do some good, but ultimately we need a wealth tax, to create fiscal space for education and healthcare (an idea that is rocketing back up the political agenda) And she warns that austerity in rich countries is hurting women particularly badly: Women are pulling out of work to care for the sick, of the elderly, of disabled people. This is because governments have sat back, not done their job and allowed a few to take away the bulk of the wealth. A quick audience poll at a Davos panel on wealth inequality shows that 61% don\u2019t support a basic income. Investors are in a relatively upbeat mood this morning, with European markets up across the board following gains in Asia. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 6,837 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.1% at 11,253 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,905 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 19,724 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.7% at 9,210 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: 0+0.7% at 358 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets: Despite the ongoing uncertainties around US, China trade markets in Europe have opened higher this morning, taking a positive lead from a strong performance for Asia markets. It\u2019s been a decent week for markets in Asia with the Nikkei 225 closing higher for the third week in a row, the first time that has happened since October last year. AM Chancellor Philip Hammond has just arrived at the Congress Centre. He wouldn\u2019t stop to talk and his team has said he\u2019s on his way to a \u201cbilateral meeting\u201d downstairs but would not say with who. He was with about half a dozen staff, with a camera in tow. Hammond has pulled out of this morning\u2019s session on the global economy, which was officially blamed on work pressures. However, Davos insiders told us that the Treasury objected to him being on the same platform as the economist Mariana Mazzucato (which the Treasury denied). Never mind Khashoggi, let\u2019s make money! That, I\u2019m afraid, is Saudi Arabia\u2019s message to Davos - as illustrated by this massive poster outside the congress centre. It\u2019s a timely reminder that money counts for more than morals round here. Just months after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder, Saudi delegates aren\u2019t being cold-shouldered here. As Bloomberg put it: At an event where success is often measured by who\u2019s seen at a reception or speaks on a panel, the Saudis aren\u2019t getting the cold shoulder any more. James Gorman, the head of Morgan Stanley, spoke on Thursday in a debate alongside two Saudi ministers. And the likes of Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and John Flint of HSBC Holdings Plc attended the annual Davos party thrown by Saudi oil giant Aramco, according to a person present. \u201cI don\u2019t think Saudi Arabia is in the penalty box,\u201d Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u201cwas utterly unacceptable and the world including the Saudis want to understand exactly what happened. In the meantime, Saudi is a country of 32 million people. These folks deserve a shot,\u201d he said. In case you missed it, here is the full story on our interview with Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate change campaigner, who will be addressing delegates in Davos later this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the final day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, and other events across the economy and the markets. In Davos, the global elite will be looking nervously to the future today - with sessions on inequality, bioethics and the global economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde will chair a discussion on the world economy. The global slowdown, the US-China trade war and Brexit have all loomed over WEF this week, so we\u2019ll hear what World Bank chief Kristalina Georgieva, South Africa\u2019s central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, Japan\u2019s central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, and economics professor Mariana Mazzucato have to say. Delegates will also by digesting George Soros\u2019s stinging attack on China last night, when he accused president Xi of using technology such as artificial intelligence to control his population. Swedish 16-year old climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg is bringing her campaign to Davos. She\u2019ll be giving a speech to delegates, and conducting her weekly school strike. Yesterday she told us: I have said that every Friday I will sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris Agreement, and now this Friday I can\u2019t be there. So I will have to do it here, and send a message that this is the only thing that matters. The agenda: 9.15am GMT / 10.15am Davos: Session on \u201cWhat if everyone had their genome sequenced at birth?\u201d with UK health secretary Matt Hancock. 9.30am GMT / 10.30am Davos: Session on the cost of inequality with primatologist Jane Goodall and Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima 10.30am GMT/11.30am Davos: Session on the global economy with Christine Lagarde, Kristalina Georgieva, Lesetja Kganyago, Haruhiko Kuroda, and Mariana Mazzucato 10.15am GMT/11.15am Davos: Greta Thunberg gives speech on the urgent need to combat climate change",

But there\u2019s another aspect also worth considering: having people on a suitable bike.</p> <p>Why did this occur to me? Because of a chat with Isla Rowntree, the eponymous founder, head and design supremo for <a href=\"https://www.islabikes.co.uk/\">Islabikes</a>, who has spent 13 years thinking about how bikes can be made easier and more fun for children to ride, and is now branching into intended bikes for older people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/nov/01/who-belongs-in-the-everyday-cycling-hall-of-fame\">Who belongs in the Everyday Cycling Hall of Fame?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a brand, Islabikes inspire strong reactions in some people, ranging from undying loyalty to disbelief that a bike aimed at a five-year-old can cost nearly \u00a3400 \u2013 though of course the latter factor is leavened by the bikes\u2019 famously strong second-hand value.</p> <p>Whatever one\u2019s view, Rowntree is a fascinating and thoughtful person with whom to discuss cycling, and her reasons for setting up the company. It began 13 years ago after relatives and friends started asking her as \u201cthe resident cycling expert\u201d \u2013 she is a former UK cyclocross champion \u2013 about the best bikes for their young children.

      "bodyText": "On the Bike Blog we do wang on quite a lot about the vital importance of safe infrastructure to get more people cycling, and with very good reason. But there\u2019s another aspect also worth considering: having people on a suitable bike. Why did this occur to me? Because of a chat with Isla Rowntree, the eponymous founder, head and design supremo for Islabikes, who has spent 13 years thinking about how bikes can be made easier and more fun for children to ride, and is now branching into intended bikes for older people. As a brand, Islabikes inspire strong reactions in some people, ranging from undying loyalty to disbelief that a bike aimed at a five-year-old can cost nearly \u00a3400 \u2013 though of course the latter factor is leavened by the bikes\u2019 famously strong second-hand value. Whatever one\u2019s view, Rowntree is a fascinating and thoughtful person with whom to discuss cycling, and her reasons for setting up the company. It began 13 years ago after relatives and friends started asking her as \u201cthe resident cycling expert\u201d \u2013 she is a former UK cyclocross champion \u2013 about the best bikes for their young children. She says: At that point in time, I think children\u2019s bikes had reached an all-time low in terms of their functionality and the riding experience. They were really heavy, because they had great big fat tubes to make them look like adult mountain bikes, but made of steel, and very often some kind of faux-suspension that added another couple of kilos, huge numbers of gears that young children couldn\u2019t understand. They seemed to have gone away from the shapes that fit an actual child \u2013 huge, long cranks, brakes that they couldn\u2019t reach and with springs so heavy they couldn\u2019t pull on them. I was coming from the angle that as a cycling evangelist you really like to persuade people to enjoy what you love. And the thought that the children of my nearest and dearest might be put off cycling \u2013 that\u2019s how bad I felt the bikes were \u2013 was quite distressing for me. Her solution was lightweight machines with child-sized components, something now mimicked by a series of other children\u2019s bike brands. Sceptics might label this a fancy excuse to flog pricey bikes to middle-class parents, but as anyone who has watched a child learn to ride, it is very relevant. I saw friends of my son struggle to get going at all on a weighty, older-style kids\u2019 bike, and almost give up, only to find it all very straightforward when introduced to a more suitable machine. Rowntree says her aim is \u201cto give a better cycling experience to children, in the hope that more of them do it more often, and some of them turn into cycling adults in some form or another\u201d. Getting more people on bikes is a continual passion for Rowntree, and her new range aimed at people 65-plus was inspired by watching her parents, in their mid-70s, struggle with their existing bikes: I thought: again, there\u2019s a group of people here to whom cycling is a really important thing, but are struggling because they can\u2019t get the most appropriate bikes for their currents needs. It was really as simple as that. This involve bikes which are easier to use for those with potentially creaking joints and reduced muscle power, featuring step-through frames, low gearing and reduced weight. Using the example of her mother \u2013 her parents live next door to her in Ludlow, Shropshire \u2013 Rowntree also designed wheels where it is easy to remove the tyres: That\u2019s the beauty of living next door to my parents. They won\u2019t go out too far any more on their own because they can\u2019t get the tyres off if they have a puncture to change of inner tube. I say to them, \u2018Call me if it happens, I\u2019ll come and fetch you,\u2019 but they\u2019re too proud. It\u2019s that practical detail that you only get to think about if you\u2019re around people who are actually at that stage and struggling with it. And that\u2019s the kind of thing I get really excited about. It might seem a bit obscure, a bit techy, but I know it\u2019ll make a real difference to those enthusiast cyclists who are still going off on rides.\u201d The problem, she thinks, has been exacerbated by the spread of wheels designed to also be used with tubeless tyres. which are a notably tighter fit even when fitted with inner tubes. These are mainly specific solutions to very particular age groups, but I\u2019d argue that too often, at least in places like the UK, too many other people ride unsuitable bikes. Many British bike commuters use rapid, lightweight road bikes and hybrids, which are fine for enthusiasts but can seem a bit rattly and twitchy for the novice, who will often start by going to a bike shop to purchase the sort of machines they see everyone else riding. There is, of course, a reason for this: the feral state of the UK roads, where cyclists have to mix it with motor traffic, placing a premium on speed. This means those who pootle along on a heavier Dutch-style bike can feel even more vulnerable. A few years ago I switched from commuting on a lightweight road-type bike to something more practical, complete with chain guard and bag-swallowing front basket, and it was something of a revelation.

Even when she has been spirited off to Mr B\u2019s isolated Lincolnshire manor house, and cannot send her letters to her parents, she keeps writing.</p> <p>This may make the novel sound an unlikely candidate for dramatisation, yet much of what Pamela records is combative dialogue. It is in words that she fights with her would-be seducer. He is always trying to win her or trick her, flatter or humiliate her, through speech. In front of other servants, he makes her out to be the \u201cintriguer\u201d, the manipulative one. She is a \u201cslut\u201d and an \u201cequivocator\u201d. Even when they are alone together, he tries to turn all the blame on her.

Richardson transformed the rake, a character beloved of Restoration literary culture, from a self-assured libertine into an awkwardly deceitful man. Pamela may be lower class, but she is verbally resourceful and up to his ruses, scoffing when he suggests that if she sleeps with him, he will go on to marry her. \u201cWhat, Sir, would the World say, were you to marry your Harlot? \u2026 I am not to be caught by a Bait so poorly cover\u2019d as this!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Richardson creates 'a sense of enclosure \u2013 of being shut in a world that has its own strange rules'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pamela finds out how power works. She begins to realise that her fellow servants are all either intimidated or suborned. Those who are not corrupt are terrified of losing their \u201cplaces\u201d.

And, of course, the law is no help: as the most important local squire, Mr B is also the justice of the peace. Pamela is on her own.</p> <p>Explaining his attraction to the novel, Crimp notes how Richardson creates \u201ca sense of enclosure \u2013 of being shut in a world that has its own strange rules\u201d. Drama thrives on such constriction. In the novel, Pamela is always pent up, unable to escape the home in which Mr B confines her. Even on the couple of occasions that she gets out of the house and garden, freedom is impossible: one time, she is terrified back to her confinement by two bulls in a neighbouring field (which turn out to be cows). Another time she reaches the road outside the house, only to realise that she can go no further. She has no money and no means of transport. A young woman can go nowhere on her own.</p> <p>So, she is apparently powerless \u2013 yet she does have a peculiar power over Mr B. The sexual politics of the novel are strange and have attracted suspicion from the beginning. Pamela\u2019s \u201cmaster\u201d is perplexed and fascinated by her stubborn \u201cvirtue\u201d. The novel was subtitled <em>Virtue Rewarded</em>, as if to reassure its first readers of its outcome, and its heroine is indeed triumphant. Richardson\u2019s brilliant trick is to have Mr B steal her letters and slowly be converted by them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9727e5ce161979130f53fa5d1bd2c12a04062e06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9727e5ce161979130f53fa5d1bd2c12a04062e06/0_174_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blanchett with Stephen Dillane in When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blanchett with Stephen Dillane in When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Cummiskey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He becomes obsessed with getting hold of her writing.

The intriguingly titled When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other, written by Martin Crimp and directed by Katie Mitchell, stars Cate Blanchett, acting at the National for the first time, opposite Stephen Dillane. The NT, foreseeing the interest that Blanchett would arouse, offered tickets for the six-week run only by ballot. The winners of the draw got the chance to buy a seat. But perhaps the strangest thing about this new work is its source. Crimp\u2019s play, though set in the present day, has used Samuel Richardson\u2019s 1740 novel Pamela as what he calls a \u201cprovocation\u201d. The play\u2019s 12 scenes mirror 12 scenes in the novel. It is a fair bet that few of those lucky enough to get tickets will have read the original, yet Pamela was a bestseller and literary sensation when it was first published, becoming one of the most influential books in the history of European literature.

      "body": "<p><strong>Our </strong><strong>10-year-old son enjoys wearing girls\u2019 underwear</strong><strong>. We have embraced his desire and </strong><strong>bought or made G-strings and bra</strong><strong> tops. We\u2019ve taught him to keep this private, explaining that </strong><strong>other people </strong><strong>may not understand, while ensuring </strong><strong>we communicate </strong><strong>it\u2019s OK </strong><strong>with us. \u201cEveryone is different and everyone is special,\u201d is the message we try to convey. He tells us </strong><strong>he enjoys it because it makes him feel good.</strong></p> <p><strong>Initially, he tried making G-strings by cutting up his underpants. This is when we realised </strong><strong>he needed help with making and buying the underwear he wanted. After this, when the scissors kept going missing and we found a new pair of (boys\u2019) underpants chopped up, we were annoyed and he got upset. He said he didn\u2019t like himself and couldn\u2019t understand why he was doing it. We calmed him </strong><strong>and reassured him that </strong><strong>we loved him</strong><strong>, but </strong><strong>said we were cross </strong><strong>with him for cutting up new underwear.</strong></p> <p><strong>This was when he </strong><strong>said he had been trying to make a bra and</strong><strong> he\u2019d done a pretty good job</strong><strong>. I took him </strong><strong>shopping so he could make a selection and my husband took him </strong><strong>to buy fabric</strong><strong> to make his own items</strong><strong>. W</strong><strong>e put these, </strong><strong>with his own </strong><strong>pair of scissors, in a </strong><strong>box in his room. He was happy and we thought the problem was solved. </strong><strong>Recently, </strong><strong>the scissors disappeared again and my husband </strong><strong>said he\u2019d found a onesie </strong><strong>that had been cut up. </strong></p> <p><strong>I\u2019d welcome </strong><strong>advice on how to raise a cross-dressing child, and how to approach this latest occurrence of cutting his own clothes.</strong></p> <p>The first thing I\u2019d like you to do is concentrate on what it is <em>you</em> are worried about because, despite your protestations of it being OK, I do think you are worried, and by not voicing it you can\u2019t address it. (\u201cI thought the problem was solved,\u201d was a telling phrase.)</p> <p>I also want you to look at this from your son\u2019s point of view. You are giving conflicting messages: you tell him it\u2019s not OK to cut up his clothes, but give special scissors to cut things up with; you say he needs to keep this private, but go out in public to buy things to enable him to do this.

      "bodyText": "Our 10-year-old son enjoys wearing girls\u2019 underwear. We have embraced his desire and bought or made G-strings and bra tops. We\u2019ve taught him to keep this private, explaining that other people may not understand, while ensuring we communicate it\u2019s OK with us. \u201cEveryone is different and everyone is special,\u201d is the message we try to convey. He tells us he enjoys it because it makes him feel good. Initially, he tried making G-strings by cutting up his underpants. This is when we realised he needed help with making and buying the underwear he wanted. After this, when the scissors kept going missing and we found a new pair of (boys\u2019) underpants chopped up, we were annoyed and he got upset. He said he didn\u2019t like himself and couldn\u2019t understand why he was doing it. We calmed him and reassured him that we loved him, but said we were cross with him for cutting up new underwear. This was when he said he had been trying to make a bra and he\u2019d done a pretty good job. I took him shopping so he could make a selection and my husband took him to buy fabric to make his own items. We put these, with his own pair of scissors, in a box in his room. He was happy and we thought the problem was solved. Recently, the scissors disappeared again and my husband said he\u2019d found a onesie that had been cut up. I\u2019d welcome advice on how to raise a cross-dressing child, and how to approach this latest occurrence of cutting his own clothes. The first thing I\u2019d like you to do is concentrate on what it is you are worried about because, despite your protestations of it being OK, I do think you are worried, and by not voicing it you can\u2019t address it. (\u201cI thought the problem was solved,\u201d was a telling phrase.) I also want you to look at this from your son\u2019s point of view. You are giving conflicting messages: you tell him it\u2019s not OK to cut up his clothes, but give special scissors to cut things up with; you say he needs to keep this private, but go out in public to buy things to enable him to do this. He may simply have taken the house scissors because they do a better job. Let\u2019s forget the underwear and scissors for the moment, as they are potentially emotive symbols, and concentrate on your son. Who is he? What is his life like? Is he happy at school, is the household relatively calm and happy? I consulted child and adolescent psychotherapist Charlie Beaumont. He felt you were trying to do the right things but in so doing \u201cundermining your own authority\u201d. It\u2019s perfectly OK, he said, to be angry at children for cutting up their clothes. \u201cYou\u2019ve also assumed,\u201d Beaumont said, \u201cthat when he cut up the underwear he wanted to cross-dress.

Many suggested a hardline faction within the ruling party were responsible, unhappy with even the limited reforms that might have convinced investors and international multilateral institutions to provide the funds to resuscitate the economy. Today, any remaining illusions have been shattered. The crackdown of the past fortnight has been the most extensive for a decade at least, and veteran campaigners in Harare worry that it is far from over. \u201cIt could be the start of a concerted effort to destroy any opposition of any type that could last weeks, even months,\u201d said one old hand, recalling a campaign of regime violence in 2008 that led to 270 deaths. Significantly, the targeting of the opposition, union leaders and civil society activists has continued even after Mnangagwa cut short a foreign trip to pledge dialogue and punishment for security officials who committed excesses. Diplomats in Harare admit it is almost impossible to work out where real power lies, among competing institutions, agencies, personalities and factions. The result is a sense of deep uncertainty, and fears that Zimbabwe is moving into uncharted waters where anything is possible. One innovation under Mnangagwa is \u201cfast-track\u201d trials for the vast numbers detained in recent days. \u201cThe rule of law has been entirely abandoned .. It\u2019s a travesty of justice,\u201d said Derek Matyszak, an analyst in Harare with the Institute for Security Studies. Each day last week, 56 accused men and five women from Epworth filed into court nine in at Harare\u2019s central magistrates\u2019 court to face trial. They are represented by just five lawyers, who managed to win a postponement of 48 hours to allow them to interview their clients. Few of the accused are likely to be freed; even those caught up by mistake like Maria. Most will face months, even years, in jail, lawyers said. Five prominent activists have been charged with subversion. They include Evan Mawarire, a preacher and activist known for his resistance to Mugabe\u2019s rule. Nor is it clear how the government can halt the economy\u2019s slide without external aid. Persistence Gwanyanya, an independent economist in Harare who has worked closely with the government, said Zimbabwe was \u201ctaking a painful pill at the moment\u201d but that there were some \u201cquick wins\u201d possible. \u201cWe are in a transition \u2026 We can expect things to get worse before they get better but I don\u2019t expect the suffering to be extended for a long time,\u201d Gwanyanya said. A measure of has calm returned to much of Zimbabwe now, with traffic approaching normal levels in the cities and the internet, shut down for several days, working once more. But few are optimistic in the long term. Marion Michasa, 40, was waiting outside Harare magistrates court to see her husband, a 51-year-old car trader in Epworth who was swept up in the dragnet during last week\u2019s riots when he tried to get to work in the centre of the city on a bicycle. \u201cLife is so difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now we are so confused. We are still living with fear.\u201d",

Stone remained such a Nixon devotee that he infamously got the former president\u2019s face tattooed on his back.</p> <p>During the 1970s, Stone also played a key role in bringing the full force of outside campaign money behind negative advertising against congressional candidates. He went on to work for Ronald Reagan\u2019s unsuccessful 1976 presidential campaign and served as a political director on Reagan\u2019s second bid for president in 1980, which sent him to the White House.</p> <p>Although he did not join the Reagan administration, Stone remained a key player in politics. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/16/the-rise-and-gall-of-roger-stone/d8ce308b-7055-4666-860e-378833f46e17/?utm_term=.0bb4e17cd857\">Washington Post</a> profile, published in 1986, wrote that Stone, then only 33, \u201cearns a reported $450,000 a year, owns two homes and a hot tub, wears $800 designer suits and a Patek Philippe watch\u201d.</p> <p>The following year, Stone urged a real estate developer in New York to run for president: his name was Donald Trump.</p> <p>Over the next three decades, Stone would repeatedly encourage Trump \u2013 whose celebrity status grew more solidified by his foray into reality television \u2013 to seek the presidency. When Trump ultimately threw his hat in the race in the 2016 election cycle, Stone was by his side as a campaign adviser.</p> <p>Although Stone later left the campaign in an official capacity, he continued to informally advise then candidate Trump. Left unknown is what \u2013 if anything \u2013 Stone told Trump about his alleged contacts with WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Mueller\u2019s indictment included evidence purporting to show that Stone had advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to leak thousands of hacked Democratic party emails.</p> <p>Trump expressed confidence last month that Stone would ultimately stay loyal to his cause, despite mounting pressure from the ongoing FBI investigation.</p> <p>\u201cI will never testify against Trump,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1069619316319035392?lang=en\">tweeted last month</a>, quoting Stone.</p> <p>\u201cThis statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about \u2018President Trump.\u2019 Nice to know that some people still have \u2018guts!\u2019\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Roger Stone \u2013 the self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster\u201d of Republican politics and longtime ally of Donald Trump \u2013 has spent decades cultivating a reputation as a combative political operative with a penchant for making brash statements and trafficking in conspiracy theories. Stone, 66, was arrested by the FBI on Friday following an indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller, whose team is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election, as well as ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign. The arrest came after months of scrutiny over Stone\u2019s fate as federal prosecutors zeroed in on the veteran Republican strategist. Stone predicted in August \u201cRobert Mueller is coming for me\u201d, though he denied wrongdoing and said he faced legal peril simply because he had advised Trump for decades. Raised in Lewisboro, New York, Stone\u2019s foray into national politics began when he was just 19. An ardent supporter of Richard Nixon, Stone was part of a scheme in 1972 to sink the former president\u2019s longshot primary challenger, Pete McCloskey. The plot, which was uncovered during the congressional hearings on Watergate, entailed sending McCloskey donations from the \u201cYoung Socialist Alliance\u201d and then leaking the information to the press in an attempt to damage his image. Stone remained such a Nixon devotee that he infamously got the former president\u2019s face tattooed on his back. During the 1970s, Stone also played a key role in bringing the full force of outside campaign money behind negative advertising against congressional candidates. He went on to work for Ronald Reagan\u2019s unsuccessful 1976 presidential campaign and served as a political director on Reagan\u2019s second bid for president in 1980, which sent him to the White House. Although he did not join the Reagan administration, Stone remained a key player in politics. A Washington Post profile, published in 1986, wrote that Stone, then only 33, \u201cearns a reported $450,000 a year, owns two homes and a hot tub, wears $800 designer suits and a Patek Philippe watch\u201d. The following year, Stone urged a real estate developer in New York to run for president: his name was Donald Trump. Over the next three decades, Stone would repeatedly encourage Trump \u2013 whose celebrity status grew more solidified by his foray into reality television \u2013 to seek the presidency. When Trump ultimately threw his hat in the race in the 2016 election cycle, Stone was by his side as a campaign adviser. Although Stone later left the campaign in an official capacity, he continued to informally advise then candidate Trump. Left unknown is what \u2013 if anything \u2013 Stone told Trump about his alleged contacts with WikiLeaks. Mueller\u2019s indictment included evidence purporting to show that Stone had advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to leak thousands of hacked Democratic party emails. Trump expressed confidence last month that Stone would ultimately stay loyal to his cause, despite mounting pressure from the ongoing FBI investigation. \u201cI will never testify against Trump,\u201d the president tweeted last month, quoting Stone. \u201cThis statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about \u2018President Trump.\u2019 Nice to know that some people still have \u2018guts!\u2019\u201d",

The campaign is targeted particularly at young adults and children and aims to break the habitual consumption of drinks with added sugar, which can lead to obesity and tooth decay. Other public figures to have signed up include the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and his Labour shadow, Jonathan Ashworth. For Watson, who managed to reverse his own type 2 diabetes with a rigorous, sugar-free diet and exercise regime, the campaign is not just about saving younger people from health problems but also about fighting back against corporations that profit from children\u2019s high sugar consumption. \u201cThe heaps of sugar companies are putting in their fizzy drinks are as good as poisoning our kids,\u201d he said. \u201cWith scores of children suffering from tooth decay, obesity and even diabetes, we must do something to alert people to the danger of too much sugar,\u201d he said.

We are at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilisation \u2013 and the entire biosphere \u2013 must speak out in clear language, no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be. We must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility. Adults keep saying: \u201cWe owe it to the young people to give them hope.\u201d But I don\u2019t want your hope. I don\u2019t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is. This is an edited version of a speech given by Greta Thunberg at Davos this week.",

The North Atlantic cod stock in the Barents Sea is likely to first rise and then crash, possibly to almost zero before the end of the century if climate change isn\u2019t addressed, says the scientific paper, published by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme. The grim forecast is based on the most comprehensive study to date of the effects of climate change on cod, which \u2013 for the first time \u2013 takes into account ocean acidification as well as warming. It found larvae mortality rates were 75% higher when exposed to the combined pressures of the two factors \u2013 both of which are caused by emissions \u2013 than to heating alone.

It means having to call up restaurants in advance to see if it\u2019s possible to eat there, and then feeling like a nuisance every time you have to grill a stumped waiter about how certain foods are prepared. It means developing a habit of meticulously reading through every single ingredient list, and becoming an expert at studying any allergen guide handed to you. And it means checking, double-checking, and then living with the fear that you haven\u2019t checked enough and that any oversight can, in severe cases, cost you your life. It is a burden people like myself have no choice but to carry, we simply have to learn how to cope. But it\u2019s made even harder when people fail to give us relevant information.

      "bodyText": "The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has raised the prospect of uniformed police or soldiers being deployed to the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a chaotic and disorderly Brexit. In the most explicit warning yet of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, he said in a worst-case scenario, a hard border could \u201cinvolve people in uniform and it may involve the need, for example, for cameras, physical infrastructure, possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up\u201d. His remarks in a Bloomberg TV interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Friday appear to mark a change of approach by Varadkar, who has repeatedly vowed not to put any cameras or infrastructure on the border, which has not had checkpoints since the peace deal 21 years ago. The warning came a day after Irish police chiefs denied they had drawn up secret plans to send 600 officers to beef up border security if Britain crashes out of the EU on 29 March without an agreement. Hints of police or soldiers being deployed will heighten concerns in the border regions, where previously warring communities have enjoyed peaceful coexistence for the past two decades. Referring to a car bomb in Derry a week ago, Varadkar told Bloomberg putting any personnel on the border had to be seen in the context of the history of the Troubles. \u201cThe problem with that in the context of Irish politics and history is those things become targets \u2013 and we\u2019ve already had a certain degree of violence in the last few weeks. I just don\u2019t want to see that come back,\u201d he said. Varadkar also lashed out at Brexiters who are blaming Ireland for the backstop, when it was the solution the EU came up with to address Theresa May\u2019s red lines on the customs union and single market. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones already giving,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK wanted a review clause in the backstop and we agreed to that, the UK wanted a UK-wide element, so why is it the country that is being victimised is the one that\u2019s always asked to give?\u201d His remarks serve to highlight the parallel direction of politics in the EU, which last night repeated that it was in solidarity with Ireland over the backstop, and the UK, where May appears to be winning over opponents including the Democratic Unionist party and Brexiter MPs with promises of changes to the backstop. Varadkar said: \u201cThis is a problem caused by Britain. We came up with a solution. Now that parliament has rejected it, shouldn\u2019t they be offering us something? Why are we the ones who are being constantly asked to help solve the problem they have created? What are they offering us? Nothing at the moment.\u201d His remarks came after a phone call between the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Varadkar in which they agreed to step up no-deal preparations. France is also helping Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with political and commercial leaders from Normandy visiting Dublin this week to discuss contingency plans involving cargo ships travelling directly to the ports of Cherbourg, Dieppe and Ouistreham in order to bypass Britain. Currently, the vast majority of lorries destined for France use the UK as a \u201clandbridge\u201d via Holyhead and Dover ports. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, this route would be threatened as tariff and customs barriers would be erected entering and leaving the UK. Herv\u00e9 Morin, the president of Normandy, said the three ports would be enhanced with sufficient numbers of customs officials and border inspection posts for animal and food health checks in time for 29 March. It also emerged on Friday that Seaborne Freight, the company handed a \u00a313.8m contract to run no-deal Brexit ferries from Ramsgate despite having no ships has started advertising for staff. Seaborne Freight is hiring a stevedore and an operations assistant, with just over 60 days to go before Brexit Day.",

      "body": "<p>For the political left in America today, the future is bright. The seriousness of inequality is now conventional wisdom. Socialism is no longer a political punchline. The popularity of unions is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/241679/labor-union-approval-steady-year-high.aspx\">high</a>. It would seem to be the best time in a half-century to revitalize the languishing labor movement. Yet with all of the political energy \u2013 and despite some high-profile successes \u2013 the labor movement as a whole still languishes. Why?</p> <p>The easy answer is that a decades-long political and propaganda campaign by rightwing and business interests has produced a system of labor law increasingly tilted against workers, making it incredibly difficult to build and maintain unions in the majority of US. states. This is true. But it is also beside the point. Turning around America\u2019s anti-union culture is a long-term project. Organizing working people is something that must happen every day, regardless, because the alternative is for humans to be crushed by the power of capital. The fish can\u2019t stop swimming just because the water is rough.</p> <p>The AFL-CIO is the biggest organized labor group in America. It has 12.5 million members from 55 different unions. It is the closest thing we have to shorthand for \u201cunions\u201d. Reinventing the wheel tends to be a big waste of time. If we want a true, thriving, powerful labor movement in this country, the AFL-CIO will be its beating heart. It therefore must be capable of conjuring great visions and making them real.</p> <p>It has not done that for quite some time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The left should be led by labor, and labor should be led by a strong AFL-CIO</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ideally, the labor movement, which represents the interests of everyone who works for a living, would be the strongest progressive force in the country. Its appeal is broader than that of any special interest or specific issue. It has the virtue of combining self-interest (it will raise your wages), public interest (it will rebuild a strong middle class), and pure righteousness (it puts power into the hands of everyone, not just a privileged few). The left should be led by labor, and labor should be led by a strong AFL-CIO. But today, neither of those things are true. The left is a wild coalition of causes, united most fervently not behind union leaders but behind a cast of political figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez whose message of democratic socialism and economic equality is \u2026 exactly what the labor movement should represent. Unions have fallen so far out of the public consciousness that they have to rely on politicians to get their points across. That\u2019s not good. Organized labor should be leading elected officials to the public, not vice versa. It\u2019s hard to do that when scarcely a tenth of the work force you claim to represent are union members.</p> <p>The AFL-CIO has long operated on the theory that pouring money into national electoral politics will result in power. The past 40 years of history show that\u2019s not the case. During that time, union membership has fallen by more than half, economic inequality has exploded, and Republicans hostile to the working class have steadily accrued more political and legal influence. All of these things are related. A strong labor movement should not have allowed any of them to happen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/16/verizon-union-busting-cwa\">'It's union busting 101': documents reveal Verizon's attacks on organized labor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The truth is that power does not come by serving as an ATM for the Democratic party; power comes from organizing workers. The best way to change red states to blue states is not to show up every other year and pour money into TV advertisements, it is to set up shop permanently and show regular, struggling working people exactly what they can win by embracing solidarity. Class consciousness is not built by campaign slogans. It comes about naturally when people go through the process of organizing. The hard work of building organized labor is an investment that will pay political dividends for decades. Had labor unions taken the more than <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-labor-unions-step-up-presidential-election-spending-1476783002\">$100m they spent on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign</a> and instead used it to hire organizers who would actually organize workers, the labor movement would be better off, and the Democratic party would too.</p> <p>It is only by constantly seeking out new people to unionize that the labor movement can keep up with the changes in our economy.

Fundamentally, it should stop prioritizing taking money from unions to give to politicians, and spend its time helping unions attract new members \u2013 either by redirecting most of its political spending to worker organizing, or by kicking some of the dues money that its member unions pay back to them, earmarked for hiring organizers. As a national organization, the AFL can build and fund cross-union organizing taskforces to unionize important targets such as Amazon, as well as low-hanging fruit such as Starbucks and other companies that claim to have a social conscience, yet do not have a unionized workforce. If money is tight, the AFL can leave its grand headquarters across from the White House and move to cheaper space. Let\u2019s keep our eyes on the prize. Everything should be relentlessly focused on raising union density in America. Even if organizers concentrate only on states that do <em>not </em>have union-busting \u201cright to work\u201d laws, there is plenty of room for improvement.

If the AFL-CIO could, say, double its membership, the question of political influence would take care of itself. There is a bit of boxing wisdom that goes: if you\u2019re getting your ass kicked, do something different. Otherwise you will continue to get your ass kicked. This is a lesson that the leaders of American organized labor have yet to absorb.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/01/amazon-fulfillment-center-warehouse-employees-union-new-york-minnesota\">'We are not robots': Amazon warehouse employees push to unionize</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a labor reporter, I speak to heroes all the time. People who do the hard work of bringing us all together. People who will never be famous, but who believe deeply that working-class solidarity will be our salvation. These people are brilliant, capable, idealistic \u2013 and disillusioned. They want a movement. Instead, the AFL-CIO gives them a bureaucracy. Bureaucrats have their place, but they are particularly unsuited to the task at hand: to seize the attention of millions of working Americans, thrust the idea of unions into their consciousness, and say: \u201cHang on to this for dear life!\u201d</p> <p>Our labor movement needs a Eugene Debs, an Emma Goldman, a Cesar Chavez. Instead, we have Richard Trumka. Richard Trumka has done many good things in his life, but it is fair to say that in his nine years atop the AFL-CIO, he has not become the charismatic leader of an unstoppable wave of union revitalization. His name does not drip from the lips of adoring young idealists. Nor is it whispered with fear by America\u2019s most powerful billionaires. During his time as our nation\u2019s most visible union figure, union membership has declined from <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/union2_01222010.pdf\">12.3% of the workforce</a> to just <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm\">10.7% in 2017</a>. If things keep going as they have been, we will soon be in single digits, and union membership will become an odd curio, like the ability to ride a unicycle, rather than a fundamental characteristic of an economy that works for workers, not hedge funds.</p> <p>As with climate change, the erosion of unions is a crisis that unfolds slowly enough to ignore until it is too late. It is essential that organized labor act with an urgency that matches the peril it\u2019s in. The AFL-CIO today has fewer members than it did when it was formed in 1955, though our nation\u2019s population has doubled. What is the plan for creating the next 12.5 million AFL-CIO members? I don\u2019t know. And I pay attention to these things for a living. There is no plan. All of those individual heroes organizing individual workplaces in individual towns are not a match for global big money. We need to organize industries. We need a movement. For better or worse, the AFL-CIO is the only institution capable of making that movement a reality. Its leaders must inspire a nation, or turn over the keys to someone who can.</p> <p><br></p>",

During his time as our nation\u2019s most visible union figure, union membership has declined from 12.3% of the workforce to just 10.7% in 2017. If things keep going as they have been, we will soon be in single digits, and union membership will become an odd curio, like the ability to ride a unicycle, rather than a fundamental characteristic of an economy that works for workers, not hedge funds. As with climate change, the erosion of unions is a crisis that unfolds slowly enough to ignore until it is too late. It is essential that organized labor act with an urgency that matches the peril it\u2019s in. The AFL-CIO today has fewer members than it did when it was formed in 1955, though our nation\u2019s population has doubled. What is the plan for creating the next 12.5 million AFL-CIO members? I don\u2019t know. And I pay attention to these things for a living. There is no plan. All of those individual heroes organizing individual workplaces in individual towns are not a match for global big money. We need to organize industries. We need a movement. For better or worse, the AFL-CIO is the only institution capable of making that movement a reality. Its leaders must inspire a nation, or turn over the keys to someone who can.",

It\u2019s hardly the first time American workers have been pawns in larger power games. It happens all the time in the private sector. A private-equity firm gains control and eliminates a sizable portion of a company\u2019s jobs. A merger generates a frenzy of payroll cuts. New management threatens to ship jobs offshore if workers don\u2019t accept wage cuts. American capitalism has become more arbitrary and autocratic than at any time in modern history. Not only have most paychecks stopped rising, but economic security has vanished. Few working people feel any sense of control over their lives. This has happened for several reasons. Capital markets are more demanding. Wall Street is insisting that corporations squeeze out every ounce of profit quarter by quarter. It\u2019s easier than ever to outsource jobs to contractors, foreign-based workers, or automated machines, all of which will do them more cheaply. Economic power has become more concentrated in a relative handful of large corporations that can keep a lid on wages even in a tight labor market.

All of which may explain why, as America begins ramping up to the 2020 presidential election, Democratic candidates are talking about empowering workers. The Ohio senator Sherrod Brown has embarked on a \u201cdignity of work\u201d tour of key voting states ahead of a potential run for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 along with a 77-page economic plan to reverse \u201cthe declining value of work\u201d and \u201cmake life better for all workers\u201d.

Warren\u2019s Accountable Capitalism Act also requires that 40% of the boards of such corporations be elected by employees. As the Democratic race heats up, expect more proposals to give workers greater say \u2013 including tripartite wage boards, sectoral bargaining, and independent works councils (similar to those that the United States occupying force wrote for Germany in 1946). Candidates will also want to make it harder for companies to reclassify employees as contract workers, and easier for contract workers to establish associations that can bargain for better pay and improved working conditions (are you listening, Uber?) There will be proposals to give workers more say over how their retirement savings are invested and end conflicts of interest by giant asset managers that push companies to buy their own pension products. All told, we may be witnessing a rebirth of the early-20th-century movement toward \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d, which held that the best way to rectify the imbalance of power between workers and business was to make corporations more democratic and give workers greater say. Industrial democracy was a direct response to the Gilded Age \u2013 an era of gross inequality, unparalleled wealth, searing poverty, powerful monopolies, and political corruption, in which workers toiled for a pittance within often unsafe workplaces.

Arts Council England (ACE) and De Montfort University (DMU) in Leicester announced details of the Talent25 project on Friday. The importance to children of activities such as being read to and reading, listening to and learning music, going to the cinema, theatre, libraries and museums, has been mostly taken as a given.

The star of the TV show Shameless said she had received a high court summons and asked for help in finding a lawyer on social media. The attorney general\u2019s office confirmed it had sent a summons to Malone after she allegedly posted an image said to be of Jon Venables. There is a global ban on publishing anything that reveals the identities of Venables and Robert Thompson, or purports to reveal their identities. They have been living anonymously with new identities since being released from a life sentence for the kidnap, torture and murder of two-year-old James 25 years ago, when they were 10. Malone, 55, from Liverpool, who has also appeared in Brookside, posted a series of messages on Facebook saying she had been served papers by the high court. The post said: \u201cI need a lawyer ASAP! I\u2019ve been committed to the High Court!\u201d Another said: \u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful day until I opened my front door five minutes ago! The High Court have served me!\u201d After the murder in February 1993, Venables and Thompson were given new identities that are strictly protected under the terms of a lifelong injunction. The worldwide injunction bans any images or information relating to their identities being published or shared online, and anyone found guilty of identifying the two men could face up to two years in jail. Malone was accused of retweeting an image said to be of Venables last year, prompting the police to launch an investigation. At the time, she told the Daily Star Sunday: \u201cThe police are only doing their job and if they\u2019re going to caution me, arrest me, pull me in or give me a slap on the wrist, I get that.

Proceedings for contempt are brought by the attorney general, the government\u2019s law officer with the responsibility of policing contempt. An attorney general\u2019s office spokesman said: \u201cThe law officers will review contempt of court allegations made to them, but they cannot comment on the nature of any investigations. \u201cThe law officers remind everyone that an injunction is in place which prevents publication of any images or information claiming to identify anyone as Jon Venables or Robert Thompson.\u201d A date for the hearing has yet to be fixed.",

According to the latest snapshot from the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses raised the ratio of their stocks to expected sales in January to the highest level since February 2008. The report, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the UK economy, said retailers expected demand to fall and had built up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal. A growing number of companies have begun ramping up their plans for a potentially disruptive no-deal Brexit at the end of March, with Westminster still gridlocked since Theresa May suffered the biggest government defeat in history over her Brexit plan. Firms including Bentley, the luxury carmaker, and retailers such as Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home have announced plans to shore up supplies in the event of chaos at British ports. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, said: \u201cThere are early signs of companies bracing themselves for a no-deal Brexit: some of our wholesalers are now reporting that they\u2019re building up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal.\u201d The CBI distributive trades survey, which has run since 1983, surveyed 103 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between 27 December and 14 January.

There was hardly a moment of parity, Pouille\u2019s occasional best efforts bludgeoned into irrelevance as Djokovic moved over the court with his familiar elasticity and menace.

      "bodyText": "A senior ally of Jeremy Corbyn has said holding a second EU referendum could badly affect the relationship between politicians and the public, as a series of Labour backbenchers tabled new amendments seeking such an option. Ian Lavery, a Labour MP who is also the party\u2019s national campaigns coordinator, said that while the possibility of a second referendum should be maintained as a way to end an otherwise intractable Brexit impasse, he was worried about the consequences. Labour\u2019s frontbench has tabled an amendment to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan which includes this option, as decreed by party policy, Lavery says in an article for the Guardian. \u201cHowever, we should be in no doubt that asking the voters to vote again on an issue they have already given an answer, until they come up with the right answer, risks serious damage to the relationship between many citizens and politicians at Westminster.\u201d The best solution would be a Labour government, Lavery wrote, \u201cnot rerunning a divisive campaign that seems likely to deliver the same result again and do nothing to answer the demand of a country crying out for real change.\u201d Such sentiments from someone seen as close to Corbyn\u2019s team will dishearten those in the party keen to push forward the option of a second referendum, something that polls show is backed by a majority of Labour members. On Thursday a planned cross-party amendment for a so-called people\u2019s vote was dropped by its organisers, who said the lack of explicit Labour frontbench backing meant it was unlikely to pass. However, the Commons order paper for Tuesday\u2019s crucial series of votes on the next stages for Brexit now features three new amendments tabled by Labour MPs seeking this eventuality. The amendments, tabled by Ian Murray, Angela Smith and Mike Gapes, are amendments to the Labour frontbench amendment, and seek to mandate the government to organise a second referendum. The Smith version is backed by four other Labour MPs. In his article, Lavery said May had \u201cspectacularly failed to deliver a Brexit deal that will meet the needs of our country\u201d. He wrote: \u201cHer attempts to revive her categorically rejected deal seem to have about the same chance of success as the kiss of life would have on the T rex exhibit at the Natural History Museum.\u201d In parallel with Labour MPs\u2019 manoeuvrings over a second referendum, Conservative backbenchers have been tabling amendments seeking to demonstrate their dislike of the Irish backstop, one of the main factors that led to the defeat of May\u2019s plan. One of the key amendments on Tuesday, if selected for a vote by the Speaker, could be one tabled by the Tory MP Andrew Murrison that has attracted the support of key figures such as Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, and May\u2019s former de facto deputy Damian Green. This calls for the backstop \u2013 an indefinite insurance policy that would come into force if no permanent deal can be made to prevent a hard Irish border \u2013 to be \u201creplaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border\u201d. While this could win over many Tory MPs who voted against the deal, and possibly also May\u2019s DUP partners, it would require a change in the EU\u2019s stance, which is seen as very unlikely. Asked whether more concessions from Brussels were possible, May\u2019s spokesman indicated on Friday that some movement was needed. \u201cI think there is a clear message from EU leaders that they want us to leave with a deal, and they understand that a deal is in the best interests of the United Kingdom and the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister put the deal as it stands before parliament, and that deal suffered a significant defeat.

To understand why certain events happened, you have to accept that cultural values, which might seem shocking by today\u2019s standards, were once commonplace.

Travis were \u2013 I know this is hard to believe now, but trust me \u2013 at the time a coolish rock band who played what was then considered real music. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NwqN-xj9Xs\">The choice was a shock: Britney Spears\u2019s \u2026 Baby One More Time</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it for a laugh the first time,\u201d said Fran Healy in an interview in 2005. \u201cAnd as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile.

To understand why certain events happened, you have to accept that cultural values, which might seem shocking by today\u2019s standards, were once commonplace. With this in mind, cast your mind back to 1999, a time in which Travis were both popular and relevant. It was this summer, when the band were at the height of their powers, that they started adding a cover to their setlist. Travis were \u2013 I know this is hard to believe now, but trust me \u2013 at the time a coolish rock band who played what was then considered real music. The choice was a shock: Britney Spears\u2019s \u2026 Baby One More Time. \u201cWe did it for a laugh the first time,\u201d said Fran Healy in an interview in 2005. \u201cAnd as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It\u2019s a very well-crafted song. It has that magic thing.\u201d Travis\u2019s cover began a bizarre part of musical history. It was a time in which bearded menage the Magic Numbers took on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Crazy in Love, replacing its searing horns with contrite melodicas. Keane performed a mash-up of Christina Aguilera\u2019s Dirrrty and Destiny Child\u2019s Bootylicious (they adapted the lyrics to namecheck the members of the band so the opening lines became: \u201cTim, can you handle this? Richard, can you handle this?\u201d). Inherent in these performances is a horrible indie smugness.

The camera pans up to reveal the character\u2019s timeless knitwear and hair. He turns toward us, all goatee and shades, gives a perfectly low-key smile and nod, and goes on his way. As in the original movie, tumbleweed drifts down the urban pavement and Bob Dylan sings The Man in Me.</p> <p>For Lebowski fans \u2013 or Achievers, to give us our proper title \u2013 merely seeing that <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/movies/20-big-lebowski-quotes/\">the Dude abides</a> is enough to warm the heart. It\u2019s good knowing he\u2019s still out there, takin\u2019 her easy for all us sinners, and Bridges still absolutely looks the part. But a couple more things come to mind, too. The date given at the end of the video is Sunday 3 February: the day of the Superbowl, which is as famous for gimmicky high-profile commercials as it is for touchdowns. Has the Dude sold out to the Man? And, if so, why does the Man even think he\u2019s worth buying?</p> <p>The bad news is that Bridges\u2019s video looks like an ad for an ad rather than a new Lebowski movie. Bridges has said he\u2019d be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bridges-on-big-lebowski-sequel-2016-7?r=UK\">happy to revisit the role</a> \u2013 and John Turturro has <a href=\"https://cornerstonefilm.com/films/going-places/\">reportedly</a> spun his character, Jesus, off into a whole new movie \u2013 but the Coens have <a href=\"https://variety.com/2016/film/news/big-lebowski-sequel-coen-brothers-1201694771/\">ruled out </a>a Lebowski sequel. We\u2019re likely looking at a commercial, then \u2013 though given that the Coens have <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/coen-brothers-directed-their-first-super-bowl-ad-mercedes-benz-175784/\">made Superbowl ads </a>in the past, there\u2019s still a chance they\u2019re involved.</p> <p>Judgment should be reserved until the date rolls around but, given the Dude\u2019s avowedly underground sensibility, the idea of him shilling for some corporate product can\u2019t help deflate the excitement of seeing him at large once more. Well, he might shrug, you gotta feed the monkey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49fc1343d7f47f20201980c615e5dcc036f82e05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49fc1343d7f47f20201980c615e5dcc036f82e05/208_1088_2947_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abiding citizens \u2026 John Goodman and Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abiding citizens \u2026 John Goodman and Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Park Circus &amp; Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it\u2019s interesting to ask why the character is still deemed resonant enough to exploit. Why, more than two decades on, does the Dude still strike a chord?</p> <p>Call me a sap but I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s because he represents qualities that can seem hard to come by these days \u2013 relics of a different era, even. He\u2019s a live-and-let-live kind of guy, a devotee of peace and love with beliefs about mutual care that are deeply held but lightly worn. He\u2019s slow to anger or insult, abhors aggression and conflict, and happily drinks and bowls with a best bud, Walter (John Goodman), whose politics and life experience are the polar opposite of his own. At a time when division, accusation and contempt seem to be all around, the Dude offers an offbeat model of love. Here\u2019s hoping that, on 3 February, Walter will be back to share in it too.</p>",

And over the last day or so, the Dude \u2013 AKA Jeffrey Lebowski, the iconic stoner-deadbeat-turned-understated-hero played by Jeff Bridges in the Coen brothers\u2019 1998 classic The Big Lebowski \u2013 well, his time and place has been on Twitter, a realm even weirder than his home turf of 90s Los Angeles. On Thursday, Bridges posted a 15-second video on Twitter, since watched more than 7m times and pored over in great detail, teasing the return of the Dude. Those familiar jelly sandals walk in on a floorful of party detritus, with smashed wine glasses, salad plates and asparagus spears suggesting somewhat classier surrounds than the Dude\u2019s typical hangouts. The camera pans up to reveal the character\u2019s timeless knitwear and hair. He turns toward us, all goatee and shades, gives a perfectly low-key smile and nod, and goes on his way. As in the original movie, tumbleweed drifts down the urban pavement and Bob Dylan sings The Man in Me. For Lebowski fans \u2013 or Achievers, to give us our proper title \u2013 merely seeing that the Dude abides is enough to warm the heart. It\u2019s good knowing he\u2019s still out there, takin\u2019 her easy for all us sinners, and Bridges still absolutely looks the part. But a couple more things come to mind, too. The date given at the end of the video is Sunday 3 February: the day of the Superbowl, which is as famous for gimmicky high-profile commercials as it is for touchdowns. Has the Dude sold out to the Man? And, if so, why does the Man even think he\u2019s worth buying? The bad news is that Bridges\u2019s video looks like an ad for an ad rather than a new Lebowski movie. Bridges has said he\u2019d be happy to revisit the role \u2013 and John Turturro has reportedly spun his character, Jesus, off into a whole new movie \u2013 but the Coens have ruled out a Lebowski sequel. We\u2019re likely looking at a commercial, then \u2013 though given that the Coens have made Superbowl ads in the past, there\u2019s still a chance they\u2019re involved. Judgment should be reserved until the date rolls around but, given the Dude\u2019s avowedly underground sensibility, the idea of him shilling for some corporate product can\u2019t help deflate the excitement of seeing him at large once more. Well, he might shrug, you gotta feed the monkey. Yet it\u2019s interesting to ask why the character is still deemed resonant enough to exploit. Why, more than two decades on, does the Dude still strike a chord? Call me a sap but I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s because he represents qualities that can seem hard to come by these days \u2013 relics of a different era, even. He\u2019s a live-and-let-live kind of guy, a devotee of peace and love with beliefs about mutual care that are deeply held but lightly worn. He\u2019s slow to anger or insult, abhors aggression and conflict, and happily drinks and bowls with a best bud, Walter (John Goodman), whose politics and life experience are the polar opposite of his own. At a time when division, accusation and contempt seem to be all around, the Dude offers an offbeat model of love. Here\u2019s hoping that, on 3 February, Walter will be back to share in it too.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t happen today,\u201d Willie John McBride says on a rainy morning at home in Ballyclare as he explains the vast differences between the gleaming powerhouse of Irish rugby today and a ramshackle sport which he only began playing at the age of 17. Four years later, in 1962, as McBride remembers, \u201cI was in the Lions Test team. Remarkably, I survived.\u201d</p> \n<p>McBride not only survived. At 78 he remains the godfather of Irish rugby and a lock forward who won 63 caps for Ireland and played a record 17 Lions Tests. He also provides a perfect starting point for a journey through Irish rugby as McBride\u2019s story shows how much Ireland and the game have changed. Despite past sectarian conflicts and multiple identities, there is a new cohesion among the four rugby provinces and the national team.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/22/conor-murray-munster-ireland-anthony-foley-interview\">Conor Murray: \u2018You can usually process death.

Ireland will face England at home with serene confidence in their opening Six Nations game on Saturday 2 February.</p> \n<p>The contrast with McBride\u2019s debut against England, in February 1962, is stark. His first cap came in the midst of an 11-match winless slump stretching from February 1961 to March 1963. \u201cWe ran out with nine new caps at Twickenham and were beaten 16-0 \u2013 which was a hiding because a try was only three points.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"567640e5c87374827531682a458a9e74da300bfe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/567640e5c87374827531682a458a9e74da300bfe/0_0_6400_4224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willie John McBride, the former Ireland and Lions rugby union captain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willie John McBride, the former Ireland and Lions rugby union captain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Willie John McBride, the former Ireland and Lions rugby union captain and below is one of his old Irish rugby jerseys.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In his third match for Ireland, against France, McBride played the last 30 minutes with a broken leg. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI remember removing my boot and two guys ran on with a sponge and water.

There is talk about the World Cup but Ireland don\u2019t get carried away. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/19/ireland-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-joe-schmidt\">beat the All Blacks</a> and move on. That\u2019s Joe\u2019s character and in the last 15 minutes against New Zealand he brought on players who were just as good as those they replaced. Murray is a super player. Young Stockdale is another. I like Iain Henderson at lock. Ireland have few weaknesses.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Rugby gave us sanity and unity beyond the madness</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Willie John McBride</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This is high praise from McBride who spends longer lamenting the ills of the modern game. He feels the ethos and camaraderie of rugby have been lost and he mourns the slow death of club rugby. Where clubs were once the lifeblood, the provinces of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht now dominate. Their best players are contracted to the Irish union \u2013 which means their focus is on European and Test rugby. Unlike their exhausted counterparts in the English Premiership, the cream of Irish rugby often miss mundane Pro14 games.</p> \n<p>McBride sighs. \u201cSomebody said to me: \u2018This game is about five different things. Money, money, money, money and money.\u2019 Professional rugby sucks all the good players out of the club scene. They have destroyed this part of rugby.\u201d</p> \n<p>Everyone else among the dozen people I interview accepts that, to compete with England\u2019s massive player pool and financial power, Ireland needed a structure that would allow the national team and the provinces to thrive. Leinster are European champions and Munster and Ulster offer key players to Ireland. All three Irish provinces qualified for the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup last weekend. In contrast, only one English club, Saracens, reached the knockout stages. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"43e1ce40-3c10-43b3-b91e-59a2ca4a31c9\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Ulster</b>&nbsp;Ballyclare and Belfast</p>\n    <p><b>Willie John McBride</b>&nbsp;(aged 78), born 6 June 1940 in Toombridge, Northern Ireland.

The 59-year-old solicitor, who played 31 times for Ireland and won four Lions caps in the 1980s, is an eloquent advocate for this current Ireland team and, more importantly, the force for good that rugby exerts in the south and, particularly, Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says of the game\u2019s capacity to forge together people from bitterly divided communities. \u201cRugby shows the way to build relationships on this island. My frustration is that, politically, we\u2019ve chosen methods of alienation, exclusion, hatred and violence. Rugby has always been relaxed about identities. It has an Irishness comfortable with a British aspect to it. And a Britishness comfortable with an Irish part of its identity. The politicians and extremists couldn\u2019t have done it much worse but rugby has shown another way.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6326a00d09424bfc647291a23185df4f336ea2a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6326a00d09424bfc647291a23185df4f336ea2a/0_0_6516_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Ringland, the former Ireland and Lions player, in front of the famous cranes of the Harland and Wolff dockyard in Belfast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Ringland, the former Ireland and Lions player, in front of the famous cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Trevor Ringland, the former Ireland and Lions player, in front of the famous cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Ringland is a Protestant who worked briefly as a politician before the parochialism became too much for him, and yet this is just one aspect of his identity. \u201cI\u2019m a Belfast man and an Ulsterman. I\u2019m British and I\u2019m Irish. I\u2019m Northern Irish and I\u2019m European. I\u2019m a long-suffering Leeds United supporter [Ringland laughs]. These identities are interchangeable and anyone who demeans any one part demeans me as a person. A multilayered identity challenges the extremists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ringland withdrew from politics when a unionist party leader refused to accept his invitation to attend a GAA final if a team from the North made it to Croke Park in Dublin. The unionist believed Croke Park symbolised Republican territory. In turn, many supporters of Gaelic football and hurling regard rugby as a Protestant sport. Few Catholic schools in Ulster play rugby but Ringland wants to break down the barriers \u2013 as Irish rugby did when the national team played at Croke Park from 2007 to 2010.</p> \n<p>The GAA relented on a rule prohibiting the playing of \u201cforeign\u201d sports at Croke Park and allowed Ireland to use its spiritual home. When <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0222/854651-rugby-ireland-v-england-croke-park/\">England arrived at Croke Park</a> in 2007, there was a danger history would swamp the occasion. Fourteen people were killed in and around Croke Park on 21 November 1920, when British soldiers opened fire on the crowd at the GAA headquarters, on a day of terrible violence during the Irish War of Independence. But rugby and Croke Park found harmony in a different century.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d Ringland says, \u201cand the first time I sang all three anthems \u2013 the Irish anthem, Ireland\u2019s Call and even God Save The Queen. All were received with impeccable respect. It was incredibly emotional and showed us moving towards a maturing society where we respect the different traditions across the island.

I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/17/jacob-stockdale-ireland-six-nations-new-zealand-world-cup-interview\">already interviewed Stockdale</a> and Iain Henderson and they are entertaining and intelligent players who represent a different kind of Ulster to a province once beset by violence and prejudice. Whether talking about his father\u2019s work as a prison chaplain or telling me \u201cJohnny Cash is my idol\u201d, Stockdale is exuberant. He also stresses the Irish squad\u2019s harmony. \u201cFrom day one,\u201d the 22-year-old wing says, \u201cI felt only friendship from the guys from every province. Our different backgrounds are joked about. That\u2019s brilliant. You\u2019ve got a Protestant from Ulster captaining Ireland. Rory is the most successful Ireland captain ever.\u201d</p> \n<p>Henderson underlines the new unity. He went to one of the few mixed schools, of Catholics and Protestants, in north Belfast. Henderson is Protestant and his wife, who went to the same school, is Catholic. \u201cYou notice a massive crossover in rugby now,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter we beat New Zealand in November I felt the impact. I filled my car with petrol in Belfast and three people said: \u2018Great game at the weekend.\u2019 Before, when you went down to Dublin, it was like you\u2019d flown to the other side of the world. Now when you come back to Belfast you feel everyone\u2019s invested into the huge potential of Ireland in a World Cup year.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ringland agrees: \u201cThis is the best Irish squad we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a glorious period for Irish rugby.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018The old pride surged again\u2019 </h2> \n<p>I like talking about glory in Limerick with Gerry McLoughlin, the great old prop who played for Munster, Ireland and the Lions. McLoughlin was in the famous Munster team which became the first Irish side to beat New Zealand in 1978. At a time when Munster men believed they had to be twice as good as Leinster players to be picked for Ireland, McLoughlin scored a famous try at Twickenham as Ireland won the Triple Crown in 1982. McLoughlin grimaces when he says the try becomes more outlandish every year as people insist he carried most of the England pack on his back while bulldozing over.</p> \n<p>In Jerry Flannery\u2019s bar, McLoughlin is more interested in talking about rugby now. \u201cYoung Joey Carbery is some player,\u201d he says of the gifted No 10 who helped Munster to reach the European knockout stages yet again. \u201cNow there\u2019s progress in Irish rugby.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37932978bcdf519a0ff70d1d1cd0548337f95088\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37932978bcdf519a0ff70d1d1cd0548337f95088/0_0_6568_4352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the Shannon RFC clubhouse next to the stadium, Munster fans watch the Leicester v Ulster match on a TV placed above a picture of the famous Munster and Shannon player Gerrry \u2018Ginger\u2019 McLoughlin and the shields won by the club for winning the All-Ireland League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the Shannon RFC clubhouse next to the stadium, Munster fans watch the Leicester v Ulster match on a TV placed above a picture of the famous Munster and Shannon player Gerrry \u2018Ginger\u2019 McLoughlin and the shields won by the club for winning the All-Ireland League.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Munster fans watch the Leicester versus Ulster match on a TV in the Shannon RFC clubhouse.

Carbery was a Sexton understudy at Leinster. The 22-year-old\u2019s talent was obvious but Sexton couldn\u2019t be shifted; and so Schmidt and <a href=\"https://www.sportsjoe.ie/rugby/joey-carbery-can-turn-munster-champions-161980\">the IRFU were not unhappy Carbery moved to Limerick</a> this season. Munster yearned for his creativity and Ireland needed Carberry playing at fly-half in the furnace of European competition \u2013 just in case Sexton sustained injury. Leinster agreed to a loan which may became permanent because their depth is such that Ross Byrne, in Sexton\u2019s absence, could steer them to a convincing win against Toulouse this month.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like my day,\u201d McLoughlin says wryly, \u201cbut we love having Carbery at Munster.\u201d</p> \n<p>McLoughlin, the mayor of Limerick in 2012, stresses how much Munster\u2019s rugby players have lifted the city. \u201cLimerick had a terrible reputation with drugs. But once Munster became a European force the old pride surged again. That\u2019s rugby\u2019s power.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b332b7d88a6730bdd17afff0e0e4c029cbb4f10a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b332b7d88a6730bdd17afff0e0e4c029cbb4f10a/0_180_6389_3833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans make their way to the game before the European Champions Cup between Munster and Exeter at Thomond Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans make their way to the game before the European Champions Cup between Munster and Exeter at Thomond Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"18abc8d4699b9f9f4baa41fc22f73bbf13f3700d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18abc8d4699b9f9f4baa41fc22f73bbf13f3700d/1472_0_4180_4180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conor Murray (left) and Chris Farrell lead a group of Munster players as they do a half lap of the pitch to finish their warmup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conor Murray (left) and Chris Farrell lead a group of Munster players as they do a half lap of the pitch to finish their warmup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d57c49474ae517608d454f146bab8973b5ffceb3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d57c49474ae517608d454f146bab8973b5ffceb3/981_0_4312_4312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Munster Rugby Supporters Club choir sing their traditional song \u201cStand Up And Fight\u201d just before the teams come out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Munster Rugby Supporters Club choir sing their traditional song \u201cStand Up And Fight\u201d just before the teams come out.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Fans make their way to Thomond Park for the European Champions Cup match between Munster and Exeter; Conor Murray (left) and Chris Farrell lead a group of Munster players as they do a half-lap of the pitch to finish their warmup; the Munster Rugby Supporters Club choir sing their traditional song \u201cStand Up And Fight\u201d just before the teams come out.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Niall O\u2019Donovan, who enjoyed having McLoughlin as his economics schoolteacher, straddles the divide between the amateur and professional eras.

In 1997, while still coaching Shannon, O\u2019Donovan joined Declan Kidney as they took charge of a newly professional Munster. Until then, Munster only played three or four games a year while the clubs dominated every week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e81c3aed0b06d82d4592254f6c520d97d8e3c058\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e81c3aed0b06d82d4592254f6c520d97d8e3c058/0_0_4492_2901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd watch a scrum during Munster\u2019s game against Exeter in the European Champions Cup at Thomond Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The crowd watch a scrum during Munster\u2019s game against Exeter in the European Champions Cup at Thomond Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d9cdf5ce3686a91eb7f5e2fcccbf57aa373e42d7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9cdf5ce3686a91eb7f5e2fcccbf57aa373e42d7/0_312_6648_3988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Munster fans celebrate during the European Champions Cup match against Exeter at Thomond Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Munster fans celebrate during the European Champions Cup match against Exeter at Thomond Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c42a607db87ceb7d38fd77caa8bc4fb728ccbe04\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c42a607db87ceb7d38fd77caa8bc4fb728ccbe04/0_223_6624_3975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niall O\u2019Donovan, the Munster team manager, at the European Champions Cup match against Exeter at Thomond Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niall O\u2019Donovan, the Munster team manager, at the European Champions Cup match against Exeter at Thomond Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a25861564b800cbe51520db793355db6feaa478\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a25861564b800cbe51520db793355db6feaa478/0_0_4780_3248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joey Carbery (centre) is congratulated by Rory Scannell (left) and Alby Mathewson (right) after his kick won the match for Munster against Exeter at Thomond Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joey Carbery (centre) is congratulated by Rory Scannell (left) and Alby Mathewson (right) after his kick won the match for Munster against Exeter at Thomond Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The crowd watch a scrum during Munster\u2019s European Champions Cup match against Exeter at Thomond Park; Munster fans celebrate during the match; Niall O\u2019Donovan, the Munster team manager; Joey Carbery (centre) is congratulated by Rory Scannell (left) and Alby Mathewson (right) after his kick won the match for Munster 9-7.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>O\u2019Donovan knew Irish rugby had to change. \u201cIt\u2019s sad but the club game had to give way. The IRFU got it right and put more money into the four provinces. I remember it changing. We played Saracens in the Heineken Cup in 1999 and took 10 fans with two flags. Then we went to the semi-final against Toulouse in Bordeaux in 2000. The streets had turned Munster red. The place was jammed, the bars were crammed. We outnumbered Toulouse in France. We got to the final at Twickenham and the ground was a sea of red \u2013 with three times as many fans as Northampton. Munster lost that day but we won the Heineken Cup twice on magical days.\u201d</p> \n<p>O\u2019Donovan then worked as Ireland\u2019s forwards coach from 2002 to 2008. \u201cWe had some great days, some horrible days. Typical Irish. Joe Schmidt has had a huge influence in making Ireland so much more consistent and confident but you have to credit the IRFU for putting in good foundations. All four provinces supply depth to Joe\u2019s squad. So it\u2019s sustainable.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902EZJmqbVAm1Gk/\" data-alt=\"Donald McRae's Irish journey\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/01/archive-zip/giv-3902EZJmqbVAm1Gk/\">Donald McRae's Irish journey</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Amid such success, O\u2019Donovan offers a telling reminder. \u201cRugby is still the fourth-choice sport in Ireland. Hurling, Gaelic football and soccer are still the first three in playing numbers in a very small population. So some weeks at Munster we understand we won\u2019t play our best players. We look to get a longer lifespan out of them as there are just four professional teams in Ireland. England have 12. In Ireland we have a player pool of about 110 Irish professionals. We have to make sure they\u2019re kept in good nick.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I was captain at a time when we changed the coach nearly every nine months \u2026 we weren\u2019t good enough or fit enough</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Keith Wood</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cEvery little Irish village has a Gaelic football pitch, a hurling pitch, a pub and a church. Hurling is embedded into rural Ireland and rugby can\u2019t replace that. Limerick is probably the only place where rugby is the main sport. We were delighted Limerick won the All-Ireland Hurling final last August [beating Galway at Croke Park in front of 82,000 fans] but rugby is in every corner of the city. Everybody here follows rugby. You won\u2019t find that anywhere else in Ireland.\u201d</p> \n<p>O\u2019Donovan still supports his old club and last month he watched Shannon play Garryowen. \u201cThere was a reasonable crowd of 400 but it\u2019s hard on the clubs now. Munster can\u2019t afford to let the clubs die. In Leinster many players come through Dublin\u2019s private schools whereas here the clubs have always been the backbone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Keith Wood, the former Ireland captain who was world rugby\u2019s player of the year in 2001, comes from Killaloe in County Clare, half an hour away, but we meet at his old school in Limerick. St Munchin\u2019s was founded in 1796 and it has a great rugby heritage with five former pupils, including Wood and Conor Murray, having played for the Lions. Wood\u2019s three sons are pupils now and he is proud of the fact that, unlike the Dublin conveyor belt of privately educated rugby talent, St Munchin\u2019s is not a fee-paying school.</p> \n<p>Few rugby players can match the range of Wood\u2019s interests and he remains a captivating presence. Before he takes me on a tour of the school which <a href=\"https://www.rugbyworld.com/countries/ireland-countries/keith-woods-son-scores-wonder-try-90074\">ends up with us watching his eldest son, Alexander</a>, and his teammates finish their training session in the gathering darkness, Wood offers a striking analogy \u2013 Irish rugby is like a three-legged stool.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb70f4ad6bc5064cec0d5c958efd04813cf23beb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb70f4ad6bc5064cec0d5c958efd04813cf23beb/0_6_6672_4004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Wood, the former Ireland and Lions player, stands above Lough Derg in County Tipperary, near his home town of Killaloe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Wood, the former Ireland and Lions player, stands above Lough Derg in County Tipperary, near his home town of Killaloe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The former Ireland and Lions player Keith Wood stands above Lough Derg in the Arra Mountains, County Tipperary, near his home town of Killaloe.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>\u201cThe provinces, the clubs and the schools hold up the game. The professional provincial leg looks perfect. The schools rugby leg is pretty good. The other leg, the club game, is not great \u2013 because we\u2019re dealing with nascent professionalism. Rugby has only been professional for 20 years. It\u2019s now time to fix the club leg. It\u2019s when things are going well that you need to do your repair work.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe board have got so many things right \u2013 some by accident, some by incredible planning. They\u2019ve done really well because they have protected the players. Johnny Sexton played 22 matches last year. I played 42 matches some years. We also have Joe Schmidt. I\u2019m not saying Joe is the best coach in the world for other teams, but for Ireland he\u2019s ideal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wood won 58 caps from 1994 to 2003. \u201cI was captain at a time when we changed the coach nearly every nine months. I had six coaches up until 1998 but we weren\u2019t good enough or fit enough. Until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/warren-gatland\">Warren Gatland</a> came in there was no consistency of selection. Gatty changed that and gave us a consistent way of playing. We became incredibly hard to beat. There was a big improvement and then Eddie O\u2019Sullivan brought us to a higher level and we won some Triple Crowns [for beating England, Scotland and Wales]. There was a sense something else was coming.\u201d</p> \n<p>That \u201csomething else\u201d meant that Ireland, under Schmidt, were transformed. \u201cI really like watching Ireland play now,\u201d Wood says. \u201cSometimes they grind out things which aren\u2019t great, and I like them for that too. I love going to a game thinking: \u2018We\u2019re going to win but I want to see how we win it.\u2019 I was convinced the week before that Ireland would beat New Zealand in November. As the week went on, I started thinking: \u2018Jesus, I\u2019m putting the kibosh on it.\u2019 And then the game starts and, after 10 minutes, I said: \u2018We\u2019re going to win this. You can see it, you can sense it. They\u2019re so in synch.\u2019 Of course we won. That\u2019s why Irish rugby, right now, is such fun.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f1b5f437ea81bae03635f813ae41b693921d36e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f1b5f437ea81bae03635f813ae41b693921d36e/0_0_5292_3528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young Munster U20s v Shannon RFC U20s, a local Limerick derby match, played at Tom Clifford Park, Greenfields.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon RFC U20s surge forward as they take on Young Munster U20s in a local Limerick derby match, played at Tom Clifford Park, Greenfields.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Shannon RFC U20s surge forward as they take on Young Munster U20s in a local Limerick derby match, played at Tom Clifford Park, Greenfields.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Wood considers a 22-year-old Leinster lock who has just 12 caps for Ireland. \u201cJames Ryan looks a born professional rugby player. My God, he\u2019s lost two games in his life. Three losses, tops, in two years. He lost one game for Ireland on tour. And a game against Toulouse. He might have lost one other. These are All Black-style stats. Ryan looks mature, capable, strong, robust, a really good player with an extraordinary thirst for work. He doesn\u2019t make many mistakes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ryan is a product of St Michael\u2019s which has become one of the dominant schools in Dublin. Wood says: \u201cThere are 1.5 million people in Dublin \u2013 which is a conduit to excellence because so many are willing to pay to get their kids to certain schools. So in Leinster huge numbers are coming through the system. In Munster we would like more players coming through the schools. But there are demographic issues and more poverty in Limerick. I think there are 22 premier schools in Ireland and St Munchin\u2019s is the only one that doesn\u2019t pay its coaches. But they have produced 18 Irish internationals and five Lions. They buck the trend.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Cohesion and identity</h2> \n<p>I first met Justin Vanstone at Saracens\u2019 training ground in Hertfordshire. Vanstone and four of his fellow Blackrock College rugby coaches spent a day shadowing their Saracens counterparts, including Mark McCall, the director of rugby. It was a sign of the Dublin school\u2019s sheer professionalism.</p> \n<p>Vanstone is English but he has lived in Dublin for 16 years. He is a perceptive teacher and, when we meet at Blackrock a month later, Vanstone is also a passionate guide around a rugby institution. We begin by walking down a corridor lined with photographs from school teams over the years which have produced so many internationals from Fergus Slattery, Hugo MacNeill and Leo Cullen to Brian O\u2019Driscoll, Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery.</p> \n<p>The current system appears more striking as Vanstone charts the dedication of his schoolboys. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be uncommon for a boy to be in at 7am for something rugby-based before school. There will be training after school and the boys do night study from 6pm to 9pm. It\u2019s a long day but they wouldn\u2019t be in before seven every morning because we try to get a balance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vanstone stresses that his first-team drives standards. \u201cThe boys expect to have the video of our Saturday morning game that evening or early Sunday morning. We create clips they\u2019ll go over before we assess it as a group on Monday. Expectations are high and we don\u2019t want the coaches doing all the analysis. If it\u2019s one-way traffic how can you expect boys to make decisions? Of course early in the season it is coach-led. But we like to step back and hear the boys\u2019 voices.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"992466ef459d990a935689f62b93018d9b33f958\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/992466ef459d990a935689f62b93018d9b33f958/0_0_6480_4272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Vanstone, head coach for Blackrock College school rugby team, prepares for his Monday video analysis session looking at the previous weekend match at Blackrock College in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Vanstone, head coach for Blackrock College school rugby team, prepares for his Monday video analysis session looking at the previous weekend match at Blackrock College in Dublin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d502aae32ab9bdb9b7c5ae6687570fdacb82afe1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d502aae32ab9bdb9b7c5ae6687570fdacb82afe1/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The main pitch, known as the \u2018Front Lawn\u2019 which is played on for a maximum of four matches per year, next to the \u2018Boarding Castle\u2019 at Blackrock College in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The main pitch, known as the \u2018Front Lawn\u2019 which is played on for a maximum of four matches per year, next to the \u2018Boarding Castle\u2019 at Blackrock College in Dublin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"cc6826c9df88285c25d09dff3879046774176163\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc6826c9df88285c25d09dff3879046774176163/0_0_5681_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The corridor at Blackrock College that shows all the old first-team rugby photos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The corridor at Blackrock College that shows all the old first-team rugby photos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53651deabb345c58120686b705728b6f7d8ee576\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53651deabb345c58120686b705728b6f7d8ee576/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The so-called Blackrock College \u2018Dream Team\u2019 that won the Schools Cup in 1996 which had five players who became full Irish internationals including Leo Cullen and Brian O\u2019Driscoll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The so-called Blackrock College \u2018Dream Team\u2019 that won the Schools Cup in 1996 which had five players who became full Irish internationals including Leo Cullen and Brian O\u2019Driscoll.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Justin Vanstone, head coach for Blackrock College school rugby team, prepares for his Monday video analysis session; the main pitch, known as the \u2018Front Lawn\u2019 which is played on for a maximum of four matches per year; the corridor at Blackrock College that shows all the old first-team photos including one of the \u2018Dream Team\u2019 that won the Schools Cup in 1996 which had five players who became full Irish internationals including Leo Cullen and Brian O\u2019Driscoll.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Video analysis includes studying the opposition. Vanstone explains that the top schools share their footage. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those unwritten rules that, during the friendly season, you do not attend an opponent\u2019s game. But it\u2019s fair game to access videos before the Leinster Schools Cup campaign. To avoid espionage, Leinster video these games and set up a database for us to study each other. It works for Leinster because they get video footage of the best schoolboys. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vanstone nods when I say it sounds very serious. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree that it\u2019s become very professional with a small \u2018p\u2019. But it\u2019s down to the coaches to ensure that the unity, camaraderie and old-fashioned enjoyment of sport remains.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVNQCTnY9Ao\">Tadgh Furlong</a> offers compelling evidence that Leinster are not just dependent on the outstanding private schools found within a six-mile radius of each other in Dublin. Furlong comes from a farming family in the small parish of Horeswood, County Wexford, a two-and-half-hour journey from where we sit at Leinster\u2019s training headquarters at University College Dublin.</p> \n<p>The prop is warm and welcoming and full of great stories about growing up in Wexford where he played hurling and Gaelic football as well as rugby. Furlong burst to prominence in the autumn of 2016 when he made his first Test start and, that November, he played in Ireland\u2019s historic victory over New Zealand in Chicago. He has since played for the Lions, in the drawn 2017 series against the All Blacks, and established himself as arguably the best prop in world rugby. One measure of Furlong\u2019s stature is that he has played New Zealand in six Tests and lost only two.</p> \n<p>\u201cRugby is a winter sport and hurling and football are very much summer sports,\u201d Furlong says. \u201cI used to alternate between them. Where I grew up everybody plays GAA. In my primary school class there were only six boys. Every village had their own teams and you\u2019re scavenging for numbers. And playing hurling and football definitely helped my rugby. The space is so big. You definitely get spatial awareness and hurling was so good for my hand-eye coordination. Footwork, too. It\u2019s multidirectional where rugby tends to be more linear.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 26-year-old laughs when I mention <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2n__lsbCs0\">YouTube footage</a> of his nimble footwork \u2013 as a teenage GAA player. \u201cThat embarrassing video rears its head every now and again. But we had a good team with our local club and I won an All-Ireland under-14 with Wexford. My dad played rugby and he was also a prop. But he coached me in GAA. He\u2019s a small-town cowboy in some respects. He\u2019d write down a team on the back of a fag packet and tell me to get stuck in.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17be35627cf4c9861dd5b8328c0e0830d6fccfb4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17be35627cf4c9861dd5b8328c0e0830d6fccfb4/0_0_6316_4136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tadhg Furlong, the Leinster and Lions player, in front of a specially commissioned artwork representing the rivers and land of the province combining together for the greater good at the Leinster training centre at the University College Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tadhg Furlong, the Leinster and Lions player, in front of a specially commissioned artwork representing the rivers and land of the province combining together for the greater good at the Leinster training centre at the University College Dublin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Tadhg Furlong, the Leinster and Lions player, at the Leinster training centre at the University College Dublin, in front of a specially commissioned artwork representing the rivers and land of the province combining together for the greater good.

There was a good club scene in Wexford and the Leinster system means if you\u2019re talented you\u2019ll be picked up. Of course the setup and coaching within the Dublin schools are unbelievable. But there are benefits from experiencing rugby outside the Dublin bubble. When you come into the academy you probably have a little chip on your shoulder. You want to prove yourself to lads who had their names in lights from school rugby. The other parallel is, because I never got exposed to the volume of training and weight sessions at school, you see rapid changes in your body and your skills when you join the academy. You get hungry to improve.\u201d</p> \n<p>Furlong reminds me of Willie John McBride. They are both sons of farmers who came to the game late. McBride achieved prodigious feats, as Furlong is already doing. Yet Furlong, unlike McBride, came into a winning Irish team and he is too professional to echo the Ulsterman when looking ahead to the England game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This Irish team today are used to success and expect to sustain and improve it</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Hugo MacNeill</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When asked for his England prediction, McBride had growled: \u201cWe can beat them again. They talk too much. People say: \u2018Why do you keep hammering on about how you love to beat England?\u2019 Well, there\u2019s a difference between being British and English. I think England talk a lot of rubbish.\u201d</p> \n<p>On a January afternoon of gentle sunshine, Hugo MacNeill, a former Blackrock boy who played for Ireland and the Lions in the 1980s, completes my journey. We stroll through Dublin and MacNeill reminds me that Leinster are the city\u2019s sole professional sports team \u2013 and a resounding success as European champions four times in the past 10 seasons.</p> \n<p>He nods when hearing how Stuart Lancaster, the former England coach who is doing so well at Leinster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/18/stuart-lancaster-interview-ireland-england-leinster-six-nations-rugby-union\">had stressed his surprise to me</a> that so many of his players were born in Dublin, had never played for another club and had no intention of leaving.

It encouraged other players to stay in Dublin. We still have to be vigilant because there are massive salaries in England and France. But our European success helps keep our best players. Dublin is also really vibrant now. When I played for Ireland young people felt they had to leave because there were so few prospects.\u201d</p> \n<p>MacNeill did a postgraduate degree in economics at Oxford between 1982 and 1984 \u2013 while playing for Ireland. He was part of the Irish side, including Ringland and McLoughlin, which won the Triple Crown in 1982. \u201cThe country was low in confidence,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy Oxford thesis was on job-sharing during terrible unemployment: 20% were unemployed. When we won the Triple Crown in 1982 this was before Ray Houghton [who scored the goal that beat England 1-0 at Euro 88], before U2, before Riverdance. Ireland was on its knees but our coach Mick Doyle said: \u2018You can be the best in the world.\u2019 We wanted to believe this, but it wasn\u2019t easy. The country, however, bought into the idea and there was an amazing response.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe won another Triple Crown in 1985. The whole county was behind us and you could feel confidence returning. I went to a big business lunch on the Monday, after we won the [1985] championship on the Saturday, and the minister of finance spoke. He said: \u2018After this great weekend, we\u2019re delighted one of the Irish team is here.\u2019 The place erupted. It was lovely. But we did not build secure foundations. We got the wooden spoon in 1986, and thoroughly deserved it. We got carried away because we weren\u2019t used to success. This Irish team today are used to success and expect to sustain and improve it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0099faf71a4acbbe6c929a6d150de2c83100bc47\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0099faf71a4acbbe6c929a6d150de2c83100bc47/0_0_6656_4416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo MacNeill, the former Ireland and Lions player, on the pitch at Trinity College, his old college, and where Dublin University Rugby Club, the oldest rugby club in the world to have played continuously, play some of their games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugo MacNeill, the former Ireland and Lions player, on the pitch at Trinity College, his old college, and where Dublin University Rugby Club, the oldest rugby club in the world to have played continuously, play some of their games.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Hugo McNeill, the former Ireland and Lions player, on the pitch at Trinity College, his old college, and where Dublin University Rugby Club, the oldest club in the world to have played continuously, have games.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>MacNeill is most interested in Irish rugby\u2019s enduring capacity to produce hope and unity. He remains close to Ringland. The Dubliner and the Ulsterman did commendable work in 1996 when, after an IRA bomb caused devastation in London\u2019s Docklands, they <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/attacking-barbarians-a-unifying-force-1.50509\">organised the Peace Game</a> between Ireland and the Barbarians \u2013 to show that the Irish wanted peace and unity above all else.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrevor and I always spoke to each other during the Troubles. We talked and talked, and still do to this day. We wanted to learn about each other\u2019s lives. We also believed the genius of rugby was that when Ireland went independent they kept things together. We are Ireland as one, north and south, in rugby. It\u2019s not like football with the Republic of Ireland. It\u2019s more than that. In some of Seamus Heaney\u2019s best poems he talks about the neighbourly, casual slaughter of the Troubles. But rugby gave us a peaceful route. You respected and welcomed differences. Irish rugby always got this right. It still does today.\u201d</p> \n<p>I have savoured Leinster\u2019s meticulous planning, Munster\u2019s gritty passion and Ulster\u2019s layered identity and capacity for rugby leadership. A new Irish team are now the best in the country\u2019s<strong> </strong>history and MacNeill\u2019s belief in them, and rugby, is resonant.</p> \n<p>\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get through this Brexit mess, and come out the other side,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are incredibly dangerous and sensitive times. We need peace and reconciliation. Irish rugby has always given us reconciliation with a generosity of spirit and mutual respect for our differences. It now also gives us a rugby team which might do something wonderful in the Six Nations and the World Cup. Irish rugby is leading the way \u2013 more than ever.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8ea0c4cb53af5e504a650d9591208b6fd6301c5b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea0c4cb53af5e504a650d9591208b6fd6301c5b/25_17_3962_2378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ireland celebrate as captain Rory Best holds the Six Nations trophy and Jonnie Sexton clutches the Triple Crown shield after their victory over England gave them the Grand Slam in March 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland celebrate as captain Rory Best holds the Six Nations trophy and Jonnie Sexton clutches the Triple Crown shield after their victory over England gave them the Grand Slam in March 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Ireland celebrate as captain Rory Best holds the Six Nations trophy and Jonnie Sexton clutches the Triple Crown shield after their victory over England gave them the Grand Slam in March 2018.</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t happen today,\u201d Willie John McBride says on a rainy morning at home in Ballyclare as he explains the vast differences between the gleaming powerhouse of Irish rugby today and a ramshackle sport which he only began playing at the age of 17. Four years later, in 1962, as McBride remembers, \u201cI was in the Lions Test team. Remarkably, I survived.\u201d McBride not only survived. At 78 he remains the godfather of Irish rugby and a lock forward who won 63 caps for Ireland and played a record 17 Lions Tests. He also provides a perfect starting point for a journey through Irish rugby as McBride\u2019s story shows how much Ireland and the game have changed. Despite past sectarian conflicts and multiple identities, there is a new cohesion among the four rugby provinces and the national team. \u201cYou feel that unity and its importance even more now,\u201d McBride says. \u201cThis Ireland team are unifying the country in the north and south.\u201d After winning the Grand Slam last year and having beaten New Zealand twice in three matches, Ireland are many people\u2019s favourites for the World Cup. Coached by Joe Schmidt, they feature the world player of the year in Johnny Sexton and outstanding teammates including Ulster\u2019s Jacob Stockdale, Munster\u2019s Conor Murray and Leinster\u2019s Tadhg Furlong. Ireland will face England at home with serene confidence in their opening Six Nations game on Saturday 2 February. The contrast with McBride\u2019s debut against England, in February 1962, is stark. His first cap came in the midst of an 11-match winless slump stretching from February 1961 to March 1963. \u201cWe ran out with nine new caps at Twickenham and were beaten 16-0 \u2013 which was a hiding because a try was only three points.\u201d Willie John McBride, the former Ireland and Lions rugby union captain and below is one of his old Irish rugby jerseys. In his third match for Ireland, against France, McBride played the last 30 minutes with a broken leg. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI remember removing my boot and two guys ran on with a sponge and water. They rubbed it and said: \u2018You\u2019re all right.\u2019 You didn\u2019t come off in those days unless you were dead. Afterwards I was taken to hospital and had plaster of Paris in Paris \u2013 up to the knee.\u201d McBride hopped back from Paris on his own \u2013 catching a plane, train and two buses before hobbling up the hill to his flat. \u201cIt was not the kind of care they\u2019re given today.\u201d Beyond medical support, money and attention to every detail of their rugby lives, McBride argues that the current internationals are luckiest in one particular regard. \u201cI believe we have the best coach in the world, by a long way,\u201d he says of Schmidt. \u201cI know him quite well and he\u2019s a guy for whom I\u2019d give everything. There is talk about the World Cup but Ireland don\u2019t get carried away. We beat the All Blacks and move on. That\u2019s Joe\u2019s character and in the last 15 minutes against New Zealand he brought on players who were just as good as those they replaced. Murray is a super player. Young Stockdale is another. I like Iain Henderson at lock. Ireland have few weaknesses.\u201d This is high praise from McBride who spends longer lamenting the ills of the modern game. He feels the ethos and camaraderie of rugby have been lost and he mourns the slow death of club rugby. Where clubs were once the lifeblood, the provinces of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht now dominate. Their best players are contracted to the Irish union \u2013 which means their focus is on European and Test rugby. Unlike their exhausted counterparts in the English Premiership, the cream of Irish rugby often miss mundane Pro14 games. McBride sighs. \u201cSomebody said to me: \u2018This game is about five different things. Money, money, money, money and money.\u2019 Professional rugby sucks all the good players out of the club scene. They have destroyed this part of rugby.\u201d Everyone else among the dozen people I interview accepts that, to compete with England\u2019s massive player pool and financial power, Ireland needed a structure that would allow the national team and the provinces to thrive. Leinster are European champions and Munster and Ulster offer key players to Ireland. All three Irish provinces qualified for the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup last weekend. In contrast, only one English club, Saracens, reached the knockout stages. Rory Best, Ireland\u2019s captain, just like McBride, is a Protestant from Ulster. Yet even amid these fraught days of Brexit, seething with talk of Irish backstops and hard borders, Best does not face the pressures McBride endured during the Troubles. \u201cYou always got the cracks against you,\u201d McBride recalls. \u201cThat bloody Ulsterman. Why is he captain of Ireland? Up here they\u2019d say: \u2018Why are you captaining that crowd?\u2019 I was pretty headstrong so I ignored it.\u201d Even when his life was threatened and an armed guard had to stand all night outside his hotel room door before some Five Nations games, McBride shrugged off the dangers. He witnessed terrifying scenes \u2013 especially on Bloody Friday in Belfast. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know where to run from so many bombs. Boom, boom, boom everywhere. But it never stopped us playing. Rugby gave us sanity and unity beyond the madness.\u201d Trevor Ringland\u2019s office in Belfast is a half-hour drive from Ballyclare. The 59-year-old solicitor, who played 31 times for Ireland and won four Lions caps in the 1980s, is an eloquent advocate for this current Ireland team and, more importantly, the force for good that rugby exerts in the south and, particularly, Northern Ireland. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says of the game\u2019s capacity to forge together people from bitterly divided communities. \u201cRugby shows the way to build relationships on this island. My frustration is that, politically, we\u2019ve chosen methods of alienation, exclusion, hatred and violence. Rugby has always been relaxed about identities. It has an Irishness comfortable with a British aspect to it. And a Britishness comfortable with an Irish part of its identity. The politicians and extremists couldn\u2019t have done it much worse but rugby has shown another way.\u201d Trevor Ringland, the former Ireland and Lions player, in front of the famous cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Ringland is a Protestant who worked briefly as a politician before the parochialism became too much for him, and yet this is just one aspect of his identity. \u201cI\u2019m a Belfast man and an Ulsterman. I\u2019m British and I\u2019m Irish. I\u2019m Northern Irish and I\u2019m European. I\u2019m a long-suffering Leeds United supporter [Ringland laughs]. These identities are interchangeable and anyone who demeans any one part demeans me as a person. A multilayered identity challenges the extremists.\u201d Ringland withdrew from politics when a unionist party leader refused to accept his invitation to attend a GAA final if a team from the North made it to Croke Park in Dublin. The unionist believed Croke Park symbolised Republican territory. In turn, many supporters of Gaelic football and hurling regard rugby as a Protestant sport. Few Catholic schools in Ulster play rugby but Ringland wants to break down the barriers \u2013 as Irish rugby did when the national team played at Croke Park from 2007 to 2010. The GAA relented on a rule prohibiting the playing of \u201cforeign\u201d sports at Croke Park and allowed Ireland to use its spiritual home. When England arrived at Croke Park in 2007, there was a danger history would swamp the occasion. Fourteen people were killed in and around Croke Park on 21 November 1920, when British soldiers opened fire on the crowd at the GAA headquarters, on a day of terrible violence during the Irish War of Independence. But rugby and Croke Park found harmony in a different century. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d Ringland says, \u201cand the first time I sang all three anthems \u2013 the Irish anthem, Ireland\u2019s Call and even God Save The Queen. All were received with impeccable respect. It was incredibly emotional and showed us moving towards a maturing society where we respect the different traditions across the island. We could then support Ireland beating England [43-13].\u201d In the check-in hall of Shannon Airport stands a bronze sculpture called The Day That Changed Ireland, by Paddy Campbell, depicting Paul O\u2019Connoll winning a lineout during the historic February 2007 Ireland v England Six Nations match at Croke Park, Dublin. Ringland is so passionate because, as the son of a policeman, he played for Ireland during the Troubles in a team of Catholics and Protestants. Some of his teammates were wounded in bomb attacks and yet none of them shut their hearts to each other. They belonged to a team which transcended bigotry and strife. \u201cRugby wants everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIt challenges the extremists who like to box people into \u2018them and us\u2019. Our concept is \u2018We\u2019. Rugby is a direct challenge to the ideologies of hatred and it delivered during the most difficult times. There was murder and mayhem but rugby shone a light on how we do things differently. \u201cIt\u2019s the same today. Rugby is inspiring and unifying when society is fractured again over Brexit and old hatreds. The Titanic is a good analogy for Northern Ireland, and Ireland. It was a great ship, well built, and the reason it sank was bad leadership. The reason we do badly as a society is through bad leadership. The people are great and you feel that so obviously in rugby.\u201d At a European Champions Cup game between Ulster and Racing on a sunlit Saturday in mid-January the atmosphere is electric. Men, women and children are united in vibrant support as Ulster help secure their eventual place in the quarter-finals by beating the powerful French club. Alongside a beaming Stockdale, blood streams down Best\u2019s face while the noise reverberates. No English ground can match this setting for European rugby. An Ulster fan walks past a mural outside the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast; a packed house for Ulster Rugby\u2019s European Champions Cup game against Racing 92; a young fan waves the flag of Northern Ireland; a bloodied Rory Best, the Ireland and Ulster captain; Jacob Stockdale (centre) on a lap of honour with his teammates after Ulster\u2019s 26-22 victory in which he scored two tries. Ringland compares Stockdale, who scored two tries, to another lethal finisher in Gerd M\u00fcller, the German footballer of the 1970s. I have already interviewed Stockdale and Iain Henderson and they are entertaining and intelligent players who represent a different kind of Ulster to a province once beset by violence and prejudice. Whether talking about his father\u2019s work as a prison chaplain or telling me \u201cJohnny Cash is my idol\u201d, Stockdale is exuberant. He also stresses the Irish squad\u2019s harmony. \u201cFrom day one,\u201d the 22-year-old wing says, \u201cI felt only friendship from the guys from every province. Our different backgrounds are joked about. That\u2019s brilliant. You\u2019ve got a Protestant from Ulster captaining Ireland. Rory is the most successful Ireland captain ever.\u201d Henderson underlines the new unity. He went to one of the few mixed schools, of Catholics and Protestants, in north Belfast. Henderson is Protestant and his wife, who went to the same school, is Catholic. \u201cYou notice a massive crossover in rugby now,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter we beat New Zealand in November I felt the impact. I filled my car with petrol in Belfast and three people said: \u2018Great game at the weekend.\u2019 Before, when you went down to Dublin, it was like you\u2019d flown to the other side of the world. Now when you come back to Belfast you feel everyone\u2019s invested into the huge potential of Ireland in a World Cup year.\u201d Ringland agrees: \u201cThis is the best Irish squad we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a glorious period for Irish rugby.\u201d \u2018The old pride surged again\u2019 I like talking about glory in Limerick with Gerry McLoughlin, the great old prop who played for Munster, Ireland and the Lions. McLoughlin was in the famous Munster team which became the first Irish side to beat New Zealand in 1978. At a time when Munster men believed they had to be twice as good as Leinster players to be picked for Ireland, McLoughlin scored a famous try at Twickenham as Ireland won the Triple Crown in 1982. McLoughlin grimaces when he says the try becomes more outlandish every year as people insist he carried most of the England pack on his back while bulldozing over. In Jerry Flannery\u2019s bar, McLoughlin is more interested in talking about rugby now. \u201cYoung Joey Carbery is some player,\u201d he says of the gifted No 10 who helped Munster to reach the European knockout stages yet again. \u201cNow there\u2019s progress in Irish rugby.\u201d Munster fans watch the Leicester versus Ulster match on a TV in the Shannon RFC clubhouse. Adorning the walls is a picture of famous Munster and Shannon player Gerrry \u2018Ginger\u2019 McLaughlin and the shields won by the club for winning the All-Ireland League. McLoughlin points to Carberry\u2019s arrival as further proof that Irish rugby has entered a new era. Carbery was a Sexton understudy at Leinster. The 22-year-old\u2019s talent was obvious but Sexton couldn\u2019t be shifted; and so Schmidt and the IRFU were not unhappy Carbery moved to Limerick this season. Munster yearned for his creativity and Ireland needed Carberry playing at fly-half in the furnace of European competition \u2013 just in case Sexton sustained injury. Leinster agreed to a loan which may became permanent because their depth is such that Ross Byrne, in Sexton\u2019s absence, could steer them to a convincing win against Toulouse this month. \u201cIt\u2019s not like my day,\u201d McLoughlin says wryly, \u201cbut we love having Carbery at Munster.\u201d McLoughlin, the mayor of Limerick in 2012, stresses how much Munster\u2019s rugby players have lifted the city. \u201cLimerick had a terrible reputation with drugs. But once Munster became a European force the old pride surged again. That\u2019s rugby\u2019s power.\u201d Fans make their way to Thomond Park for the European Champions Cup match between Munster and Exeter; Conor Murray (left) and Chris Farrell lead a group of Munster players as they do a half-lap of the pitch to finish their warmup; the Munster Rugby Supporters Club choir sing their traditional song \u201cStand Up And Fight\u201d just before the teams come out. Niall O\u2019Donovan, who enjoyed having McLoughlin as his economics schoolteacher, straddles the divide between the amateur and professional eras. The current Munster manager played for Shannon, in the same pack as McLoughlin, and also coached that great old club for five seasons. In 1997, while still coaching Shannon, O\u2019Donovan joined Declan Kidney as they took charge of a newly professional Munster. Until then, Munster only played three or four games a year while the clubs dominated every week. The crowd watch a scrum during Munster\u2019s European Champions Cup match against Exeter at Thomond Park; Munster fans celebrate during the match; Niall O\u2019Donovan, the Munster team manager; Joey Carbery (centre) is congratulated by Rory Scannell (left) and Alby Mathewson (right) after his kick won the match for Munster 9-7. O\u2019Donovan knew Irish rugby had to change. \u201cIt\u2019s sad but the club game had to give way. The IRFU got it right and put more money into the four provinces. I remember it changing. We played Saracens in the Heineken Cup in 1999 and took 10 fans with two flags. Then we went to the semi-final against Toulouse in Bordeaux in 2000. The streets had turned Munster red. The place was jammed, the bars were crammed. We outnumbered Toulouse in France. We got to the final at Twickenham and the ground was a sea of red \u2013 with three times as many fans as Northampton. Munster lost that day but we won the Heineken Cup twice on magical days.\u201d O\u2019Donovan then worked as Ireland\u2019s forwards coach from 2002 to 2008. \u201cWe had some great days, some horrible days. Typical Irish. Joe Schmidt has had a huge influence in making Ireland so much more consistent and confident but you have to credit the IRFU for putting in good foundations. All four provinces supply depth to Joe\u2019s squad. So it\u2019s sustainable.\u201d Amid such success, O\u2019Donovan offers a telling reminder. \u201cRugby is still the fourth-choice sport in Ireland. Hurling, Gaelic football and soccer are still the first three in playing numbers in a very small population. So some weeks at Munster we understand we won\u2019t play our best players. We look to get a longer lifespan out of them as there are just four professional teams in Ireland. England have 12. In Ireland we have a player pool of about 110 Irish professionals. We have to make sure they\u2019re kept in good nick. \u201cEvery little Irish village has a Gaelic football pitch, a hurling pitch, a pub and a church. Hurling is embedded into rural Ireland and rugby can\u2019t replace that. Limerick is probably the only place where rugby is the main sport. We were delighted Limerick won the All-Ireland Hurling final last August [beating Galway at Croke Park in front of 82,000 fans] but rugby is in every corner of the city. Everybody here follows rugby. You won\u2019t find that anywhere else in Ireland.\u201d O\u2019Donovan still supports his old club and last month he watched Shannon play Garryowen. \u201cThere was a reasonable crowd of 400 but it\u2019s hard on the clubs now. Munster can\u2019t afford to let the clubs die. In Leinster many players come through Dublin\u2019s private schools whereas here the clubs have always been the backbone.\u201d Keith Wood, the former Ireland captain who was world rugby\u2019s player of the year in 2001, comes from Killaloe in County Clare, half an hour away, but we meet at his old school in Limerick. St Munchin\u2019s was founded in 1796 and it has a great rugby heritage with five former pupils, including Wood and Conor Murray, having played for the Lions. Wood\u2019s three sons are pupils now and he is proud of the fact that, unlike the Dublin conveyor belt of privately educated rugby talent, St Munchin\u2019s is not a fee-paying school. Few rugby players can match the range of Wood\u2019s interests and he remains a captivating presence. Before he takes me on a tour of the school which ends up with us watching his eldest son, Alexander, and his teammates finish their training session in the gathering darkness, Wood offers a striking analogy \u2013 Irish rugby is like a three-legged stool. The former Ireland and Lions player Keith Wood stands above Lough Derg in the Arra Mountains, County Tipperary, near his home town of Killaloe. \u201cThe provinces, the clubs and the schools hold up the game. The professional provincial leg looks perfect. The schools rugby leg is pretty good. The other leg, the club game, is not great \u2013 because we\u2019re dealing with nascent professionalism. Rugby has only been professional for 20 years. It\u2019s now time to fix the club leg. It\u2019s when things are going well that you need to do your repair work. \u201cThe board have got so many things right \u2013 some by accident, some by incredible planning. They\u2019ve done really well because they have protected the players. Johnny Sexton played 22 matches last year. I played 42 matches some years. We also have Joe Schmidt. I\u2019m not saying Joe is the best coach in the world for other teams, but for Ireland he\u2019s ideal.\u201d Wood won 58 caps from 1994 to 2003. \u201cI was captain at a time when we changed the coach nearly every nine months. I had six coaches up until 1998 but we weren\u2019t good enough or fit enough. Until Warren Gatland came in there was no consistency of selection. Gatty changed that and gave us a consistent way of playing. We became incredibly hard to beat. There was a big improvement and then Eddie O\u2019Sullivan brought us to a higher level and we won some Triple Crowns [for beating England, Scotland and Wales]. There was a sense something else was coming.\u201d That \u201csomething else\u201d meant that Ireland, under Schmidt, were transformed. \u201cI really like watching Ireland play now,\u201d Wood says. \u201cSometimes they grind out things which aren\u2019t great, and I like them for that too. I love going to a game thinking: \u2018We\u2019re going to win but I want to see how we win it.\u2019 I was convinced the week before that Ireland would beat New Zealand in November. As the week went on, I started thinking: \u2018Jesus, I\u2019m putting the kibosh on it.\u2019 And then the game starts and, after 10 minutes, I said: \u2018We\u2019re going to win this. You can see it, you can sense it. They\u2019re so in synch.\u2019 Of course we won. That\u2019s why Irish rugby, right now, is such fun.\u201d Shannon RFC U20s surge forward as they take on Young Munster U20s in a local Limerick derby match, played at Tom Clifford Park, Greenfields. Wood considers a 22-year-old Leinster lock who has just 12 caps for Ireland. \u201cJames Ryan looks a born professional rugby player. My God, he\u2019s lost two games in his life. Three losses, tops, in two years. He lost one game for Ireland on tour. And a game against Toulouse. He might have lost one other. These are All Black-style stats. Ryan looks mature, capable, strong, robust, a really good player with an extraordinary thirst for work. He doesn\u2019t make many mistakes.\u201d Ryan is a product of St Michael\u2019s which has become one of the dominant schools in Dublin. Wood says: \u201cThere are 1.5 million people in Dublin \u2013 which is a conduit to excellence because so many are willing to pay to get their kids to certain schools. So in Leinster huge numbers are coming through the system. In Munster we would like more players coming through the schools. But there are demographic issues and more poverty in Limerick. I think there are 22 premier schools in Ireland and St Munchin\u2019s is the only one that doesn\u2019t pay its coaches. But they have produced 18 Irish internationals and five Lions. They buck the trend.\u201d Cohesion and identity I first met Justin Vanstone at Saracens\u2019 training ground in Hertfordshire. Vanstone and four of his fellow Blackrock College rugby coaches spent a day shadowing their Saracens counterparts, including Mark McCall, the director of rugby. It was a sign of the Dublin school\u2019s sheer professionalism. Vanstone is English but he has lived in Dublin for 16 years. He is a perceptive teacher and, when we meet at Blackrock a month later, Vanstone is also a passionate guide around a rugby institution. We begin by walking down a corridor lined with photographs from school teams over the years which have produced so many internationals from Fergus Slattery, Hugo MacNeill and Leo Cullen to Brian O\u2019Driscoll, Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery. The current system appears more striking as Vanstone charts the dedication of his schoolboys. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be uncommon for a boy to be in at 7am for something rugby-based before school. There will be training after school and the boys do night study from 6pm to 9pm. It\u2019s a long day but they wouldn\u2019t be in before seven every morning because we try to get a balance.\u201d Vanstone stresses that his first-team drives standards. \u201cThe boys expect to have the video of our Saturday morning game that evening or early Sunday morning. We create clips they\u2019ll go over before we assess it as a group on Monday. Expectations are high and we don\u2019t want the coaches doing all the analysis. If it\u2019s one-way traffic how can you expect boys to make decisions? Of course early in the season it is coach-led. But we like to step back and hear the boys\u2019 voices.\u201d Justin Vanstone, head coach for Blackrock College school rugby team, prepares for his Monday video analysis session; the main pitch, known as the \u2018Front Lawn\u2019 which is played on for a maximum of four matches per year; the corridor at Blackrock College that shows all the old first-team photos including one of the \u2018Dream Team\u2019 that won the Schools Cup in 1996 which had five players who became full Irish internationals including Leo Cullen and Brian O\u2019Driscoll. Video analysis includes studying the opposition. Vanstone explains that the top schools share their footage. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those unwritten rules that, during the friendly season, you do not attend an opponent\u2019s game. But it\u2019s fair game to access videos before the Leinster Schools Cup campaign. To avoid espionage, Leinster video these games and set up a database for us to study each other. It works for Leinster because they get video footage of the best schoolboys. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d Vanstone nods when I say it sounds very serious. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree that it\u2019s become very professional with a small \u2018p\u2019. But it\u2019s down to the coaches to ensure that the unity, camaraderie and old-fashioned enjoyment of sport remains.\u201d Tadgh Furlong offers compelling evidence that Leinster are not just dependent on the outstanding private schools found within a six-mile radius of each other in Dublin. Furlong comes from a farming family in the small parish of Horeswood, County Wexford, a two-and-half-hour journey from where we sit at Leinster\u2019s training headquarters at University College Dublin. The prop is warm and welcoming and full of great stories about growing up in Wexford where he played hurling and Gaelic football as well as rugby. Furlong burst to prominence in the autumn of 2016 when he made his first Test start and, that November, he played in Ireland\u2019s historic victory over New Zealand in Chicago. He has since played for the Lions, in the drawn 2017 series against the All Blacks, and established himself as arguably the best prop in world rugby. One measure of Furlong\u2019s stature is that he has played New Zealand in six Tests and lost only two. \u201cRugby is a winter sport and hurling and football are very much summer sports,\u201d Furlong says. \u201cI used to alternate between them. Where I grew up everybody plays GAA. In my primary school class there were only six boys. Every village had their own teams and you\u2019re scavenging for numbers. And playing hurling and football definitely helped my rugby. The space is so big. You definitely get spatial awareness and hurling was so good for my hand-eye coordination. Footwork, too. It\u2019s multidirectional where rugby tends to be more linear.\u201d The 26-year-old laughs when I mention YouTube footage of his nimble footwork \u2013 as a teenage GAA player. \u201cThat embarrassing video rears its head every now and again. But we had a good team with our local club and I won an All-Ireland under-14 with Wexford. My dad played rugby and he was also a prop. But he coached me in GAA. He\u2019s a small-town cowboy in some respects. He\u2019d write down a team on the back of a fag packet and tell me to get stuck in.\u201d Tadhg Furlong, the Leinster and Lions player, at the Leinster training centre at the University College Dublin, in front of a specially commissioned artwork representing the rivers and land of the province combining together for the greater good. Below, Furlong is congratulated by friends and family after Ireland\u2019s 2018 victory over England which game them the Grand Slam. It sounds a small miracle Furlong was spotted by Leinster and enticed to their academy in 2013. \u201cNot really. There was a good club scene in Wexford and the Leinster system means if you\u2019re talented you\u2019ll be picked up. Of course the setup and coaching within the Dublin schools are unbelievable. But there are benefits from experiencing rugby outside the Dublin bubble. When you come into the academy you probably have a little chip on your shoulder. You want to prove yourself to lads who had their names in lights from school rugby. The other parallel is, because I never got exposed to the volume of training and weight sessions at school, you see rapid changes in your body and your skills when you join the academy. You get hungry to improve.\u201d Furlong reminds me of Willie John McBride. They are both sons of farmers who came to the game late. McBride achieved prodigious feats, as Furlong is already doing. Yet Furlong, unlike McBride, came into a winning Irish team and he is too professional to echo the Ulsterman when looking ahead to the England game. When asked for his England prediction, McBride had growled: \u201cWe can beat them again. They talk too much. People say: \u2018Why do you keep hammering on about how you love to beat England?\u2019 Well, there\u2019s a difference between being British and English. I think England talk a lot of rubbish.\u201d On a January afternoon of gentle sunshine, Hugo MacNeill, a former Blackrock boy who played for Ireland and the Lions in the 1980s, completes my journey. We stroll through Dublin and MacNeill reminds me that Leinster are the city\u2019s sole professional sports team \u2013 and a resounding success as European champions four times in the past 10 seasons. He nods when hearing how Stuart Lancaster, the former England coach who is doing so well at Leinster, had stressed his surprise to me that so many of his players were born in Dublin, had never played for another club and had no intention of leaving. Lancaster admired their cohesion and identity. Stuart Lancaster, the former England rugby head coach and now senior coach at Leinster, and the club\u2019s motto on display in the atrium at their training centre at the University College, Dublin. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky Johnny Sexton\u2019s experience in French club rugby [with Racing 92 from 2013 to 2015] was seen as negative,\u201d MacNeill says. \u201cIt was a key moment when Sexton came home. It encouraged other players to stay in Dublin. We still have to be vigilant because there are massive salaries in England and France. But our European success helps keep our best players. Dublin is also really vibrant now. When I played for Ireland young people felt they had to leave because there were so few prospects.\u201d MacNeill did a postgraduate degree in economics at Oxford between 1982 and 1984 \u2013 while playing for Ireland. He was part of the Irish side, including Ringland and McLoughlin, which won the Triple Crown in 1982. \u201cThe country was low in confidence,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy Oxford thesis was on job-sharing during terrible unemployment: 20% were unemployed. When we won the Triple Crown in 1982 this was before Ray Houghton [who scored the goal that beat England 1-0 at Euro 88], before U2, before Riverdance. Ireland was on its knees but our coach Mick Doyle said: \u2018You can be the best in the world.\u2019 We wanted to believe this, but it wasn\u2019t easy. The country, however, bought into the idea and there was an amazing response. \u201cWe won another Triple Crown in 1985. The whole county was behind us and you could feel confidence returning. I went to a big business lunch on the Monday, after we won the [1985] championship on the Saturday, and the minister of finance spoke. He said: \u2018After this great weekend, we\u2019re delighted one of the Irish team is here.\u2019 The place erupted. It was lovely. But we did not build secure foundations. We got the wooden spoon in 1986, and thoroughly deserved it. We got carried away because we weren\u2019t used to success. This Irish team today are used to success and expect to sustain and improve it.\u201d Hugo McNeill, the former Ireland and Lions player, on the pitch at Trinity College, his old college, and where Dublin University Rugby Club, the oldest club in the world to have played continuously, have games. MacNeill is most interested in Irish rugby\u2019s enduring capacity to produce hope and unity. He remains close to Ringland. The Dubliner and the Ulsterman did commendable work in 1996 when, after an IRA bomb caused devastation in London\u2019s Docklands, they organised the Peace Game between Ireland and the Barbarians \u2013 to show that the Irish wanted peace and unity above all else. \u201cTrevor and I always spoke to each other during the Troubles. We talked and talked, and still do to this day. We wanted to learn about each other\u2019s lives. We also believed the genius of rugby was that when Ireland went independent they kept things together. We are Ireland as one, north and south, in rugby. It\u2019s not like football with the Republic of Ireland. It\u2019s more than that. In some of Seamus Heaney\u2019s best poems he talks about the neighbourly, casual slaughter of the Troubles. But rugby gave us a peaceful route. You respected and welcomed differences. Irish rugby always got this right. It still does today.\u201d I have savoured Leinster\u2019s meticulous planning, Munster\u2019s gritty passion and Ulster\u2019s layered identity and capacity for rugby leadership. A new Irish team are now the best in the country\u2019s history and MacNeill\u2019s belief in them, and rugby, is resonant. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get through this Brexit mess, and come out the other side,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are incredibly dangerous and sensitive times. We need peace and reconciliation. Irish rugby has always given us reconciliation with a generosity of spirit and mutual respect for our differences. It now also gives us a rugby team which might do something wonderful in the Six Nations and the World Cup. Irish rugby is leading the way \u2013 more than ever.\u201d Ireland celebrate as captain Rory Best holds the Six Nations trophy and Jonnie Sexton clutches the Triple Crown shield after their victory over England gave them the Grand Slam in March 2018.",

He also has links to the Bourbon-Anjou and Orl\u00e9ans royal families and several other European dynasties. The current Napol\u00e9on, who works as a banker in London, tries to keep out of the fray. Louis de Bourbon, 44, who styles himself \u201chead of the Bourbon household\u201d, was brought up partly in Spain and is subject to mockery from French royalists for his accent. Meanwhile, Jean d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, 53, has shown himself to be a man of the people with support for the gilets jaunes protesters. Of course, France is a republic and, as such, does not recognise those who claim to be French royalty, but for the would-be King Jean of Orl\u00e9ans \u2013 whose motto is \u201cto serve France and the French\u201d \u2013 hope springs eternal. \u201cI think France is monarchist at heart, and republican through reason,\u201d he said in a recent interview. The funeral of Henri d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans will be held on 2 February at the royal chapel at St-Louis de Dreux, the burial place of the Orl\u00e9ans family.",

Rowntree observed how her parents, who are \u201ckeen recreational cyclists\u201d in their mid-70s and live next door to her in Ludlow, began to have difficulties using their existing bikes.</p> <p>While their fitness remained good, their muscular strength had declined, she says, making low bike weight and a big range of gears important: \u201cFor the last few years, whenever I\u2019ve changed a part on my mother\u2019s bike, every time she\u2019ll ask me: \u2018Is it heavier than the bit you\u2019ve taken off?\u2019 It never was, but that was her concern.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same with gears \u2013 if you give them a low enough bottom gear they\u2019ll winch their way up just about anything, but they don\u2019t have the muscular strength to heave it up. All this isn\u2019t rocket science, but it makes so much difference.\u201d</p> <p>The three-bike range is primarily aimed at people who already enjoy cycling, and thus have price tags that might startle novices or dabblers. The cheapest, an everyday bike called the Joni \u2013 they all have baby boomer-referencing names \u2013 is \u00a3800, while the lighter and more sophisticated Janis, for road riding, and Jimi, a mountain bike, cost \u00a31,200.</p> <p>Many older cyclists use e-bikes, which provide pedalling assistance from a small electric motor. Rowntree says her range is intended for \u201cpeople who want to ride under their own steam for as long as possible, and then might switch to an e-bike when they need to\u201d.</p> <p>For all the similarities in redesigning bikes for children and older people, there is one clear divergence: unlike young riders, adults generally have to brave the roads rather than happily pedalling through traffic-free parks or on pavements.</p> <p>Rowntree accepts that this is an issue for many who would like to cycle: \u201cI\u2019d love to get to a time when I\u2019m at a social event and when people find out I ride a bike that they don\u2019t reply: \u2018You\u2019re brave.\u2019 That happens to me all the time. Regardless of the statistics, if people don\u2019t feel safe then they won\u2019t ride.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c314648b253081864d7a24f52b474a53143468a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c314648b253081864d7a24f52b474a53143468a7/0_171_3648_4560/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Adams, 76, examines the Islabikes Joni.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Adams road-testing the Islabike Joni: \u2018I\u2019m pleased to see the complete absence of a crossbar.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shelly Morris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Testing it out</h2> <p>Faced by the Islabike Joni, Jeremy Adams, 76, is immediately struck \u2013 and impressed \u2013 by one aspect of the bike aimed at older riders.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see the complete absence of a crossbar,\u201d he says, examining the low, step-through frame. \u201cApart from an artificial knee I also have a bit of arthritis on the hip, so raising my leg a full balletic lift would have been possible but definitely uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>While the bike is primarily aimed at older people who still ride, the retired museum curator from Lewes in East Sussex is a potentially tougher proposition to impress, confessing he last spent much time in the saddle about 20 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/15/over-65s-join-parkruns\">\u2018If you can run, you can do anything\u2019: why over 65s are at park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But after some time poking, prodding and then lifting up the machine \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s surprising light\u201d \u2013 Adams sets off for a tryout and returns impressed, even with \u201ca few hundred yards of fairly cautious riding\u201d to get used to the responsive disc brakes, a type he had not used before.</p> <p>\u201cIt was great fun \u2013 I can\u2019t remember enjoying a bicycle so much,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIf I was to have a long-term relationship with the bike I would make a couple of little adjustments. I\u2019d probably have a more cushioned seat, and raise the handlebars a little bit, but these are minor things.\u201d</p> <p>Even the \u00a3800 price tag is not as much of a shock as it might have been: \u201cMy son-in-law leaves these cycling magazines lying around with bikes in it that cost \u00a35,000, so this doesn\u2019t seem too bad by comparison.\u201d</p>",

A vehement advocate for better everyday cycling infrastructure, Rowntree is also a passionate environmentalist. One company project involves trying to make zero-waste children\u2019s bikes that are rented rather than bought, and returned to the firm for refurbishment once the rider has outgrown the model. Islabikes came about after friends and relatives asked their resident cycling expert \u2013 Rowntree is a former UK cyclocross champion \u2013 for advice on bikes for young children, and she found most of them were cumbersome, weighty and poorly designed. The new range had a similar genesis. Rowntree observed how her parents, who are \u201ckeen recreational cyclists\u201d in their mid-70s and live next door to her in Ludlow, began to have difficulties using their existing bikes. While their fitness remained good, their muscular strength had declined, she says, making low bike weight and a big range of gears important: \u201cFor the last few years, whenever I\u2019ve changed a part on my mother\u2019s bike, every time she\u2019ll ask me: \u2018Is it heavier than the bit you\u2019ve taken off?\u2019 It never was, but that was her concern. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with gears \u2013 if you give them a low enough bottom gear they\u2019ll winch their way up just about anything, but they don\u2019t have the muscular strength to heave it up. All this isn\u2019t rocket science, but it makes so much difference.\u201d The three-bike range is primarily aimed at people who already enjoy cycling, and thus have price tags that might startle novices or dabblers. The cheapest, an everyday bike called the Joni \u2013 they all have baby boomer-referencing names \u2013 is \u00a3800, while the lighter and more sophisticated Janis, for road riding, and Jimi, a mountain bike, cost \u00a31,200. Many older cyclists use e-bikes, which provide pedalling assistance from a small electric motor. Rowntree says her range is intended for \u201cpeople who want to ride under their own steam for as long as possible, and then might switch to an e-bike when they need to\u201d. For all the similarities in redesigning bikes for children and older people, there is one clear divergence: unlike young riders, adults generally have to brave the roads rather than happily pedalling through traffic-free parks or on pavements. Rowntree accepts that this is an issue for many who would like to cycle: \u201cI\u2019d love to get to a time when I\u2019m at a social event and when people find out I ride a bike that they don\u2019t reply: \u2018You\u2019re brave.\u2019 That happens to me all the time. Regardless of the statistics, if people don\u2019t feel safe then they won\u2019t ride.\u201d Testing it out Faced by the Islabike Joni, Jeremy Adams, 76, is immediately struck \u2013 and impressed \u2013 by one aspect of the bike aimed at older riders. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see the complete absence of a crossbar,\u201d he says, examining the low, step-through frame. \u201cApart from an artificial knee I also have a bit of arthritis on the hip, so raising my leg a full balletic lift would have been possible but definitely uncomfortable.\u201d While the bike is primarily aimed at older people who still ride, the retired museum curator from Lewes in East Sussex is a potentially tougher proposition to impress, confessing he last spent much time in the saddle about 20 years ago. But after some time poking, prodding and then lifting up the machine \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s surprising light\u201d \u2013 Adams sets off for a tryout and returns impressed, even with \u201ca few hundred yards of fairly cautious riding\u201d to get used to the responsive disc brakes, a type he had not used before. \u201cIt was great fun \u2013 I can\u2019t remember enjoying a bicycle so much,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIf I was to have a long-term relationship with the bike I would make a couple of little adjustments. I\u2019d probably have a more cushioned seat, and raise the handlebars a little bit, but these are minor things.\u201d Even the \u00a3800 price tag is not as much of a shock as it might have been: \u201cMy son-in-law leaves these cycling magazines lying around with bikes in it that cost \u00a35,000, so this doesn\u2019t seem too bad by comparison.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Church of England\u2019s two most senior leaders have accused the UK\u2019s main political parties of \u201cstifling\u201d reconciliation of social divisions. The direct rebuke to political leaders comes in a special motion on the state of the nation to be considered at the C of E General Synod next month, weeks before the Brexit deadline. The motion, tabled by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, and John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, says \u201csocial divisions feel more entrenched and intractable than for many years\u201d. It expresses concern at \u201cthe divisions within the major political parties which are stifling the emergence of a hopeful and viable vision for the common good in our communities\u201d. Dioceses and parishes should pray regularly for local MPs, members of the government and civil servants, \u201cseeking God\u2019s strength and wisdom for the responsibilities they bear\u201d. The archbishops\u2019 motion says the Christian commitment \u201cto putting the voices of the poor and marginalised at the heart of the nation\u2019s concerns\u201d must be reaffirmed, and the \u201cnation\u2019s leaders must work together for the common good at this time of division\u201d. The wording does not explicitly refer to Brexit, but Welby has increasingly spoken out on his concerns about social and political divisions over the issue. Earlier this month, he said a no-deal Brexit would hit the poorest and most vulnerable people in the UK, and would be \u201cnot only a political and practical failure, but a moral one\u201d. Welby voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, but has since stressed the need for reconciliation and restraint. He told the House of Lords this month: \u201cA second referendum is not my preference, but if parliament fails in the task entrusted to it then regrettably it may be required. This is about more than Brexit, and parliament must not show itself unfit for the job.\u201d A recent opinion poll [paywall] found 44% of Britons thought it was inappropriate for the archbishop to offer political opinions, compared with 35% who said it was appropriate. Sentamu also voted to remain in the EU in 2016, but last month voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal in the House of Lords. A second referendum would result in a \u201cfurther draining away of trust from an already discredited political class [that] would be of very great danger to the future government of Britain\u201d, he wrote in the Yorkshire Post. \u201cPermanent loss of confidence in governmental institutions always results in civil unrest and violence.\u201d C of E officials have cleared almost two hours in the agenda of next month\u2019s assembly of representatives of clergy, bishops and lay members of the church to debate the motion. Divisions in the country over Brexit are reflected within the church, and debate is likely to see a clash of opinions on the way forward. The four-day meeting in London is also scheduled to discuss homelessness, the environment, gambling and discrimination against Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. The synod will also hear a report from a body examining issues around gender, identity and sexuality, including same-sex marriage. The \u201cLiving in Love and Faith\u201d group, led by Christopher Cocksworth, the bishop of Coventry, has been considering the church\u2019s position since June 2017.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>The attrition continues with an early-morning phone call informing me that an old friend from university had died from lung cancer. I met Keir on my first day at Exeter. I had been dropped off at my halls of residence by my parents and was mooching around aimlessly on my own, feeling rather homesick. Keir took me under his wing and we headed off to a pub near St Davids station. After dropping in on a fish and chip shop on the way back, he stopped to roll a joint and by the end of the evening I felt that university wasn\u2019t going to be so bad after all. We went on to become close friends, sharing a tatty house \u2013 more of a commune, really, as there were 10 of us \u2013 and doing the bare minimum of work. After university we lost touch rather \u2013 he went to live and work abroad \u2013 but whenever we did meet up it was as if we\u2019d never been apart. Keir was a one-man entertainment centre, a person of immense charm who could generate fun from almost any situation. I\u2019m told he even turned his deathbed into a party. I miss him much more than I expected. The list of old friends who have died from a variety of causes is growing uncomfortably long. It feels as if there is someone going round turning out the lights of a house I am not ready to leave. In the dimness, my own mortality is becoming unavoidable.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>The BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46843631\">reports</a> there has been a surge in the number of medicines that are in short supply. Pharmacists are experiencing difficulties obtaining more than 80 drugs, and the situation is expected to become more critical as the uncertainty over Brexit increases. Especially with man-boy Matt Hancock in charge of the NHS. Obviously the first thing I did was to check through the list to see if any of the drugs I take on a daily basis for my depression are on it. Sure enough, one was. Which presents me with something of a dilemma. Should I immediately rush off to my shrink for another prescription so that I can create my own private stockpile? Or should I take my chances and wait for my current supplies to run out? Obviously the ethical thing to do is to hope for the best. If everyone were to try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/revealed-uk-patients-stockpile-drugs-in-fear-of-no-deal-brexit\">hoard a six-month stash</a>, supplies would become in even shorter supply and some people would inevitably lose out. On the other hand, I know from first-hand experience that going cold turkey from this one particular drug is extremely unpleasant, as the first time I tried to come off it I had hideous side-effects. Something I am in no hurry to repeat. So I am going to try my hand at stockpiling and sod the rest of the country. Besides, what\u2019s the point of leaving the EU if it\u2019s not every person for themselves? And if I fail then at least I can say I was one of the first people to have been driven genuinely mad by Brexit.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/23/james-dyson-brexiteer-elite-brexit-rees-mogg\">Wealthy Brexiteers like James Dyson are jumping ship.

There was no record of six of the firms on the Companies House register, two people signed the letter twice, three companies had two directors\u2019 signatures, one company\u2019s name was misspelled, one company had no registered employees and several appeared to have filed no accounts. Of the more high-profile names, John Mills, owner of the shopping channel JML Direct, has been found to be in breach of Ofcom rules and the Leave Means Leave founder, Richard Tice, is stuck in an ongoing row with a US private equity firm after losing a contract to manage a \u00a3250m portfolio. Pride of place goes to Edi Truell of the UK Strategic Investment Advisory Board, who offered to pay \u00a3500,000 for a hi-tech system he claims could solve the Northern Ireland border problem, despite the government\u2019s insistence that no such technology existed. Nice people to do business with. Digested week, digested: Spurs avoid a further match at Wembley.",

Pillgwenlly, or Pill as it is more commonly known in this corner of south Wales, is not only where he grew up but also the same tough inner-city area where Tony Pulis, Middlesbrough\u2019s manager, was raised, meaning that Saturday\u2019s fourth-round tie is much more than a meeting between two former Newport players. In Pill, which has a population of just under 8,000, it is Flynn against Pulis. Or, to put it another way, Baldwin Street against Dolphin Street.</p> <p>\u201cI was chuffed to bits when I saw the draw,\u201d says Raymond who, at 54, is seven years younger than Tony. \u201cI thought it was great for both sides, obviously what with the connections. We all played for Pill \u2013 Tony played for Pill YMCA, I played for Pill AFC, along with Michael. So it\u2019s just great for the community.\u201d</p> <p>All three also turned out for Newport at various stages and, so the story goes, Raymond was a more talented footballer than Tony. Raymond, who works as a fork-lift truck driver for a packaging company in Newport docks, looks a little unsure how to respond when that suggestion is put to him and needs a bit of encouragement. \u201cGo on, big yourself up,\u201d Flynn says, smiling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84528f922f3a1f901348acd5d25acb9845b01e41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84528f922f3a1f901348acd5d25acb9845b01e41/0_250_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raymond Pulis, a former Newport player, at the docks where he works there.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raymond Pulis, a former Newport player, at the docks where he works there.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI probably was a better player,\u201d Raymond says. \u201cBut Tony was more dedicated.

That\u2019s when Pill was Pill. Everybody knew everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn nods his head. He was five when Tony left Newport for Bournemouth in 1986 but says the Pulis name was well known to him when he was growing up. \u201cTony\u2019s somebody I\u2019ve always had a lot of time and respect for, because of what he\u2019s done.

      "bodyText": "Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his Russian ally Vladimir Putin are predictably claiming that the swearing-in of Juan Guaid\u00f3 as acting president is a coup organised by Donald Trump. Those of us who want a democratic \u2013 and as peaceful as possible \u2013 end to Maduro\u2019s dictatorship must ignore the anti-American rhetoric and throw our full support behind the president of the country\u2019s national assembly. Guaid\u00f3 must not be allowed to fail. No one within the opposition is better suited to steer Venezuela back towards democracy. Following years of seeing former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez abuse the rules of democracy, an increasing number of Venezuelans has lost faith in politics and the power of the vote. They are understandably angry, and they seem to believe that the only way out is to take the fight to the streets. Guaid\u00f3, who cut his teeth in the 2007 protests against Ch\u00e1vez, has enough credibility to convince this group that a democratic transition is still possible. After his experience leading protests, Guaid\u00f3 got into politics and ran in the 2010 and 2015 elections. Maduro and Putin can scream foul all they want, but article 233 of the constitution states that if there is no president to be sworn in at the beginning of the term, the head of the national assembly will be acting president while elections are organised. This, right here, is the democratic transition the international community had been waiting for. Guaid\u00f3 is 100% working class.

Shipped out to \u201csleepy, leafy Richmond\u201d, he is called to investigate the murder and mutilation of an up-and-coming singer named Brendan Clarke. It\u2019s a journey that will take him to a memorial vigil in a field outside Hastings, a seedy Soho members\u2019 club and a town called Edenville.</p> <p>Murder victim Clarke turns out to have been an avid fan of charismatic glam rock star Lucas Bell, who killed himself a decade earlier but continues to inspire fierce devotion. Clarke was a moneyed collector of Bell memorabilia, some of which has gone missing from the scene. At the last gig before he was murdered, Clarke not only paid tribute to his hero with a set comprised of Bell cover versions, but assumed the mask of Bell\u2019s most famous character: King Lost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Noon has a Ballardian understanding of the intoxicating magic of celebrity and its impact on a text</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a>\u2019s Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane are perhaps inevitable in the fictional King Lost, and Noon has a Ballardian understanding of the intoxicating magic of celebrity, and its impact on a text. He masterfully casts the spell of Bell\u2019s dark glamour with tinctures of Bowie \u2013 his absence rather than his presence \u2013 as well as shades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/10/marc-bolan-t-rex-interview\" title=\"\">Marc Bolan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/29/richey-edwards-manic-street-preachers\" title=\"\">Richey Edwards</a>.</p> <p>Events move quickly, and as Hobbes deciphers a web of occult codes surrounding Clarke\u2019s murder, and a disturbing childhood secret at the heart of Bell\u2019s King Lost persona, Noon ups the stakes until the inspector finds himself facing mortal danger at every turn, including from within the force. DI Hobbes is (of course!) philosophical in response to the human cruelty he witnesses on the job. \u201cMaybe you take after your namesake, Inspector?\u201d someone observes.</p> <p>Noon made his name in the 1990s with sui generis SF novels such as <em>Vurt</em> and <em>Pollen</em> that were distinctively homegrown and dreamlike. <em>Slow Motion Ghosts</em> is his first crime novel, and it\u2019s a belter.

      "bodyText": "In the aftermath of the 1981 Brixton riots, inner city policeman Detective Inspector Henry Hobbes has been ostracised by fellow officers after breaking ranks to stop a colleague carrying out a racist attack. Shipped out to \u201csleepy, leafy Richmond\u201d, he is called to investigate the murder and mutilation of an up-and-coming singer named Brendan Clarke. It\u2019s a journey that will take him to a memorial vigil in a field outside Hastings, a seedy Soho members\u2019 club and a town called Edenville. Murder victim Clarke turns out to have been an avid fan of charismatic glam rock star Lucas Bell, who killed himself a decade earlier but continues to inspire fierce devotion. Clarke was a moneyed collector of Bell memorabilia, some of which has gone missing from the scene. At the last gig before he was murdered, Clarke not only paid tribute to his hero with a set comprised of Bell cover versions, but assumed the mask of Bell\u2019s most famous character: King Lost. Echoes of David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane are perhaps inevitable in the fictional King Lost, and Noon has a Ballardian understanding of the intoxicating magic of celebrity, and its impact on a text. He masterfully casts the spell of Bell\u2019s dark glamour with tinctures of Bowie \u2013 his absence rather than his presence \u2013 as well as shades of Marc Bolan and Richey Edwards. Events move quickly, and as Hobbes deciphers a web of occult codes surrounding Clarke\u2019s murder, and a disturbing childhood secret at the heart of Bell\u2019s King Lost persona, Noon ups the stakes until the inspector finds himself facing mortal danger at every turn, including from within the force. DI Hobbes is (of course!) philosophical in response to the human cruelty he witnesses on the job. \u201cMaybe you take after your namesake, Inspector?\u201d someone observes. Noon made his name in the 1990s with sui generis SF novels such as Vurt and Pollen that were distinctively homegrown and dreamlike. Slow Motion Ghosts is his first crime novel, and it\u2019s a belter. Hobbes\u2019s journey into the underworlds of occult obsession and police violence is rich in social and subcultural detail, and Noon\u2019s storytelling is assured and compelling. \u2022 Slow Motion Ghosts is published by Doubleday (RRP \u00a316.99). To order a copy for \u00a314.95, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315, online orders only. Phone orders min. p&amp;p of \u00a31.99.",

      "body": "<p>It takes a certain audacity for a white male novelist to choose as his protagonist a young California woman who converts to Islam, disguises herself as a man in order to study in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jul/27/afghanistan.pakistan\" title=\"\">tribal borderlands of Pakistan</a>, and from there joins the Taliban in Afghanistan. You almost wonder if he\u2019s spoiling for a fight of some kind. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/18/godsend-john-wray-review\" title=\"\">author of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/18/godsend-john-wray-review\" title=\"\">Godsend</a></em>, John Wray (6ft 3in, softly spoken and unassuming), doesn\u2019t seem the type. The most aggressive thing about him is the ghostly wailing of the doorbell of his brownstone near Prospect Park in Brooklyn (it\u2019s on a \u201cHalloween setting\u201d). A Guggenheim and Whiting award winner, best known for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/14/lowboy-by-john-wray\" title=\"\">Lowboy</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/lost-time-accidents-review-john-wray\" title=\"\">The Lost Time Accidents</a></em>, Wray was anointed one of Granta\u2019s Best Young American Novelists in 2007. He has been living mostly in Mexico City for the past couple of years, but I caught him while he was in town to see his mother for the holidays.</p> <p>The house, which he bought and fixed up several years ago when it \u201clooked like there had been a fire\u201d, has become a renowned haven for writers and artists, all gleaming wood and a David Bowie tribute bathroom. Friends are always in and out, often staying longer than expected, especially now that Wray is, in his late 40s, \u201cat the age where people are getting divorced\u201d. Current and former residents or renters of workspace there include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/marlon-james\" title=\"\">Marlon James</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/07/dinner-at-centre-of-earth-nathan-englander-review\" title=\"\">Nathan Englander</a>, Alice Sola Kim and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/19/killing-and-dying-by-adrian-tomine-review\" title=\"\">Adrian Tomine</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In US culture now there\u2019s a lot of attention, for very good reasons, on who has the right to tell a given story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As I talk to Wray, the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/26/akhil-sharma-family-life-books-interview\" title=\"\">Akhil Sharma</a>, who came to crash for a week or two, \u201cand that was two years ago\u201d, saunters upstairs, wearing Wray\u2019s scarf. Wray asks if I want the football table that sits in the middle of the living room \u201clike an enormous vase of flowers that cannot be moved\u201d \u2013 an unsolicited gift from the Chilean writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/05/multiple-choice-by-alejandro-zambra-review\" title=\"\">Alejandro Zambra</a>, who apparently decided the house was missing a touch of machismo. \u201cPeople only play if they\u2019re drunk,\u201d he says. Noting affectionately that the crowd he has assembled here are \u201cnot just artists, they\u2019re actually doing stuff that\u2019s good\u201d, he catches himself and laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing to say.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s true that you can get away with a lot more if you\u2019re good. Late on in the writing of <em>Godsend</em>, when Wray was starting to worry about publishing such a book \u201cat this moment in US culture where there\u2019s a lot of attention being brought to bear, for very good reasons, on who\u2019s telling the story, what their agenda is, who should have the right to tell a given story\u201d, he asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/28/white-tears-hari-kunzru-review\" title=\"\">Hari Kunzru</a> for advice.</p> <p>\u201cAnd he said: \u2018You know, the real problem is not John Updike and Martin Amis, as privileged white men, writing about Islam. The problem was the books weren\u2019t good.\u2019 So, he just said: \u2018Make it good. That\u2019s the way to deal with that problem.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Wray agrees: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/05/shopping.fiction\" title=\"\">Updike\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/05/shopping.fiction\" title=\"\">Terrorist</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/05/shopping.fiction\" title=\"\"> </a>seems \u201cas though his mind was made up at the beginning \u2026 He thought he had all the answers. That\u2019s usually a mistake. Even if you\u2019re writing a novel about a divorce, it\u2019s probably a good idea not to feel like you have all the answers going into it.\u201d</p> <p>With a delicate subject like this one, if you\u2019re not pulling it off, Wray says, \u201cyou have to hope that someone close to you in your life will take you aside and say: \u2018Listen, buddy, you\u2019re really barking up the wrong tree here.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m sure people who worked on Homeland had the best intentions.

Nonetheless, Wray was sensitive to the risk that he might inadvertently \u201ccontribute to the literature of misperception with regard to the Islamic world, with regard to aggressive views of the United States internationally, with regard to militant insurgencies, all the things that have been so cynically misrepresented in popular culture. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people who worked on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/10/homeland-season-four-trailer-drone-strikes-pakistan-baby-brody\" title=\"\">Homeland</a></em> who had the best intentions, who think of themselves as political progressives.

      "bodyText": "It takes a certain audacity for a white male novelist to choose as his protagonist a young California woman who converts to Islam, disguises herself as a man in order to study in the tribal borderlands of Pakistan, and from there joins the Taliban in Afghanistan. You almost wonder if he\u2019s spoiling for a fight of some kind. But the author of Godsend, John Wray (6ft 3in, softly spoken and unassuming), doesn\u2019t seem the type. The most aggressive thing about him is the ghostly wailing of the doorbell of his brownstone near Prospect Park in Brooklyn (it\u2019s on a \u201cHalloween setting\u201d). A Guggenheim and Whiting award winner, best known for Lowboy and The Lost Time Accidents, Wray was anointed one of Granta\u2019s Best Young American Novelists in 2007. He has been living mostly in Mexico City for the past couple of years, but I caught him while he was in town to see his mother for the holidays. The house, which he bought and fixed up several years ago when it \u201clooked like there had been a fire\u201d, has become a renowned haven for writers and artists, all gleaming wood and a David Bowie tribute bathroom. Friends are always in and out, often staying longer than expected, especially now that Wray is, in his late 40s, \u201cat the age where people are getting divorced\u201d. Current and former residents or renters of workspace there include Marlon James, Nathan Englander, Alice Sola Kim and Adrian Tomine. As I talk to Wray, the novelist Akhil Sharma, who came to crash for a week or two, \u201cand that was two years ago\u201d, saunters upstairs, wearing Wray\u2019s scarf. Wray asks if I want the football table that sits in the middle of the living room \u201clike an enormous vase of flowers that cannot be moved\u201d \u2013 an unsolicited gift from the Chilean writer Alejandro Zambra, who apparently decided the house was missing a touch of machismo. \u201cPeople only play if they\u2019re drunk,\u201d he says. Noting affectionately that the crowd he has assembled here are \u201cnot just artists, they\u2019re actually doing stuff that\u2019s good\u201d, he catches himself and laughs: \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing to say.\u201d Still, it\u2019s true that you can get away with a lot more if you\u2019re good. Late on in the writing of Godsend, when Wray was starting to worry about publishing such a book \u201cat this moment in US culture where there\u2019s a lot of attention being brought to bear, for very good reasons, on who\u2019s telling the story, what their agenda is, who should have the right to tell a given story\u201d, he asked Hari Kunzru for advice. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018You know, the real problem is not John Updike and Martin Amis, as privileged white men, writing about Islam. The problem was the books weren\u2019t good.\u2019 So, he just said: \u2018Make it good. That\u2019s the way to deal with that problem.\u2019\u201d Wray agrees: Updike\u2019s Terrorist seems \u201cas though his mind was made up at the beginning \u2026 He thought he had all the answers. That\u2019s usually a mistake. Even if you\u2019re writing a novel about a divorce, it\u2019s probably a good idea not to feel like you have all the answers going into it.\u201d With a delicate subject like this one, if you\u2019re not pulling it off, Wray says, \u201cyou have to hope that someone close to you in your life will take you aside and say: \u2018Listen, buddy, you\u2019re really barking up the wrong tree here.\u2019\u201d No one did, and the novel is a thrilling high-wire act \u2013 the experiences of its heroine, Aden Sawyer, renamed Suleyman, feel very real. Nonetheless, Wray was sensitive to the risk that he might inadvertently \u201ccontribute to the literature of misperception with regard to the Islamic world, with regard to aggressive views of the United States internationally, with regard to militant insurgencies, all the things that have been so cynically misrepresented in popular culture. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people who worked on Homeland who had the best intentions, who think of themselves as political progressives. And yet what they ended up producing was so self-serving and so Islamophobic and so juvenile in its treatment of a very complicated and nuanced issue.\u201d Godsend was sparked by an \u201carresting and fascinating fragment of a story\u201d about a young female American Taliban fighter Wray heard in Afghanistan, during the weeks he spent doing research for a non-fiction project about John Walker Lindh, the US citizen captured while serving with the Taliban in 2001.

Nor did they mention Joan of Arc, one of the key figures he thought about when writing the book.

      "body": "<p>There has been a reliable mediocrity coursing through the films of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294505/?ref_=nv_sr_2\">Bart Freundlich</a>, some of them starring his wife Julianne Moore, including the breakout 1997 drama <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/myth-film-review.html\">The Myth of Fingerprints</a>. That was met with a quiet acclaim which has grown quieter with each film, from shapeless romcoms including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/22/the-rebound-film-review\">The Rebound</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/22/romance.comedy\">Trust the Man</a> to indie dirge such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/19/movies/film-in-review-world-traveler.html\">World Traveller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wolves-2017\">Wolves</a>. Given the critical apathy that tends to meet his output, he might seem like a strange choice to open this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundance-2019\">Sundance film festival</a>. But for his latest, he has recruited not only his wife but Michelle Williams, a duo whose combined skills would illuminate even the drabbest of films.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/23/sundance-film-festival-movies-documentaries-keira-knightley-jake-gyllenhaal\">Hollywood A-listers and controversial documentaries head to Sundance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a year marked by the festival\u2019s increased inclusivity \u2013 from a majority of critics coming from underrepresented groups to a record-breaking diverse set of directors \u2013 it might seem odd that a film written and directed by a straight, white man is kicking it off. But Freundlich has crafted, or rather recrafted, a female story with his gender-swapped remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/apr/14/susanne-bier-love-all-you-need\">Susanne Bier</a>\u2019s acclaimed 2006 drama <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457655/\">After the Wedding</a>. The two central male characters have been turned into women, one an idealist, the other a millionaire. Williams plays the former, Isabel, an American working in India, helping to run an orphanage with scarce financial support.

      "bodyText": "There has been a reliable mediocrity coursing through the films of Bart Freundlich, some of them starring his wife Julianne Moore, including the breakout 1997 drama The Myth of Fingerprints. That was met with a quiet acclaim which has grown quieter with each film, from shapeless romcoms including The Rebound and Trust the Man to indie dirge such as World Traveller and Wolves. Given the critical apathy that tends to meet his output, he might seem like a strange choice to open this year\u2019s Sundance film festival. But for his latest, he has recruited not only his wife but Michelle Williams, a duo whose combined skills would illuminate even the drabbest of films. In a year marked by the festival\u2019s increased inclusivity \u2013 from a majority of critics coming from underrepresented groups to a record-breaking diverse set of directors \u2013 it might seem odd that a film written and directed by a straight, white man is kicking it off. But Freundlich has crafted, or rather recrafted, a female story with his gender-swapped remake of Susanne Bier\u2019s acclaimed 2006 drama After the Wedding. The two central male characters have been turned into women, one an idealist, the other a millionaire. Williams plays the former, Isabel, an American working in India, helping to run an orphanage with scarce financial support. She receives an offer from a potential benefactor, Theresa, played by Moore, who wants her to fly to New York to prove why she deserves her investment. Frustrated by the need to justify a charitable donation yet under pressure for funds, Isabel agrees. The pair meet on the eve of Theresa\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding for which Isabel receives a surprise invite. As the title suggests, most of the drama takes place post-nuptials, with some revelations that are best kept in the dark. From the outset, Freundlich announces that his film is heading into grander territory than the original, with some handsome, swooping cinematography and an emphatic score. But while he dresses his film up as worthy Oscar bait, the contrivances of the plot are more befitting far soapier territory, often making it feel like a more restrained episode of This Is Us. It would be difficult to invest in if not for its two main stars who work hard to elevate the overly engineered plot, filling in the emotional gaps left by the haphazard script. Williams, who has been wasted recently with such ill-fitting roles in Venom and I Feel Pretty, plays a convincingly uncomfortable co-lead, confronted by wealth she\u2019s not familiar with and a newfound position she didn\u2019t expect. It\u2019s a frustratingly necessary reminder of her ability to bring nuance and empathy to smaller, more intimate fare.

      "bodyText": "Izzy just wants to tell the world about her skincare regime. The blond teenager has suffered with acne for years \u2013 at school, one bully cruelly nicknamed her Dimple Pimple. She has tried so many face washes \u2013 she even had prescription meds. It\u2019s no wonder her story, told in a series of tweets earlier this month, resonated with hundreds of people, and was \u201cliked\u201d on the site more than 1,000 times. Thankfully, there is a happy ending. One \u201crandom Tuesday about six months ago\u201d, Izzy found a cure for her troublesome skin. Coffee Creations coffee scrub! This Twitter thread \u2013 which looks like it was sent by an earnest young woman \u2013 is an advert posted by a corporation in a process known as \u201castroturfing\u201d (like the artificial turf, it might look authentic, but it\u2019s not the real thing). Izzy\u2019s thread \u2013 and the countless others \u201cshe\u201d has posted like it \u2013 sum up just how complicated online advertising is today. That\u2019s why, although I\u2019m happy that dozens of celebrities have promised the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to be clearer about the way they advertise online, I wonder if it\u2019s too little, too late. Sixteen influencers \u2013 including models, reality TV stars, and actors \u2013 have vowed to the CMA that they will be clear in their online posts about whether they have been paid (in money or gifts) to promote a product. This comes five years after the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) first introduced #ad, a way for internet celebrities to clearly mark paid-for posts. Social media celebs earn thousands of pounds by posting adverts for brands, and this new commitment to transparency is commendable. Young, impressionable audiences deserve to know whether someone they admire is truly recommending a product or being paid to do so. Under the CMA\u2019s remit, influencers who break the rules can be fined and even jailed for up to two years. And yet, is anyone really deterred? In September 2017, the ASA upheld a complaint against Geordie Shore star Sophie Kasaei for posting a picture of the diet drink Flat Tummy Tea on Instagram, alongside unverified claims that the drink aided weight loss. This was arguably a win for regulators, but Kasaei was undeterred. On 2 January 2018, she told her 1.9 million Instagram followers about her new range of diet supplements, SZKNutrition. Earlier this month, she posted about the supplements again \u2013 without #ad or a mention of her recent trip to an exclusive exercise bootcamp in Marrakech. Ultimately, the public continues to be misled \u2013 and things quickly get even more complicated. In December 2017, a 22-year-old American named Jake tweeted a picture of Extra chewing gum alongside a story about his blossoming romance with a classmate. The tweet looked like an ad \u2013 the brand was prominent, and Jake even used Extra\u2019s official social media slogan #GiveExtraGetExtra. Yet when I contacted Extra, they were emphatic that this was not a paid promotion. Why would a young person create a social media post that looks like an ad, even when they\u2019re not being paid? Recently the Atlantic\u2019s Taylor Lorenz revealed that hundreds of wannabe-influencers are faking brand deals by posting advertisements that seem paid for, using #ad, so that they look more famous than they are. Good luck, CMA! Two recent documentary films about the ill-fated Fyre festival have been getting lots of attention \u2013 but no influencer who was paid to advertise the disastrous event (which saw attendees at the music festival stranded in the Bahamas with limited food and water) has been punished or faced opprobrium. Kendall Jenner reportedly received $250,000 to advertise Fyre, and did so without using #ad. She hasn\u2019t been fined, or even spoken publicly about the deal.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Top story: Rich Republicans detached from shutdown effects Two duelling bills designed to end the partial government shutdown both failed to pass the US Senate on Thursday, leaving Donald Trump and Democrats at an impasse once again. In something of a blow to Trump, six Republican senators voted in favour of the Democratic proposal, which did not include funding for his desired border wall. But the 52-44 vote still fell short of the 60-vote threshold required to overcome the filibuster. Let them eat cake. Prominent Republicans have been accused of playing down the effects of the shutdown, with the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, suggesting workers take out loans against their missed paychecks. Notional emergency. The Trump administration has reportedly drafted a national emergency order to fund a wall as one possible \u2013 if perilous \u2013 way out of the shutdown. Venezuela military chief blames unrest on \u2018criminal US plan\u2019 The US state department has told US citizens to \u201cstrongly consider\u201d leaving Venezuela, after the country\u2019s defence minister accused the US of conspiring with the opposition movement led by Juan Guaid\u00f3 in a \u201ccriminal plan\u201d to foment civil war and unseat the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. As the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reports, it is unclear how the White House might translate its support for Guaid\u00f3 into regime change in Caracas. Oil markets. The political crisis in Venezuela, still a major oil exporter, has rattled oil markets, with prices rising slightly in anticipation of further disruption. El Chapo trial hears account of murders committed by Guzm\u00e1n The trial of the Sinaloa cartel boss Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n has heard for the first time of murders committed personally by the Mexican drug lord, known as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s former bodyguard Isa\u00edas Valdez R\u00edos told a federal court in New York that he had seen his then boss carry out three killings, including one in which he buried the victim alive. The once elusive Guzm\u00e1n, 61, was extradited to the US in 2017 and has been on trial for drug trafficking since November. Cooperating witness. Valdez, a former member of the Mexican army\u2019s special forces, worked as a guard for Guzm\u00e1n beginning in 2004, and piloted drug planes for the cartel before his arrest in 2014. Trump official \u2018overruled\u2019 advice not to award Kushner clearance A Trump White House appointee awarded top security clearance to the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last May, against the advice of two specialist adjudicators. The revelation, first reported by NBC News, raises fresh concerns about the administration\u2019s lax approach to national security, given Kushner had previously lost his full clearance after it emerged he had failed to disclose adequate information about his foreign contacts. Cohen subpoena. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, will appear before the Senate intelligence committee to answer questions related to the Russia investigation. Crib sheet Japan faces international condemnation after announcing it will resume commercial whaling for the first time since 1986, joining Norway and Iceland in defying a global ban on the practice. Brazil\u2019s only openly gay congressman says he has left the country and has no plans to return after facing a growing number of death threats. The US will on Friday return the first group of migrants seeking asylum to Mexico to await a decision on their claims, under an agreement announced by the Trump administration last month. Ukraine\u2019s former president Viktor Yanukovych has been found guilty of treason by a court in Kiev for his brutal crackdown on the pro-western protests that ultimately led to his overthrow in 2014. Yanukovych lives in exile in Russia. Listen to Today in Focus: the Catholic church faces its past The Catholic church covered up sexual abuse for decades, recent investigations around the world have revealed. India Rakusen talks to two survivors, while the Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent, Harriet Sherwood, tells her how the church intends to move forward. Must-reads The phenomenon of the self-loving actor-director What film director would shoot a scene in which 88-year-old Clint Eastwood has a threesome with two twentysomething women? Clint Eastwood, that\u2019s who. Whenever an actor directs himself, the film risks becoming a vanity project, writes Ryan Gilbey. Inside the secret world of hostage negotiation London is the centre of the kidnap and ransom insurance industry. And yet, as in the US, official UK policy is never to concede to kidnappers\u2019 demands. Could that policy be getting people killed? Joel Simon reports on the delicate business of hostage negotiation. A transgender teenager\u2019s journey \u2013 in pictures The photographer Susana Vera followed the Spanish teenager Gabriel Diaz de Tudanca over several years as he underwent gender reassignment surgery, found love with a new girlfriend, and got a \u201cself-made man\u201d tattoo. \u2018I stumbled into competitive eating\u2019 Molly Schuyler is 5ft 7in, weighs 120 pounds, and once ate 501 chicken wings in 30 minutes. \u201cI\u2019ve also eaten 119 dumplings in two minutes,\u201d says Schuyler, a professional competitive eater. \u201cI just swallowed them whole \u2013 there was no time for chewing.\u201d Opinion Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s attempts to oust Nicol\u00e1s Maduro appear to have been closely coordinated with the US, says Gabriel Hetland, who believes a catastrophic US invasion of Venezuela is now a genuine possibility. The case against Maduro is easy to make. Yet it must be recognized that Venezuela\u2019s crisis is not solely Maduro\u2019s doing. The US government and opposition also share responsibility. Sport The swimmer Nathan Adrian, a five-time Olympic gold medallist, has revealed he was recently diagnosed with testicular cancer, but says he has begun treatment and plans to continue training for the 2020 Tokyo Games. Atlanta is hosting this year\u2019s Super Bowl. It\u2019s also home to the world\u2019s busiest airport.

The minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, Victoria Atkins, fumbled for words in an interview when asked to explain the Home Office\u2019s inability to tackle the rise in people using dinghies in an a bid to reach Britain from France. The lack of clarity in Atkins\u2019 response as to why border force boats were still in their respective ports three weeks after the crisis began was peppered with bouts of nervous laughter as she announced: \u201cThey are on their way!\u201d On Thursday, the Home Office continued in the same opaque vein. Britain has started returning migrants to France, it said \u2013 although it would not reveal how many, where they were from or if, indeed, they were the same ones who arrived during the recent spike in people using small boats. The department did say it wanted to provide \u201ca strong deterrent against the dangerous crossings\u201d. But the giggle-strewn interview between radio presenter Nick Ferrari and the parliamentary undersecretary of state, broadcast on Monday, raised concerns. Is the government taking the issue seriously? Or is too little proactive action \u2013 or none \u2013 being taken to protect UK borders and the lives of vulnerable migrants making the dangerous crossing? In the live interview with London-based radio station LBC, Atkins not only failed to answer questions regarding the current whereabouts of two Border Force cutters, but also sought to downplay the number of asylum seekers entering the UK illegally by sea. Last weekend, 16 people were detained in Kent having arrived from France in separate landings, and this weekend there will undoubtably be more. Pledges made last month by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, who said he would deploy Border Force and navy vessels to the English Channel, have yet to materialise. Atkins sought to underplay the volume of those undertaking the perilous journey, saying: \u201cWe are very conscious that a small number of people are making the journey across the channel and we need to make sure that it is tackled and it\u2019s all in train.\u201d Her \u201csmall number\u201d does not match official figures published by the Home Office showing that 539 refugees attempted to travel to the UK on small boats in 2018, 80% of them in the last 12 weeks of the year. About 227 (42%) were intercepted by the French before they made it to the UK. Official figures do not take into account how many boats have landed in the UK without authorities\u2019 knowledge. Atkins went on to first blame the Ministry of Defence and \u201cother partners\u201d for the delay in deploying the vessels, which, she finally admitted, were still in port in Malta and Gibraltar. Pushed on who was to blame for the inaction, she conceded that the UK Border Force reports to the Home Office \u2013 her department. Atkins went on to say, in a curious sentence peppered with laughter: \u201cWe are getting the navy to help with patrols \u2026[laughter] \u2026 We want to stop people making these journeys and ensure that they claim asylum in the first safe country in which they enter.\u201d Sources confirmed to the Guardian that people-smuggling activities between France and the UK continued unabated at the weekend. Save for insisting that there must be increased dialogue with French counterparts, the home secretary and Atkins have thus far failed to detail how they intend to tackle the number of migrants trying to reach Britain from France. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was not available for comment, and in the past has had little to add, calling for increased boats to help refugees who fall into danger. Utilising a variety of techniques, from the naive to the sophisticated, smugglers are using riskier and riskier methods.

The 2017 survey by the Help Refugees organisation reported that the Calais camp contained 5,497 residents, while Dunkirk\u2019s Grande-Synthe contained 1,200, a figure believed to have risen in recent months.

Prices for the global benchmark Brent crude oil and the US West Texas Intermediate rose slightly on Thursday, at $61 a barrel and $53 a barrel, respectively, but oil-market participants are nervously watching the outcome of the tug-of-war. \u201cThis Venezuelan situation could potentially turn into something big,\u201d said Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist with RJO Futures. Tensions ratcheted up after the Trump administration recognized Guaid\u00f3 as interim president on Wednesday and called Maduro\u2019s government illegitimate. Alejandro Arreaza, analyst at Barclays, said in a Thursday research note a binary outcome was possible. \u201cEither there\u2019s a short-term exit by Maduro, or if he manages to ride this crisis out and keep power, he could stay for a prolonged period. However, Maduro\u2019s margin for maneuver to hold on to power seems extremely tight at this point, in our view. Considering the escalation of tensions with the US, the next few days could prove critical,\u201d he said. Compounding the situation for the oil market was a tweet on Wednesday by the Reuters Venezuela news service saying that the Trump administration warned US energy companies it could impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports. Venezuelan oil production has been circling the drain for several years as the South American country\u2019s economy collapses, but several factors mean it can still influence global oil markets, and the US. Venezuela still produces about 1.5m barrels a day, according to Barclays, citing data from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), of which nearly 1.2m are exported.

It would be one avenue of substitution without paying significantly more money out of pocket,\u201d he said. Since this latest Venezuelan situation escalated quickly, energy analysts say they are waiting to see what develops, as there\u2019s not much clear information available. Ghali said oil prices received a little support based on ideas that continued internal struggles in Venezuela mean even less money is being spent on the country\u2019s already crumbling oil infrastructure. \u201cThe market is likely to shrug this off because in the near term, we really don\u2019t have any information to put a bet one way or the other,\u201d he said.

The next step, Hennings said, was a plan to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were recognised in the constitution as the First Peoples of Australia. Fifty-two years later that still has not happened and the Uluru Statement, which sets out a path forward, was rejected by the federal government. Hennings is 85 now, a celebrated elder. On Saturday she will be one of four Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people honoured for their role in the 1967 referendum, and for a lifetime of other community work.

Manikarnika: the Queen of Jhansi is a nationalistic epic about the life \u2013 and death at British hands \u2013 of Rani Lakshmibai, an Indian woman who learned martial arts, married a maharajah and became a leader in the 1857 rebellion against the British East India Company. The film\u2019s lead actor, Kangana Ranaut, has been brawling off-screen too, this week warning hardline Hindu groups who have apparently threatened to disrupt the film\u2019s release that she would \u201cdestroy each and every one of them\u201d. Trailers for the film, which will be released in time for India\u2019s Republic Day on 26 January, show a blood-splattered Lakshmibai wielding her sword in gory fights with red-coated British soldiers. Lakshmibai, who died aged 29 in the last battle of the rebellion at Gwalior, has had her virtues extolled in Indian ballads, poetry and books but not yet in the country\u2019s popular cinema. Legends about her life say she was born into a royal court where she was trained in fighting and horse-riding along with two boys.

Three years later, company soldiers across north India began to rebel against the colonial administration and Lakshmibai joined the uprising. \u201cShe actually led an army into battle against the East India Company army,\u201d said Harleen Singh, an associate professor at Brandeis University who has written a book about the queen. The first depictions of Lakshmibai came from Victorian novelists, who portrayed her as a cunning oriental despot, Singh said. In one fictional telling, she kidnaps white men and keeps them in a harem, eventually falling in love with a British soldier. \u201cShe is made to submit to the supremacy of British masculinity,\u201d Singh added. It was well into the 20th century that she began to appear in Indian works in her modern depiction as a goddess of war and harbinger of independence. Singh said: \u201cWhatever the historical and literary myth making may be about her, the historical fact is this young Indian queen rode out into battle against the British army and died in conflict. This was a remarkable woman.\u201d Activists purporting to be from Karni Sena, a fanatical Hindu group, have seized on false rumours that the film alludes to Lakshmibai having an affair with a British soldier. Last year, the same group rioted in several Indian cities and threatened to mutilate the actor Deepika Padukone over similarly bogus claims that the film Padmaavat, about another historical Indian queen, depicted love scenes with a Muslim ruler. A national spokesman for Karni Sena denied that the fringe group had mobilised against the movie and said unauthorised people were using its name. At a press event for the film last week, Ranaut said Manikarnika was a celebration of the queen\u2019s life that hardline Hindus ought to embrace. \u201cThey should support us and the film,\u201d she said. \u201cLakshmibai is India\u2019s daughter and everyone should push that film forward.\u201d She added that although the film had been approved by historians and censors, \u201cKarni Sena are continuing to harass me.

Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves: nothing\u2019s written in stone yet.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s what Pouille has to keep in mind as he steels himself for his first ever major semi-final. Everybody knows the 29th seed is a rank outsider, that realistically he stands little chance of toppling Djokovic, the world No1 and the champion here on six occasions. The likeliest scenario is a comfortable Djokovic win, probably in straight sets, leaving him nice and fresh for another epic battle with Nadal on Sunday. The awesome Serb is in good nick after an easy quarter-final against Kei Nishikori and remains the man to beat as he bids for a third consecutive grand slam title. Yet Pouille is an elegant player who can draw on the memory of beating Nadal at the US Open in 2016. He impressed in his quarter-final against Milos Raonic and has the talent to ensure this isn\u2019t a one-off. Yet whether he has enough to deal with a genius like Djokovic is another matter altogether \u2013 and it\u2019s difficult not to think we already know the answer to that question.</p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at</strong> 8.30am GMT and 7.30pm in Melbourne.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T08:18:33.907Z\">at 8.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a report on Novak Djokovic\u2019s demolition of Lucas Pouille. I\u2019ll be in the chair for the world No1\u2019s dust-up with Rafael Nadal on Sunday, while James Piercy will have live coverage of the women\u2019s final between Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova tomorrow. Thanks for reading. Bye. Another pointer: Nadal hasn\u2019t beaten Djokovic on a hard court since the 2013 US Open final. Djokovic has won their last seven matches on hard courts. It will be Novak Djokovic\u2019s seventh Australian Open final. He\u2019s yet to lose one, which makes him the favourite against Rafael Nadal, even though the Spaniard\u2019s been in scorching form in Melbourne. Djokovic leads the head-to-head 27-25, triumphed in their semi-final at Wimbledon last year and has won eight of their last 10 matches. Novak Djokovic is asked about playing Rafael Nadal. \u201cFirst of all I would definitely want to buy the ticket for that match. We have different rules this year with the super tie-break so I don\u2019t think we will go as far as in 2012. Hopefully the outcome will be good for me.\u201d Novak Djokovic is asked about his family. \u201cMy son is not watching me. He is going to pre-school. I talked with him before my match. He was telling me about Spiderman. He tells me good luck and make sure you win.\u201d Novak Djokovic is asked about his comeback in the last year. \u201cIt was highly unlikely 12 months ago that I would be where I am today. But I said it before, I always had plenty of belief in myself and self-belief is something that always prevails.\u201d Novak Djokovic speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the best matches I ever had on this court. Everything worked the way I imagined it before the match. A tough one for Lucas, but he had a great tournament and I wish him all the best for the rest of the season. He has the quality to be a top 10 player. It was his first semi-final and the occasion is different. He is going to get more matches in the latter stages of grand slams.\u201d Lucas Pouille makes his way off court, well beaten and probably in need of plenty of alone time. Novak Djokovic is through to yet another Australian Open final. He plays Rafa Nadal. More errors from Pouille hand Djokovic a 15-30 lead. Pouille nets a forehand to give Djokovic two match points. The Frenchman hangs his head. Then he lifts it and saves the first with a big forehand at the net. 30-40. But it\u2019s a temporary reprieve. Pouille nets a backhand and it\u2019s all over. Not that it ever really began. Third set: Djokovic* 6-0, 6-2, 5-2 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic knocks an easy forehand down the line for 30-0. It\u2019s not long before he holds to love. Mercifully this forgettable match is almost over. Third set: Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 4-2 Pouille* (*denotes server): Pouille holds! Third set: Djokovic* 6-0, 6-2, 4-1 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic wants this done as quickly as possible. No point hanging around when he has to face Nadal on Sunday. He holds to love. Third set: Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 3-1 Pouille* (*denotes server): Pouille comes up with a very good backhand to keep Djokovic at bay at 40-30. \u201cBravo,\u201d Djokovic says - before making it deuce with a vicious backhand. Then Djokovic comes up with some outstanding defence to draw Pouille into an errant forehand. Break point. Pouille nets a forehand. Third set: Djokovic* 6-0, 6-2, 2-1 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. He has hit an untouchable level. Third set: Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 1-1 Pouille* (*denotes server): Pouille holds easily enough, which wakes up the crowd for a bit. Third set: Djokovic* 6-0, 6-2, 1-0 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to 30. Though Pouille finds some resolve, fighting from 15-30 to 40-30, the game goes to deuce after a razor sharp forehand from Djokovic, who soon earns a set point. Pouille sends a backhand wide. We\u2019ve only been going for 56 minutes. This is lamentable. Second set: Djokovic* 6-0, 5-2 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic races into a 40-0 lead thanks to a clever volley. He holds to love. Pouille will serve to stay in the set. Second set: Djokovic 6-0, 4-2 Pouille* (*denotes server): Pouille holds to 15, not that it really seems to matter at this point. Second set: Djokovic* 6-0, 4-1 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. That\u2019s all you\u2019re getting. Second set: Djokovic 6-0, 3-1 Pouille* (*denotes server): Pouille should win the first point, only to get himself in a muddle with a volley off a running Djokovic forehand. He makes up for it by winning the next two points, an ace making it 30-15. Yet the game goes to 30-all and Djokovic earns a break point when Pouille nets a backhand pass. Pouille rushes and double-faults. Second set: Djokovic* 6-0, 2-1 Pouille (*denotes server): Pouille makes himself feel even better with a lovely backhand down the line, but Djokovic is always in control of the game, moving to 40-15 with an ace. He holds to 30 with an ace. Second set: Djokovic 6-0, 1-1 Pouille* (*denotes server): Pouille holds to 15, beating Djokovic with a brilliant forehand pass! Maybe the match has started! Pouille\u2019s on the board! It\u2019s taken half an hour, but he\u2019s on the board! Second set: Djokovic* 6-0, 1-0 Pouille (*denotes server): You have to feel for Pouille. Rather him than me out there. And let\u2019s not forget that Djokovic has meted out similar treatment to Federer and Murray on this court in the past. He\u2019s just unstoppable when he\u2019s in this mood. Serving to stay in the set, Pouille can only watch in awe as Djokovic pings a stunning backhand return down the line for 15-30. Djokovic\u2019s return is on. Another sets him up to pummel a forehand down the line for two set points. A bit of complacency sets in and Djokovic wastes the first with a poor backhand drop shot. But it\u2019s relentless. It\u2019s not long before Pouille wafts a forehand miles off target and the set\u2019s over in 23 minutes. Someone give him a hug. First set: Djokovic* 5-0 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic wrongfoots Pouille with a brilliant backhand for 15-0. The applause from the crowd is a bit subdued, though. They want to see a contest, but this is a ruthless demolition. Djokovic lashes a forehand away to hold to love. First set: Djokovic 4-0 Pouille* (*denotes server): The deflating thing is Pouille isn\u2019t playing badly. But Djokovic is all over him at 30-all, spanking a forehand into the right corner to earn a break point. Pouille\u2019s serve comes to his aid to force deuce. But Djokovic grabs a second chance. Pouille whacks a forehand long. This is absurd. First set: Djokovic* 3-0 Pouille (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love to consolidate the break. This is not encouraging. First set: Djokovic 2-0 Pouille* (*denotes server): This is such an important game for Pouille, who can\u2019t afford to let Djokovic establish an early lead. Yet he isn\u2019t making first serves. Djokovic moves to 15-30 - and then Pouille slaps a forehand into the net to give up two break points.But he saves the first with a big serve and then whacks an ace out wide to force deuce. He isn\u2019t out of the woods yet, though, and Djokovic earns a third chance with a curling forehand down the line. This time Pouille nets a first serve. Feeling the heat, he goes for too much on a reckless second serve and fires it long. Djokovic breaks straight away. Oh dear. First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Pouille (*denotes server): Novak Djokovic, who\u2019s won his last 27 grand slam matches against Frenchmen, opens the serving. He wins the first point - but Lucas Pouille is keen to assert himself straight away, making it 15-all with a precise forehand, then moving to 15-30 with a deft volley. This is good attacking play from the underdog. The game goes to deuce, Djokovic finding himself under surprise early pressure. Yet the world No1 digs in to hold serve. Lucas Pouille is coached by Amelie Mauresmo, Andy Murray\u2019s old coach. Here\u2019s what he has to say about her. Here come the players. Lucas Pouille first, then Novak Djokovic, who knows the drill here. These two have never met before. So there you go. If Lucas Pouille wins he will be the first Frenchman to reach a grand slam final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga reached the final of this tournament in 2008 - and lost to Novak Djokovic, who collected the first of his 14 majors with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 win. Good news for Australia! Hello and welcome to live coverage of Novak Djokovic\u2019s training session ahead of the Australian Open final. His hitting partner today is Lucas Pouille, a lucky 24-year-old Frenchman, and ... no, this is too harsh. Too presumptuous, even. This is sport, after all, and it pays to expect the unexpected. Anything can happen, even extraordinary things, even though it seems inevitable that Pouille is set to go the same way as the unfortunate Stefanos Tsitsipas, who suffered badly at the hands of Rafael Nadal in yesterday\u2019s semi-final. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves: nothing\u2019s written in stone yet. That\u2019s what Pouille has to keep in mind as he steels himself for his first ever major semi-final. Everybody knows the 29th seed is a rank outsider, that realistically he stands little chance of toppling Djokovic, the world No1 and the champion here on six occasions.

After beating Karunaratne with an absolute beauty earlier in the over, Cummins repeated the dose to finish, landing on a length that forced the opener to play. Sure enough, it kissed the edge and sailed into the gloves of Lyon. Quite the moment to end the day, smiles everywhere! The visitors will be gutted, one delivery away from reaching the close without loss.

Lyon, on for one over before the close, finds a legitimate outside edge off Thirimanne\u2019s blade, Khawaja unable to get his left hand down. The replay doesn\u2019t serve the slipper well, moving too late to realistically make it down. Lyon is a man in complete control so far in this Test Match, getting so much bounce and turn. <br></p> <p>\u201cGood morning from Spain.\u201d As you do, Dave Langlois. \u201cIf SL could somehow bluff their way to 350 this would be a really juicy match. Both of today\u2019s test matches, I reckon, are showing the value of a good battery of quick, consistently 140k+ bowlers who know where they\u2019re putting it. England just hasn\u2019t got them, only the foxy, endearingly cunning Anderson. Lakmal has done really well here but the Aussie bunch are up with SA\u2019s or India\u2019s or, on their day, even better. They win matches.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps. For Lakmal, though, like Anderson, it\u2019s about accuracy and movement. Just as it is Philander and Abbas. Balance and all that. But don\u2019t worry, Archer will be in the England XI any moment now! <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c4ae3afe4b0a585f6e863ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T10:25:15.191Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 2, Thirimanne 2) </strong>Singles for both to finish another probing over, Thirimanne\u2019s off an inside edge that wasn\u2019t far away from causing him major problems.

Throws his hands at a wide ball, gets a thick edge, and watches it whisper past the hands of second slip and fine for four. Does he learn his lesson? Naahhhhhh, learning lessons is for chumps. Instead he doubles down with another wild slap outside off and misses the ball completely, luckily for him. Retract my earlier suggestion: in this case the spoon would be wasted.<br></p> <p><em>Play your natural game</em>, runs the mantra.

      "bodyText": "Six wickets in the final session. Five for Sri Lanka then Pat Cummins striking for Australia with the final delivery of the night. Lakmal was superb with 5/75, keeping the visitors vaguely in the game. But they are so far behind now, especially with the huge wicket of Karunaratne, that it could well be one-nil to Australia by this time tomorrow. Be sure to join us again on the OBO when we do return for that, and thanks for your company today. Goodnight from the Gabba! Of course! After beating Karunaratne with an absolute beauty earlier in the over, Cummins repeated the dose to finish, landing on a length that forced the opener to play. Sure enough, it kissed the edge and sailed into the gloves of Lyon. Quite the moment to end the day, smiles everywhere! The visitors will be gutted, one delivery away from reaching the close without loss. They go to sleep trailing by 162. 5th over: Sri Lanka 17-0 (Karunaratne 3, Thirimanne 6) Half a chance! Lyon, on for one over before the close, finds a legitimate outside edge off Thirimanne\u2019s blade, Khawaja unable to get his left hand down. The replay doesn\u2019t serve the slipper well, moving too late to realistically make it down. Lyon is a man in complete control so far in this Test Match, getting so much bounce and turn. \u201cGood morning from Spain.\u201d As you do, Dave Langlois. \u201cIf SL could somehow bluff their way to 350 this would be a really juicy match. Both of today\u2019s test matches, I reckon, are showing the value of a good battery of quick, consistently 140k+ bowlers who know where they\u2019re putting it. England just hasn\u2019t got them, only the foxy, endearingly cunning Anderson. Lakmal has done really well here but the Aussie bunch are up with SA\u2019s or India\u2019s or, on their day, even better. They win matches.\u201d Perhaps. For Lakmal, though, like Anderson, it\u2019s about accuracy and movement. Just as it is Philander and Abbas. Balance and all that. But don\u2019t worry, Archer will be in the England XI any moment now! 4th over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 2, Thirimanne 2) Singles for both to finish another probing over, Thirimanne\u2019s off an inside edge that wasn\u2019t far away from causing him major problems. Richardson\u2019s the man most likely right now. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 10-0 (Karunaratne 1, Thirimanne 1) Starc spraying it about again, four byes from a ball well down the legside. Really should have been wides. As usual, he backs it up with a good\u2019un. This isn\u2019t the most popular view at the moment, but I reckon Starc\u2019s volatility is an asset more often than not. Some big news in from the ECB, veteran spinner Danielle Hazell has retired from international cricket. \u201cI feel 100 per cent happy with my decision to move on from playing international cricket and I\u2019m really excited to find out what the next chapter holds in store for me. I owe a lot to the game and I would now love to give some of my time and energy back into the sport. There have been some amazing highlights \u2013 some really special moments \u2013 but the memory that stands out the most to me is the back-to-back Ashes victories across 2013 and 2014.Playing international cricket for nine years can have an effect on you both mentally and physically and my body is telling me that it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d What an absolute ripper. Well played, Dani. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Karunaratne 1, Thirimanne 0) It is a full body experience when Richardson bowls, really throwing himself at the batsmen with every delivery. It\u2019s wonderful to watch. Last night at the press conference I asked him who he modelled his game on growing up, he said Dale Steyn. I can definitely see that. Karunaratne is playing him with utmost respect here, defending and leaving on that off and fourth stump line. Four overs to go. 1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Karunaratne 1, Thirimanne 0) Starc is wayward to begin, his first ball clipping Karunaratne\u2019s pad on the way to the rope for four leg byes, the opener then getting off strike to midwicket. Thirimanne\u2019s turn, who watches one three feet outside the off stump, defending off a length then playing and missing at the final delivery. Gradual improvement, then. What life is all about. The players are back on the field. Six overs to come, can the visitors get through without loss? That would be quite the achievement. Starc v Karunaratne. PLAY! \u201cEvening Adam.\u201d Gervase Greene, good evening to you. \u201cIt seems to be my turn to offer one of those plaintive/pathetic appeals to the OBO universe, asking if there is anywhere in Hanoi where the cricket might be on?\u201d I\u2019m invested in this, visiting Hanoi in March. The last time I mentioned that, I received the most magnificent must-do email from the OBO fam. Love you, guys. \u201cThe country\u2019s estimated 50 million TVs were all on display when the football team played last night (they bowed out of the Asian Cup, but not before giving heavyweights Japan plenty of what-for), so a small kernel of hope exists. (I might have made up the \u201850 million\u2019 figure, but there were certainly plenty around in the Old Quarter, where I am stranded cricketless at present). Thoughts, anyone?\u201d Richardson tried to get in the act but top edged Perera into the air, Karunaratne doing the rest with the catch before racing off to pad up. Sri Lanka will have to face six overs tonight before the close, their first innings deficit 179. 106th over: Australia 323-9 (Starc 26, Richardson 1) BIG! Starc loads up and plonks Lakmal over long-on and into the members! He\u2019s hit that perfectly. It was taken in the crowd by a bloke in a pink polo shirt, living in his best life with the celebration. Starc goes again next ball, clipping four past square leg. Easy peasy! 105th over: Australia 312-9 (Starc 16, Richardson 0) Clever batting! Starc gets down low to sweep Perera hard into the gap for four then does the exactly same thing from the next ball too. Chandimal\u2019s field is set for cow corner slogs but the big quick has a few more tricks than that. Australia\u2019s lead is now 168 with ten overs remaining, so they should still get a handful in tonight with the pink ball. 104th over: Australia 304-9 (Starc 8, Richardson 0) Richardson is a very handy No11. He defends his first couple of balls in Test cricket to deny Lakmal a sixth. Oh, how Suranga Lakmal has deserved this bag of five! That\u2019s another lovely delivery too, hooping in from over the wicket at the man on debut. Patterson uses the review but there little doubt where that is going - straight into the leg stump. 103rd over: Australia 302-8 (Patterson 29, Starc 7) On telly, they are backing in a declaration. Or maybe they just want Mitch Starc to drop some bombs? He doesn\u2019t. Back to back maidens. Actually, three on the trot. 15,603 is the final attendance, I can report from CA. Most of those who are left now are getting full. 102nd over: Australia 302-8 (Patterson 29, Starc 7) We\u2019re seeing a back and forth below us, some scallywags trying to engage the members in a verbal stoush. In response? The chap dunked his rum and coke. Where else but Queensland? To level with you, this is where my attention is rather than on Lakman\u2019s maiden to Patterson. But I\u2019m happy he\u2019s back on the field and straight into the attack. 101st over: Australia 302-8 (Patterson 29, Starc 7) Maiden? Sure. A maiden. Starc plays out Perera, preferring to block than bludgeon. Kurt\u2019s turn. 100th over: Australia 302-8 (Patterson 29, Starc 7) Bang, bang! Batting for 67 balls without a boundary, Patterson has struck two in two balls off Chameera, pulling with power through midwicket then flogging a cut shot past point for another. Getting his chance later in the over, Starc got a bouncer down to his feet for a quick single, Patterson making it three fours in the over from the final offering with a cross-bat wallop through point! 15 from it, the 300 up as well. \u201cDown at the Australian Open arena,\u201d Abhijato Sensarma says, trying to make us jealous. \u201cDjokovic is serving an utterly moral-draining pounding to the talented French tennis player Lucas Pouille, taking the first set 6-0. As it happens to be, David Warner is in the crowd with a cast on his hand. He sits next to Ricky Ponting. The former has a smile on his face, with the on-air commentators mentioning the \u2018pain\u2019 he has caused the country. \u2018Just for a while,\u2019 the man adds, with a tone which leads me to not believed him easily.\u201d Keep a close eye on that. 99th over: Australia 287-8 (Patterson 16, Starc 6) Runs around the field off Perera, Patterson a couple to point then another to cover. Starc then takes two to midwicket to finish. Yep, I think they\u2019re preparing themselves for happy hour. I neglected to post the Head and Paine wickets from Lakmal\u2019s earlier spell. 98th over: Australia 282-8 (Patterson 13, Starc 4) After the drinks break, Starc has one ball to face to finish the successful Chameera over and he\u2019s off the mark with a lavish cover-driven boundary. It makes sense for them to put the foot down here with 17 overs left tonight and a healthy lead already in the bank. A 21-ball duck for Cummins, Chameera earning his edge with another ball that tails away delightfully. I\u2019ll say it again: beware the injured fast bowler! Fantastic cricket from the Sri Lankans, doing the best with what they have after dark. 97th over: Australia 277-7 (Patterson 12, Cummins 0) Perera\u2019s radar is a touch off this time, a leg bye from Patterson then a bye down the legside. To finish, the more recognised batsman gets one to midwicket to keep the strike. As soon as the set is done, Perera runs down to the rooms. \u201cIs there a nightclub down there?\u201d asks Michael Vaughan. \u201cLove Island,\u201d replies Kerry O\u2019Keefe. That kicks off a conversation about what the villa would be like if Shane Warne went in. Huss wants none of it. 96th over: Australia 274-7 (Patterson 11, Cummins 0) If Chameera is going as badly as his body language between overs suggests, this is a brave spell from him, charging in and bending his back well enough to jag back into Cummins\u2019 pad with arms raised. He then capped the over with one that went the other way, beating the right hander outside the off stump. On Fox, Kerry O\u2019Keefe is comparing Lakmal to Terry Alderman. The attack leader is standing on the boundary, ready to come back on shortly. It should be fun when he does. This is why day-night Tests are superb. 95th over: Australia 274-7 (Patterson 11, Cummins 0) Before Perera started the new over, Chameera again looked to be battling with a hobble to long leg. Can they keep him on long enough for Lakmal to recover and go again? Bowling at Patterson, the off-spinner nearly beat the dancing left-hander to begin, which meant that he stayed home in defence for the rest. 94th over: Australia 273-7 (Patterson 11, Cummins 0) Chameera looked a spent force half an hour ago but now he\u2019s back on the field and beating the bat of Cummins with a lovely little away swinger. There is no pace about but with the pink ball at this time of night it is all about accuracy. 93rd over: Australia 273-7 (Patterson 10, Cummins 0) Perera was through that set in about 90 seconds, doing Lakmal no favours. Patterson made it to double figures along the way, from the inside portion of his blade to square leg. Cummins also inside edged near the bat pad but not near the hand of the catcher. With that over bowled, Lakmal leaves the field, which means his fine spell is complete. 92nd over: Australia 272-7 (Patterson 9, Cummins 0) Not to be! The hat-trick ball was his worst of the set, waaaay outside the off stump. Chandimal retains the five slips (!) for Cummins throughout the over, beating him with a pair of beauts. The second of those prompted an enthusiastic appeal from the posse behind the wicket but Umpire Illingworth wanted none of it. What a wonderful spell. How many more can he get through? 91st over: Australia 272-7 (Patterson 9, Cummins 0) Perera is getting plenty of movement and ample bounce from round the wicket but Patterson is up to the task. Suddenly, his job is a very important one. Stand by for the hat trick ball! 90th over: Australia 272-7 (Patterson 9, Cummins 0) We will have to wait for the hat-trick ball, Lakmal\u2019s pair of wickets from the final two deliveries. What a superb over from the Sri Lankan attack leader, at the very moment that they looked set to be batted out of this Test with their two other quicks off the field injured. That\u2019s leadership. Lakmal is on a hat-trick! He has squared up the Australian captain first ball, finding the edge, just making the journey to Mendis at second slip. That\u2019s a gorgeous piece of bowling and an equally fantastic catch coming forward. Well, it may have been a nice time to bat but Head has not made the most of it. It came back a long way from Lakmal, shaping back into the left-hander from over the wicket, clipping the top of the stumps. Sorry for saying in the previous post that it was Patterson facing, the man on debut was watching that safely from the other end. IS HEAD OUT LBW TO LAKMAL? Umpire Illingworth says so! But he\u2019s sent it upstairs. Stand by. 89th over: Australia 269-5 (Head 82, Patterson 9) Patterson gets off strike first ball in the same way he got off the mark, to mid-on with a firm push off Perera. Head is content playing conservatively until the final delivery, cutting a couple into the gap. Test cricket is never easy, but this truly is the time to cash in. 88th over: Australia 266-5 (Head 80, Patterson 8) Lakmal again, who might have to bowl for the entirety of this long final session. There isn\u2019t a lot going on, Head defending the accurate deliveries and leaving the wide alone, including one down leg. Super shot to finish, leaning back to crunch a slightly shorter ball through point for four from the balls of his feet, ala Joe Root at his best. 87th over: Australia 262-5 (Head 76, Patterson 8) It is back to Perera for the injured Chameera, the offie who sent down a lovely set to begin this session. He\u2019s now coming from the Stanley Street End, the sun slowly setting over his left shoulder. Coming round the wicket to Head, he takes one to square leg. Patterson\u2019s turn, the new man leaning into a drive but only as far as the man at cover. \u201cPatterson has just got to be careful,\u201d notes Michael Vaughan on TV after miscuing a defensive push. \u201cHe\u2019s just leaning over too far.\u201d 86th over: Australia 261-5 (Head 75, Patterson 8) Lakmal gives Head enough room to free his arms and punch down the ground off the back foot for three to begin, taking him three quarters of the way to a ton. This is the third time that the South Australian has made it into the 70s in Tests but he simply has to convert this time around. With bowlers down everywhere, he won\u2019t get a better chance. 85th over: Australia 258-5 (Head 72, Patterson 8) Yup, Chameera is in more trouble than the early settlers, chatting to Chandimal between balls, limping back to his mark. But, of course, beware of the injured bowler. Sure enough, he beats the blade of Patterson before the over is done then leaving the field. We have an answer to the Jim Maxwell poser! From Carl Jepson: \u201cThe aforementioned gentlemen commenced their test careers at No. 7?\u201d Ding, ding, ding! Bradman\u2019s first has been of interest to me this summer because it was played at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, where two Tests were held - including his debut. Nearly a century on, Manuka next week becomes just the 11th in Australia. By comparison, in India during the 2017 tour, Australia played at three new venues - Pune, Ranchi and Dharhamsala - making 27 in their history. 84th over: Australia 256-5 (Head 71, Patterson 7) Lakmal does replace Perera, which is a bit disappointing for those of us who enjoy watching finger spinners do their thing with the new ball. For that, you can thank Dipak Patel. As it was in the previous over, the only scoring shot is a three to Patterson, this time leaning on a full ball, placing it through cover. With Chameera all-but cooked and Kumara off the field, there\u2019s a lot riding on Lakmal\u2019s spell right now. \u201cEvening Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Phil Withall. \u201cWith regard to the banner. The whole thing has been badly dealt with from the beginning. Cricket Australia seemed to think it would just blow over and no harm would come of it. That is the most disappointing aspect (the content of the banner is obviously abhorrent beyond belief). The soft handling of things like this only empowers the idiots to repeat such things and escalate them. The less punishment the more ennobled they become. Prejudice has no place in sport or society as a whole and those that display it need to understand this.\u201d Well said. For CA\u2019s part, I suspect there might have been some confusion about what the statement means. Of course, it is coded. If a Pepe the Frog banner were unfurled it would be just the same. Anyway, as I said, you\u2019re all across this. 83rd over: Australia 253-5 (Head 71, Patterson 4) Patterson gets three more now, tucking Chameera off his pads easily enough. The quick gets through the over with his pace dropping. As they note on TV, he looks spent at just the wrong time. 82nd over: Australia 250-5 (Head 71, Patterson 1) The new man is playing with soft hands until Perera gets one to drift and turn beautifully, beyond his outside edge. He\u2019s getting considerable bounce with the second new ball, too. Another excellent delivery follows, going on with the arm. The expectation was that the offie was on now to help change ends of the quicks but they should keep him going on the evidence of this set. To finish, Patterson dances down the track to take his first run in Test cricket, down to mid-on. It took 14 balls and included a 40-minute wait. But he\u2019s away now and what a relief that must be. \u201cThey (CA) won\u2019t do anything about this unless the cops do?\u201d asks Laura Caughey, our favourite Irish umpire. \u201cAnd they banned three players for a year for ball tampering after the ICC already issued their sanctions?\u201d Nice pick up. The players are back on the field. Perera has the ball at the Vulture Street end, bowling at Patterson who is yet to score with Australia resuming at 249/5. PLAY! An update on the disgraceful nonsense from last night. I\u2019m pleased that WA Police are investigating as that is the only real way that CA will ban the idiots for three years, as they have the capacity to do. I know that I don\u2019t need to explain the origins of that particular slogan to OBO readers. To that end, it\u2019s a disgrace that they could just stroll into, say, the WBBL final tomorrow. They\u2019re not welcome. This will mean nothing to those in the non-footy states, but Luke Hodge is on Channel Seven at the break with Damien Fleming. I can\u2019t wait to eat that right up. What do these men have in common? As Jim Maxwell entered the dinner room here behind our position here in the press, this is what he put to me. In turn, I said I would begin by asking the OBO if they can work it out in less time than I did. McCartney, Noble, Kippax, Bradman, GS Chappell, and now, Kurtis Patterson. Go! Hello, by the way. How about a debut ton for the new southpaw with all the runs coming in the final session against the pink ball? Dare to dream. For now, keep me company with a formal note or a searing hot take. I\u2019m open for business. Australia\u2019s session, Australia\u2019s match, but still that defining innings remains elusive for Australia\u2019s batsmen. Marnus Labuschagne got close with his 81 - the top score of the summer for Australia in Tests - but his composed knock ended when he handed his wicket away out of the blue shortly before Dinner. Travis Head may yet pile on the runs to become Australia\u2019s first centurion of 2019 but his innings has not been without good fortune. He should have been caught two hours ago but Niroshan Dickwella and the slip cordon made a meal of a routine edge behind the wicket. The final session of the day promises plenty. Under lights Kurtis Patterson will show what he\u2019s made of, and with his side already in command of this Test the shackles should be off for the young New South Welshman. Adam Collins will take you through the next phase of play so I shall take my leave, find a spoon, and resume my career as a Pete Townshend lookalike. See you tomorrow. 81st over: Australia 249-5 (Head 71, Patterson 0) Patterson\u2019s dot ball debut extends to eight but he does rotate the strike courtesy of a leg-bye. It\u2019s an innocuous opening over with the new ball by Lakmal, his pace in the mid to high 120s kph which is far from threatening at this level without prodigious sideways movement. Head is happy to stand his ground and stride off for the Dinner interval. The second new ball has been taken immediately. Lakmal will have one over with it before the Dinner break. 80th over: Australia 248-5 (Head 71, Patterson 0) Head dabs out a maiden with the end of the session fast approaching. Not only that but the second new ball is also now a consideration. 79th over: Australia 248-5 (Head 71, Patterson 0) The left-handed Patterson begins his Test career with five dot balls. Oh no! Such a shame for Marnus Labuschagne. He\u2019s been chanceless all session but in the shadow of the Dinner break he chips Dananjaya harmlessly to short midwicket and he has to go. There was a century and more for the taking but a summer\u2019s summit of 81 will have to do. 78th over: Australia 248-4 (Labuschagne 81 Head 71) Dickwella is adamant he has Head caught behind off the bowling of Perera but Richard Illingworth is unmoved and Sri Lanka have no reviews remaining. Short and wide from the bowler and not the smartest shot from the batsman. We await the DRS replays. 77th over: Australia 247-4 (Labuschagne 80 Head 71) Dananjaya\u2019s back into the attack after that light relief from Karunaratne but it\u2019s an inauspicious start, a full toss followed by a long hop. Among this Labuschagne sprints an all-run four and dabs a single into the offside to reach 80, Australia\u2019s highest individual score of this Test summer. 76th over: Australia 240-4 (Labuschagne 74 Head 70) *Milestone Klaxon*: this is now Australia\u2019s highest fifth-wicket partnership versus Sri Lanka. In further good news for Australian sport, Sam Stosur has just won a grand slam. 75th over: Australia 238-4 (Labuschagne 74 Head 68) Karunaratne gets a third over and he justifies it with a beautiful opening delivery that kissed the deck and gambolled beyond Labuschagne\u2019s outside edge. There\u2019s an appeal for LBW soon afterwards but umpire Erasmus is wise to a faint inside edge. 74th over: Australia 234-4 (Labuschagne 71 Head 67) Sri Lanka\u2019s fielding so far has been dreadful, missing catches, chaperoning boundaries and gifting singles. The latest aberration allows Head to jog through for a run but it almost works in the tourists\u2019 favour. With Labuschagne on strike Perera beats the bat for the first time in a long time and appeals heartily for LBW. It\u2019s declined on field but SRI LANKA REVIEW! The ball spun past the inside edge of Labuschagne\u2019s bat from a delivery sent down from over the wicket. DRS confirms it was missing leg stump and Sri Lanka burn their second and final review. 73rd over: Australia 231-4 (Labuschagne 69 Head 66) More right-arm reputation destroyers from Karunaratne, but this time he loses his line to Head and invites a delicate glance to the fine-leg fence for the first boundary in yonks. There\u2019s a much shorter wait for the next four, Karunaratne offering too much width and Head slashing confidently through the offside ring. 72nd over: Australia 223-4 (Labuschagne 69 Head 58) This match is happening, I am absorbing it, but I\u2019m damned if I can pick out much to report. One leg-bye from the latest unremarkable over. 71st over: Australia 222-4 (Labuschagne 69 Head 58) Sri Lanka turn to the part-time medium pace of Karunaratne. I love this. Proper old school net bowling medium pace junk. Keeper\u2019s stood up, pace is a smidgen over 100kph, and the batsmen are terrified of getting out. A couple of singles keep the game moving. 70th over: Australia 220-4 (Labuschagne 67 Head 58) Head does his best to keep the scoreboard ticking over but he finds Dananjaya difficult to get away. This match is in a bit of a holding pattern until the second new ball. When that arrives, along with the floodlights, we should move into a more exhilarating phase of play. Ray Murphy has emailed in a tempting question. It would be helpful if anyone out there could answer it. \u201cWhen Patterson comes out to bat Australia will have a first innings lead. When was last Australian batsman to debut in such a \u2018comfortable\u2019 scenario?\u201d 69th over: Australia 219-4 (Labuschagne 66 Head 58) Head pushing his partner close in the race to become the first Australian centurion of the summer. He moves four runs closer the milestone with a handsome pull from a Dananjaya long hop. 68th over: Australia 214-4 (Labuschagne 65 Head 54) Labuschagne looks as though he could bat out there with a popsicle and still nudge the scoreboard forward every over. Not to be outdone in the making it look effortless stakes, Head has dispensed with the helmet and is batting in a baggy green. Very Tugga areas, but still not Shimron Hetmyer walloping England about in a white floppy. 67th over: Australia 211-4 (Labuschagne 63 Head 53) The next milestone for this pair is one of them reaching 80 and in so doing registering the highest individual score for Australia this Test summer. Labuschagne gets nearer the mark with the 11th three of this partnership. The 12th isn\u2019t far behind after Head\u2019s clubbed drive is hauled in just before the long-on rope. 66th over: Australia 204-4 (Labuschagne 59 Head 50) Perera makes it spin from both ends but Sri Lanka\u2019s offies haven\u2019t found much turn or bounce so far. Their task has been made more difficult by this Australian partnership batting with great discipline. 65th over: Australia 201-4 (Labuschagne 56 Head 50) *Milestone Klaxon*: 50 for Travis Head, 200 for Australia. This pair are cruising. One of those TV pieces in the outer has just revealed Kurtis Patterson is known as \u2018spoon\u2019 to his mates. Something to do with the shape of his head and his skinny body. It reminded me that everybody looks like Pete Townshend from The Who in the back of a spoon. 64th over: Australia 199-4 (Labuschagne 55 Head 49) A run, a run, my kingdom for a run! And there it is, kinda, a leg-bye, but one off the bat isn\u2019t far behind courtesy of some tip and run from Labuschagne. Nearly Brenden, his scores in order ate 0,13, 25, 43, 38 and now 54*. Just that 38 interrupting the flow. 63rd over: Australia 195-4 (Labuschagne 54 Head 47) Third maiden in a row! Labuschagne is eager to get the scoreboard moving again but Dananjaya is wise to it, mixing up his pace and flight, and bowling to his field. 62nd over: Australia 195-4 (Labuschagne 54 Head 47) First jaffa for a while and it comes out of the hand of Chameera, defeating Labuschagne with a cross-seamer that wobbles away and beyond the outside edge of the bat like a drunk failing to reassure an officer of his sobriety. Another maiden. 61st over: Australia 195-4 (Labuschagne 54 Head 47) Dananjaya into the attack and his offies from around the wicket to Head force Australia\u2019s latest vice captain onto the defensive. A maiden for the first over after drinks. 60th over: Australia 195-4 (Labuschagne 54 Head 47) The first uncontrolled shot from Labushcagne for some time, but his top-edgey pull from Chameera was never in any danger of finding a fielder. Another one for all you milestone fans, this is now Australia\u2019s biggest partnership of the summer. 59th over: Australia 193-4 (Labuschagne 53, Head 46) Milestones coming thick and fast here, the latest involves Labuschagne reaching 50 for the first time in Tests. Again it\u2019s his ability to use the depth of his crease to Perera, creating the room to free his arms and force the ball through the covers off the back foot. 58th over: Australia 187-4 (Labuschagne 48, Head 45) Century partnership! Just the second of this difficult Test summer for Australia and it\u2019s brought up by a controlled square cut. The returning Chameera offers Head width again later in the over but this time his attacking stroke is off the front foot and earns him three following some superb work on the boundary by Kumara. Much greater intent from both batsmen now against a Sri Lankan attack beginning to wilt in the Brisbane heat. 57th over: Australia 180-4 (Labuschagne 48, Head 38) More calm accumulation against Perera, the kind of easy run-scoring that could be accompanied by some smooth jazz flute while the afternoon sunlight drifts through the conservatory glass and coaxes you into a gentle slumber. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F7GAYtZS4o 56th over: Australia 176-4 (Labuschagne 45, Head 37) Lovely by Head, punching an off drive with exquisite timing to send Lakmal\u2019s delivery skipping to the boundary. This is really Australia\u2019s time to make hay. Two set batsman against the old ball on a flat pitch in clear skies. We saw yesterday runs can dry up under lights so both batsman will be keen to fill their boots. 55th over: Australia 171-4 (Labuschagne 44, Head 33) Even in my curmudgeonly state it is possible to appreciate Labuschagne\u2019s developing innings. He picks up his second three since Tea by rocking back into his crease and driving forcefully through the covers. Head matches the score a couple of balls later, meeting Perera at the pitch and timing him sweetly through long on. In his fourth Test match, Labushcagne has set a new highest score. There\u2019s no reason he shouldn\u2019t go on to turn it into a total sufficient to guarantee an Ashes tour spot. 54th over: Australia 164-4 (Labuschagne 40, Head 30) Labuschagne enters the 40s with some tip and run, the highlight of a Lakmal over containing little in the way of highlights. 53rd over: Australia 163-4 (Labuschagne 39, Head 30) Head gathers his thoughts by playing out a Perera maiden. More on the crowd issue at the BBL yesterday: 52nd over: Australia 163-4 (Labuschagne 39, Head 30) It takes Labuschagne just two balls after the Tea interval to suggest this session may be a different beast, guiding an effortless cover drive to within a whisker of the boundary. Then Travis Head should be gorrrrrn but he is gifted a life! Lakmal provokes a backfoot prod from around the wicket and the edge flies to the left of the diving keeper but still to the right of the preposterously wide first slip. The outcome is a sloppy gloved chance that leaves the bowler shaking his head and Head thanking his lucky stars. Anyway, back to the cricket. We\u2019ve had two hours of it already today and four more are to follow. I\u2019d like to be more enthusiastic in my description of events but it feels rather like a mundane weekday afternoon in the office out there; both sets of players punching their cards, going through the motions, living for the weekend Nothing on display has been particularly eye-catching. The bowling is fine, the batting is now ok after being pretty ordinary for an hour or so. It\u2019s certainly not the Herbie Hancock freestyle Test cricket going on over in the Caribbean. More\u2019s the pity. Tell me I\u2019m wrong on Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. Feel free to reminisce about McIlvanney too, if you have any favourite columns you\u2019d like to share. The wealth of material in McIlvanney\u2019s archive will stand the test of time, especially his reporting and feature writing about boxing. McIlvanney had the good fortune of working during a golden age of the sport and pieces such as this with Muhammad Ali in the afterglow of the rumble in the jungle will no doubt be revisited for decades to come. He also had one of those voices that lent authority to anything the came out of his mouth, imbuing this poetically scripted documentary of George Best with waves of pathos. Thank you very much Geoff, one of my favourite sporting wordsmiths since Hugh McIlvanney. It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of McIlvanney earlier today. He was one of the very best, perhaps even the greatest, sportswriter of his time, and he will be sorely missed. A decent session for Australia in the end, after the early wobble was stabilised. Harris and Lyon fell early, Head and Labuschagne looked as ropey as ship\u2019s rigging for an hour, but they settled and were much more composed by the end of the session. Big opportunity for them after tea to take their scores on from useful to imposing. Australia have a lead of 15 so far and should be able to make that an insurmountable one by the end of the day, but the spectre of the collapse is never quite absent. Kumara put in a heroic shift in that session and the other bowlers have had their moments. I\u2019ve got through that whole session without mercilessly mocking England\u2019s overnight total of 77, largely because an excellent West Indies bowling attack was excellent in provoking it. And that\u2019s a lovely thing to be able to write about Test cricket. Enough from me. Jonathan P!nk Howcroft will take it from here. 51st over: Australia 159-4 (Labuschagne 36, Head 29) The break doesn\u2019t deter Labuschagne from going after a few more runs. Another sweep shot against Dilruwan, another boundary. Then mixes it up by pushing on the off side for two. And working a single to keep the post-tea strike. They\u2019re home! 50th over: Australia 152-4 (Labuschagne 29, Head 29) Dual spin. Dhananjaya de Silva, who also bowls off-spin, comes on for an exploratory over. It almost produces results, too, as he hits Marnus on the pad before beating Head\u2019s outside edge. But fruit is not quite borne. 49th over: Australia 151-4 (Labuschagne 28, Head 29) Marnus using his feet now against the spinner to drive a single. Good signs. Head sweeps a couple of runs fine. The break is minutes away. Though I suppose anything is minutes away, it\u2019s just a matter of how many minutes. Things in the past are minutes away in the other direction. I need to stop overthinking this. 48th over: Australia 148-4 (Labuschagne 27, Head 27) Jeepers, another no-ball. Xavier Tras continues dominating the scorecard. It\u2019s Lakmal bowling as Kumara finally gets a break. It doesn\u2019t work out, Lakmal bowling too straight and both batsmen able to flick three to the leg side. Australia passes Sri Lanka\u2019s total at four wickets down. 47th over: Australia 140-4 (Labuschagne 23, Head 24) Two singles from Perera\u2019s over, as he gets things back under control. Abhijato Sensarma emails in. \u201cEngland picked Curran, and got bundled out for 77. The Aussies have passed that score, but look just as weary against what has been a similar bowling effort. The dismal Sri Lankan batting means the Australians will move into the lead, but this is not the greatest line-up one can produce for the Ashes. Yet, there is some hope in the form of a (comparatively) late-blooming Curran-esque player. \u201cCummins is the player who has all the ability to open the bowling in any conditions. Dare I say, he is the best Test all-rounder in the world? One can say that one series is too less a sample size to judge on, but the performances did come against India, the best side in the world. When everyone was falling apart, he held the team together (the best he could) with compact all-round performances. His purple patch with the ball has continued with a four-fer, and if his contribution with the willow helps his team gain a healthy lead, who are we to deny his stature as the world\u2019s best (unless Curran or Stokes hit a match winning century in the fourth innings in the Caribbean)?\u201d 46th over: Australia 138-4 (Labuschagne 22, Head 23) Another over for Kumara, his ninth this morning. Just the two singles from it. I hope he gets a Homer Simpson sized sandwich at the break. Decent team. The WBBL final is tomorrow. 45th over: Australia 136-4 (Labuschagne 21, Head 22) Too short and Head cuts three runs to turn over the strike. Perera around the wicket with his off-breaks to the right-hander. Labuschagne lap-sweeps nicely for two to fine leg, then plays a meatier sweep to hit the square leg boundary. Growing in confidence. The over costs 10. 44th over: Australia 126-4 (Labuschagne 14, Head 19) Another maiden for Kumara, who just keeps putting in. He nails Marnus on the pad again but the impact is too high and the appeal turned down. 43rd over: Australia 126-4 (Labuschagne 14, Head 19) They\u2019re starting to work Dilruwan Perera quite nicely now. A few singles, a three for Labuschagne. This surface looks pretty nice to bat on. 42nd over: Australia 120-4 (Labuschagne 10, Head 18) Kumara is revving up the speedo, but getting more erratic in accuracy. Wided for a bouncer, which is an achievement in first-class cricket. Jonathan Wallis has the answers I\u2019m looking for. \u201cHello Geoff. Your \u2018learning lessons is for chumps\u2019 brings us right back to your query about the shared etymology of discipline and disciple. Both words ultimately derive from the Latin verb discere \u2026 \u2018to learn\u2019. So disciple = pupil, discipline = system to aid or encourage learning. \u2018Travis\u2019 presumably derives from something else.\u201d Areas. Now, this. Another spectacular PR stumble for Cricket Australia. A white supremacist banner at a Big Bash game does not meet with the sort of response one might imagine it should. 41st over: Australia 117-4 (Labuschagne 9, Head 17) Dilruwan Perera at last, the offie who had his right thumb tenderised by Pat Cummins yesterday. He seems to be gripping the ball alright though. Marnus blocks a few, then drives three runs. Head gets an outside edge into the ground. Had some struggles against Bilal Asif in the UAE with the ball turning away from the left-hander. Drinks. 40th over: Australia 114-4 (Labuschagne 6, Head 17) The players gonna play, play, play. head is one of those. Belts Chameera through point for four, then again through cover to close the over. 39th over: Australia 105-4 (Labuschagne 5, Head 9) Kumara to Head, off the pads to midwicket for a quick single. Labuschagne was alive to that one. He\u2019s impossible not to like, a whole-hearted cricketer even though his returns have been predictably modest so far. Gets a nice opportunity from Kumara via a straight ball that\u2019s a bit too short, and easily clipped away. The batsmen run back for a third. They\u2019re working: 9 to 5. 38th over: Australia 101-4 (Labuschagne 2, Head 8) Chameera is long and lean, coming in off a long and long-striding run-up from the Vulture Street end. Very picturesque from side on. Nice action at the crease. Keeps targeting that off stump or just outside against Travis Head, until the end of the over when one slips down leg and Dickwella fumbles. Add that bye to a no-ball that Chameera bowled, and extras are by far the biggest contributors of runs on the day. The partnership is 19 and the batsmen between them have 10. \u201cIf only we had the reassuring presence of a Marsh striding out to right the ship,\u201d emails David Shepherd, not the late umpire. We were talking earlier about Australia\u2019s bowlers yesterday. This is an interesting number from our statto friends. 37th over: Australia 99-4 (Labuschagne 2, Head 8) Not to be outdone for creativity, Marnus Labuschagne stands up on his toes and plays a defensive cross-bat slog to mid-on. Yep, just what I said. Kumara is the bowler, coming on for Lakmal and changing ends. What a workhorse. 36th over: Australia 99-4 (Labuschagne 2, Head 8) Security guards stopped a bunch of spectators from bringing wooden spoons into the ground yesterday. A shame, because Travis head might benefit from some old-fashioned discipline. Sri Lanka bring in third man, knowing he was caught there twice in a Test against India. So what does Travis do? Throws his hands at a wide ball, gets a thick edge, and watches it whisper past the hands of second slip and fine for four. Does he learn his lesson? Naahhhhhh, learning lessons is for chumps. Instead he doubles down with another wild slap outside off and misses the ball completely, luckily for him. Retract my earlier suggestion: in this case the spoon would be wasted. Play your natural game, runs the mantra. Just a shame for your teammates if your natural game is \u2018park slogger with a Guy Pearce memory problem\u2019. 35th over: Australia 95-4 (Labuschagne 2, Head 4) Lakmal draws a stuttering defensive shot from Labuschagne, and nearly draws the edge. Footwork hesitant. Very upright bat in the backlift, Labuschagne, and next he plays the pleave, off the full face by accident, running down into the gully on the bounce. Swipes across his front pad next to repel a ball to midwicket. Battling hard but yet to look convincing. Nerves, heat, warring emotions. Stabs down on a ball and it skews to gully again. Survives. Grant Moss emails in. \u201cSadly Harris again shows he doesn\u2019t yet have the temperament at the top of the order. The ball before he needlessly went out his footwork was largely absent, his front foot being about 1/2 metre from where his bat hit the ball. Top order batting still a problem - the bowlers must be quite disheartened.\u201d They will be if they\u2019re out there bowling again today. Drinks break, and Kumara has a rest. He\u2019s been working hard, as the CricViz analysts can affirm. 34th over: Australia 95-4 (Labuschagne 2, Head 4) Chameera takes up the attack, and Labuschagne finally opens his account with two runs flicked square. Then there\u2019s a brain-fade from Mendis, after the ball comes off the batsman\u2019s thigh pad to slip. Despite having never left his crease, Mendis at slip decides to throw down Labuschagne\u2019s stumps. And misses. And concedes three more extras down the ground. 33rd over: Australia 90-4 (Labuschagne 0, Head 4) Lakmal keeps easing them down outside Head\u2019s off stump, trying to get him to play. But eventually the length slips back too far. Head has played any number of bad cut shots this summer, but that was a perfect one. There was enough width, just. And he went at it circumspectly, placing it down and into the gap behind point to race for four. 32nd over: Australia 86-4 (Labuschagne 0, Head 0) Sensible occupation stuff from Labuschagne, who covers his stumps and watchfully sees out Kumara\u2019s over. Just got another email, and this one\u2019s close to my heart. Sending a hello and a huge hug out to Warren Smith, an old friend I haven\u2019t seen in far too long. He\u2019s been in the wars the last few years with a bad motorbike crash and then a cancer diagnosis, and has been doing it very tough. But he says it\u2019s been cheering him up to read the OBO the last few months, and for that I\u2019m glad. Lots of love your way, Waz. 31st over: Australia 86-4 (Labuschagne 0, Head 0) \u201cDiscipline, discipline, discipline,\u201d Head is muttering to himself, in my imagination. He sees out an over from Lakmal without trying to score. I just realised that \u2018discipline\u2019 and \u2018disciple\u2019 share the same root: something about adherence to a cause, I\u2019d guess. Anyone got any insights on that etymology? 30th over: Australia 86-4 (Labuschagne 0, Head 0) Kumara is getting feisty. A chunky, barrel-chested type, he follows through all the way up to Labuschagne after a close leave. Kumara nails Marnus on the front pad and launches into a huge appeal but the umpire says no. And that\u2019s what happens when you make stupid reviews: you get gun-shy about reviewing closer ones. Chandimal keeps his card in his pocket. Marnus was lunging at the ball and it struck him just below the knee roll, probably just outside the line. Replays confirm that was the case. Might have been clipping the bails but impact was outside. 29th over: Australia 86-4 (Labuschagne 0, Head 0) Extras continue to dominate the scoring, as Lakmal follows the wicket of Lyon with a bouncer at Head that evades the wicketkeeper. Both batsmen are on nought. \u201cGlad you\u2019ve managed to enjoy our delightful ferries getting to the Gabba,\u201d emails Murray Henman. \u201cWas at the game yesterday and was disappointed to see the rather small crowd. Any thoughts as to why such a low attendance? Because it\u2019s not the first test of the summer?\u201d To be honest, I\u2019m not sure it was that small. Just shy of 14,000. Which doesn\u2019t look great, but the only Tests I\u2019ve been to at the Gabba that did look great have been Ashes Tests. Otherwise the numbers are pretty paltry, or at least look paltry in such a big ground. Numbers look very thin again today. Generally you\u2019d expect bigger crowds on weekends than weekdays, though. Thanks for proving my point, Sri Lanka. A few balls after burning that review, Lyon spars at a wide ball that required no sparring, and gives a low catch to slip. The third umpire has 24 looks at it for some reason, but the ball is going clearly into the hands of Kusal Mendis. Four down. 28th over: Australia 82-3 (Lyon 1, Labuschagne 0) Sri Lanka use a review, but it\u2019s a shocker: Kumara\u2019s full swinging ball absolutely beat Lyon\u2019s bat and pinned him on the ankle, but it had swung so far that the impact was outside the line of the right-hander\u2019s leg stump, never mind his off stump. Excited, Sri Lanka. This after another ball had hit his leg and ricocheted for four leg byes. I mean, it was a bad review to begin with, but why would you use a review against the nightwatchman? 27th over: Australia 77-3 (Lyon 1, Labuschagne 0) The nightwatchman has outlasted his senior partner. Well well. Marnus Labuschagne is the next to the crease. Lyon opens his account with a simple press into the covers, after having a few sighters against Suranga Lakmal. That takes Australia to 77, meaning they\u2019ve at least matched England\u2019s overnight score. 26th over: Australia 76-3 (Lyon 0) Marcus Harris, what have you done. That\u2019s the ugliest dismissal of a career that has already involved too many surrenders to opposing bowlers. Right after driving four through cover, Harris gets a horrible miscued delivery from Kumara, way outside off stump and very wide. Harris can\u2019t help throwing his hands at it, and meets it shoulder-high but only with the toe of the bat. It wobbles to backward point like a car with four slashed tyres. But what I\u2019m really interested in is Nathan Lyon \u2013 with the bat. Australia\u2019s greatest off-spinner is also Australia\u2019s most improved batsman in the last year or so, for my money. He\u2019s played some gems down the order, both entertaining and adding important runs. Now his nightwatchman work has scored him a job in the top order, for today. Who knows, he could ton up and make No4 his own. Also Marcus Harris is there, who has hit the 70s a couple of times in his short Test career but never gone on. Big chance today. It was a cheerful sort of day for Australia on day one, with Jhye Richardson making an excellent start to Test cricket. He took 3 for 26 from 14 overs, but more importantly he looked the goods in terms of bowling a length that would have hit the top of the stumps, challenging the batsmen, and knocking them over with good balls rather than lucky ones. It was impressive. Pat Cummins was also very consistent with an attacking length in his 4 for 39, while Mitchell Starc brought up his 200th and 201st wickets with 2 for 51, and Nathan Lyon looked great on a first-day pitch for 1 for 38. If you\u2019re wondering, it\u2019s still approximately one millionty degrees everywhere around Australia except Brisbane where it\u2019s 32 and Darwin where it\u2019s 26. Go figure. I\u2019m on a boat! I\u2019m on a boat! Everybody look at me cos I\u2019m sailing on a boat. Probably the best thing about Brisbane is that you can take a boat to work. Not everyone loves everything about this city but the boat thing is a win. You can jump on the river ferry from way upstream or downstream and cruise into the city, with no traffic jams or fumes or sudden braking or near misses, watching the riverbanks go by. One end of the trip especially is on some real Jurassic Park tip, all kinds of cliffs and vines and sources of prehistoric DNA. Then once you\u2019ve got off the fast ferry at North Quay, you get one of the cute and shabby little City Hoppers for free, with their slatted wooden deckboards and their red paint, and you jump to the far bank to the Maritime Museum stop and then walk up to the Gabba. Breezes and sunshine and water lapping. It\u2019s way better than a tram. Also, hello! Geoff Lemon with you to start the day, Jonathan Pleasantries Howcroft for the middle session, then Adam Collins to drive the beast home. As always, you can get in touch with us via our respective email addresses and Twitter handles which should be visible and linked somewhere near the byline box depending on what sort of device and program you\u2019re using to access our wares. For me, those contact details are geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or @GeoffLemonSport. Today is: Australia\u2019s day. Not Australia Day, which a few nongs who are very short of ideas are trying to make a political wedge issue ahead of our election. Australia\u2019s day, to try to make the Test runs that have so far eluded them this summer. They won\u2019t get many better chances. A modest Sri Lankan attack, a pitch that will probably be at its best for batting on days two and three, a pink ball that is no longer new after its exertions last night, and a fairly clear and very bright, warm, sunny Brisbane day. Make hay while the proverbial. Australia reached stumps at 72 for 2, exactly halfway to Sri Lanka\u2019s paltry first innings of 144. And now comes the chance for the home side\u2019s green middle order to bank some scores and give themselves some confidence and sense of belonging ahead of Australia\u2019s next Test assignment, which just happens to be the Ashes in August.",

The Americans will face Panama in Glendale then Costa Rica on 2 February in San Jose in a pair of friendlies. Stiffer and more significant tests await, including the Concacaf Gold Cup in June and the March friendly with Chile that was announced on Thursday. While not a critical period for a programme in rebuild mode after that notorious night at Ato Boldon Stadium and before the start of 2022 World Cup qualifying, Berhalter\u2019s beginning is at least a long-awaited moment; a milestone on the road to recovery after the 2-1 defeat in October 2017 that saw the US fail to reach the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986. Born in New Jersey, the former defender made 44 appearances for the US. At club level he played for Zwolle, Sparta Rotterdam and Cambuur in the Netherlands, Crystal Palace in England, Energie Cottbus and 1860 Munich in Germany and the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer, then managed the Swedish side, Hammarby, for 19 months. The 45-year-old was confirmed in December after the New York Red Bulls ejected his Columbus Crew side from the MLS playoffs. It was the Crew\u2019s fourth postseason in five years under Berhalter. Despite a paltry budget and turbulence off the pitch as ownership made like tech industry millennials and tried to move to Austin, Berhalter built a solid side that worked hard and employed a possession-based approach that laid a foundation for the gifted playmaker, Federico Higuain, to express himself eloquently. After relying on Higuain, Berhalter again finds himself in charge of a team that is deeply dependent on one player for assists and goals: the new Chelsea signing, Christian Pulisic. The 20-year-old won\u2019t be suiting up in the Phoenix suburbs; as usual, the Europe-based set were not called into the January camp.

      "bodyText": "As all of Australia suffered through a brutal heatwave last week, locals in the outback New South Wales towns of Walgett and Lightning Ridge were better prepared than most. Almost every day in summer is 40C or above here. Usually, the rivers provide relief: swimming in cool water, fishing for golden perch or Murray cod or seeking the solace of a big sleepy red gum that lines the banks. But this year there are no rivers. With the mercury in the mid-40s, the Narran, the Namoi and the Barwon \u2013 all tributaries of the vast Murray-Darling river system \u2013 are dry, or reduced to a series of green, stagnant weir pools. The mighty red gums, roots exposed, are hanging on for dear life. Heritage-protected lakes and wetlands are empty, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish. Australia has endured a searing summer of drought and extreme heat. Hundreds of feral animals have died of thirst or faced culling as they encroached on properties in search of water. All-time temperature records have been broken in South Australia, with Adelaide reaching 46.6C, while Melbourne had its hottest day since the catastrophic 2009 bushfires, and more fires swept through Tasmania. The Murray-Darling basin, which stretches from Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria before emptying into the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, should be the lifeblood of the continent in such times. But things have gone very wrong on the rivers. At Menindee, near Broken Hill, thousands of fish were found dead on 6 January, including giant Murray cod up to 40 years old. Government ministers blamed the drought that set in across eastern Australia from April 2017. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it \u201cjust hasn\u2019t rained\u201d. \u201cWe are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when it rains, it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying \u2018what are we going to do with all the water?\u2019 That\u2019s Australia.\u201d But the huge fish kill drew the nation\u2019s attention to the wider crisis on the Murray-Darling, which has been the subject of political wrangling between farmers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups for decades. While irrigation has expanded in some of Australia\u2019s driest regions, the Darling and its tributaries have been reduced to a series of muddy pools.

Salt levels became dangerously high, jeopardising Adelaide\u2019s water supply, as well as internationally recognised wetlands. Governments were forced to act and in 2007, after years of difficult negotiations, the states and the commonwealth agreed to a plan that would licence water extraction and buy back a share of water for the environment. This water is owned by the Commonwealth and is released periodically to mimic nature and, in theory, keep the rivers healthy. But from the outset, the plan owed more to political compromise than science. \u201cThe best available science assembled for the guide to the the Basin Plan said that we needed 3,200GL to 7,600GL for the environment,\u201d said Jamie Pittock, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists.

      "bodyText": "The parents of a teenager who died after having an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette have welcomed a government consultation on food labelling laws and called for the most stringent rules to be applied. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, collapsed on a British Airways flight from London to Nice in July 2016 after eating an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette. She died from a reaction to sesame in the baguette, an ingredient that was not on the label. The government launched the consultation after her death and is looking to toughen the rules on labelling of foods such as sandwiches and salads that are made, packaged and sold in-store. These foods are not currently required to carry labels. The consultation puts forward four proposals for how allergy advice is provided in future: promoting \u201cbest practice around communicating allergen information to consumers\u201d, \u201cask the staff\u201d labels, allergen-only labelling, or full ingredient listing. Natasha\u2019s parents, Tanya and Nadim, said they wanted the government to adopt the most stringent labelling laws. \u201cWe\u2019re really gunning for the top option, which is full labelling with allergens and ingredients,\u201d Tanya told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThe first two options are very soft and really aren\u2019t options in our mind at all. We\u2019re hopeful that the food industry is really behind this and we feel like it is, as a whole, and change has to happen.\u201d Nadim said: \u201cI think every life, particularly of a child, and those of us who are parents know, is the most precious thing on the planet. There\u2019s nothing more important. And with the death of our child \u2026 as parents, it\u2019s so important that something good comes out of this incredible tragedy. \u201cIt\u2019s vital action is taken that remedies the situation to prevent this kind of tragedy happening to other people.\u201d The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the consultation was designed to give the UK\u2019s 2 million people with food allergies greater confidence in the safety of their food. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said: \u201cNatasha\u2019s parents have suffered a terrible loss, and I want to pay tribute to Nadim and Tanya for their inspirational work to deliver Natasha\u2019s law. We want to ensure that labels are clearer and that the rules for businesses are more consistent, so that allergy sufferers in this country can have confidence in the safety of their food. \u201cMany businesses are already bringing changes on board independently, and in the meantime they should continue doing all they can to give consumers the information they need.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A lot of people can\u2019t believe what I do for a living. I don\u2019t fit the profile. I\u2019m 5ft 7in and weigh 120 pounds. But I can eat 48 slices of pumpkin pie in 10 minutes and get paid for it.</p> <p>I stumbled into competitive eating. In 2012, I was working in a bar in Nebraska and its restaurant had a challenge: if you ate its 5lb (2.2kg) hamburger, which is about the diameter of a soccer ball, you got it for free. Someone bet me I couldn\u2019t do it, so I just ate it. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal but everyone else did. I undertook a couple of similar challenges. There was a burger joint down the road and I ended up taking its record. Then they put me in a face-off with the previous record-holder. After that, things snowballed.</p> <p>At first, I only wanted to do challenges, not contests where you\u2019re facing all these people and trying to win money. I have four kids, and I was too busy. But in 2013, I was invited to a competition in Connecticut. I won two contests back-to-back and earned more in four minutes than I could make in two weeks at work. I quit my job after that.</p> <p>Competitive eating is becoming more and more popular. There are probably about 100 professionals. Prize money varies greatly, and there are very few people who can earn all their income from doing this \u2013 maybe two or three in the US.</p> <p>One of my earliest challenges was eating a 72oz (2kg) steak. That\u2019s about the size of a loaf of bread. I ate it in under three minutes, more than halving the record. I\u2019ve also eaten 119 dumplings in two minutes. I just swallowed them whole \u2013 there was no time for chewing. And I got a Guinness World Record for eating 12lbs (5kg) of pudding in three minutes. That\u2019s my only Guinness record, because I never turn them in officially; I don\u2019t need to appear in a book.</p> <p>I\u2019ve won Wing Bowl three times \u2013 a contest to see who can eat the most chicken wings in half an hour. It\u2019s held in a sports arena in Philadelphia on the Friday of Super Bowl weekend, in front of 20,000 people, and all the crowd are drunk. In 2018 my prize was $5,000 and a Hyundai Sonata. I hold its record for eating 501 chicken wings in 30 minutes. That\u2019s probably my proudest achievement.</p> <p>You can train for this, though. For instance, you can drink a lot of water to stretch your stomach. The after-effects of a contest depend on how much you eat. If I eat 5lbs or 10lbs of something, I\u2019ll be fine \u2013 I\u2019ll even go for a meal afterwards. But if I eat 25lbs of something, my body\u2019s going to kick it out. I also go through spurts of losing weight when I\u2019m sick of eating. It can become a chore.</p> <p>I heard of a kale-eating contest once, but 99% of what we eat in competitions is junk. No competitive eater eats like this every day. At home, I don\u2019t buy a lot of junk food, and there\u2019s always a lot of fruit and vegetables at every meal. Sometimes, I\u2019ll grab a cup of coffee and might not have time for lunch.</p> <p>We\u2019re in the off-season now because most contests are held outdoors. In the summer, I travel most weekends, and I\u2019ve met so many cool people. There\u2019s no typical eater; we have teachers, military personnel, people who work in restaurants. I could do up to 20-25 contests a year, and I make substantially more than I did in my bartending job \u2013 above an average US wage.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve never gloated \u2013 once you start saying you\u2019re the best, that\u2019s the day you\u2019re going to lose. I don\u2019t go into a contest telling anybody who I am, or trash-talking. I\u2019m quiet. Sometimes the other competitors get mad and complain when I beat them: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, why did you invite a professional?\u201d I\u2019ve heard it all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/18/experience-i-talked-a-man-down-from-a-bridge\">Experience: I talked a man down from a bridge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My kids know what I do for a living, but I don\u2019t flaunt it in front of them, and they don\u2019t come to the contests. It\u2019s not a nice world to be in. People are critical of what we do, or make rude comments. They think we\u2019re wasteful. But if you\u2019ve ever overeaten at Thanksgiving, or gone to a buffet and eaten more than you should, you\u2019ve done the same thing \u2013 only I\u2019m getting paid.</p> <p>As told to Nige Tassell.</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have an experience to share?

But I can eat 48 slices of pumpkin pie in 10 minutes and get paid for it. I stumbled into competitive eating. In 2012, I was working in a bar in Nebraska and its restaurant had a challenge: if you ate its 5lb (2.2kg) hamburger, which is about the diameter of a soccer ball, you got it for free. Someone bet me I couldn\u2019t do it, so I just ate it. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal but everyone else did. I undertook a couple of similar challenges. There was a burger joint down the road and I ended up taking its record. Then they put me in a face-off with the previous record-holder. After that, things snowballed. At first, I only wanted to do challenges, not contests where you\u2019re facing all these people and trying to win money. I have four kids, and I was too busy. But in 2013, I was invited to a competition in Connecticut. I won two contests back-to-back and earned more in four minutes than I could make in two weeks at work. I quit my job after that. Competitive eating is becoming more and more popular. There are probably about 100 professionals. Prize money varies greatly, and there are very few people who can earn all their income from doing this \u2013 maybe two or three in the US. One of my earliest challenges was eating a 72oz (2kg) steak. That\u2019s about the size of a loaf of bread. I ate it in under three minutes, more than halving the record. I\u2019ve also eaten 119 dumplings in two minutes. I just swallowed them whole \u2013 there was no time for chewing. And I got a Guinness World Record for eating 12lbs (5kg) of pudding in three minutes. That\u2019s my only Guinness record, because I never turn them in officially; I don\u2019t need to appear in a book. I\u2019ve won Wing Bowl three times \u2013 a contest to see who can eat the most chicken wings in half an hour. It\u2019s held in a sports arena in Philadelphia on the Friday of Super Bowl weekend, in front of 20,000 people, and all the crowd are drunk. In 2018 my prize was $5,000 and a Hyundai Sonata. I hold its record for eating 501 chicken wings in 30 minutes. That\u2019s probably my proudest achievement. You can train for this, though. For instance, you can drink a lot of water to stretch your stomach. The after-effects of a contest depend on how much you eat. If I eat 5lbs or 10lbs of something, I\u2019ll be fine \u2013 I\u2019ll even go for a meal afterwards. But if I eat 25lbs of something, my body\u2019s going to kick it out. I also go through spurts of losing weight when I\u2019m sick of eating. It can become a chore. I heard of a kale-eating contest once, but 99% of what we eat in competitions is junk. No competitive eater eats like this every day. At home, I don\u2019t buy a lot of junk food, and there\u2019s always a lot of fruit and vegetables at every meal. Sometimes, I\u2019ll grab a cup of coffee and might not have time for lunch. We\u2019re in the off-season now because most contests are held outdoors. In the summer, I travel most weekends, and I\u2019ve met so many cool people. There\u2019s no typical eater; we have teachers, military personnel, people who work in restaurants. I could do up to 20-25 contests a year, and I make substantially more than I did in my bartending job \u2013 above an average US wage. But I\u2019ve never gloated \u2013 once you start saying you\u2019re the best, that\u2019s the day you\u2019re going to lose. I don\u2019t go into a contest telling anybody who I am, or trash-talking. I\u2019m quiet. Sometimes the other competitors get mad and complain when I beat them: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, why did you invite a professional?\u201d I\u2019ve heard it all. My kids know what I do for a living, but I don\u2019t flaunt it in front of them, and they don\u2019t come to the contests. It\u2019s not a nice world to be in. People are critical of what we do, or make rude comments. They think we\u2019re wasteful. But if you\u2019ve ever overeaten at Thanksgiving, or gone to a buffet and eaten more than you should, you\u2019ve done the same thing \u2013 only I\u2019m getting paid.

      "body": "<p>Years back, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/25/cannes2006.cannesfilmfestival5\">Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marie Antoinette</a>, a luscious, insouciant, royal-friendly if not entirely pro-royal biopic had its press screening at Cannes, it was booed. This puzzled those of us seduced by the spectacle, and research revealed that many objected to the film because it painted the French monarch in too sympathetic a light. No screen time had been spared to show the plight of ordinary people, those who suffered and starved during Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette\u2019s reign. For shame!</p> <p>Writer-director Pierre Schoeller\u2019s panoramic-scaled cinematic history lesson One Nation, One King (Un Peuple et Son Roi) might have been the kind of supposedly inclusive film that Marie Antoinette haters would have preferred. Every substratum of society gets some representation, from the starving denizens of Paris, up through the debaters in the National Assembly, on to the king (Laurent Lafitte) and queen (Ma\u00eblia Gentil), seen at key moments as they are turfed out of Versailles and later sent to the guillotine. That said, rather more time is spent with humbler folk, such as glass-blowing revolutionary Uncle (Olivier Gourmet), a feisty washerwoman (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) named Fran\u00e7oise, and a reformed chicken thief and arthouse stud muffin, Basile (Gaspard Ulliel), with whom Fran\u00e7oise falls in love. Just for <em>merde</em> and giggles, Schoeller throws in big stars Louis Garrel as Robespierre and Denis Lavant as a splendidly seedy Marat, enhancing an already stellar cast with long, declamatory speeches to recite.</p> <p>Sadly, the whole assemblage is bit of a bum-numbing bore, both overwritten and sketchy at the same time, as it strains to namecheck key historical moments and distribute attention equally in such a way that none of the characters develop more than half a dimension. That said, it does look handsome, with a generous budget spent on period details, costumes and extras, and not a euro spared in the lighting budget so everyone is backlit and beautiful, no matter how poor or scruffy they\u2019re supposed to be.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E5wFOVtxHk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0E5wFOVtxHk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E5wFOVtxHk\">One Nation, One King official trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Years back, when Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marie Antoinette, a luscious, insouciant, royal-friendly if not entirely pro-royal biopic had its press screening at Cannes, it was booed. This puzzled those of us seduced by the spectacle, and research revealed that many objected to the film because it painted the French monarch in too sympathetic a light. No screen time had been spared to show the plight of ordinary people, those who suffered and starved during Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette\u2019s reign. For shame! Writer-director Pierre Schoeller\u2019s panoramic-scaled cinematic history lesson One Nation, One King (Un Peuple et Son Roi) might have been the kind of supposedly inclusive film that Marie Antoinette haters would have preferred. Every substratum of society gets some representation, from the starving denizens of Paris, up through the debaters in the National Assembly, on to the king (Laurent Lafitte) and queen (Ma\u00eblia Gentil), seen at key moments as they are turfed out of Versailles and later sent to the guillotine. That said, rather more time is spent with humbler folk, such as glass-blowing revolutionary Uncle (Olivier Gourmet), a feisty washerwoman (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) named Fran\u00e7oise, and a reformed chicken thief and arthouse stud muffin, Basile (Gaspard Ulliel), with whom Fran\u00e7oise falls in love. Just for merde and giggles, Schoeller throws in big stars Louis Garrel as Robespierre and Denis Lavant as a splendidly seedy Marat, enhancing an already stellar cast with long, declamatory speeches to recite. Sadly, the whole assemblage is bit of a bum-numbing bore, both overwritten and sketchy at the same time, as it strains to namecheck key historical moments and distribute attention equally in such a way that none of the characters develop more than half a dimension. That said, it does look handsome, with a generous budget spent on period details, costumes and extras, and not a euro spared in the lighting budget so everyone is backlit and beautiful, no matter how poor or scruffy they\u2019re supposed to be.",

      "body": "<p>The hero of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/12/the-mule-review-clint-eastwoods-drug-running-drama-is-a-slow-misfire\" title=\"\">The Mule</a> is Earl Stone, a horticulturist who earns extra cash ferrying drugs across the US. He is a popular fellow, and there are no fewer than three scenes in the film in which he is applauded by large and admiring crowds. Though aged 90, he has two separate threesomes in the course of the film, both with women in their 20s who are eager to get their hands on him. (\u201cIt\u2019s my turn!\u201d says one impatiently). Earl may crack a joke about Viagra in the film\u2019s opening minutes, but he requires no chemical boost. And it is not enough that he should get it on with two women at once; he is also spied on from across the street by a younger man, mystified and perhaps a touch envious about the old timer\u2019s allure.</p> <p>It is encouraging to find a stereotype-busting role like this on the screen, and good to see that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/03/clint-eastwood-what-watching-40-films-box-set-taught-me\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood</a> has the vim to play it. But that joy can only be compromised by the knowledge that Eastwood also cast the part, and called the shots behind the camera. All those closeups of himself looking incorrigible, or lapping up the adoration of others, or getting down to business with women young enough to be his great-granddaughters \u2013 these were staged and approved by him. Perhaps he even asked for extra takes. Better safe than sorry.</p> <p>Eastwood is no slouch when it comes to self-worship, though in his case it usually has a moral rather than a sexual dimension; in films such as Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, he performs self-sacrificial acts for the betterment of mankind, or to atone for his own sins. At least when he made his directorial debut in 1971 with <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/play-misty-for-me-1971\" title=\"\">Play Misty for Me</a>, he was to some extent interrogating male narcissism as much as he was wallowing in it. In that thriller about a gadabout DJ who is stalked by a female fan, there is the sense that Eastwood\u2019s character is the architect of his own undoing, paying the price for his cavalier treatment of women. Fast forward nearly half a century and analysis has been replaced by analgesia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f700aeee2c2b3e4424733716070bfeb392a415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f700aeee2c2b3e4424733716070bfeb392a415/0_0_5851_3510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Octogenarian pulling power?

There can have been little reason for the Scrubs star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/live/2014/sep/15/zach-braff-webchat-wish-i-was-here\" title=\"\">Zach Braff</a> to have directed himself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/fridayreview/story/0,,1370064,00.html\" title=\"\">Garden State</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/18/wish-i-was-here-review-zach-braff-manic-pixie-dream\" title=\"\">Wish I Was Here</a> other than to promote Brand Braff: quirky, sensitive, indie-loving. Overstretching is another risk, as Kenneth Branagh proved when he directed himself in six films over the course of just seven years, some of them so bad that their titles (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101669/\" title=\"\">Dead Again</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105130/\" title=\"\">Peter\u2019s Friends</a>) are never mentioned on film sets for fear they will summon a Macbeth-style curse.</p> <p>But vanity need not make an endeavour worthless. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bradley-cooper\" title=\"\">Bradley Cooper</a>, who plays an FBI agent in The Mule, directed himself last year as a fading country-rock singer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/31/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper\" title=\"\">A Star Is Born</a>, he gave us vain without the pain. As one of the co-writers of this remake, Cooper had the opportunity to shift the balance of the story away from its usual focus on male self-destruction and to give the female lead a bigger slice of the pie. It was one he chose to resist. With Cooper in charge behind the camera, as well as hogging the meaty scenes in front of it, this was vanity cinema at its baldest. Fortunately it\u2019s no hardship watching him: file Cooper in the vain-but-worth-it category alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/warren-beatty\" title=\"\">Warren Beatty</a> directing his own performances in Heaven Can Wait and Reds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b4703d4712597f79624dc6391781e28561c5f48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b4703d4712597f79624dc6391781e28561c5f48/0_0_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scene-stealer \u2026 Bradley Cooper with Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scene-stealer \u2026 Bradley Cooper with Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least Cooper wasn\u2019t deluded. When Kevin Spacey first proposed making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1359576,00.html\" title=\"\">Beyond the Sea</a>, a film about the singer Bobby Darin, he was 32 \u2013 five years younger than Darin was when he died, and comfortably within range of playing the part. By the time Spacey found financing for the project, he was 45. A wise man would have known that the years had overtaken him, and that he should probably find someone else to tackle the crooner\u2019s late teens and 20s, but Spacey was not that man. Beyond the Sea tries to pre-empt such criticisms by having the older Darin debate the story\u2019s veracity with his childhood self, but this technique comes across as precisely what it is: the equivalent of slapping a sticking-plaster on a compound fracture.</p> <p>Plenty of actor-directors make the mistake of assuming themselves to be positively adorable. Sylvester Stallone directed parts two, three, four and six of his own Rocky series, amplifying his sentimental fondness for the title character each time. Even the one film that he directed that didn\u2019t have a role for him \u2013 his pitiful Saturday Night Fever sequel <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086361/\" title=\"\">Staying Alive</a> \u2013 still included a tell-tale flash of egotism. Stallone gives himself a Hitchcock-style walk-on part in the movie, which might have been harmless enough had he not directed its star, John Travolta, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=e-QVifJ_ufU\" title=\"\">to perform a disbelieving double-take as he strolled past</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"430928bdaf9845b263aabcb1825b5c7cf3182d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/430928bdaf9845b263aabcb1825b5c7cf3182d73/261_0_4321_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Self-regarding \u2026 Vincent Gallo in The Brown Bunny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-regarding \u2026 Vincent Gallo in The Brown Bunny, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are numerous ways in which an actor-director can share with the world his high opinion of himself but you have to admire the directness of Vincent Gallo. It was ironic that the actor-writer-director was mocked for his film The Brown Bunny, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/chloe-sevigny-now-total-disdain-directors\" title=\"\">for the moment in which he is fellated on-screen by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a>, when anyone who has watched the whole movie will know that this scene has a nasty sting in the tail: the encounter transpires to be pure fantasy<strong>,</strong> the product of Gallo\u2019s character\u2019s warped guilt over failing to save Sevigny from an ugly death. Far more deserving of ridicule is the scene in his directorial debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/30/features.magazine\" title=\"\">Buffalo 66</a>, in which he is shown peeing at a urinal while the man next to him marvels at Gallo\u2019s equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s so <em>big</em>!\u201d the man says, as though it would have been impolite to keep this view to himself. Difficult to look at this scene, written and directed by its star, without thinking: What a dick.</p> <p>There is no shortage of contenders for the title of most self-regarding actor-director in cinema: George Clooney in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/13/georgeclooney.comedy\" title=\"\">Leatherheads</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/19/stuart-heritage-meets-van-damme-its-like-weve-known-each-other-for-two-months\" title=\"\">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a> in The Quest, Steven Seagal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/11/steven-seagal-60-best-film-roles\" title=\"\">On Deadly Ground</a>, Prince in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092133/\" title=\"\">Under the Cherry Moon</a>. But it takes a special kind of vanity to combine narcissism and prestige and it is for that reason that no one can hold a candle to Kevin Costner, even 29 years after his performance in his own <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/\" title=\"\">Dances With Wolves</a> as a Union soldier who discovers a kinship with the Sioux. There may ostensibly be an on-screen love story between the hero and a Sioux woman (Mary McDonnell), but the most convincing romance is the one between director and star, Costner and Costner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd0d6d108769b47f5a223f77ccb6bda1a75c8255\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0d6d108769b47f5a223f77ccb6bda1a75c8255/0_200_1727_1036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blinded \u2026 Kevin Costner in The Postman, 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blinded \u2026 Kevin Costner in The Postman, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is nothing quite like it. Except, perhaps, Costner\u2019s followup, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119925/\" title=\"\">The Postman</a>, which repeated all the same tricks as Dances With Wolves to zero acclaim. In this futuristic drama, set at a time when democracy has collapsed in America and the land is ruled by thugs, Costner chances upon an old mail van and reinstates the country\u2019s postal service. The actor does his humble messiah routine from Dances With Wolves, while several hundred extras send looks of awestruck wonder in his direction. The effect suggests a man contemplating himself in a mirror for three hours.</p> <p>If one element is conspicuous by its absence from this survey, it is women.

      "bodyText": "The hero of The Mule is Earl Stone, a horticulturist who earns extra cash ferrying drugs across the US. He is a popular fellow, and there are no fewer than three scenes in the film in which he is applauded by large and admiring crowds. Though aged 90, he has two separate threesomes in the course of the film, both with women in their 20s who are eager to get their hands on him. (\u201cIt\u2019s my turn!\u201d says one impatiently). Earl may crack a joke about Viagra in the film\u2019s opening minutes, but he requires no chemical boost. And it is not enough that he should get it on with two women at once; he is also spied on from across the street by a younger man, mystified and perhaps a touch envious about the old timer\u2019s allure. It is encouraging to find a stereotype-busting role like this on the screen, and good to see that Clint Eastwood has the vim to play it. But that joy can only be compromised by the knowledge that Eastwood also cast the part, and called the shots behind the camera. All those closeups of himself looking incorrigible, or lapping up the adoration of others, or getting down to business with women young enough to be his great-granddaughters \u2013 these were staged and approved by him. Perhaps he even asked for extra takes. Better safe than sorry. Eastwood is no slouch when it comes to self-worship, though in his case it usually has a moral rather than a sexual dimension; in films such as Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, he performs self-sacrificial acts for the betterment of mankind, or to atone for his own sins. At least when he made his directorial debut in 1971 with Play Misty for Me, he was to some extent interrogating male narcissism as much as he was wallowing in it. In that thriller about a gadabout DJ who is stalked by a female fan, there is the sense that Eastwood\u2019s character is the architect of his own undoing, paying the price for his cavalier treatment of women. Fast forward nearly half a century and analysis has been replaced by analgesia. Whenever an actor directs his own performance (and it is almost invariably a \u201che\u201d), there is the risk that a film will morph into a vanity project. There can have been little reason for the Scrubs star Zach Braff to have directed himself in Garden State and Wish I Was Here other than to promote Brand Braff: quirky, sensitive, indie-loving. Overstretching is another risk, as Kenneth Branagh proved when he directed himself in six films over the course of just seven years, some of them so bad that their titles (Dead Again, Peter\u2019s Friends) are never mentioned on film sets for fear they will summon a Macbeth-style curse. But vanity need not make an endeavour worthless. When Bradley Cooper, who plays an FBI agent in The Mule, directed himself last year as a fading country-rock singer in A Star Is Born, he gave us vain without the pain. As one of the co-writers of this remake, Cooper had the opportunity to shift the balance of the story away from its usual focus on male self-destruction and to give the female lead a bigger slice of the pie. It was one he chose to resist. With Cooper in charge behind the camera, as well as hogging the meaty scenes in front of it, this was vanity cinema at its baldest. Fortunately it\u2019s no hardship watching him: file Cooper in the vain-but-worth-it category alongside Warren Beatty directing his own performances in Heaven Can Wait and Reds. At least Cooper wasn\u2019t deluded. When Kevin Spacey first proposed making Beyond the Sea, a film about the singer Bobby Darin, he was 32 \u2013 five years younger than Darin was when he died, and comfortably within range of playing the part. By the time Spacey found financing for the project, he was 45. A wise man would have known that the years had overtaken him, and that he should probably find someone else to tackle the crooner\u2019s late teens and 20s, but Spacey was not that man. Beyond the Sea tries to pre-empt such criticisms by having the older Darin debate the story\u2019s veracity with his childhood self, but this technique comes across as precisely what it is: the equivalent of slapping a sticking-plaster on a compound fracture. Plenty of actor-directors make the mistake of assuming themselves to be positively adorable. Sylvester Stallone directed parts two, three, four and six of his own Rocky series, amplifying his sentimental fondness for the title character each time. Even the one film that he directed that didn\u2019t have a role for him \u2013 his pitiful Saturday Night Fever sequel Staying Alive \u2013 still included a tell-tale flash of egotism. Stallone gives himself a Hitchcock-style walk-on part in the movie, which might have been harmless enough had he not directed its star, John Travolta, to perform a disbelieving double-take as he strolled past. There are numerous ways in which an actor-director can share with the world his high opinion of himself but you have to admire the directness of Vincent Gallo. It was ironic that the actor-writer-director was mocked for his film The Brown Bunny, and for the moment in which he is fellated on-screen by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, when anyone who has watched the whole movie will know that this scene has a nasty sting in the tail: the encounter transpires to be pure fantasy, the product of Gallo\u2019s character\u2019s warped guilt over failing to save Sevigny from an ugly death. Far more deserving of ridicule is the scene in his directorial debut Buffalo 66, in which he is shown peeing at a urinal while the man next to him marvels at Gallo\u2019s equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s so big!\u201d the man says, as though it would have been impolite to keep this view to himself. Difficult to look at this scene, written and directed by its star, without thinking: What a dick. There is no shortage of contenders for the title of most self-regarding actor-director in cinema: George Clooney in Leatherheads, Jean-Claude Van Damme in The Quest, Steven Seagal in On Deadly Ground, Prince in Under the Cherry Moon. But it takes a special kind of vanity to combine narcissism and prestige and it is for that reason that no one can hold a candle to Kevin Costner, even 29 years after his performance in his own Dances With Wolves as a Union soldier who discovers a kinship with the Sioux. There may ostensibly be an on-screen love story between the hero and a Sioux woman (Mary McDonnell), but the most convincing romance is the one between director and star, Costner and Costner. There is nothing quite like it. Except, perhaps, Costner\u2019s followup, The Postman, which repeated all the same tricks as Dances With Wolves to zero acclaim. In this futuristic drama, set at a time when democracy has collapsed in America and the land is ruled by thugs, Costner chances upon an old mail van and reinstates the country\u2019s postal service. The actor does his humble messiah routine from Dances With Wolves, while several hundred extras send looks of awestruck wonder in his direction. The effect suggests a man contemplating himself in a mirror for three hours. If one element is conspicuous by its absence from this survey, it is women. It is not unheard of for a female director to show excessive self-regard or false humility, and it would be hard to think of a better example than The Mirror Has Two Faces, a take on the Ugly Duckling story directed by its star, Barbra Streisand. The picture contains endless scenes of Streisand fishing for the audience\u2019s compliments, playing gawky when we can see all along that she\u2019s glam; it is the stuff of Marie Antoinette at the milking stool. Yet to put it in the same class as Costner\u2019s work would be to praise it with faint damning. Streisand can be self-indulgent, but she is no Costner. Only once a female film-maker directs herself in something as self-admiringly bad as The Postman will we have achieved true equality between the genders.",

Most alarmingly, a female tennis player told one of these WTC directors, and the LTA\u2019s safeguarding manager, of conduct by Sanders which, the review found, could have been considered a sexual assault. When away at a conference some years before, Sanders asked her to go to his hotel room, and when she arrived he was wearing just a T-shirt and boxer shorts, was sexually aroused, and touched her chest and tried to kiss her. However because the woman was 19, and she wanted to maintain her confidentiality, the WTC investigation did not include it, nor did the LTA do anything to initiate proceedings against Sanders, according to the report.</p> <p>Of that failure by the WTC, the report says: \u201cThis was a missed opportunity. This was a disclosure of inappropriate behaviour. It is reasonably capable of being treated as a disclosure of an alleged sexual assault.\u201d</p> <p>The LTA also failed by not making further investigations, the report states, concluding that the other complaints amounted to sufficient evidence for action to be taken. \u201cThe LTA decision not to pursue misconduct proceedings against Daniel Sanders was incorrect,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>Sanders was not disciplined or even \u201cadmonished\u201d following the 2012 investigation but an action plan was put in place aimed at improving the culture at the WTC.</p> <p>Yet further concerns were raised in 2012, 2013 and 2014 by a female coach and by concerned parents, one of whom warned in writing in January 2014 that the WTC was \u201ca bomb waiting to go off\u201d. Another, Richard Hughes, a police chief inspector, says he warned one of the WTC directors, Bob Moore, that in his experience Sanders fitted the profile of a sexual predator. Moore told the review he did recall Hughes expressing various concerns about Sanders\u2019s conduct but not that specific warning.</p> <p>The report criticises the WTC and Tennis Wales for safeguarding failures and concludes of the national governing body: \u201cThe LTA also failed to investigate the risks that should have been evident to them both from the 2012 WTC report and from other information, and to initiate appropriate proceedings against Daniel Sanders. In the subsequent years there were further failures to react sufficiently to further complaints and disclosures emanating from, or relating to, WTC and to manage properly the LTA\u2019s 2012 action plan.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Lloyd, the LTA chief executive appointed in January 2018, responded to the report by apologising for these failures and promised to \u201credouble our efforts to raise safeguarding standards in tennis\u201d. He said: \u201cThe LTA is committed to having the best safeguarding procedures possible at every level of the game but in this case the actions taken were clearly not enough. I am concerned that opportunities to act were missed and we apologise sincerely to all those affected.</p> <p>\u201cWe will ensure the LTA, Tennis Wales and Wrexham Tennis Centre take all necessary action required to implement the review recommendations in full.\u201d</p>",

Most alarmingly, a female tennis player told one of these WTC directors, and the LTA\u2019s safeguarding manager, of conduct by Sanders which, the review found, could have been considered a sexual assault. When away at a conference some years before, Sanders asked her to go to his hotel room, and when she arrived he was wearing just a T-shirt and boxer shorts, was sexually aroused, and touched her chest and tried to kiss her. However because the woman was 19, and she wanted to maintain her confidentiality, the WTC investigation did not include it, nor did the LTA do anything to initiate proceedings against Sanders, according to the report. Of that failure by the WTC, the report says: \u201cThis was a missed opportunity. This was a disclosure of inappropriate behaviour. It is reasonably capable of being treated as a disclosure of an alleged sexual assault.\u201d The LTA also failed by not making further investigations, the report states, concluding that the other complaints amounted to sufficient evidence for action to be taken. \u201cThe LTA decision not to pursue misconduct proceedings against Daniel Sanders was incorrect,\u201d the report states. Sanders was not disciplined or even \u201cadmonished\u201d following the 2012 investigation but an action plan was put in place aimed at improving the culture at the WTC. Yet further concerns were raised in 2012, 2013 and 2014 by a female coach and by concerned parents, one of whom warned in writing in January 2014 that the WTC was \u201ca bomb waiting to go off\u201d. Another, Richard Hughes, a police chief inspector, says he warned one of the WTC directors, Bob Moore, that in his experience Sanders fitted the profile of a sexual predator. Moore told the review he did recall Hughes expressing various concerns about Sanders\u2019s conduct but not that specific warning. The report criticises the WTC and Tennis Wales for safeguarding failures and concludes of the national governing body: \u201cThe LTA also failed to investigate the risks that should have been evident to them both from the 2012 WTC report and from other information, and to initiate appropriate proceedings against Daniel Sanders. In the subsequent years there were further failures to react sufficiently to further complaints and disclosures emanating from, or relating to, WTC and to manage properly the LTA\u2019s 2012 action plan.\u201d Scott Lloyd, the LTA chief executive appointed in January 2018, responded to the report by apologising for these failures and promised to \u201credouble our efforts to raise safeguarding standards in tennis\u201d. He said: \u201cThe LTA is committed to having the best safeguarding procedures possible at every level of the game but in this case the actions taken were clearly not enough. I am concerned that opportunities to act were missed and we apologise sincerely to all those affected. \u201cWe will ensure the LTA, Tennis Wales and Wrexham Tennis Centre take all necessary action required to implement the review recommendations in full.\u201d",

Theirs is the first joint award since 1967, when the band the Seekers was named. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Harris, an anaesthetist and diver from Adelaide, and Challen, a champion diver from Wangara, Western Australia, were part of the global team that freed the trapped Wild Boars football team in July 2018. The men stayed in the underwater Tham Luang cave system for three days, swimming multiple kilometres in hazardous conditions. Harris swam the length of the cave system, performed medical checks on the children and administered anaesthetic to each of them. Challen then transported the children to safety, and the two men worked together to ensure all 12 escaped unharmed. The three-day operation involved 18 rescue divers in the final stages. One diver, retired Thai navy seal Saman Kunan, died in the process. Harris paid tribute to Kunan last year, and when he won South Australian of the year, he told the ABC he would have preferred if Challen won the national award. But on Friday, the awards committee praised both men equally for their \u201cselflessness, courage and willingness to help others\u201d. Both men have previously been awarded the Star of Courage \u2013 Australia\u2019s second-highest civilian award for bravery \u2013 and the medal of the order of Australia. In 2012, Challen also set an Australasian record by diving to 221m in a river cave in New Zealand on an expedition with Harris. Also on Friday, the Indigenous rapper Danzal Baker \u2013 better known as Baker Boy \u2013 was announced as the young Australian of the year. The 22-year-old musician from Arnhem Land was honoured for his talent, his work with remote communities and his breakthrough success in rapping in the Yolngu Matha language. His song Marryuna came 17th in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2017, and his song Cloud 9 won the station\u2019s Unearthed competition the same year. The chair of the Australia Day council, Danielle Roche, said Baker was a \u201cdedicated advocate who inspires young Indigenous Australians to embrace their heritage\u201d. The senior Australian of the year was paediatrician Dr Suzanne Packer, for her work championing children\u2019s rights. The local hero award went to Kate and Tick Everett, who founded the anti-bullying organisation Dolly\u2019s Dream after the tragic death of their daughter. Dolly\u2019s Dream \u2013 named after Amy \u201cDolly\u201d Everett \u2013 works to prevent childhood bullying with a focus on regional and rural communities in the Northern Territory. \u201cKate and Tick Everett endured heartbreak and put their own grief aside to drive cultural change, prevent bullying and ensure that other children and parents never have to suffer as their family has,\u201d Roche said. Other nominees in the running for Australian of the year this year included Paralympian and champion wheelchair racer Kurt Fearnley, former AFL player and anti-racism advocate Michael Long, journalist and women\u2019s rights advocate Virginia Haussegger and Jon Rouse, a Queensland police detective who broke up one of the world\u2019s largest child sex abuse rings.",

Oh, and, as of tomorrow, a performance at one of the biggest arenas in the UK. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.theo2.co.uk/events/detail/davido\">The 02, SE10, Sunday 27 January</a></em></p> <h2>Massive Attack</h2> <p>To mark the 20th anniversary of 1998\u2019s Mezzanine, Bristol boffins Massive Attack encoded the album into DNA (!) and then released it in the form of a matt-black spray paint can. A nod to the rumour that the band\u2019s 3D is actually Banksy? Perhaps. They are also celebrating the album\u2019s legacy with these shows, featuring vocalist Liz Fraser. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.massiveattack.co.uk/\">Glasgow, Monday 28; Manchester, Tuesday 29 January; touring to 2 March</a></em></p> <h2>Ghetts</h2> <p>East London rapper Ghetts has a had a pretty varied career. Having made his name as part of grime collectives NASTY Crew and then later the Movement alongside Wretch 32, he made a lunge for the mainstream in 2011 via a long-forgotten collaboration with X Factor finalist Cher Lloyd. Recent singles Preach and Black Rose have thankfully seen him return to his more intricately poetic flow. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.livenation.co.uk/artist/ghetts-tickets\">Islington Assembly Hall, N1, Wednesday 30 &amp; Thursday 31 January; touring to 5 February</a></em></p> <h2>Low</h2> <p>Heralded as a \u201cscowling and shellshocked response to Trump\u2019s America\u201d, Low\u2019s rapturously received 12th album Double Negative warped the slowcore trio\u2019s trademark sound in ways they had only hinted at previously, creating an organ-displacing cacophony perfect for uncertain times. Brace yourselves, basically. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.chairkickers.com/shows\">Glasgow, Tuesday 29; Birmingham, Wednesday 30; Brighton, Thursday 31 January; London, Friday 1 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Tigran Hamasyan</h2> <p>Around 2010, young Armenian pianist-composer Tigran Hamasyan looked like a fledgling pop-jazz star, but his country\u2019s folk traditions are his real love. These gigs \u2013 with a choir, plus trumpet master Arve Henriksen on Sunday \u2013 showcase the rich mix of jazz, classical music, hip-hop and spacey vocals of his album An Ancient Observer. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.tigranhamasyan.com/\">The Sage, Gateshead, Saturday 26; Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, Sunday 27 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730950af1d29cb04520501ec17a6cb2fb303f56a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730950af1d29cb04520501ec17a6cb2fb303f56a/0_246_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrg Frey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00fcrg Frey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>J\u00fcrg Frey</h2> <p>Until very recently, anyone in Britain who wanted to hear anything of Swiss composer J\u00fcrg Frey\u2019s fragile, evanescent music had to make a pilgrimage to the Huddersfield contemporary music festival, where his pieces are performed regularly. Now, though, Cafe Oto is devoting a day to his works, with the composer joined by cellist Anton Lukoszevieze in the first concert, followed by an evening of his electronic music. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/events/jurg-frey-one-day-residency/\">Cafe Oto, E8, Sunday 27 January</a></em></p> <h2>Die Walk\u00fcre</h2> <p>Vladimir Jurowski is measuring out the final years of his tenure as the London Philharmonic\u2019s principal conductor with a Ring cycle \u2013 one semi-staged instalment each year until he steps down in 2021. It is Die Walk\u00fcre this time, though with Markus Marquardt as Wotan and Claudia Mahnke as Fricka there\u2019s no connection with the cast of last year\u2019s Rheingold. The Siegmund and Sieglinde are Stuart Skelton and Ruxandra Donose. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/120035-die-walkure-2019\">Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sunday 27 January</a></em></p> <h2>St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra</h2> <p>The St Petersburg Philharmonic is Russia\u2019s longest-established orchestra and one of the most distinguished in Europe. It has had just two chief conductors in the last 80 years; the current boss Yuri Temirkanov has been in charge since 1988 and he leads it on this extensive UK tour. Russian music \u2013 Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich \u2013 dominates the programmes, with pianist Freddy Kempf and violinist Julia Fischer as the concerto soloists. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.sagegateshead.com/event/rns-presents-st-petersburg/\">Gateshead, Saturday 26</a>; <a href=\"http://www.usherhall.co.uk/whats-on/sunday-classics-st-petersburg-philharmonic-orchestra-freddy-kempf\">Edinburgh, Sunday 27</a>; <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/119974-julia-fischer-and-st-petersburg-philharmonic-orchestra-2019\">London, Tuesday 29</a>; <a href=\"https://www.thsh.co.uk/event/st-petersburg-philharmonic\">Birmingham, Thursday 31 January</a>; <a href=\"https://www.bridgewater-hall.co.uk/whats-on/st-petersburg-philharmonic-010219/\">Manchester, Friday 1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.leedstownhall.co.uk/whats-on/orchestral/st-petersburg-philharmonic/4153\">Leeds, 2</a>; <a href=\"http://www.anvilarts.org.uk/SPPO\">Basingstoke, 3 February</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74346ea5baaf01e446a86e6221e9a4383e3bc762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74346ea5baaf01e446a86e6221e9a4383e3bc762/0_10_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Ruskin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Ruskin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Collection of the Guild of St George/Museums Sheffield</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing</h2> <p>The drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are the most direct windows on his genius: a unique mind who explored life, the universe and everything while also casually displaying the greatest graphic talent of all time. This mega-event spreads his masterpieces from the royal collection cross-country from Belfast to Bristol, Cardiff to Glasgow. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.rct.uk/about/news-and-features/leonardo-da-vinci-a-life-in-drawing#/\">Various venues, nationwide, Friday 1 February to 6 May</a></em></p> <h2>Katie Paterson &amp; JMW Turner</h2> <p>Conceptual artist Paterson is fascinated by outer space. Her cosmic meditations range from meteorite sculptures to working with Nasa to imagine what Titan smells like. Turner, too, was drawn to the stars \u2013 or one of them, at least. His obsession with the sun gives his paintings a haunting sense of our planet\u2019s journey through space. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/katie-paterson-and-jmw-turner\">Turner Contemporary, Margate, Sat to 6 May</a></em></p> <h2>Bill Viola/Michelangelo</h2> <p>The video art of Bill Viola is full of spiritual ambition. He dives deep, often literally: images of bodies sinking and rising are among the ways he evokes the soul alongside ethereal flames and portrayals of meditation. But can his art really bear comparison with the drawings of Michelangelo? The intensity with which the sculptor delineates striving bodies goes way beyond Viola. This pairing risks glibness. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/bill-viola-michelangelo\">Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Saturday 26 January to 31 March</a></em></p> <h2>John Ruskin</h2> <p>There has never been another art critic as gifted as Ruskin, the Victorian writer who championed Turner and anticipated Marx on capitalism. Ruskin made his arguments in cascades of rhetorical prose, using his interest in geology as well as art history to give his books polymathic power. He was also a keen artist, and his studies of rocks and architecture provide plenty to look at in this survey of a genius. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-ruskin-465\">Two Temple Place, WC2, Saturday 26 January to 22 April</a></em></p> <h2>La Caixa Collection of Contemporary Art</h2> <p>There\u2019s some good stuff in novelist Enrique Vila-Matas\u2019s choice from a Spanish bank\u2019s art collection \u2013 just not enough of it. A chilly painting by Gerhard Richter of his former wife Isa Genzken leaves you numbed and disturbed. More shock and anxiety is stirred by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster\u2019s cell-like video installation in which a child appears to be imprisoned with her thoughts. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/la-caixa-collection/\">Whitechapel Gallery, E1, to 28 April</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e121d9c277e936990ae8ae6eedd7c2400231a8b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e121d9c277e936990ae8ae6eedd7c2400231a8b4/0_56_5483_3290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Linney in My Name Is Lucy Barton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Linney in My Name Is Lucy Barton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Cost of Living</h2> <p>There will always be a buzz when Adrian Lester treads the boards, such is his magnetic presence on stage. Lester makes his Hampstead Theatre debut in artistic director Edward Hall\u2019s swansong season. He stars as an unemployed truck driver caring for his estranged, disabled wife, Ani, in Martyna Majok\u2019s edgy and probing Pulitzer prize-winning play. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2019/cost-of-living/\">Hampstead Theatre, NW3, to 9 March</a></em></p> <h2>Pinter at the Pinter: A Slight Ache &amp; The Dumb Waiter</h2> <p>Jamie Lloyd\u2019s stunning Pinter odyssey comes to a close with a couple of short, sharp and eerie plays. The Dumb Waiter sees two hitmen warily await their next target. In A Slight Ache, a couple\u2019s pleasant evening descends into chaos. Martin Freeman and Pinter superfan Danny Dyer star. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.pinteratthepinter.com/the-plays/a-slight-ache-the-dumb-waiter\">The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, Thursday 31 January to 23 February</a></em></p> <h2>The Shadow Factory</h2> <p>Howard Brenton\u2019s wartime drama opened the City arts complex last year, and now returns to celebrate the venue\u2019s one-year anniversary. The play unfurls in the smog and smoke of Southampton in 1940. When the Germans bomb the city\u2019s pivotal Spitfire factories, the community must find a way to fight back. The show features a 25-strong community company and is lit up by blazing projections from visual technology pros 59 Productions. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nstheatres.co.uk/whats-on/the-shadow-factory\">Nuffield Theatre: City, Southampton, Wednesday 30 January to 2 March</a></em></p> <h2>Home, I\u2019m Darling</h2> <p>Laura Wade\u2019s biting satire sweeps into the West End. Wade is never knowingly under-subversive and this time she takes a swipe at the idea of domestic perfection and wifely devotion. Katherine Parkinson stars as Judy who, having been made redundant, transforms the family home into a 50s haven. But the fantasy sours and it isn\u2019t long before Judy is trapped in a perfectly kitsch prison of her own making. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/home-im-darling-at-duke-of-yorks-theatre\">The Duke of York\u2019s, WC2, Saturday 26 January to 13 April</a></em></p> <h2>My Name Is Lucy Barton</h2> <p>Following an agonisingly short run last year, My Name Is Lucy Barton returns. Rona Munro deftly adapts Elizabeth Strout\u2019s stunning novel, which sees a mother and daughter tentatively reach out to each other during a series of sleepless nights in hospital. The play is written as a one-woman monologue, which Laura Linney absolutely owns. Assisted by Richard Eyre\u2019s sensitive direction, Linney offers up a considered yet natural performance. <br><em><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/my-name-is-lucy-barton/\">Bridge Theatre, SE1, to 16 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d6b91be5f79f1afd8c11256d48dabf68963cd00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d6b91be5f79f1afd8c11256d48dabf68963cd00/0_242_3000_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gandini Juggling and Alexander Whitley\u2019s Spring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gandini Juggling and Alexander Whitley\u2019s Spring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rosie Kay Dance Company: 5 Soldiers \u2013 The Body Is the Front Line</h2> <p>Choreographer Rosie Kay went on real-life battle exercises with 4th Battalion the Rifles during her research for this excellent, evocative and thumpingly physical work about the lives of modern-day soldiers, and the impact of training and conflict on their bodies and identities. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.wiltshirecreative.co.uk/whats-on/salisbury-arts-centre/5-soldiers-the-body-is-the-front-line/\">Salisbury Arts Centre, Thursday 31 January &amp; Friday 1 February; touring to 3 April</a></em></p> <h2>Yorke Dance Project: Twenty</h2> <p>Yolande Yorke-Edgell attracts great dancers and repertoire to her small company.

Glasgow, Monday 28; Manchester, Tuesday 29 January; touring to 2 March Ghetts East London rapper Ghetts has a had a pretty varied career. Having made his name as part of grime collectives NASTY Crew and then later the Movement alongside Wretch 32, he made a lunge for the mainstream in 2011 via a long-forgotten collaboration with X Factor finalist Cher Lloyd. Recent singles Preach and Black Rose have thankfully seen him return to his more intricately poetic flow. Islington Assembly Hall, N1, Wednesday 30 &amp; Thursday 31 January; touring to 5 February Low Heralded as a \u201cscowling and shellshocked response to Trump\u2019s America\u201d, Low\u2019s rapturously received 12th album Double Negative warped the slowcore trio\u2019s trademark sound in ways they had only hinted at previously, creating an organ-displacing cacophony perfect for uncertain times. Brace yourselves, basically. Glasgow, Tuesday 29; Birmingham, Wednesday 30; Brighton, Thursday 31 January; London, Friday 1 February MC Tigran Hamasyan Around 2010, young Armenian pianist-composer Tigran Hamasyan looked like a fledgling pop-jazz star, but his country\u2019s folk traditions are his real love. These gigs \u2013 with a choir, plus trumpet master Arve Henriksen on Sunday \u2013 showcase the rich mix of jazz, classical music, hip-hop and spacey vocals of his album An Ancient Observer. The Sage, Gateshead, Saturday 26; Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, Sunday 27 January JF Three of the best ... classical concerts J\u00fcrg Frey Until very recently, anyone in Britain who wanted to hear anything of Swiss composer J\u00fcrg Frey\u2019s fragile, evanescent music had to make a pilgrimage to the Huddersfield contemporary music festival, where his pieces are performed regularly. Now, though, Cafe Oto is devoting a day to his works, with the composer joined by cellist Anton Lukoszevieze in the first concert, followed by an evening of his electronic music. Cafe Oto, E8, Sunday 27 January Die Walk\u00fcre Vladimir Jurowski is measuring out the final years of his tenure as the London Philharmonic\u2019s principal conductor with a Ring cycle \u2013 one semi-staged instalment each year until he steps down in 2021. It is Die Walk\u00fcre this time, though with Markus Marquardt as Wotan and Claudia Mahnke as Fricka there\u2019s no connection with the cast of last year\u2019s Rheingold. The Siegmund and Sieglinde are Stuart Skelton and Ruxandra Donose. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Sunday 27 January St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra The St Petersburg Philharmonic is Russia\u2019s longest-established orchestra and one of the most distinguished in Europe. It has had just two chief conductors in the last 80 years; the current boss Yuri Temirkanov has been in charge since 1988 and he leads it on this extensive UK tour. Russian music \u2013 Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich \u2013 dominates the programmes, with pianist Freddy Kempf and violinist Julia Fischer as the concerto soloists. Gateshead, Saturday 26; Edinburgh, Sunday 27; London, Tuesday 29; Birmingham, Thursday 31 January; Manchester, Friday 1; Leeds, 2; Basingstoke, 3 February AC Five of the best ... exhibitions Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing The drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are the most direct windows on his genius: a unique mind who explored life, the universe and everything while also casually displaying the greatest graphic talent of all time. This mega-event spreads his masterpieces from the royal collection cross-country from Belfast to Bristol, Cardiff to Glasgow. Various venues, nationwide, Friday 1 February to 6 May Katie Paterson &amp; JMW Turner Conceptual artist Paterson is fascinated by outer space. Her cosmic meditations range from meteorite sculptures to working with Nasa to imagine what Titan smells like. Turner, too, was drawn to the stars \u2013 or one of them, at least. His obsession with the sun gives his paintings a haunting sense of our planet\u2019s journey through space. Turner Contemporary, Margate, Sat to 6 May Bill Viola/Michelangelo The video art of Bill Viola is full of spiritual ambition. He dives deep, often literally: images of bodies sinking and rising are among the ways he evokes the soul alongside ethereal flames and portrayals of meditation. But can his art really bear comparison with the drawings of Michelangelo? The intensity with which the sculptor delineates striving bodies goes way beyond Viola. This pairing risks glibness. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, Saturday 26 January to 31 March John Ruskin There has never been another art critic as gifted as Ruskin, the Victorian writer who championed Turner and anticipated Marx on capitalism. Ruskin made his arguments in cascades of rhetorical prose, using his interest in geology as well as art history to give his books polymathic power. He was also a keen artist, and his studies of rocks and architecture provide plenty to look at in this survey of a genius. Two Temple Place, WC2, Saturday 26 January to 22 April La Caixa Collection of Contemporary Art There\u2019s some good stuff in novelist Enrique Vila-Matas\u2019s choice from a Spanish bank\u2019s art collection \u2013 just not enough of it. A chilly painting by Gerhard Richter of his former wife Isa Genzken leaves you numbed and disturbed. More shock and anxiety is stirred by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster\u2019s cell-like video installation in which a child appears to be imprisoned with her thoughts. Whitechapel Gallery, E1, to 28 April JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Cost of Living There will always be a buzz when Adrian Lester treads the boards, such is his magnetic presence on stage. Lester makes his Hampstead Theatre debut in artistic director Edward Hall\u2019s swansong season. He stars as an unemployed truck driver caring for his estranged, disabled wife, Ani, in Martyna Majok\u2019s edgy and probing Pulitzer prize-winning play. Hampstead Theatre, NW3, to 9 March Pinter at the Pinter: A Slight Ache &amp; The Dumb Waiter Jamie Lloyd\u2019s stunning Pinter odyssey comes to a close with a couple of short, sharp and eerie plays. The Dumb Waiter sees two hitmen warily await their next target. In A Slight Ache, a couple\u2019s pleasant evening descends into chaos. Martin Freeman and Pinter superfan Danny Dyer star. The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, Thursday 31 January to 23 February The Shadow Factory Howard Brenton\u2019s wartime drama opened the City arts complex last year, and now returns to celebrate the venue\u2019s one-year anniversary. The play unfurls in the smog and smoke of Southampton in 1940. When the Germans bomb the city\u2019s pivotal Spitfire factories, the community must find a way to fight back. The show features a 25-strong community company and is lit up by blazing projections from visual technology pros 59 Productions. Nuffield Theatre: City, Southampton, Wednesday 30 January to 2 March Home, I\u2019m Darling Laura Wade\u2019s biting satire sweeps into the West End. Wade is never knowingly under-subversive and this time she takes a swipe at the idea of domestic perfection and wifely devotion. Katherine Parkinson stars as Judy who, having been made redundant, transforms the family home into a 50s haven. But the fantasy sours and it isn\u2019t long before Judy is trapped in a perfectly kitsch prison of her own making. The Duke of York\u2019s, WC2, Saturday 26 January to 13 April My Name Is Lucy Barton Following an agonisingly short run last year, My Name Is Lucy Barton returns. Rona Munro deftly adapts Elizabeth Strout\u2019s stunning novel, which sees a mother and daughter tentatively reach out to each other during a series of sleepless nights in hospital. The play is written as a one-woman monologue, which Laura Linney absolutely owns. Assisted by Richard Eyre\u2019s sensitive direction, Linney offers up a considered yet natural performance. Bridge Theatre, SE1, to 16 February MG Three of the best ... dance shows Rosie Kay Dance Company: 5 Soldiers \u2013 The Body Is the Front Line Choreographer Rosie Kay went on real-life battle exercises with 4th Battalion the Rifles during her research for this excellent, evocative and thumpingly physical work about the lives of modern-day soldiers, and the impact of training and conflict on their bodies and identities. Salisbury Arts Centre, Thursday 31 January &amp; Friday 1 February; touring to 3 April Yorke Dance Project: Twenty Yolande Yorke-Edgell attracts great dancers and repertoire to her small company. This 20th-anniversary tour features a new work by the legend that is Robert Cohan and the first ever revival of Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s Playground from 1979. Pavilion Dance South West, Bournemouth, Thursday 31 January &amp; Friday 1 February; touring to 26 April Gandini Juggling &amp; Alexander Whitley: Spring Even if you think you don\u2019t like juggling, the Gandinis are the people to turn you on to the fine art of tossing things in the air and catching them, especially when combined with the artful choreography of Alexander Whitley. Sadler\u2019s Wells, EC1, Thursday 31 January to 2 February LW",

Delta announced Wednesday that it will go into \u201c24-hour mode\u201d after the game, with airport staffing, security and limited food service.</p> <p>Passengers with tickets for travel the Monday after the Super Bowl can arrive after the game, clear security and head to the concourses.

About 125,000 extra passengers are expected to filter into and out of the airport before and after the Super Bowl, with about 110,000 expected to leave the day after the game. With the government shutdown edging to Super Bowl Sunday on 3 February, and with the Transportation Safety Administration reporting twice as many unscheduled absences among employees who are not being paid, operations even at an airport as large as Atlanta\u2019s could be hampered, and fans could be delayed getting out \u2013 or even in. \u201cWe are paying a lot of attention to the political situation that we have no control over,\u201d Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport general manager John Selden said during a talk to an industry group last week, as reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cIt is very scary to us.\u201d After TSA officers missed their first paycheck last week, the airport reported security delays of more than one hour, causing some passengers to miss their flights. A bomb threat on Wednesday caused an investigation that delayed flights for 40 minutes. According to daily figures released by the TSA, travelers at Atlanta airport had the maximum standard wait time \u2013 41 minutes \u2013 of any major US airport on Tuesday except Boston Logan Airport, at 42 minutes. The maximum wait time for TSA pre-checked passengers at Atlanta on Tuesday was 19 minutes, longer than any other major US airport. The National Football League has declined to comment about what contingency measures it would take \u2013 if any \u2013 to help its fans handle getting in and out of town. Before the government shutdown, however, TSA had committed to sending additional resources to Hartsfield-Jackson Airport to help with the Super Bowl, an airport spokeswoman told the Guardian earlier this week. Additional TSA officers, additional overtime hours and an additional K-9 teams have been dedicated to support the increased operations, the spokeswoman said. TSA sent some officers last week. Additional contract security will be used during a 10-day operational period. \u201cCustomer engagement agents\u201d and 1,800 Super Bowl volunteers will be on hand to help passengers navigate the gigantic airport. The Visitors Bureau and Super Bowl Host Committee has already recommended that visitors check out of their hotels five hours before their flights. (Turn in your rental car four hours before the flight, check your bag three hours before the flight, go through security two hours before the flight and be at your gate one hour before the flight, they said as part of what they call an \u201caggressive\u201d departure plan.) According to a spokeswoman from the Visitors Bureau, hotels in the Atlanta area are \u201cessentially sold out,\u201d so it would be difficult for fans holding tickets to the Super Bowl to, say, drive instead of fly to Atlanta and stay an extra night on either side of the game. She added, however, that she has not heard of many fans who have thought about doing that. It could be worse: The Atlanta Super Bowl Host Committee expects about 150,000 fans from out of state will converge upon the city in the week leading up to the game, but Atlanta is one of the top convention cities in the country, routinely hosting meetings of 50,000 or more. Miami International Airport, in the city where Super Bowl LIV will be played next year, handles about 44m travelers annually, less than half the number of those that use the Atlanta airport, but Tampa International Airport handles 21m travelers, and Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport handles only about 12m. Delta Air Lines, which uses the Atlanta airport as its major hub, expects it passenger traffic the day after the game to be more than 30% above normal. Delta announced Wednesday that it will go into \u201c24-hour mode\u201d after the game, with airport staffing, security and limited food service. Passengers with tickets for travel the Monday after the Super Bowl can arrive after the game, clear security and head to the concourses. Delta airport employees and its Peach Corps will welcome travelers at concourse \u201chelp desks\u201d and provide blankets, pillows and amenity kits.",

She serves you bread and cheese, but it is very good bread and cheese, the sort of meal that is often more satisfying than fancier stuff. Once Upon a River is a hearty paean to the Thames and the people who live on or near it, whose stories never truly begin or end, but flow on for ever, to a dimly imagined sea. \u2022 Once Upon a River is published by Transworld.

This is his 14th studio album, and, he says, his last, after an extraordinary career in which he has transformed the music of the continent. Since his days with Mali\u2019s legendary Rail Band, his solo work has included everything from the electronica and keyboard-backed breakthrough solo set Soro in 1987, to less happy jazz funk albums, exquisite semi-acoustic sets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/23/albums-decade-salif-keita\">Moffou</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/07/worldmusic.shopping\">M\u2019Bemba</a>, and a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/15/pop-review-gotan-project-music\">Gotan Project\u2019s Philippe Cohen Solal</a>, who produced his last offering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/07/salif-keita-tale-review\">Tal\u00e9</a>, six years ago. The title of this final album translates as Another White, in reference to his early struggles as an albino musician (also the theme of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/04/salif-keita-cd-review\">2009 album La Diff\u00e9rence</a>). Although it includes the autobiographical Lerou Lerou, it is dominated by praise songs \u2013 to God, mothers, hunters and \u2026 a friend who gave him a plane.</p> <p>This self-produced release is aimed at the commercial mainstream, with the throbbing backing dominated by keyboards, guitars and horns pitched against female backing singers and occasional flurries of the kora. There are too many collaborations, with Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo and rapper MHD appearing on the cluttered Itarafo and Alpha Blondy contributing to the reggae track Mansa Fo La, though Ladysmith Black Mambazo\u2019s rousing harmony vocals are a welcome addition to the semi-acoustic Ngamale.</p> <p>What makes Un Autre Blanc distinctive and special is Keita\u2019s vocal work. He is on compelling form throughout, from the soaring, pained anti-war song Syrie to the magnificent Tiranke, on which he switches from thoughtful passages to bursts of controlled power, with backing provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngoni_(instrument)\">ngoni</a> and his own acoustic guitar. If this truly is his last recording, he\u2019ll be badly missed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1KJ5jWC5vJHyeN5s2kyTM7\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1KJ5jWC5vJHyeN5s2kyTM7\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>Also out this month</h2> <p>Also from Mali, the world\u2019s finest ngoni band, <strong>Bassekou Kouyate </strong><strong>and Ngoni Ba</strong>, return with Miri, an engagingly laid-back set in which Bassekou\u2019s wife, Amy Sacko, is joined by male singers including Afel Bocoum.

Although it includes the autobiographical Lerou Lerou, it is dominated by praise songs \u2013 to God, mothers, hunters and \u2026 a friend who gave him a plane. This self-produced release is aimed at the commercial mainstream, with the throbbing backing dominated by keyboards, guitars and horns pitched against female backing singers and occasional flurries of the kora. There are too many collaborations, with Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo and rapper MHD appearing on the cluttered Itarafo and Alpha Blondy contributing to the reggae track Mansa Fo La, though Ladysmith Black Mambazo\u2019s rousing harmony vocals are a welcome addition to the semi-acoustic Ngamale. What makes Un Autre Blanc distinctive and special is Keita\u2019s vocal work. He is on compelling form throughout, from the soaring, pained anti-war song Syrie to the magnificent Tiranke, on which he switches from thoughtful passages to bursts of controlled power, with backing provided by ngoni and his own acoustic guitar. If this truly is his last recording, he\u2019ll be badly missed. Also out this month Also from Mali, the world\u2019s finest ngoni band, Bassekou Kouyate and Ngoni Ba, return with Miri, an engagingly laid-back set in which Bassekou\u2019s wife, Amy Sacko, is joined by male singers including Afel Bocoum. And Tartit, Mali\u2019s finest female-led desert blues band are back after 12 years and still in hypnotic form, with Amankor/The Exile. From New Orleans, Leyla McCalla\u2019s The Capitalist Blues is a gloriously varied blend of local jazz, zydeco and calypso, with reminders of her Haitian roots and angry new protest songs.",

The city of Melbourne hit 42.8C by early afternoon, and the state of Tasmania battled 30 uncontained fires as Australia\u2019s second heatwave in as many weeks continued. With the last semi-final of the Australian Open scheduled for the evening, Melbourne residents were relieved by a cool change at 2pm that lowered temperatures by 12C within 10 minutes. The duty forecaster at Victoria\u2019s bureau of meteorology, Michael Halfpenny, said the cool change had arrived to south-west Victoria early on Friday afternoon and was finally making its way through to the city. But parts of the state were still sweltering \u2013 Swan Hill, on the south bank of the Murray River, reached 47C at 3pm, and Kyabram, in the Goulburn River Valley, hit 46.7C. The extreme heat led to blackouts lasting more than two hours, which affected approximately 200,000 Victorians. The Victorian energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said the state suddenly lost 1,800 megawatts of power, mainly because of the failure of coal plants and rising demand.

The NBC News report, published on Thursday night, suggests new intrigue within the White House over the clearance process. Two career White House officials specializing in assessing individuals for their security risk turned Kushner down for the sensitive \u201ctop secret\u201d category, the report states. Unnamed sources told NBC News that the adjudicators based their rejection of Kushner on FBI background checks that raised red flags over Kushner\u2019s family\u2019s businesses as well as his foreign contacts. Having rejected Kushner for the clearance, the decision was reversed by Trump appointee Carl Kline, a former official in the department of defense who was put in charge of the personnel security office at the White House four months after Trump took office.

Many have invoked our great imperial past as something we were destined to return to post-Brexit. In the giddy aftermath of the vote, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/13/canzuk-after-brexit-canada-australia-new-zealand-and-britain-can/\" title=\"\">Andrew Roberts</a> thought that \u201cone of the many splendid opportunities\u201d offered by Brexit was the resuscitation of Churchill\u2019s dream of a CANZUK union, comprising Canada, Australia, New Zealand and us. There was talk of Empire 2.0.</p> <p>These days, the vibe is more \u201clet them eat turnips\u201d; Britain as underdog as opposed to would-be oppressor. However, a nasty strain of exceptionalism remains the default mode of the Brexit elite, usually abetted by a woeful misunderstanding of the qualities that have actually helped the British people in the past.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the pro-crashing-out economist Roger Bootle <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jacob-reesmogg-brexit-theresa-may-bruges-group-a8743051.html\" title=\"\">told the Bruges Group</a> that the reason Britain could never make its peace with the EU was that we are one of only four European countries not to have endured occupation or dictatorship this last century. How conveniently he forgets that Ireland and Malta have indeed spent much of their history under occupation \u2013 British occupation. And how cleverly he reframes geography as a matter of virtue rather than luck. An old trick of the ruling classes, to confuse virtue and luck.</p> <p>It is not healthy patriotism that underpins that leave project but its toxic inversion: a hatred of Britain as it actually is, a contempt for its young, a dismissal of its businesses and an eagerness to make the poorest pay. Brexit hardliners are invariably the ones with dubious links to overseas pressure groups, with asset funds in emerging markets, with schemes to move their HQs abroad. The British reputation for pragmatism, good business sense and moderation is not some God-given destiny; it required some active application of the same qualities. It required some sense of responsibility towards the next generation. These are supposedly conservative values, but they were sold off a long time ago, the proceeds half-forgotten in a vault in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>Sadly, collective insanity isn\u2019t necessarily a vulnerability in one\u2019s opponents. Churchill again: \u201cMadness is, however, an affliction which in war carries with it the advantage of surprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Godwin is a freelance journalist</p>",

In the giddy aftermath of the vote, Andrew Roberts thought that \u201cone of the many splendid opportunities\u201d offered by Brexit was the resuscitation of Churchill\u2019s dream of a CANZUK union, comprising Canada, Australia, New Zealand and us. There was talk of Empire 2.0. These days, the vibe is more \u201clet them eat turnips\u201d; Britain as underdog as opposed to would-be oppressor. However, a nasty strain of exceptionalism remains the default mode of the Brexit elite, usually abetted by a woeful misunderstanding of the qualities that have actually helped the British people in the past. Earlier this week, the pro-crashing-out economist Roger Bootle told the Bruges Group that the reason Britain could never make its peace with the EU was that we are one of only four European countries not to have endured occupation or dictatorship this last century. How conveniently he forgets that Ireland and Malta have indeed spent much of their history under occupation \u2013 British occupation. And how cleverly he reframes geography as a matter of virtue rather than luck. An old trick of the ruling classes, to confuse virtue and luck. It is not healthy patriotism that underpins that leave project but its toxic inversion: a hatred of Britain as it actually is, a contempt for its young, a dismissal of its businesses and an eagerness to make the poorest pay. Brexit hardliners are invariably the ones with dubious links to overseas pressure groups, with asset funds in emerging markets, with schemes to move their HQs abroad. The British reputation for pragmatism, good business sense and moderation is not some God-given destiny; it required some active application of the same qualities. It required some sense of responsibility towards the next generation. These are supposedly conservative values, but they were sold off a long time ago, the proceeds half-forgotten in a vault in the Cayman Islands. Sadly, collective insanity isn\u2019t necessarily a vulnerability in one\u2019s opponents. Churchill again: \u201cMadness is, however, an affliction which in war carries with it the advantage of surprise.\u201d \u2022 Richard Godwin is a freelance journalist",

So conspicuously unfair and yet so intricately embedded in the establishment. So very hard to uproot. In 1970, the philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/19/society1\" title=\"\">Mary Warnock</a> summed up the problem crisply: \u201cThey have sizable endowments, great prestige, and of course influence. They command a kind of loyalty which is largely irrational \u2026 It might be both difficult and unpopular simply to legislate them out of existence, and who knows by what ingenious dodges they might even so manage to survive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIngenious dodges\u201d smacks of Sir Humphrey in <em>Yes Minister</em> and, as the most exciting chapters of this book document, private schools have indeed pulled some fast ones. Fastest of all, and perhaps the most superbly Sir Humphrey-like exercise in vested interest disguised as public virtue, was the process by which the \u201cpublic\u201d schools got their confusing name. The famous schools \u2013 Eton, Harrow and chums \u2013 had been founded on generous legacies for the education of local poor children.

Yet attention to this, far more than luxury, is how private schools retain their advantages in exams and then medical school and Oxbridge. Just six private schools have their finances analysed in any detail here, and one of these is the Purcell music school, which has 90% state-funded students. With equal vagueness, the authors assert that private schools in the UK are not significantly state funded: but the state pays for teacher training and the private schools share the teachers\u2019 pension scheme. This is not a small point: 16% of teachers work in private schools and they are paid better than in state schools, so theirs are more than 18% of the projected payouts of the scheme \u2013 a total of \u00a34.79bn by 2024 \u2013 which is helping to drive the current wave of cuts in state schools.</p> <p>Similarly, the recent influx of international students into private schools is gestured at, but not investigated, and, apart from scornful references to the indulgent lunch at St Paul\u2019s and the luxurious bedrooms at Rodean, girls\u2019 schools are abandoned in 1963. The authors\u2019 solutions to the private school problem proffer the same mixture of self-importance and distance: they don\u2019t think removing charitable status will apply enough financial pressure or that improving state schools is relevant or possible.

      "bodyText": "British private schools are a challenge to any progressive government. So small \u2013 they cater to just 7% of children \u2013 and yet so all-pervasive. So conspicuously unfair and yet so intricately embedded in the establishment. So very hard to uproot. In 1970, the philosopher Mary Warnock summed up the problem crisply: \u201cThey have sizable endowments, great prestige, and of course influence. They command a kind of loyalty which is largely irrational \u2026 It might be both difficult and unpopular simply to legislate them out of existence, and who knows by what ingenious dodges they might even so manage to survive?\u201d \u201cIngenious dodges\u201d smacks of Sir Humphrey in Yes Minister and, as the most exciting chapters of this book document, private schools have indeed pulled some fast ones. Fastest of all, and perhaps the most superbly Sir Humphrey-like exercise in vested interest disguised as public virtue, was the process by which the \u201cpublic\u201d schools got their confusing name. The famous schools \u2013 Eton, Harrow and chums \u2013 had been founded on generous legacies for the education of local poor children. By the 1860s they had sunk into Tom Brown\u2019s School Days style brutishness, and the legacies were being abused. The Clarendon commission enforced better governance and made the scholarships \u201cpublic\u201d; open to any boy who took a competitive exam \u2013 in the classics. This effectively meant that the scholarship money went not to the local poor but to rich men\u2019s sons from the (scholarship exam) \u201cpreparatory\u201d schools that soon sprang up, boys who could travel in from all over the country on the new railways. The book is sharp, too, on how the schools responded to their new \u201cpublic\u201d role: replacing caddish Flashmans with pliable Tom Browns destined for the colonial service; exchanging anarchy and drinking for muscular Christianity; swapping toasting before the fire for obsessive sport and cricket 11s who \u201ctook flying kicks at junior posteriors, their white shoes marking the score\u201d.

Those cover locations including: <strong>Castle Forbes Bay</strong>, <strong>Geeveston</strong>, <strong>Port Huon</strong>, <strong>Cairns Bay</strong> and <strong>Waterloo</strong>;<strong> Waddamana</strong>, <strong>Hilltop</strong> and <strong>Penstock Lagoon</strong>; <strong>Bronte Park Area</strong>, <strong>Pine Tier Lagoon</strong> and <strong>London Lakes</strong>; <strong>Shannon</strong>; <strong>Lake Echo</strong> and surrounds; and <strong>Liawenee</strong>.</p> <p>Much of southern Tasmanian, including <strong>Hobart</strong>, is covered a red, smoky haze. </p> <p>The other big story of the day, of course, was the fact that about 200,000 homes across Victoria were hit by power blackouts.

So, everyone does their fair share. But they\u2019re looking to make sure it\u2019s sort of the maximum benefit in terms of reduction, they look at the amount of demand in a particular area, and they\u2019ll take that off first, and then it rolls through.</p> </blockquote> <p>Zibelman says that these \u201cshort breaks\u201d are to \u201ctop the entire system straining\u201d. The loadshedding \u2013 that is, outages \u2013 will be rotated around. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s up to two hours, is what we\u2019ve asked for. So, hopefully what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll see it through, it will be for a temporary period of time, they\u2019ll restore it. And if we do additional load shedding, usually the process is they go to different areas. So, it is \u2013 we call it rotating brown-outs for that very reason.

Really good situational awareness today is really important. It\u2019s too late when the fire is on your back door step.\u201d</p> <p>McGuinness said investigators were looking into reports a home had been lost overnight. It would be the second property loss, following the devastation of a house at central Miena earlier in the week. </p> <p>\u201cToday is the worst day that we\u2019ve had for the fire season to date,\u201d Arnol said. </p> <p>Since late December some 71,000 hectares of land has been burnt and there is more than 900km of fire edge, with 500 firefighters on the ground.</p> <p>On the west coast, an evacuation centre is open at Queenstown Basketball Stadium.</p> <p>Communities in the highland lakes area are also reminded to stay on high alert, with emergency warnings in place for Shannon, Waddamana, Penstock Lagoon and Hilltop and there is an evacuation centre open at the Bothwell Town Hall.</p> <p>Authorities are telling people not to enter bushland this weekend, with a total fire ban in place statewide until Monday.</p> <p>\u201cIn these extreme fire danger conditions, it is not safe to camp in areas surrounded by bush,\u201d the TFS warns.</p> <p>The hazard is being fuelled by temperatures in the high 30s and wind gusts of up to 90km/h. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T02:18:56.582Z\">at 2.18am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5c4a6a79e4b0a585f6e860f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T01:53:26.841Z\">1.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AEMO: 30,000 homes affected by Melbourne blackout</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chief executive of the <strong>Australian Energy Market Operator</strong>, <strong>Audrey Zibelman</strong>, has just held a press conference on its decision to order load shedding in Victoria. </p> <p>Zibelman has confirmed 30,000 homes are being impacted by the ordered blackouts, which have been put in place to protect the electricity grid.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s a wrap. Thanks for sticking with us throughout day. A reminder that there are still dozens of bushfires burning in Tasmania and Victoria. Authorities have warned people not to be complacent. An emergency warning is still in place for communities near a fire at Timbarra, in Victoria\u2019s Gippsland region. The fire there has grown in size from 300ha to 4,000ha and it is now too late for locals to leave. There are six emergency warnings in place in Tasmania. Those cover locations including: Castle Forbes Bay, Geeveston, Port Huon, Cairns Bay and Waterloo; Waddamana, Hilltop and Penstock Lagoon; Bronte Park Area, Pine Tier Lagoon and London Lakes; Shannon; Lake Echo and surrounds; and Liawenee. Much of southern Tasmanian, including Hobart, is covered a red, smoky haze. The other big story of the day, of course, was the fact that about 200,000 homes across Victoria were hit by power blackouts. You can expect the political argy to roll on on that one for the next few days. With that, I\u2019ll leave you. Have a nice weekend and if you\u2019re in a bushfire-affected area, stay safe. Victoria\u2019s emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, says the Timbarra community may be living with the current fire for weeks to come. The fire was 300ha this morning. Over the day it has spread to cover 4000ha. We have a community who continues to do it very tough today. The Timbarra community, that whole region, which is living with the fire at the moment, a very active and dangerous fire. They had a really tough few days since the fire took off, and they are probably going to face this fire in their landscape for many weeks to come. The message I have right now is that it is still very early in the day. Please do not be complacent. Victoria\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is addressing the media. He\u2019s talking about the fire at Timbarra, which is the most dangerous of the fires burning across Victoria. Crisp says the fire has been burning since 16 January and residents have been provided advice about the need to activate their bushfire plans since then. Three people have made it to a relief centre at Buchan, but Crisp says authorities believe other locals have \u201cmade other arrangements\u201d. Earlier today, the CFA warned people it was too late to leave the area and that they should take immediate steps to survive. \u201cThe fire is a dangerous fire,\u201d Crisp says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to move fire fighters out of that particular area until things settle down.\u201d \u201cThe change is not expected to go through there until the evening.\u201d Thanks to Naaman for briefly taking over. Luke Henriques-Gomes back with you now. D\u2019Ambrosio has sung the praises of Victoria\u2019s renewable energy during the heatwave, saying it was coal and thermal generators that failed the state. \u201cWe lost 1800 megawatts of power capacity generation in Victoria,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is an extraordinary figure to lose. Essentially most of that was as a result of failed infrastructure from coal and gas units \u2013 in particular coal. \u201cPeople should be rightly disappointed that the power grid was not up to the stakes today...we have a 20th century energy system, for a 21st century climate. \u201cThe fact is our thermal generators are ageing, they are becoming less and less reliable. Wind power came through today \u2013 it produced sufficient power generation. Our large batteries were available last night when we needed them the most. Renewable energy is the way of the future and the here and now.\u201d She did also apologise to Victorians for the outages. \u201cThe market operator had to make the decision to minimise the impact of [the failures]\u201d, she said. \u201cAt 12 oclock today they directed load shedding distributed fairly across the state.\u201d 150,000 Victorians had they power supply taken off \u201cfor a very short period of time\u201d, she said. In Melbourne, the Victorian energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, is explaining why load shedding happened earlier today. She says the state suddenly lost 1,800 megawatts of power \u2013 mostly due to failed coal plants \u2013 which created a 250 megawatt gap. Supply was low, and demand increased as people tried to keep cool. Aemo then decided to load shed until the cool change came. \u201cThis morning Aemo advised we had more than sufficient power to meet all of our needs. The situation changed very very quickly. \u201cThe extreme heat continued to remain with us and demand continued to increase to unanticipated levels. That caused greater stress on our existing thermal generators ... That came on top of the fact we los three coal generators in the La Trobe valley. \u201cThe market operator did what their job is, and decided there was an actual gap in energy supply to meet that continually rising demand.\u201d Tasmanians are being reminded that the state has a total fire ban extending over the entire Australia Day long weekend. Some other ways to look at those record-breaking temperatures yesterday. According to weather researcher Maximiliano Herrera, Port Augusta\u2019s 49.5C is the highest temperature recorded at a coastal location in the southern hemisphere. On Wednesday, Red Rocks Point in WA reached 49.1C. The measuring station is only 70m from the ocean, which potentially makes it the hottest temperature ever recorded so close to the sea. Back to that press conference. Emergency services have warned that the cool change will create a change in wind direction \u2013 placing more people at risk. If you are near a fire, be aware that the front could shift overnight. Fire services have 30 aircraft across the state, and up to 700 people at work. A police spokesman says: \u201cLeave early before the need is there, ensure there is a planned route and travel slowly.\u201d Two fires have worsened \u2013 residents of Wilburville and Flintstone may be at high risk within 2 to 6 hours. Both are now at Watch and Act. The bureau of meteorology also adds that the fire danger remains high. While temperatures are now dropping, the wind is picking up, meaning the risk is still as high as ever. \u201cWhile conditions are easing, the fire danger remains high for the moment,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAs the temperature drop the winds are peaking \u2013 that is keeping the fire danger up.\u201d There are \u201ccooler conditions and a slight easing of the winds\u201d forecast overnight, but the danger will remain. There is not a lot of rain forecast for tomorrow \u2013 only a couple of millimetres. Tasmania\u2019s fire chief also warned that \u201csevere conditions will now move on to the east coast from now on\u201d. Tasmanian emergency services are giving a press conference now. The topline is that conditions remain severe, and many fires are still posing a threat. Tasmania\u2019s fire chief says there are still 56 active fires in Tasmania, with 30 uncontained. \u201cThirty of them still going, that means they are not contained, and they will be breaking their containment lines tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt remains hot, windy and the fuels remain incredibly dry in this state right now. We have a long way to go. Do not underestimate the situation we are in. We can\u2019t let our guard down.\u201d In Victoria, there is a house fire at Taylor Court, Colac. The fire is contained but an advice warning has been issued for Colac, Colac West, Colac East. In Tasmania, the Zeehan Highway is closed. People looking to evacuate must travel via Strahan. Hello everyone, Naaman Zhou here taking over from Luke for a short while. The weather in central Melbourne has dropped to 29.9C (yes, below 30C). And the cool change has been a quick one, too. Some very concerning news out of Gippsland in Victoria\u2019s east. Authorities have issued an updated emergency warning fir residents in Timbarra Settlement, Mt McLeod, Butchers Ridge, Gelantipy, Gillingall, Murrindal, W Tree. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive,\u201d the alert reads. \u201cThe safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave.\u201d Please click though the link below to see for offical advice. In fact, I\u2019m told by a Melbourne colleague who has just ventured the cool change is on. At least in the centre of Melbourne. It is also very windy. \u201cBring goggles\u201d is the word from the street. Twenty. Minutes. Some bad news from Tasmania. There are currently eight emergency warnings in place throughout the state. That fire is putting Maydena, Tyenna and Mount Field national park at risk. I wrote earlier that Audrey Zibelman said 30,000 homes were being impacted by imposed power outages throughout Melbourne. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the total number of people estimated to be impacted is much larger: 60,000 across Victoria, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator. The mercury has hit 42.8C in central Melbourne, according to the bureau\u2019s observation page. But they do say there is some relief on the way. When you don\u2019t have a pool. One take on the Melbourne #heatwave. This seems relevant. Here is more from AEMO chief Audrey Zibelman about what load shedding actually means and how it works in practice. What they do is based on the maximum amount that they can take off in an area ... it\u2019s an equitable distribution across the entire region. So, everyone does their fair share. But they\u2019re looking to make sure it\u2019s sort of the maximum benefit in terms of reduction, they look at the amount of demand in a particular area, and they\u2019ll take that off first, and then it rolls through. Zibelman says that these \u201cshort breaks\u201d are to \u201ctop the entire system straining\u201d. The loadshedding \u2013 that is, outages \u2013 will be rotated around. It\u2019s up to two hours, is what we\u2019ve asked for. So, hopefully what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll see it through, it will be for a temporary period of time, they\u2019ll restore it. And if we do additional load shedding, usually the process is they go to different areas. So, it is \u2013 we call it rotating brown-outs for that very reason. As I said, you try to get people off for a short period, and then get them back on so, you know, because to give people relief. Just thought I would clarify that areas across Melbourne are being impacted by the blackouts. The first news to come to hand was that suburbs in the north and north-west \u2013 such as Essendon and Broadmeadows \u2013 supplied by one company, Jemena, had lost power. In fact, the impact is much more widespread than that as a later statement from the energy market operator shows. Regions to be impacted include parts of: Epping, Mill Park, Lysterfield, Rowville, Clyde, Cranbourne East; Southbank, Armadale, Toorak, Camberwell, Fairfield, Northcote, Caulfield, Elwood, Beaumaris, Bulleen, Burwood, Riversdale, Bentleigh, Heathdale, Balaclava, Malvern, Balwyn, Surrey Hills, Essendon, Essendon North, Strathmore, Glenroy, Oak Park, Kalkallo, Broadmeadows, West Footscray, Fairfield, Ivanhoe, Alphington, Airport West, East Keilor, Niddrie, Ascot Vale, and Moonee Pond, Camperdown, Weerite, Yarrawonga, Bundalong, Castlemaine Muckleford, Lara, Corio, Norlane, Herne Hill, Hamlyn Heights, Balmoral, Haven, Woolsthorpe, Grassmere and Mailers Flat. At this stage, we are expecting more favourable weather and supply-demand conditions mid-afternoon, reducing the need for scheduled supply interruptions into the evening, barring further major generation issues. Some more on those power outages. Here are some thoughts from people without power. AAP has filed a report on the latest in Tasmania. As I mentioned earlier, two homes have already been destroyed. A second home is believed to have been lost in Tasmania as residents across the state face the threat of ember attack from fires burning kilometres away. Authorities on Friday said they were facing extreme fire risk with dry air and temperatures reaching into the mid-30s, while 56 blazes continued across the island. At Geeveston, southwest of Hobart, a fire is about 10km from the community, the Tasmania Fire Service chief officer, Chris Arnol, said. \u201cThere will not be a head fire go into Geeveston, but with the wind in the mix, the conditions that we have, we\u2019re expecting ember attack to go into those townships,\u201d he said, adding there is potential for embers to travel more than 10km. Residents are being urged to leave early and already some 80 people have gathered at an evacuation centre at nearby Huonville. The service\u2019s Andrew McGuinness asked people to remain aware of what\u2019s going on. \u201cPeople in the state will be inside with the curtains closed and their air conditioning on,\u201d he said. \u201c[They need to] make sure they open the curtains every now and then and go outside and experience what is going on around them. Really good situational awareness today is really important. It\u2019s too late when the fire is on your back door step.\u201d McGuinness said investigators were looking into reports a home had been lost overnight. It would be the second property loss, following the devastation of a house at central Miena earlier in the week. \u201cToday is the worst day that we\u2019ve had for the fire season to date,\u201d Arnol said. Since late December some 71,000 hectares of land has been burnt and there is more than 900km of fire edge, with 500 firefighters on the ground. On the west coast, an evacuation centre is open at Queenstown Basketball Stadium. Communities in the highland lakes area are also reminded to stay on high alert, with emergency warnings in place for Shannon, Waddamana, Penstock Lagoon and Hilltop and there is an evacuation centre open at the Bothwell Town Hall. Authorities are telling people not to enter bushland this weekend, with a total fire ban in place statewide until Monday. \u201cIn these extreme fire danger conditions, it is not safe to camp in areas surrounded by bush,\u201d the TFS warns. The hazard is being fuelled by temperatures in the high 30s and wind gusts of up to 90km/h. The chief executive of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman, has just held a press conference on its decision to order load shedding in Victoria. Zibelman has confirmed 30,000 homes are being impacted by the ordered blackouts, which have been put in place to protect the electricity grid. As I reported earlier, affected suburbs include Broadmeadows and Glenroy in Melbourne\u2019s north and Essendon in the north-west. \u201cWe may have to do more over the course of the afternoon, as the demand continues to increase,\u201d Zibelman said. \u201cWe are hoping, however, that the updated forecast is that the cold front is gonna be coming in a little bit earlier, around 2pm, which will help us because it will give us some demand relief.\u201d If you were wondering how the market operator determines which areas should be blacked out, Zibelman addressed that too. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to make sure it\u2019s sort of the maximum benefit in terms of reduction, they look at the amount of demand in a particular area, and they\u2019ll take that off first, and then it rolls through,\u201d she said. VicRoads is also reporting traffic light outages throughout Melbourne and Geelong. The Australian Energy Market Operator has ordered load shedding across Victoria, according to the ABC. Suburbs in Melbourne\u2019s north and west that are being affected include Glenroy, Essendon and Broadmeadows. (Earlier today, the Victorian energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said the government did not expect any load shedding today.) From overnight: The Victorian town of Rutherglen beat its minimum temperature record, dropping to only 29.3C. That\u2019s the highest overnight temperature since records began in 1913. People at Bradys Lake in Tasmania are being urged to move to Hamilton, where there is an evacuation centre at the community hall. Any other places closing due to the heat? Some welcome news. An update on that Watch and Act issued for the Gippsland community of Timbarra. It has been updated to an emergency warning. Authorities say leaving now is the safest option. Tasmanian authorities are holding a press conference to provide an update on the fires. The Tasmanian Fire Service chief officer, Chris Arnol, said there are currently more than 80 fires burning across the state, covering 71,000 hectares. \u201cToday is the worst day we\u2019ve had of the fire season,\u201d he says. The most at-risk areas at the Central Plateau, the West Coast and Geeveston. Authorities have not issued any forced evacuations, but there are six emergency warnings in place. At least two properties have been destroyed, with reports of a third, the fire service says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not properly prepared, you need to leave,\u201d Arnol said. \u201cPeople near current bushfires should consider leaving \u2026 right now.\u201d Parts of the state will soon reach extreme bushfire conditions, he said. \u201cLives could be at risk,\u201d he said. Embers could travel 10km and road closures are possible, authorities say. They are saying that during the 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires, many died on the roads trying to escape the fires. The message is that people need to evacuate early. Arnol said anyone going camping during the Australia Day weekend should cancel those plans. A reminder that authorities are asking people in Victoria to reduce their power consumption to ease demand on the network. That means avoiding the use of dishwashers, pool pumps and washing machines where possible. It is predicted that the peak demand period will be between 1pm and when a cool change hits later in the afternoon. There are currently three units down at power stations in the Latrobe Valley. The Victorian government says it can\u2019t guarantee there won\u2019t be blackouts today. (I have updated this post to reflect that individual units are down, rather than the entire stations themselves.) Here are some good tips. Please remember to hydrate. There is now a Watch and Act in place for the community of Timbarra, in the state\u2019s far east, just south of Omeo. VicEmergency says: \u201cThere is a bushfire 10 km north of Timbarra that is not yet under control. The bushfire is travelling in a southerly direction towards Timbarra Settlement. There are spot fires south of Surveyors Track. \u201cDon\u2019t wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly.\u201d One of our readers, Susan, has a tip for staying cool overnight and, I\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t heard this one before: \u201cI put wet facewashers in freezer 30 minutes before sleep, and put these on my arm pits, groin, back of neck,\u201d she writes. \u201cTop it off by sleeping on a bath towel.\u201d Very specific. Thanks, Susan. Keep them coming, folks. Yesterday we mentioned that there are fears that precious wilderness in Tasmania is being threatened by fire at Mount Anne, within Wilderness World Heritage Area. On that, here is a thought from the Tasmanian author James Boyce on that. Thoughts? Across Tasmania there are six emergency fire warnings in place. Three fires \u2013 at Tahune, Lynch Hill and Grand Pine Tier \u2013 are threatening the areas including Geeveston, Zeehan, Renison Bell, Waddamana, Pine Tier Lagoon and Shannon. Here\u2019s the view in Tasmania, from Guardian Australia contributor Adam Morton. Authorities predicted that bushfire conditions in Tasmania today would be almost unprecedented. Already this morning police have urged residents to leave Geeveston (population 616), south-west of Hobart, as ash starts to fall there. The area is being threatened by a fire at Tahune. There were suggestions yesterday that Melbourne might get close to its overnight heat record. In its forecast, the bureau was not mincing its words, predicting an \u201coppressive night\u201d ahead. In fact, the city hovered around 30C overnight, meaning that record stayed in tact. But for Melburnians without airconditioning or a fan, like your scribe, that was not exactly cold comfort. I\u2019m keen to hear how you kept cool overnight. A colleague attempted using icepacks as a sort of reverse hot water bottle (before she moved to the air-conditioned living room). Send me an email luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or tweet at me @lukehgomes with your tips. My colleague Calla Wahlquist has filed this preview on today\u2019s heatwave conditions. She notes that the Victorian energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, told 3AW radio on Friday morning that she \u201ccan\u2019t rule out brown-outs\u201d. Read Calla\u2019s full report below.

Here, instead of sleeping pills and multivitamins, customers will be offered prescriptions of Derek Walcott and Elizabeth Bishop.</p> <p>Alma, who as the \u201c<a href=\"https://emergencypoet.com/\">Emergency Poet</a>\u201d has prescribed poems as cures from the back of a 1970s ambulance for the last six years, is now setting up a permanent outlet in a shop at Bishop\u2019s Castle in Shropshire. An old Edwardian ironmonger\u2019s, it still has the original fixtures and fittings, and, together with her partner, the TS Eliot prize-shortlisted poet James Sheard, Alma is preparing to turn it into a haven \u201cto help ease a variety of maladies with the soothing therapy of Poetry\u201d.</p> <p>Dressed in a white coat and stethoscope, Alma says she was invited to appear as the Emergency Poet at \u201cschools, hospitals and festivals all over the place, but I\u2019m a middle-aged woman and I\u2019m getting a bit old for driving around\u201d.

The sections will be set up along the lines of a poetry anthology she edited in 2016, The Everyday Poet, which was split into poems \u201caddressing areas of emotional need\u201d such as love, ageing, grief and hope.

      "bodyText": "Following in the hallowed footsteps of Milton, who wrote in 1671 that \u201capt words have power to swage / The tumours of a troubled mind / And are as balm to festered wounds\u201d, the poet Deborah Alma is preparing to open the UK\u2019s first poetry pharmacy. Here, instead of sleeping pills and multivitamins, customers will be offered prescriptions of Derek Walcott and Elizabeth Bishop. Alma, who as the \u201cEmergency Poet\u201d has prescribed poems as cures from the back of a 1970s ambulance for the last six years, is now setting up a permanent outlet in a shop at Bishop\u2019s Castle in Shropshire. An old Edwardian ironmonger\u2019s, it still has the original fixtures and fittings, and, together with her partner, the TS Eliot prize-shortlisted poet James Sheard, Alma is preparing to turn it into a haven \u201cto help ease a variety of maladies with the soothing therapy of Poetry\u201d. Dressed in a white coat and stethoscope, Alma says she was invited to appear as the Emergency Poet at \u201cschools, hospitals and festivals all over the place, but I\u2019m a middle-aged woman and I\u2019m getting a bit old for driving around\u201d. She first noticed the shop on Bishop\u2019s Castle High Street two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s got all the original shelves, drawers, the oak counter; it\u2019s beautiful and I thought: \u2018Wow, that would make a fantastic poetry pharmacy!\u2019 Two years later, we\u2019ve done it and got a mortgage,\u201d she says. The mortgage was approved on Wednesday, and Alma is buzzing with plans for how the shop will be divided like a pharmacy \u201cinto areas for particular ailments, so you walk around and find wherever your mood might be addressed by literature\u201d. The sections will be set up along the lines of a poetry anthology she edited in 2016, The Everyday Poet, which was split into poems \u201caddressing areas of emotional need\u201d such as love, ageing, grief and hope. There will also be a children\u2019s section, a consulting room, a cafe, and a large space for writing retreats, workshops and performances. With a report earlier this week showing that poetry sales were up by more than 12% in 2018, driven largely by younger buyers, Alma suggests poetry is filling the gap left by religion. \u201cI think probably more than any other art it speaks directly as though from one person to another,\u201d says Alma, who published her own first collection, Dirty Laundry, last year. \u201cIt\u2019s intimate and it\u2019s empathetic. It can be a prayer or a curse, or something just to hang on to.\u201d Alma is reluctant to hand out general poetry prescriptions on demand, as she says each \u201cpatient\u201d needs a proper consultation before being given a poem, but she will advise that for a broken heart, Derek Walcott\u2019s Love After Love is \u201calways a good one, about falling in love with your own interesting life\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Sterling rallies after PM\u2019s defeat The pound soared after Theresa May suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat ever over her Brexit plan, as currency traders in the City bet that the chances of a hard Brext in less than 70 days\u2019 time had significantly diminished. Sterling has risen to the highest level against the euro in more than a year, while also gaining against the dollar. At its current level just above $1.30, the pound is still worth 12% less against the dollar than it was before the EU referendum in June 2016. Equities recover on trade hopes Stock markets around the world have rallied over the past month after the worst December for Wall Street since 1931. The FTSE 100 has staged a strong recovery along with other major global indices as hopes grow for a resolution in the US-China dispute over trade, which has been acting as a handbrake on the global economy. The UK\u2019s major listed companies have gained by more than 6% in a month, despite lingering concerns over Brexit. Analysts, however, warn that potential reignition of the trade war between Washington and Beijing could trigger fresh losses. Meets forecast Falling petrol prices drag down inflation UK inflation declined to the lowest level in almost two years in December after a drop in petrol prices. Offering respite to hard-pressed consumers at Christmas, the slide in inflation could help rebuild household finances ahead of Brexit, while also alleviating pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The consumer price index fell from 2.3% in November to 2.1% in December, which is the lowest level since January 2017. The drop comes after consumers were hit by rising prices after the 2016 Brexit vote, when the fall in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Worse than forecast Trade fears grow amid global slowdown Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 unexpectedly widened in November to \u00a312bn from \u00a311.9bn in October, as the weak pound failed to lift export volumes abroad. Fears are growing over the levels of global trade, given the standoff between the US and China, while the slowdown in the Chinese economy has lowered demand for UK manufactured goods. The car industry, also struggling with a new set of rules around vehicle emissions, has been particularly hard hit, dragging UK economic growth close to a standstill. Better than forecast Brexit stockpiling boosts business activity An increase in firms stockpiling before a potential no-deal Brexit helped UK factory output grow at the fastest pace in six months during December, amid growing fears of border delays. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply suggests Brexit could perversely benefit the economy in the short-term by prompting firms to raise activity in preparation for no deal. Despite the upswing, analysts warned that the UK\u2019s dominant services sector remained close to flatlining. Economists said the surveys of business activity point to growth of about 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018, down from a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter. Better than forecast Wage growth and employment surges The average wages of British workers rose at the fastest annual rate since the financial crisis in the three months to November as unemployment fell to the lowest rate since the mid-1970s. Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 3.3% in the biggest rise since 2008. Meanwhile, the number of people in work also rose after an increase of 141,000 people entering employment to a record high of 32.54 million in the three months to November. Despite the good news from the jobs market, some economists warned that employers may have turned to hiring contractors rather than full-time staff amid uncertainty over Brexit, with self-employment accounting for two-thirds of the rise in new jobs. Worse than forecast Christmas sales slump after Black Friday UK consumers reined in their spending in December over the key Christmas shopping period after splashing out in November on Black Friday promotions. Confirming a tough festive season on the high street, the quantity of goods bought last month fell by 0.9% compared with November. Sales had surged in the previous month as shoppers pulled forward their Christmas spending to take advantage of Black Friday deals. Worse than forecast EU contribution pushes up government borrowing Britain\u2019s budget deficit, the gap between spending and income from taxes, was higher than expected in December, as the government spent more than it received. Although the UK\u2019s finances are steadily improving on an annual basis, the performance over the last month was worse than the City expected.

The Office for National Statistics said the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU budget was \u00a31.5bn higher than in December 2017; transfers to Brussels can fluctuate at the end of each year. Worse than forecast Brexit threat drags down house prices UK house prices fell at the fastest rate in six years in December, while the outlook for sales was the weakest in two decades, according to the latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Sales expectations for the next three months were the lowest since the survey began in 1999, with a net balance of -28% \u2013 the difference between the number of respondents anticipating increases and the number expecting decreases. Analysts blamed Brexit uncertainty for the malaise.

The rare book, of which only a handful of copies remain, was bought online by government librarians last year and unveiled for the first time in Ottawa on Wednesday. The acquisition, which curators say will preserve a critical piece of history, comes at a time of growing antisemitism and Holocaust denial in Canada. Published in 1944 by the German researcher and linguist Heinz Kloss, Statistics, Media, and Organizations of Jewry in the United States and Canada is a disturbingly thorough catalogue of Jewish residents in the two countries and reflects Nazi plans in the event they gained control over the continent. \u201c[The book] demonstrates that the Holocaust wasn\u2019t a European event \u2013 it was an event that didn\u2019t have the opportunity to spread out of Europe,\u201d Michael Kent, a curator at Library and Archives Canada, told the Guardian. \u201cIt reminds us that conflicts and human tragedies that seemed far away could find their way to North America.\u201d Experts believe the book was once part of Hitler\u2019s extensive library at his alpine hideaway and was probably removed by Allied soldiers or dignitaries who visited the complex following the defeat of the Nazis.

Acquired by a private collector in the US at a cost of US$4,500, the book will go on public display on Saturday, in commemoration of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The item will become a permanent addition to archive\u2019s collection of more than 22m books. The book highlights Nazi plans for an eventual presence in North America. They made larger strides than is often realized: in 1943, the year before Kloss\u2019s book was published, the Germans established an automated weather station in what is now the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. There are also numerous wartime stories in eastern Canada of German U-boats making headway up the St Lawrence river. Kent likens the library\u2019s recent acquisition to the Black Book, a list of prominent British residents identified as potential targets, in the event of a successful Nazi invasion of the United Kingdom. While many Holocaust memorials in the US refuse to acquire Nazi memorabilia \u2013 including the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC \u2013 the library\u2019s mandate is to preserve and document historical items that are important to Canadian history, said Kent. \u201cObviously, given the provenance and given the subject matter of the book, there had to be a larger reflection than just our standard operating procedures,\u201d he said. The acquisition by the national archive comes at a time when scholars have warned of rising ignorance among Canadians about the Holocaust. On Thursday, editors of a Toronto-based publication, Your Ward News, were found guilty of hate crimes for its depiction of women and Jewish figures. The judge called the paper\u2019s views an \u201cunrelenting promotion of hate\u201d. The verdict follows a study that found more than half of Canadian adults were unaware that more than 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust, and as many as two-thirds of young respondents failed to demonstrate knowledge of the event. \u201cI\u2019m still fighting Nazis and white supremacists in ways that I never dreamed I\u2019d be doing in retirement,\u201d said Bernie Farber, chair of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. \u201cWhen I go into schools I see young people who have not been taught the lessons of the past.\u201d He hopes that better education \u2013 including the archive\u2019s acquisition of the book \u2013 can combat the \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d trend of ignorance among young Canadians. \u201cI don\u2019t want Nazi memorabilia falling into the hands of neo-Nazis.

      "bodyText": "Britain is preparing for Brexit in little over two months against a backdrop of faltering domestic growth and a global economic slowdown, which threatens to compound the consequences of a no-deal exit, according to Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month. UK plc has begun to enact emergency plans for crashing out of the EU, with Westminster gridlocked since Theresa May suffered the worst government defeat of any British PM in the democratic era over her withdrawal plan. P&amp;O, the 182-year-old British maritime operator, will re-register under the Cypriot flag to avoid disruption, Sony is to move its European headquarters from London to Amsterdam, and retailers from Dixons Carphone to Pets at Home have announced plans to stockpile supplies in the event of chaos at British ports. These moves come amid growing signs of a weakening world economy, with slowdowns from China to Europe. And the US-China trade dispute is acting as a handbrake on world trade, just as the UK needs to strike trade deals to help offset the disruption of leaving the EU. Amid already falling levels of growth in Europe and elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund is warning that a no-deal Brexit and a steeper slowdown in China are the biggest risks to the global economy in 2019. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, said: \u201cIt is not a good backdrop for Brexit. The prospect of a no-deal-Brexit is very damaging for the UK economy. \u201cA \u2018no-deal\u2019 would signal that our government had lost control of events, and was complicit in a chaotic outcome to the Brexit process.\u201d To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian is monitoring eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was worse than expected. In two cases, the result was better than forecast, and one was in line with expectations. The Guardian\u2019s latest monthly tracker of economic news does, however, reveal some bright spots for the British economy. The rise in stockpiling has inadvertently boosted business activity, which could benefit the wider economy as manufacturers produce more goods in preparation for no deal. Wages are growing at the fastest rate since the 2008 financial crisis and unemployment has dropped to the lowest level since the mid 1970s, while inflation has cooled, thanks to falling petrol prices, which is helping to rebuild the spending power of UK households. Employment rose by 141,000 in the three months to November, although economists warned that two-thirds of the increase was in self-employment and probably reflected a Brexit-related concern among companies over hiring permanent employees. Also writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former MPC member, said: \u201cMost other advanced countries, including the US and Germany, have seen declining rates. The concern is that these new self-employed jobs are low paying and possibly short-lived.\u201d He added: \u201cBrexit uncertainty makes it hard to see much improvement in the economic data anytime soon, although ditching no-deal would likely be an upside surprise.\u201d The deterioration in the global economy has had a knock-on impact on the UK, at a time when some Brexiters are pushing for a no-deal exit with a promise of more free trade deals with the rest of the world. The UK\u2019s motor industry has suffered from a drop in output amid faltering demand at home and abroad, as well as from disruption caused by new emissions tests. British consumers have become reluctant to make big purchases ahead of Brexit, while China, the biggest market for some UK manufacturers, has just recorded the first annual decline in car sales for almost 30 years. Other European countries have suffered from the downturn in factory output, with Germany likely to be in recession in the second half of 2018. UK economic growth slowed in the three months to November as a consequence, with the broadest drop in industrial production since 2012, while Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 unexpectedly widened in November to reach \u00a312bn. Having fallen from a growth rate of 0.6% over the summer, economic growth in the UK dropped to 0.3% and is expected to slow further in the final months of 2018 and the first months of 2019. Economists said politicians agreeing to a Brexit deal could help boost the outlook for 2019, and warned failure to do so would maintain the current tepid rate of UK growth. Sentance said: \u201cWe need an end to Brexit uncertainty, which has been holding back the UK economy for the past three years.\u201d",

Amnesty\u2019s Indigenous rights campaigner, Belinda Lowe, said the case highlighted broader concerns that police and the courts had not been educated about alternatives to less-successful punitive measures like youth detention. \u201cAny possible step that can be taken to keep kids out of the justice system is better for them and for the community,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cWhen a child is put in the justice system, the likelihood of them offending increases. \u201c[Restorative justice] often works quite well because kids are put in front of the people who are affected by their behaviour and their bad decisions. They\u2019re able to see the impact of their crime. \u201cWith a lot of the kids who go through the justice system, there can be cognitive issues, or learning development issues, and a clinical court process is not always the best way to teach a child about the impact of what they\u2019ve done. \u201cIt is critical that police and judges and other people who are decision makers in the process are educated to consider these things, so they can make decisions when children are in a bit of trouble or need a little extra support.\u201d Judge Ian Dearden reviewed the case and ruled this month that the children\u2019s court magistrate had \u201cfallen into error\u201d. Dearden set aside the original sentence \u2013 30 hours of community service the youth has already completed \u2013 and referred the child back to a restorative justice process. \u201c[The magistrate] expressed, fairly bluntly, a disinclination to utilise a sentencing option that the learned magistrate was obliged to consider,\u201d Dearden said in a judgment posted this week.",

The MBA\u2019s first restoration project was at Tunskeen, also in the Galloway Forest.</p> <p>Bothying predates the creation of the MBA, stretching back to the 1930s with the rise in popularity of hillwalking, when groups would shelter in disused farm buildings while hiking in wild places. Robert Barton, maintenance organiser for the Northern Highlands and a member of the MBA for more than 30 years, says: \u201cThe houses were left empty, mostly after the war, when the estates didn\u2019t have so much money to employ people, and walkers just started using them.\u201d As such, bothies vary hugely in their original purpose, from Viking longhouses to simple sheep shelters. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed25bf46a993dba446330ac18b501f7113cf1e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed25bf46a993dba446330ac18b501f7113cf1e64/0_995_3648_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This bothy \u2013 the Lookout on the Isle of Skye \u2013 is a former coastguard watch station that was operational until the 1970s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This bothy \u2013 the Lookout on the Isle of Skye \u2013 is a former coastguard watch station that was operational until the 1970s</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>This bothy, the Lookout on the Isle of Skye, is a former coastguard station that was operational until the 1970s</p></li> </ul> <p>From its conception, the MBA extended its work across the UK, expanding from the first restored bothy in Galloway Forest to the Cairngorms and eventually across Scotland, and into England and Wales. By 1975, it was maintaining 32 bothies and had become a registered charity. There are 83 shelters in Scotland, a further 12 in England and nine in Wales. They are all hidden away in mountainous country, and gaining access to them requires sure-footedness and a head for navigation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c8a421af9b445e26b7834a101f25ea2382562c70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8a421af9b445e26b7834a101f25ea2382562c70/0_0_5207_3471/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Glendu bothy, here pictured on the left of two other buildings, is in the far north-west of Scotland and is one of 83 Scottish shelters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Glendu bothy, here pictured on the left of two other buildings, is in the far north-west of Scotland and is one of 83 Scottish shelters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Glendhu bothy (on the left), in the far north-west of Scotland, is one of 83 Scottish shelters</p></li> </ul> <p>The determination required to reach a bothy has meant that for many years they were frequented only by the hardiest of hill walkers, munro baggers and rock climbers. Neil Stewart, publicity coordinator for the MBA, says that until recently, \u201cbothy locations were really only found by word of mouth\u201d. Barton says that in the early years it was more like a secret society: \u201cWe had various lists that had been photocopied but even then it was just a list of names and approximate areas \u2026 there were no grid references.\u201d It was only in 2009 that the MBA chose to reveal the location of the bothies to the public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfb67b83266fc9b3efe8ec6dc4a9e5e2581f8f69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfb67b83266fc9b3efe8ec6dc4a9e5e2581f8f69/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lone walker in mountainous Scottish countryside.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lone walker in mountainous Scottish countryside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Reaching a bothy requires some determination \u2013 which has meant they have become the preserve of hill walkers and rock climbers</p></li> </ul> <p>Most bothies offer little in the way of creature comforts. Few have taps, toilets, beds or lights, and some don\u2019t even have a fireplace. Perhaps the best definition is provided by MBA chairman Simon Birch, who describes them as \u201ca stone tent\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Mountain Bothies Association (MBA) is a charity made up of volunteers who maintain more than 100 remote shelters across England, Wales and Scotland. It was founded in 1965 by Bernard Heath after he spotted a remark in the visitor book at the Backhill of the Bush bothy in Galloway Forest park, suggesting the setting up of a club to save a growing number of deserted farm buildings from ruin. Plaque on the door of a bothy maintained by the MBA Heath realised that a collective effort was needed to keep the abandoned cottages and huts weatherproof in order \u201cto maintain simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of all who love wild and lonely places\u201d. The MBA\u2019s first restoration project was at Tunskeen, also in the Galloway Forest. Bothying predates the creation of the MBA, stretching back to the 1930s with the rise in popularity of hillwalking, when groups would shelter in disused farm buildings while hiking in wild places. Robert Barton, maintenance organiser for the Northern Highlands and a member of the MBA for more than 30 years, says: \u201cThe houses were left empty, mostly after the war, when the estates didn\u2019t have so much money to employ people, and walkers just started using them.\u201d As such, bothies vary hugely in their original purpose, from Viking longhouses to simple sheep shelters. This bothy, the Lookout on the Isle of Skye, is a former coastguard station that was operational until the 1970s From its conception, the MBA extended its work across the UK, expanding from the first restored bothy in Galloway Forest to the Cairngorms and eventually across Scotland, and into England and Wales. By 1975, it was maintaining 32 bothies and had become a registered charity. There are 83 shelters in Scotland, a further 12 in England and nine in Wales. They are all hidden away in mountainous country, and gaining access to them requires sure-footedness and a head for navigation. The Glendhu bothy (on the left), in the far north-west of Scotland, is one of 83 Scottish shelters The determination required to reach a bothy has meant that for many years they were frequented only by the hardiest of hill walkers, munro baggers and rock climbers. Neil Stewart, publicity coordinator for the MBA, says that until recently, \u201cbothy locations were really only found by word of mouth\u201d. Barton says that in the early years it was more like a secret society: \u201cWe had various lists that had been photocopied but even then it was just a list of names and approximate areas \u2026 there were no grid references.\u201d It was only in 2009 that the MBA chose to reveal the location of the bothies to the public. Reaching a bothy requires some determination \u2013 which has meant they have become the preserve of hill walkers and rock climbers Most bothies offer little in the way of creature comforts. Few have taps, toilets, beds or lights, and some don\u2019t even have a fireplace. Perhaps the best definition is provided by MBA chairman Simon Birch, who describes them as \u201ca stone tent\u201d. Although some have light switches, these aren\u2019t connected to anything and have been mischievously placed there by MBA members poking fun at the basic nature of the refuge. (Above left) Any luxuries must be carried in, as in the case of this visitor to Glendhu, who brought his own cooking pot when he stopped overnight on his way north to Cape Wrath. The Instagram factor of bothies such as the Eagle\u2019s Nest (right) on the Isle of Lewis has attracted many more visitors, bringing record numbers of visitors to remote parts of Scotland The hand-built stone structure of the Eagle\u2019s Nest Bothy perches on a cliff edge in the Outer Hebrides, hundreds of feet above crashing waves. The Instagram factor, combined with the publication of the Scottish Bothy Bible in 2017, has resulted in a huge increase in visitor numbers in recent years. This has provoked mixed feelings within the organisation, but in the MBA\u2019s most recent newsletter, a trustee points out: \u201cLooking ahead, we\u2019re far more likely to attract future generations of bothy carers and maintainers by letting people know we\u2019re here.\u201d Top, Cuillin Horseshoe, Isle of Skye; bottom, a cyclist approaches the bothy at Kearvaig Bay in Cape Wrath Bothies now provide vital shelter in increasingly popular multi-day treks such as the Cape Wrath Trail and the West Highland Way, which continue to bring visitors in record number to the most remote parts of Scotland. This includes the Hebrides, where the Isle of Skye in particular has seen a massive upsurge in tourists wishing to see the famous Black Cuillins, and other natural wonders popularised by their appearance in television programmes such as Game of Thrones. The main concern for longstanding MBA members is that inexperienced hikers may not treat the bothies with the caution they often merit. The bothy at Kearvaig Bay in Cape Wrath was a former hunting lodge that had been abandoned for 40 years until being restored. It is reached by a short ferry ride over the Kyle of Durness, where the weather can be treacherously unpredictable. If the ferry cannot run, visitors can be stranded for days.

These voluntary working holidays provide essential maintenance to keep the buildings weatherproof and open to the public. In 2017, an estimated 400 volunteers contributed around 1,300 working days to the upkeep of the buildings by attending advertised maintenance parties throughout the year.

In 2015 its roof was ripped off by a storm, but the building was saved by the quick actions of MBA members, who promptly carried in hundreds of slates before any more damage could be inflicted. A young German volunteer sweeps the bothy at the end of a successful work party at Glendhu Bothy For mountain bothies to continue to provide shelter for those looking to enjoy the wildest regions of the UK, an increase in the number of people attending the maintenance parties is needed. Only if this happens will founder Bernard Heath\u2019s ambition for the organisation to \u201cgo on forever\u201d be fulfilled.",

Here, followers of every Premier League club have their say, with the odd break for a celebrity interview. Cheering or booing when Lyle mentions individual teams takes up an awful lot of time and the chat can be anaemic, but the tone \u2013 loud, matey and unpretentious \u2013 is about right. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>The Victorian House of Arts and Crafts <br>9pm, BBC Two<br></h2> <p>The series reaches the dining room. This means fire dogs, Tondino plates and curtains decorated with socialist poetry. It\u2019s twee and unashamedly nostalgic, but there is a certain satisfaction in seeing modern craftspeople attempt these remarkable creations. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Grantchester <br>9pm, ITV<br></h2> <p>\u201cWe were promised a hunky new vicar,\u201d you may say on finding that curate Leonard appears to have taken charge in place of the newly departed Sidney.

In the meantime, Leonard and Geordie look into a case of mercury poisoning. <em>Mike Bradley</em></p> <h2>On Guitar: Lenny Kaye! <br>9pm, BBC Four<br></h2> <p>Amiable Patti Smith cohort Lenny Kaye presents a decent history of the electric guitar in the pop era, recalling the major players and technological advances behind the sounds we love. Best of all is Bonnie Raitt\u2019s description of \u201cthe power and abandon and sex and fury\u201d she feels when she plays. <em>MB</em></p> <h2>Rob and Romesh vs Usain Bolt <br>9pm, Sky One<br></h2> <p>A new series in which Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett tick off their wishlist of sports and entertainment megastars. Join them on a lightning tour of Jamaica hosted, appropriately, by Usain Bolt. Larks aplenty: 38 minutes of R&amp;R and seven minutes of Bolt to finish. <em>MB</em></p> <h2>Bob\u2019s Burgers <br>10pm, Comedy Central<br></h2> <p>It may be more kind-hearted than South Park but this animated sitcom still smuggles in some snark amid its general goofy sweetness.

      "bodyText": "The Real Football Fan Show 12.10am, Channel 4 After a mid-season break, Robbie Lyle returns with a third series of studio banter that builds on his success interviewing Arsenal fans on YouTube. Here, followers of every Premier League club have their say, with the odd break for a celebrity interview. Cheering or booing when Lyle mentions individual teams takes up an awful lot of time and the chat can be anaemic, but the tone \u2013 loud, matey and unpretentious \u2013 is about right. Jack Seale The Victorian House of Arts and Crafts 9pm, BBC Two The series reaches the dining room. This means fire dogs, Tondino plates and curtains decorated with socialist poetry. It\u2019s twee and unashamedly nostalgic, but there is a certain satisfaction in seeing modern craftspeople attempt these remarkable creations. Phil Harrison Grantchester 9pm, ITV \u201cWe were promised a hunky new vicar,\u201d you may say on finding that curate Leonard appears to have taken charge in place of the newly departed Sidney. Worry not, as his interregnum proves short and sweet: a replacement is already haring to the parish. In the meantime, Leonard and Geordie look into a case of mercury poisoning. Mike Bradley On Guitar: Lenny Kaye! 9pm, BBC Four Amiable Patti Smith cohort Lenny Kaye presents a decent history of the electric guitar in the pop era, recalling the major players and technological advances behind the sounds we love. Best of all is Bonnie Raitt\u2019s description of \u201cthe power and abandon and sex and fury\u201d she feels when she plays. MB Rob and Romesh vs Usain Bolt 9pm, Sky One A new series in which Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett tick off their wishlist of sports and entertainment megastars. Join them on a lightning tour of Jamaica hosted, appropriately, by Usain Bolt. Larks aplenty: 38 minutes of R&amp;R and seven minutes of Bolt to finish. MB Bob\u2019s Burgers 10pm, Comedy Central It may be more kind-hearted than South Park but this animated sitcom still smuggles in some snark amid its general goofy sweetness. Season nine kicks off with a double bill featuring lovestruck Tina infiltrating a boyband audition and the return of Kevin Kline\u2019s sly tycoon Mr Fischoeder. Graeme Virtue Film choice A Quiet Place, 12.10pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere This suspenseful thriller is set in a world where blind creatures hunt humans \u2013 who are safe, as long as they remain silent. Director John Krasinski also stars as Lee who, with the rest of the Abbott family, are practised survivalists; but mum Evelyn (Emily Blunt) is pregnant \u2013 how do you give birth silently?

In the speech to the Sandringham Women\u2019s Institute, she spoke of the virtues of \u201crespecting\u201d the other person\u2019s point of view. It echoed her Christmas address when she touched on the same theme, telling the nation: \u201cEven with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.\u201d Her speech came as Philip Hammond told business leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/24/philip-hammond-urges-business-leaders-to-accept-brexit-result\">they needed to accept the result of Britain\u2019s EU referendum</a> and warned that a failure to implement it would damage the country\u2019s political stability.

It\u2019s a fresh blow for Donald Trump that has deepened the sense of dysfunctional government and left Washington in deadlock. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s commerce chief, billionaire Wilbur Ross, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/24/wilbur-ross-government-shutdown-federal-workers-food-banks\">was ridiculed for saying </a>he didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand why\u201d unpaid government workers were turning to food banks, suggesting they should take out loans instead.

Official policy in the UK (and US) \u2013 unlike in many other countries \u2013 is to never make concessions to kidnappers, refusing to negotiate with terrorists, pay ransom or make concessions. The logic of that policy is that paying ransom puts a target on the back of British citizens, increasing the risk of future kidnappings.

Venezuela\u2019s crisis shows no signs of abating as the US state department ordered all its non-emergency staff to leave the country and urged US citizens to \u201cstrongly consider\u201d leaving. It came as the head of Venezuala\u2019s armed forces warned of a civil war sparked by a Washington-backed \u201ccriminal plan\u201d to unseat president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \u201cWe are here to avoid, at all costs \u2026 a conflict between Venezuelans,\u201d defence minister Vladimir Padrino said in a live broadcast, as he declared his support for Maduro. Meanwhile, the president\u2019s challenger, opposition leader and self-appointed interim president, Juan Guaid\u00f3, offered Maduro an amnesty if he went quietly. In his first interview since Wednesday\u2019s dramatic declaration, Guaid\u00f3 said he was determined to bring Maduro\u2019s \u201cdictatorship\u201d to an end, stabilise his economically devastated nation and organise free elections \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. In Washington, diplomatic onlookers were left scratching their heads over the possible next steps in US\u2019s push for regime change in Caracas. As Julian Borger writes, remarks by senior administration figures suggest the Trump White House has not completely worked out the full details of its ambitious gambit to change the Venezuelan leader. * * * \u2018Common ground\u2019 \u2013 The Queen has delivered a speech calling for people never to lose \u201csight of the bigger picture\u201d in what has been seen in some quarters as an veiled reference to Brexit.

It will be particularly high in 2019 due to an expected return towards El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions, during which plants and trees\u2019 ability to absorb C02 is reduced. \u201cThis year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,\u201d he said. * * * Windrush \u2013 The high court has ordered a new inquest into the death of Dexter Bristol after the original coroner failed to consider the impact of the Home Office\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policy on his health. Bristol was 57 when he died, having moved from Grenada to the UK in 1968, when he was eight. He was sacked from his cleaning job last year because he had no passport, and was denied benefits. The original inquest found he died of natural causes but the assistant coroner declined to consider evidence that stress was a contributing factor, something his family challenged. * * * \u2018Needle in a haystack\u2019 \u2013 The remains of the famous British explorer Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia, have been uncovered near London\u2019s Euston station, 200 years after he was buried. The graveyard is being excavated to make way for the high-speed line between London and Birmingham. Only a small proportion of the 40,000 bodies being exhumed from St James\u2019s cemetery, behind the station, have been identified so far, making the discovery of Flinders\u2019 remains earlier this month a \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d find, according to the project\u2019s lead archaeologist.

Lunchtime read: The business of kidnapping Kidnapping and ransom insurance was created in the 1930s, but it wasn\u2019t until the 60s that it began to really catch on, following a spate of kidnappings in Europe by groups such as Eta in Spain, the Red Army Faction in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. The appeal was simple: in the event of a kidnapping, the insurance would provide reimbursement for ransom payment. Nearly a century later, London is the global centre for kidnap and ransom insurance, but it has not always been a comfortable fit. Official policy in the UK (and US) \u2013 unlike in many other countries \u2013 is to never make concessions to kidnappers, refusing to negotiate with terrorists, pay ransom or make concessions. The logic of that policy is that paying ransom puts a target on the back of British citizens, increasing the risk of future kidnappings. But those taken sometimes die as a result. Joel Simon asks if it is time to rethink.

Business While Brexit has invoked many stories of economic doom, one upside may be the ability to fix your mortgage payments on a cheap rate for the next decade. According to the latest research from the mortgage number crunchers Moneyfacts, the average 10-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased significantly over the past five years and now stands at an average of 3.05%.

I actually want to do a T-shirt with two rectangles on it, with the measurements, in a funny way.\u201d</p> <p>He says he was right, too, about refusing to be superstitious as a result of Stevie Wonder\u2019s lyrics. \u201cWe really were a superstitious family. Imprisoned by superstition. My literature was album sleeves, reading the lyrics and liner notes. And when I read: \u2018When you believe in things that you don\u2019t understand then you suffer,\u2019 that was impactful to me. It sounds funny, but I\u2019m not going to look at it and say I didn\u2019t mean it.

Indeed, if you were Matt or Luke Goss, you would probably be in a good mood, too. They say they knew After the Screaming Stops was a good film.

They spent Christmas together in the US, the appalling rows that punctuate the documentary long since passed (\u201cThe cameras didn\u2019t exacerbate them,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWithout the cameras, there would have been blood\u201d), watching in amazement as Matt\u2019s views on rectangles, conkers and how CNN is the thinking man\u2019s reality TV became memes. Some people compared it to Spinal Tap. Others said it had reduced them to tears, victims of the film-makers\u2019 brilliant bait-and-switch tactics.

Almost uniquely among big stars of the era, the 80s revival never quite got around to Bros. There has been no attempt to critically rehabilitate their music, ironically or otherwise; you seldom hear their hits, even on radio stations predicated on nostalgia; their brief but dazzling flash of fame was apparently sealed in a box marked Things We Would Rather Forget.</p> <p>Until, it appears, now. They tell me they went to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/22/bodyguard-named-best-new-drama-at-national-television-awards\" title=\"\">National Television awards</a> on Tuesday and were besieged by well-wishers. Dermot O\u2019Leary introduced them onstage with the words: \u201cThey\u2019re ours, and we love them.\u201d When I tell people I\u2019m interviewing Bros, they express delight and envy, a reaction it is hard to imagine their name provoking a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Perhaps, suggests Luke, it has something to do with the film\u2019s honesty. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world at the moment where fake perfection is being presented in all different mediums, so that degree of candour is refreshing, I think.\u201d Certainly, if they seem slightly different in person to on camera 18 months ago \u2013 Matt more self-aware, Luke less fragile \u2013 they are nevertheless very similar. Matt is in a bespoke three-piece suit and hat, and remains fond of an extended metaphor (\u201cMatt\u2019s a great lyricist, and basically thinks that way after 30 years of doing it,\u201d offers his brother); Luke is more softly spoken, in regulation designer rock star garb, albeit with his seemingly fathomless supply of grunge T-shirts exchanged for a plain black one. Like the crystal-owning meditators of After the Screaming Stops, both are occasionally given to talking in spiritual terms, something I assumed was a reaction to fame\u2019s excesses, but apparently isn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been like that,\u201d says Matt. \u201cOur grandfather was a faith healer, our granny was a Romany gypsy, a clairvoyant. We\u2019re not afraid of that conversation now.\u201d</p> <p>Or perhaps it\u2019s linked to the Goss brothers\u2019 ability to take a joke. They seem blithely unconcerned that people were laughing at them. \u201cOf course they were,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe made a conscious decision that we knew there were going to be some uncomfortable moments,\u201d adds Matt. \u201cIn life, there are. It isn\u2019t contrived.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f479ff06f71c4487ff5804a53222e967d9ada7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f479ff06f71c4487ff5804a53222e967d9ada7d/0_0_3840_5648/680.jpg\" alt=\"Matt and Luke Goss.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Or maybe it has something to do with the film giving people a better understanding of what it was like to be in Bros. On arrival in 1987, they seemed like the perfect teen-pop confection: beautiful boys with a gimmick, who furthermore seemed of the moment. You would never have confused their music with acid house, but their image at least was cannily based on the clothes you would have seen at an illegal warehouse party of the era: ripped 501s, bandanas, quiff-y hair by London\u2019s hippest salon, Cuts. Linking them, albeit tangentially, to a youth culture the police were actively trying to stop might have given them the faintest hint of rebellion in teenage eyes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t speak about how rebellious our fans were,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThey would bunk off school to see us, they would turn up in their thousands, you had this mania.\u201d</p> <p>Their lyrics made them seem cocky and hungry for success at all costs: \u201cDrop the boy \u2013 I\u2019m the man\u201d; \u201cWhen will I see my picture in the papers?\u201d But then, the twins hadn\u2019t written the lyrics \u2013 they were the handiwork of their manager, Tom Watkins, and a songwriter called Nicky Graham, who muddied the waters by crediting themselves as \u201cthe Brothers\u201d. The people who sang their words seem to have been desperately ill-equipped to cope with vertiginous success, their woes compounded by the fact that at the time the British tabloid press was running riot. It was the era of headlines such as \u201cFreddie Starr ate my hamster\u201d, and \u201cPop idols sneer at dying kids\u201d, when showbiz reporting and demented fiction seemed to be interchangeable.</p> <p>\u201cWe were continuously on our back foot, because we were constantly having to rectify what had been said,\u201d says Matt. \u201cToday, if a journalist writes a piece you can go online and dissect it immediately. Back then, if a journalist said something about me and Luke, we would have to wait until the next interview to correct it. If you\u2019re constantly defending yourself, you can\u2019t be yourself.\u201d</p> <p>In fairness, there were positives to their fame. They both loved playing live. \u201cTouring was attractive for me because the [record company] execs didn\u2019t know how to fuck with it, they didn\u2019t know how to play,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIt was our zone. I was with my brother, playing and singing. It was as real as it can be, it was legit.\u201d Also, they couldn\u2019t help but enjoy some aspects of the mania. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pop band with a couple of hits, it was a global phenomenon, it personified what rock\u2019n\u2019roll is,\u201d says Matt. \u201cTens of thousands of fans everywhere, helicopters and bodyguards and craziness, being shoved into the back of meat wagons by police. We\u2019re still the youngest men to headline Wembley stadium. That belongs to Bros. Whether it matters to anyone else, that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s deeply important to us.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, watching After the Screaming Stops, it is hard to avoid the feeling that the traumatic aspects of Bros\u2019s success might have outweighed the positives. In the documentary\u2019s most disturbing moment, the brothers recall appearing on TV chatshow Wogan, performing and taking delivery of platinum discs, hours after being told that their sister had been killed by a drunken driver.</p> <p>\u201cI think if someone had said: \u2018Do you need a second after your big sister was killed?\u2019, we would have probably said: \u2018Yeah, that would be nice.\u2019 We were 17-, 18-year-old boys. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m enjoying <em>this</em>, and it\u2019s taken a long time for us to have that. We have our own lives and we understand business and have good acumen. But I think back then \u2026 we lost the love of it, we lost each other, and in the end it did supersede the desire to get onstage.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6acdfa867de7ad2e649efae31b34e96168938d09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6acdfa867de7ad2e649efae31b34e96168938d09/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bros in After the Screaming Stops, onstage at the 02 Arena.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bros in After the Screaming Stops, onstage at the 02 Arena.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pair are keen to emphasise that the damage wreaked by their rise and fall as teen idols is in the past. Matt has a successful career as a Las Vegas entertainer, packing them in at the Mirage. Luke has reinvented himself as an actor, largely in action thrillers. And these are high times for Bros. They are playing another reunion gig at Brixton Academy in July; they seem to have missed a trick billing it as Bros Coming Home rather than Bros Coming HOME \u2013 four letters, as Matt says in After the Screaming Stops, that personify home \u2013 but it looks like a guaranteed sell-out. There\u2019s talk of a new album, more TV, even \u2013 perhaps jokingly \u2013 of merchandise that reads MAKE CONKERS GREAT AGAIN.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I feel about it?\u201d frowns Matt when the latter is mentioned. \u201cI think it\u2019s \u2026 you shouldn\u2019t get me started on this,\u201d he says, then gets started on it anyway. \u201cI think Britain is known for its sense of humour. We\u2019re cheeky, flirtatious, sadistic, sarcastic, there\u2019s a sense of humour ingrained in all of us, and I think it\u2019s important we don\u2019t lose that. Talking about having to wear goggles when you play conkers is a way of saying let\u2019s not become too careful. We\u2019re meant to smash our knuckles with conkers, we\u2019re meant to fall out of trees and break our wrists. Do you know what I mean? I think people get it when I go on about not wearing goggles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it could be a suggestion,\u201d offers Luke. \u201cBut to insist that we do things \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d interrupts Matt. \u201cI don\u2019t even want a suggestion. Goggles in chemistry lessons, fair enough, you might blow yourself up, but conkers \u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI think you understand. I just want to say that I\u2019m more concerned about North Korea than I am about conkers,\u201d he says, then smiles. \u201cBut conkers are right up there.\u201d</p> <p><em>Bros: After the Screaming Stops is on BBC2, Saturday, 10.45pm.

There has been no attempt to critically rehabilitate their music, ironically or otherwise; you seldom hear their hits, even on radio stations predicated on nostalgia; their brief but dazzling flash of fame was apparently sealed in a box marked Things We Would Rather Forget. Until, it appears, now. They tell me they went to the National Television awards on Tuesday and were besieged by well-wishers. Dermot O\u2019Leary introduced them onstage with the words: \u201cThey\u2019re ours, and we love them.\u201d When I tell people I\u2019m interviewing Bros, they express delight and envy, a reaction it is hard to imagine their name provoking a few weeks ago. Perhaps, suggests Luke, it has something to do with the film\u2019s honesty. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world at the moment where fake perfection is being presented in all different mediums, so that degree of candour is refreshing, I think.\u201d Certainly, if they seem slightly different in person to on camera 18 months ago \u2013 Matt more self-aware, Luke less fragile \u2013 they are nevertheless very similar. Matt is in a bespoke three-piece suit and hat, and remains fond of an extended metaphor (\u201cMatt\u2019s a great lyricist, and basically thinks that way after 30 years of doing it,\u201d offers his brother); Luke is more softly spoken, in regulation designer rock star garb, albeit with his seemingly fathomless supply of grunge T-shirts exchanged for a plain black one. Like the crystal-owning meditators of After the Screaming Stops, both are occasionally given to talking in spiritual terms, something I assumed was a reaction to fame\u2019s excesses, but apparently isn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been like that,\u201d says Matt. \u201cOur grandfather was a faith healer, our granny was a Romany gypsy, a clairvoyant. We\u2019re not afraid of that conversation now.\u201d Or perhaps it\u2019s linked to the Goss brothers\u2019 ability to take a joke. They seem blithely unconcerned that people were laughing at them. \u201cOf course they were,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable.\u201d \u201cWe made a conscious decision that we knew there were going to be some uncomfortable moments,\u201d adds Matt. \u201cIn life, there are. It isn\u2019t contrived.\u201d Or maybe it has something to do with the film giving people a better understanding of what it was like to be in Bros. On arrival in 1987, they seemed like the perfect teen-pop confection: beautiful boys with a gimmick, who furthermore seemed of the moment. You would never have confused their music with acid house, but their image at least was cannily based on the clothes you would have seen at an illegal warehouse party of the era: ripped 501s, bandanas, quiff-y hair by London\u2019s hippest salon, Cuts. Linking them, albeit tangentially, to a youth culture the police were actively trying to stop might have given them the faintest hint of rebellion in teenage eyes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t speak about how rebellious our fans were,\u201d says Matt. \u201cThey would bunk off school to see us, they would turn up in their thousands, you had this mania.\u201d Their lyrics made them seem cocky and hungry for success at all costs: \u201cDrop the boy \u2013 I\u2019m the man\u201d; \u201cWhen will I see my picture in the papers?\u201d But then, the twins hadn\u2019t written the lyrics \u2013 they were the handiwork of their manager, Tom Watkins, and a songwriter called Nicky Graham, who muddied the waters by crediting themselves as \u201cthe Brothers\u201d. The people who sang their words seem to have been desperately ill-equipped to cope with vertiginous success, their woes compounded by the fact that at the time the British tabloid press was running riot. It was the era of headlines such as \u201cFreddie Starr ate my hamster\u201d, and \u201cPop idols sneer at dying kids\u201d, when showbiz reporting and demented fiction seemed to be interchangeable. \u201cWe were continuously on our back foot, because we were constantly having to rectify what had been said,\u201d says Matt. \u201cToday, if a journalist writes a piece you can go online and dissect it immediately. Back then, if a journalist said something about me and Luke, we would have to wait until the next interview to correct it. If you\u2019re constantly defending yourself, you can\u2019t be yourself.\u201d In fairness, there were positives to their fame. They both loved playing live. \u201cTouring was attractive for me because the [record company] execs didn\u2019t know how to fuck with it, they didn\u2019t know how to play,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIt was our zone. I was with my brother, playing and singing. It was as real as it can be, it was legit.\u201d Also, they couldn\u2019t help but enjoy some aspects of the mania. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pop band with a couple of hits, it was a global phenomenon, it personified what rock\u2019n\u2019roll is,\u201d says Matt. \u201cTens of thousands of fans everywhere, helicopters and bodyguards and craziness, being shoved into the back of meat wagons by police. We\u2019re still the youngest men to headline Wembley stadium. That belongs to Bros. Whether it matters to anyone else, that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s deeply important to us.\u201d Nevertheless, watching After the Screaming Stops, it is hard to avoid the feeling that the traumatic aspects of Bros\u2019s success might have outweighed the positives. In the documentary\u2019s most disturbing moment, the brothers recall appearing on TV chatshow Wogan, performing and taking delivery of platinum discs, hours after being told that their sister had been killed by a drunken driver. \u201cI think if someone had said: \u2018Do you need a second after your big sister was killed?\u2019, we would have probably said: \u2018Yeah, that would be nice.\u2019 We were 17-, 18-year-old boys. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m enjoying this, and it\u2019s taken a long time for us to have that. We have our own lives and we understand business and have good acumen. But I think back then \u2026 we lost the love of it, we lost each other, and in the end it did supersede the desire to get onstage.\u201d The pair are keen to emphasise that the damage wreaked by their rise and fall as teen idols is in the past. Matt has a successful career as a Las Vegas entertainer, packing them in at the Mirage. Luke has reinvented himself as an actor, largely in action thrillers. And these are high times for Bros. They are playing another reunion gig at Brixton Academy in July; they seem to have missed a trick billing it as Bros Coming Home rather than Bros Coming HOME \u2013 four letters, as Matt says in After the Screaming Stops, that personify home \u2013 but it looks like a guaranteed sell-out. There\u2019s talk of a new album, more TV, even \u2013 perhaps jokingly \u2013 of merchandise that reads MAKE CONKERS GREAT AGAIN. \u201cHow do I feel about it?\u201d frowns Matt when the latter is mentioned. \u201cI think it\u2019s \u2026 you shouldn\u2019t get me started on this,\u201d he says, then gets started on it anyway. \u201cI think Britain is known for its sense of humour. We\u2019re cheeky, flirtatious, sadistic, sarcastic, there\u2019s a sense of humour ingrained in all of us, and I think it\u2019s important we don\u2019t lose that. Talking about having to wear goggles when you play conkers is a way of saying let\u2019s not become too careful. We\u2019re meant to smash our knuckles with conkers, we\u2019re meant to fall out of trees and break our wrists. Do you know what I mean? I think people get it when I go on about not wearing goggles.\u201d \u201cI think it could be a suggestion,\u201d offers Luke. \u201cBut to insist that we do things \u2026\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d interrupts Matt. \u201cI don\u2019t even want a suggestion. Goggles in chemistry lessons, fair enough, you might blow yourself up, but conkers \u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI think you understand. I just want to say that I\u2019m more concerned about North Korea than I am about conkers,\u201d he says, then smiles. \u201cBut conkers are right up there.\u201d Bros: After the Screaming Stops is on BBC2, Saturday, 10.45pm. Bros play the O2 Academy Brixton on 5 July",

That means either still in primary school, or at best in the nervous beginnings of secondary.

Life is not like that for every 11-year-old, however, and it is the unlucky ones who are perhaps most likely to end up in the bowels of a police station.

Children as young as nine have been found carrying knives.

Vincent Lambe\u2019s Detainment tells that painful story over again but this time through the transcribed police interviews and court testimony of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, voiced by child actors. The boys had just turned 11 when they stood trial for his death.</p> \n<p>Even a quarter of a century later, all this evokes disturbing feelings. Close your eyes, and you may still be able to see the CCTV images shown night after night; a tiny boy, his hand trustingly in that of an older child, being led off to what we now understand will be his death. His poor mother, Denise, had lost sight of him only for a moment in a busy shopping centre, yet by the time she began frantically searching it was too late. A nation was gripped by every unbearable moment of the trial, which to this day drives debate both about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/05/jon-venables-criminality-attitudes-james-bulger\" title=\"\">possibilities and limits</a> of rehabilitation \u2013 Venables has twice been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/07/james-bulger-killer-jon-venables-pleads-guilty-to-having-indecent-images\" title=\"\">jailed</a> for offences involving child abuse images since being paroled in 2001, while Thompson is still living under his new identity \u2013 and about the social conditions that could have produced such horror. It feels like part of our collective national experience, and yet James does not belong to us. The memory of a dead child belongs first and foremost to his parents, as Lambe apparently failed to appreciate when he did not speak in advance to the Bulger family.</p> \n<p>When Detainment was this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/23/james-bulger-detainment-parents-film-oscar-nomination-denise-fergus-ralph-bulger\" title=\"\">nominated for an Oscar</a> in the best live-action short film category, a title that in this context sounds hideously crass, the family were understandably angry and distressed. Regardless of the artistic merits of the film, there is something grotesque about placing their dead boy in this glitzy, superficial, red-carpeted context.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c09452ab-0b90-418d-a306-2c17c4efed81\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1i-ZBm-mhEs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But that is not their only objection. Friends of the family say they see the film as part of a wider liberal agenda to build sympathy for Venables and Thompson, pushing the memory of their son to one side. They want the focus to stay on James, as for them it always will be. And that is where things get murkier. It would be grossly unfair to demand that the Bulger family see their son\u2019s murderers in any one particular light, but grieving relatives do not ultimately have a veto on how the rest of society engages with difficult moral questions.</p> \n<p>Both Venables and Thompson were said to have been loved but neglected, raised by families struggling with addiction and mental health issues. They were perpetrators and victims of violence, at times both frightened and frightening. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eKZTtJGsi8\" title=\"\">trailers for Detainment</a> \u2013 which is not on cinema release, but is being shown at film festivals \u2013 show the boys weeping and panicking in their police interviews, but Lambe says his film is a factual rather than a sympathetic portrayal, which does not seek to make excuses for them. It is right, he says, that we see them as human beings not monsters; children whose actions need to be explored and understood to prevent such things happening again. It is a crucial and timeless argument and yet the timelessness, in a sense, is the problem. To rake over all this again, with the pain it invariably causes, seems justified only if there is something new to say.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/05/jon-venables-criminality-attitudes-james-bulger\">Jon Venables: how attitudes towards criminality have changed and hardened | Zoe Williams</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For the argument in favour of understanding is almost as old as the crime itself. It was most bravely made at the height of the trial, when feelings were running high on Merseyside and crowds tried to attack police vans bringing the boys to court. But it has been made sporadically ever since on film, in print, in books such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/06/bulger.ukcrime\" title=\"\">Blake Morrison</a>\u2019s troubling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/09/scienceandnature1\" title=\"\">As If</a>.

      "bodyText": "How does an 11-year-old boy end up alone in a London police cell? Eleven years old, for heaven\u2019s sake. That means either still in primary school, or at best in the nervous beginnings of secondary. Eleven still says muddy knees, flapping around in a blazer several sizes too big, and wanting a bedtime story \u2013 or at least it does for the parents of the lucky children. Life is not like that for every 11-year-old, however, and it is the unlucky ones who are perhaps most likely to end up in the bowels of a police station. His solicitor didn\u2019t say what he was accused of doing, when she posted on Twitter earlier this week that \u201cno child should be in a cell. Period.\u201d Her point was that a custody suite is no place for a kid that small, no matter what they might have done. But the mind makes leaps, anyway. Children as young as nine have been found carrying knives. Gangs organising so-called \u201ccounty lines\u201d operations, running drugs from the inner city deep out into rural towns, have been known to recruit from primary schools. I thought about this boy, and what he might or might not have done, when the storm broke over a new film about the murder of toddler James Bulger. Vincent Lambe\u2019s Detainment tells that painful story over again but this time through the transcribed police interviews and court testimony of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, voiced by child actors. The boys had just turned 11 when they stood trial for his death. Even a quarter of a century later, all this evokes disturbing feelings. Close your eyes, and you may still be able to see the CCTV images shown night after night; a tiny boy, his hand trustingly in that of an older child, being led off to what we now understand will be his death. His poor mother, Denise, had lost sight of him only for a moment in a busy shopping centre, yet by the time she began frantically searching it was too late. A nation was gripped by every unbearable moment of the trial, which to this day drives debate both about the possibilities and limits of rehabilitation \u2013 Venables has twice been jailed for offences involving child abuse images since being paroled in 2001, while Thompson is still living under his new identity \u2013 and about the social conditions that could have produced such horror. It feels like part of our collective national experience, and yet James does not belong to us. The memory of a dead child belongs first and foremost to his parents, as Lambe apparently failed to appreciate when he did not speak in advance to the Bulger family. When Detainment was this week nominated for an Oscar in the best live-action short film category, a title that in this context sounds hideously crass, the family were understandably angry and distressed. Regardless of the artistic merits of the film, there is something grotesque about placing their dead boy in this glitzy, superficial, red-carpeted context. But that is not their only objection. Friends of the family say they see the film as part of a wider liberal agenda to build sympathy for Venables and Thompson, pushing the memory of their son to one side. They want the focus to stay on James, as for them it always will be. And that is where things get murkier. It would be grossly unfair to demand that the Bulger family see their son\u2019s murderers in any one particular light, but grieving relatives do not ultimately have a veto on how the rest of society engages with difficult moral questions. Both Venables and Thompson were said to have been loved but neglected, raised by families struggling with addiction and mental health issues. They were perpetrators and victims of violence, at times both frightened and frightening. The trailers for Detainment \u2013 which is not on cinema release, but is being shown at film festivals \u2013 show the boys weeping and panicking in their police interviews, but Lambe says his film is a factual rather than a sympathetic portrayal, which does not seek to make excuses for them. It is right, he says, that we see them as human beings not monsters; children whose actions need to be explored and understood to prevent such things happening again. It is a crucial and timeless argument and yet the timelessness, in a sense, is the problem. To rake over all this again, with the pain it invariably causes, seems justified only if there is something new to say. For the argument in favour of understanding is almost as old as the crime itself. It was most bravely made at the height of the trial, when feelings were running high on Merseyside and crowds tried to attack police vans bringing the boys to court. But it has been made sporadically ever since on film, in print, in books such as Blake Morrison\u2019s troubling As If. The disturbing juxtaposition of childishness and murder is brought alive in the film by a shot of one of the boys sitting in a chair, small feet swinging inches from the floor. But it was captured at the time in court artists\u2019 sketches and trial reports noting how Thompson sucked his thumb in the dock. The unanswered question hanging over Lambe\u2019s film is why now, and why this story of all true stories? If the point was to introduce a new generation to the argument, then why not through the stories of that generation, fictionalised if necessary to avoid intrusion? This week\u2019s story of the 11-year-old languishing in the police cell turned out, in the end, to be both more and less troubling than it initially appeared. The boy\u2019s solicitor, Kerry Hudson, confirmed later that the child concerned was accused of malicious communications over social media \u2013 not a trivial offence, given the impact of cyberbullying on vulnerable teenagers and the way gang violence often escalates from social media beefs, but not the most serious either \u2013 and was later released. The question of how the criminal justice system should approach children of this age committing un-childlike crimes, however, lingers. Every time a teenager stabs another teenager on the way home from school, we are confronted all over again with the terrifying capacity of some children for violence and with questions about the social conditions in which that can happen. Every time, public opinion divides between those seeking to understand why a child carries a knife, and those who (as John Major said of the Bulger case) want to understand a little less and condemn a little more.

Compression in reality The real-world challenges of bandwidth restrictions and a need for speed of audio delivery mean the audiophile\u2019s iron grip over priorities begins to slip away when audio moves into the world of voice. This battle for audio quality appears futile when you consider the myriad devices upon which digital assistants are available, from the high-end headphones which can indeed replicate high quality sounds, through to the small speakers on smartphones, which certainly cannot. So, as lossless compression formats do not do quite enough in terms of file reduction, \u201clossy\u201d formats go further.

By cleverly using auditory masking, which is where quiet sounds concurrent with loud sounds cannot be heard, and psychoacoustics, the branch of psychology concerned with the perception of sound, these compression modes look to only save information that we as listeners can and will notice, and not the stuff we will not. The popularity and proliferation of MP3 and other lossy formats reflect, in part, their extraordinary success in creating perceptively high-quality audio while maintaining small file sizes. At higher bitrates, most people cannot tell the difference. Can you? Not all formats are created equally Yet, with each format applying its own algorithmic strategy on how to create smaller files, it is only when you begin to reduce the amount of data a file holds per second \u2013 from the higher end 320kbps (kilobits per second), 192kbps and 128kbps bitrates of music encoding best practices, to the lower bitrates of 64kbps, 32kbps and even 24kbps recommended for voice \u2013 that noticeable acoustic artifacts begin to emerge. At this lower end, it becomes clear that not all lossy formats were created equally. When the Voice Lab looked at Google\u2019s audio documentation while developing our first project, we were very surprised to see the guide recommends a bitrate of 24kbps for MP3 or Ogg Vorbis. We were surprised, firstly, by the extent to which Google prioritises small file sizes above all else, in recommending such a low bitrate as 24kbps. But secondly, surprised that by recommending MP3 or Ogg Vorbis at the same bitrate, Google appears to suggest these two formats offer a parity of quality when, in reality, they do not. Have a listen to the below video to get an idea of how dramatically different the two codecs of MP3 and Ogg Vorbis perform, even at 48kbps, double the bitrate recommended by Google. Ogg Vorbis comes out the undisputed winner, as it does at lower bitrates. Practicality of use In terms of practical considerations, despite its inferior performance, the widespread proliferation of MP3 makes it the easier format to work with, as default audio players such as iTunes offer MP3 encoding options, allowing easy conversion of your WAV/AIFF files. Using Ogg Vorbis requires a little more effort. For the Voice Lab to use Ogg Vorbis on our Year in Review project, we used a command line utility, FFmpeg, to script batch conversions of our uncompressed audio. Despite requiring an initial upfront effort in set-up, the script saved the team lots of time over the course of the project, and the gains in Ogg Vorbis audio quality were considerable and absolutely worth the effort. It comes as little surprise that Spotify favours encoding its music in Ogg Vorbis over MP3 for precisely this ability to maintain both audio quality and small file sizes. In conclusion, Google\u2019s selection of 24kbps as its recommended bitrate for both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis reflects its focus for audio within voice to be on producing small files sizes for rapid playback, rather than higher fidelity and rich audio. However, by ensuring you do not assume Google\u2019s recommendations for audio suggest parity between the formats, by implementing use of Ogg Vorbis over MP3, you can achieve higher audio quality standards while maintaining those small file sizes and high retrieval speeds that voice requires.

But it was far from clear whether any of those options would succeed in transferring real power to Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the opposition-led national assembly. Military intervention does not appear to be under serious consideration at present, and US defence officials told Voice of America radio they have received no instructions for new deployments. The national security adviser, John Bolton, said the immediate priority was to transfer revenues from the Maduro government to Guaid\u00f3, but admitted that was \u201cvery complicated\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of different things we have to do but that\u2019s in the process,\u201d Bolton said. His remarks gave weight to suggestions the administration had not completely worked out what to do on day two of its ambitious gambit to change the Venezuelan regime. Venezuelan assets can be frozen in the US and other countries supporting Guaid\u00f3, and formally transferred to the national assembly\u2019s \u201cinterim government\u201d. Guaid\u00f3 reportedly has plans to take over control over Citgo, the US-based oil refining subsidiary of the Venezuelan state oil company. He has appointed an ambassador to the Organisation of American States in Washington, a lawyer and former politician, Gustavo Tarre, and there are plans to name other ambassadors to friendly countries. The problem for Guaid\u00f3 and his foreign backers is how to convert assets abroad to real power inside Venezuela, without control over armed services, the ports or the banks. Pompeo announced that the US was ready to send $20m in humanitarian aid, adding that it would be delivered \u201cas soon as logistically possible\u201d. The disbursement and delivery of the assistance could be complicated by the US government shutdown, and the practical difficulties of delivering food and medicine to a territory with hostile security forces. \u201cYou could start trying to move foreign assets and flow of incomes from the US into the hands of the interim government under Juan Guaid\u00f3, but it is far too early to know if that is feasible,\u201d said Ivan Briscoe, the Latin America and Caribbean programme director for the International Crisis Group. \u201cYou could set up a foreign bank accounts, but if it goes to opposition leaders without any control over coercive powers, it just increases the risks of persecution and jail,\u201d Briscoe said. Meanwhile, a complete oil embargo imposed on the Maduro government would have blowback effects on the US economy. Chet Thompson, the president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, wrote to Trump to warn that \u201csanctions on Venezuela\u2019s energy sector would like harm US businesses, workers, and consumers while failing to address the very real issues in Venezuela.\u201d Another option would be designate Venezuela a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d which would lead to more sanctions and travel bans, but it would be hard to justify factually, and would be unlikely to have a serious impact on Maduro\u2019s inner circle, who are already subject to extensive US sanctions. Moises Rendon, associate director of the Americas programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, argued that the US administration was right to provide maximum support to the national assembly at a time of mass street protests and a last-ditch opposition effort to force a return to democracy through peaceful means.

      "bodyText": "Japan will resume commercial whaling for the first time in three decades immediately after it leaves the body responsible for protecting global whale populations. Media reports said a fleet would leave for the country\u2019s coastal waters on 1 July, a day after its official exit from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), whose ban on commercial whaling went into effect in 1986. A ship owned by a fisheries association in Taiji \u2013 known for its annual slaughter of dolphins \u2013 will join four vessels from other whaling towns and hunt minke whales off the north-east coast, Kyodo news agency said, quoting association sources. The decision to openly hunt whales for profit comes weeks after Japan announced its withdrawal from the IWC following years of friction between Tokyo and pro-conservation IWC members such as Australia and New Zealand. The decision drew widespread condemnation, with the Australian government saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d. Some observers, however, have pointed out that the coastal expeditions will be much smaller than previous research hunts and would save hundreds of whales that Japan once caught in more distant waters. Japan used a clause in the moratorium to hunt a certain number of whales in the Antarctic in the name of scientific research, but grew frustrated over its repeated failure to reform the IWC to raise the prospects of a return to commercial whaling. It had argued that the ban was intended as a temporary measure and accused a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d IWC of abandoning its original purpose \u2013 managing the sustainable use of global whale stocks. The country\u2019s coastal fleet will hunt minke whales off northern Japan for about a week, with the vessel from Taiji then sailing south to conduct a solo hunt of Baird\u2019s beaked whales and other smaller species off Chiba prefecture, near Tokyo, until late August, Kyodo said. All five vessels will regroup to hunt off the northernmost island of Hokkaido through to October, it added. The fisheries agency has yet to announce how many whales the fleet plans to kill. Japanese officials claim that populations of certain types of whale \u2013 such as the minke \u2013 have recovered sufficiently to allow the resumption of \u201csustainable\u201d hunting. But some in the industry have questioned whether hunting whales in coastal waters will be commercially viable. Byproduct from Japan\u2019s expeditions to the Antarctic is sold on the domestic market, but the appetite for whale meat has declined dramatically since the postwar years, when it was an important source of protein. Japanese consumers ate 200,000 tons of whale meat a year in the 1960s, but consumption has plummeted to about 5,000 tons in recent years, according to government data. Japan will join Iceland and Norway in openly defying the ban on commercial whale hunting.",

      "bodyText": "An inquiry into Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs light rail has called for a review of public-private partnerships in big infrastructure projects following delays and budget blowouts on the $2.1bn project. The parliamentary inquiry\u2019s final report, released on Friday, made 20 recommendations, including that the state\u2019s auditor-general undertake a review of the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of public-private contracts \u201cfor significant state infrastructure projects\u201d. The light rail project has been beset by myriad problems since it was announced by the former New South Wales premier Barry O\u2019Farrell at the end of 2012. Initially expected to cost $1.6bn and due for completion in 2019, the project has had its budget blown out to at least $2.1bn, and the completion date is now expected to be around May 2020. In April last year, the project\u2019s Spanish contractor, Acciona, launched a $1.1bn lawsuit against the state\u2019s lead transport agency, Transport for NSW, alleging \u201cmisleading or deceptive conduct\u201d before the signing of a contract in 2014 to design and build the project. The committee also recommended that the government review the exemptions provided to projects deemed \u201ccritical state significant infrastructure\u201d. The designation means the NSW Environment Protection Authority cannot issue specific notices to the contractor, and the inquiry heard evidence that it prevented proper enforcement of conditions of approval. During the inquiry, one resident described the designation as a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d that allowed the project to \u201cget away with blue murder and not be held accountable\u201d. Chaired by Christian Democrat MP Fred Nile, the committee in its report detailed issues with the cost of the project as well as the impact on businesses and residents along the project\u2019s route. Nile, in his forward to the report, wrote that the impacts of the construction had been \u201cprofoundly felt\u201d. \u201cMany have experienced excessive noise, dust, vibration and damage to their homes. Some of these issues have been heightened due to construction delays,\u201d he wrote. The committee found that some businesses had closed down as a result of the project, and small businesses had suffered a \u201csevere loss of trade and goodwill\u201d. \u201cNot only have they endured significant financial losses, their physical and mental wellbeing has also been negatively impacted,\u201d he wrote. The government ended up in court with Acciona after the sub-contractor claimed Transport for NSW led it to believe the power company Ausgrid had agreed to a plan to deal with its utilities under the 12.5km route when it had not. Acciona has claimed that Transport for NSW prevented it from dealing directly with Ausgrid, and that the cost of the project had blown out after the electricity provider issued more extensive requirements that amounted to a change in scope on the project. The committee found that warranted a review of the success of the public-private partnership model for large projects. \u201cIn light of project delays and rising costs, complexities associated with the contract structure, and the utility risks and lack of power contractors have to influence utility owners, the committee believes it would be useful for the government to review whether the PPP contract was indeed the most appropriate contract structure for this type of infrastructure project,\u201d the report said. The committee also recommended a full investigation into the mishandling of human remains by a worker, who was seen throwing bones on to the pavement in Surry Hills in October 2018. It also suggested that Transport for NSW should conduct an urgent review of all claims of property damage caused by the delayed project. The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, described the light rail project as \u201cwithout doubt one of the most intensive, intrusive builds\u201d in the state\u2019s history, but argued the government was already implementing many of the report\u2019s recommendations. He said the Coalition would consider the request for an auditor-general review of the PPP process, but said it was a business model he believed in.",

The My Health Record system relies on doctors and medical practices using their own IT systems to upload clinical information about patients, to help ensure continuity of care and improve interactions with healthcare providers. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning An internal briefing to the Australian Digital Health Agency\u2019s data integrity group last month, obtained by Guardian Australia, shows that a software bug began to affect the system in early 2016, which prevented some clinical information systems used by medical practices \u201cfrom uploading clinical documents to the My Health Record system\u201d. The briefing said the error had the potential to cause \u201cmissing clinical information in a consumer\u2019s My Health Record\u201d and \u201camendments not uploading resulting in out-of-date or incorrect information\u201d. \u201cWhen the digital signature issue emerged in 2016, its impact was so significant that it was escalated to the minister for health, and although the issue is being managed it is not completely resolved,\u201d the leaked briefing, dated 18 December 2018, said. But the agency, in a statement to Guardian Australia, has strongly denied any suggestion the 2016 software bug compromised patient records, saying it affected only a tiny proportion of documents and did not leave My Health Records with missing or out-of-date information. \u201cThe matter you refer to accounts for less than 1% of attempted document uploads from clinicians,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe agency rejects any statement that the security or safety of the My Health Record system has been compromised.\u201d Neither the minister, then Sussan Ley, nor the agency publicly announced the error. The agency has also strongly denied any suggestion that the issue is still unresolved, despite what is written in the briefing. It said the bug was quickly dealt with in 2016. \u201cTo be absolutely clear, the agency rejects any assertion that there is any clinical risk to patient safety or long standing problem unresolved since 2016,\u201d a spokeswoman said. The briefing document suggests that, in some cases, medical practices using older software were oblivious to the errors. \u201cThe detectability of this error depended on the clinical information system and the implementation of error reporting,\u201d the agency\u2019s briefing said. \u201cSome clinical information systems did not display an obvious error message.

Last month\u2019s briefing said some doctors were still using the old software. \u201cVendors were then advised of the issue and how to resolve it, however many healthcare providers are still using clinical information systems with the issue rather than the corrected versions created by vendors,\u201d the briefing said. Guardian Australia has confirmed at least one software vendor issued a note to users on how to fix the issue, but not until several months after the bug was first discovered. The agency said it introduced a tool in November allowing it to find the \u201csmall number of clinicians\u201d who were still using the buggy software and advise them of the problem. It said even those providers would receive an alert when their uploads failed. The revelations have prompted a backlash from critics who say the government should have told the public and took too long to take steps to understand the scale of the problem. David Glance, director of the University of Western Australia\u2019s centre for software practice and a frequent critic of the system, said the public should have been told. \u201cThe fact that this wasn\u2019t made public, that GPs weren\u2019t informed that potentially documents weren\u2019t going up there, that hospitals weren\u2019t told that summaries were incomplete ... there\u2019s all sorts of ramifications,\u201d he said. \u201cThis again highlights that the [agency], their standards of transparency, leave a lot to be desired.\u201d The agency would not say why the issue was not publicly announced to give patients and doctors an opportunity to correct the errors.

The problem was that there were other healthcare providers out there who were running systems with this fault and they were able to do so for a very long time without any successful action taken to correct it.\u201d The leaked briefing shows the bug was caused by part of the digital signatures used to help secure and authenticate digital clinical records. Those signatures contain an identifier starting with a randomly generated hexadecimal character \u2013 either one of nine numerical characters or a letter from A to F. An average of 62.5% of all records uploaded to the My Health Record system used a number at the start of their digital signature identifier. The use of numbers at the start of the identifiers became a problem in March 2016 after an update to a Microsoft framework used by the My Health Record system. The update meant that any digital signature identifiers starting with a number caused a \u201cWindows operating system error\u201d. \u201cThis update exposed an issue in the way many clinical information systems created digital signatures preventing the clinical information system from uploading clinical documents to the My Health Record system,\u201d the agency\u2019s briefing said. The agency said it quickly released its own patch to resolve the bug. But the fix also required updates from software vendors and healthcare providers to their own systems.",

Twenty-five million tax-payer dollar-roos would be injected into Morisson\u2019s own electorate to redevelop the site into a \u201csemi-aquatic memorial site\u201d devoted to the arrival of Cook and the Endeavour, with $3m of that scratch going towards the erection of an effigy to honour JC himself. It was a colonial wet dream. At the time I suggested it also provided an illuminating glimpse into the kind of populist campaign the two intended to orchestrate between then and the next election, which was emerging on the political horizon at the time. Speaking to Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph, Morrison said he expected the monument to be \u201cquite lovely\u201d, and he told the Weekend Australian it would create \u201ca place of commemoration and recognition and understanding of two cultures, and the incredible Captain Cook\u201d. In Cooktown on Tuesday, Morrison was plying the same kind of schtick. His government was promising $5.45m for a Cooktown 2020 festival and $6.7m to spruce up the Endeavour replica for a public relations tour around Australia over 14 months, calling into 39 locations along the way. Morrison\u2019s devotion to the memorialisation of James Cook comes to a total of $54.15m \u2026 so far (The Morrison government still has seven days of work scheduled before the latest date an election needs to be held on 18 May). That strikes me as an extraordinarily pricey man fetish at the expense of struggling Australians, but let\u2019s not let that detail deprive us of some giggles. The first is provided by the PM himself, who persists with the claim that memorialising Cook is going to reconcile First Nations people with the version of history Morrison demonstrably prefers. \u201cAs the 250th anniversary nears we want to help Australians better understand Captain Cook\u2019s historic voyage and its legacy for exploration, science and reconciliation,\u201d Morrison said in a statement on Tuesday. As Kenny Bania would say, \u201cIt\u2019s the best, Jerry! The best!\u201d But the PM\u2019s routine was shaded by the response from blackfellas on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday morning in Melbourne\u2019s bayside suburb of St Kilda, the punny word-play \u201cA Racist Endeavour\u201d was added to the Captain Cook statue that sits beside the Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron in Catani Gardens. Aside from the chest of gems under the #ThingsCookDid hashtag on Twitter, there was the mock crowdfunder launched by Jordan Raskopoulos to fund the building of a pirate ship to sink the replica of Endeavour during the circumnavigation stunt. Pledges were sailing in to support the fundraiser before GoFundMe suspended the page, saying it couldn\u2019t process payments for \u201cknives, explosives, ammunition, firearms, or other weaponry.\u201d This prompted Raskopoulos to clarify that the funds would only be used for a ship and \u201cpirate props/costumes so that a pirate themed theatrical protest performance may take place\u201d. And there was more than one cheeky inquiry as to whether Cook\u2019s St Valentine\u2019s Day visit to Hawaii in 1779 could be recreated. Personally, I\u2019d look forward to seeing the Australian public in each of the 39 locations mentioned in Morrison\u2019s announcement recreate the responses of mob all the way up along the east coast of Australia whenever the Endeavour intruded for a sticky-beak in 1770. Cook\u2019s journal repeatedly provides accounts of them waving the Endeavour off, telling it to keep moving, to just go away. Fortunately, I only have to wait until May for the rehearsal.",

Trump\u2019s approval rating during the shutdown came in at 42% with 40% responding that they would support the President \u201cno matter what\u201d, but an undeclared Democratic opponent still leads by 10 points nationally. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBased on the results of this first survey of 2019, the battle of 2018 will carry forward with an even more engaged, more re-aligned and politicized country, to produce an election like nothing we have seen before\u201d the pollsters from Stanley Greenberg, Democracy Corps &amp; Greenberg Research wrote in a memo released with the findings. Here are the rest of the results:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <ul> \n    <li> <strong>The Democratic margin is growing.</strong> Democrats prevailed by 8.6 points nationally in 2018, and in this first poll of 2019, the Democratic candidate for President is ahead by 10 points, 51 to 41 percent, with 5 percent volunteering third party candidates. (Just 3 percent are undecided in a generic presidential ballot against Trump.) That leaves the Trump vote 5 points short of 2016, which would push him back dramatically back behind the Electoral College blue wall. He is losing independents by 11 points and is losing a quarter of moderate Republicans.</li> \n    <li><strong>Voters are nationalized politically. </strong>Fully 92 percent of those who voted for Democrats in 2018 are voting for a Democratic presidential candidate, and 90 percent of those who voted Republican in 2018 are voting for Donald Trump in 2020. All voters of both camps have fully polarized and translating their preferences nationally.</li> \n    <li><strong>The re-alignment continues. </strong>The Democratic candidate is winning Hispanics 62 to 32 percent, millennials 64 to 26 percent, millennial women by a daunting 79 to 16 percent, unmarried women 71 to 22 percent, and even white unmarried women by a two-to-one margin (62 to 30 percent). Every one of those numbers in the Rising American Electorate pushes the 2018 blue wave a step further. </li> \n    <li><strong>White working class women are sending a message.</strong> They currently give the Democrat a 3-point lead over Donald Trump, 49 to 46 percent. </li> \n    <li><strong>Historic level of engagement already.</strong> The most stunning development is the historic level of voter engagement in the first month of the election of the cycle. The percentage who say they are following the election at the highest possible level is already higher than in the last months of 2018 midterms that produced historic levels of off-year turnout. The high level of engagement recorded here for registered voters exceeds what we received for likely voters in 2016. So, by our standard definition of likely voters in a presidential election, we show virtually all registered voters as likely voters. This suggests an historic level of turnout in 2020.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T01:47:14.453Z\">at 1.47am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c4a4c0ae4b024f0efeae0a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-01-25T00:06:17.058Z\">12.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">State Department is pulling government workers out of Venezuela</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Political turmoil spiked in Venezuela this afternoon, after the leader of the Venezuelan armed forces <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/world/americas/venezuela-news-maduro-russia.html\">declared</a> loyalty for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and called the US-supported transitional government under Juan Guaid\u00f3 an attempted coup.</p> \n  <p>The US State Department has now called for all non-emergency government employees to leave the country and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/politics/pompeo-bolton-venezuela-maduro/index.html\">issued</a> a warning to American travelers advising them to leave Venezuela or to stock supplies and \u201cshelter in place\u201d. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1088575780580458499\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sec.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s a wrap for Thursday. Here\u2019s what happened if you\u2019re just tuning in: The government shutdown continues, closing out 33 days of no pay (and a second missed paycheck) for federal workers. The Senate failed to pass both measures to re-opened the government, one backed by Trump and the other by Democrats. The latter earned support from six Republicans. While Senate leaders met to come up with a new plan, the White House said it would only agree to a short-term resolution if it included a \u201ca large down payment on the wall\u201d. CNN reported that the Trump administration already had a draft ready so the president could issue a national emergency order to fund his wall without congressional support. Speaking to reporters today, he was vague about the plans, referring only to \u201cother alternatives\u201d should Congress fail to make a deal that includes wall funding. The situation in Venezuela intensified as Russian financial and military support for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro countered US recognition of his challenger, Juan Guaid\u00f3. The state department has pulled non-emergency officials out of the country and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced the US would provide more than $20m in humanitarian aid. See you tomorrow! NBC is reporting that Jared Kushner\u2019s application for top security clearance moved forward even after issues were flagged during an FBI background check. Two anonymous sources cited in the report told NBC that in addition to Kushner, former Pentagon official Carl Kline overruled career security specialists judgements on at least 30 Trump officials, a move they said was unprecedented. \u201cWhat you are reporting is what all of us feared,\u201d Brad Moss, a lawyer who represents persons seeking security clearances told NBC. \u201cThe normal line adjudicators looked at the FBI report\u2026saw the foreign influence concerns, but were overruled by the quasi-political supervisor\u201d. In a letter to Donald Trump today, Nathan Catura, who heads the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, expressed just how dire the shutdown has been for workers who have now gone without pay for more than a month. Describing the \u201cperilous position\u201d federal workers are facing, he writes that many are depending on GoFundMe pages and soup kitchens to get by. Citing that 27,000 federal agents and officers across 65 federal agencies are represented by his association and that all have had to work with no pay as their jobs are essential to national security, he called the shutdown reprehensible and asked the President to end it. Many of our members conduct complex investigations including tracking terrorists, identifying foreign actors, and protecting elected officials, including you and your family. As the shutdown continues they are being put in both a fiscally and personally compromising position that is antithetical to the way our nation should be treating those that protect us. Twenty-first century law enforcement requires research, analysis and technology. These critical investigative support elements are not working during the shutdown, this compares to half of a team taking a field for a game. The targets of our investigations now have an advantage of being better informed and better resourced than our members. This is an extremely dangerous situation that threatens the lives of our members and all Americans. According to a new poll, released today, Americans are more polarized and pessimistic than ever \u2014 but also more inclined to vote. Trump\u2019s approval rating during the shutdown came in at 42% with 40% responding that they would support the President \u201cno matter what\u201d, but an undeclared Democratic opponent still leads by 10 points nationally. \u201cBased on the results of this first survey of 2019, the battle of 2018 will carry forward with an even more engaged, more re-aligned and politicized country, to produce an election like nothing we have seen before\u201d the pollsters from Stanley Greenberg, Democracy Corps &amp; Greenberg Research wrote in a memo released with the findings. Here are the rest of the results: The Democratic margin is growing. Democrats prevailed by 8.6 points nationally in 2018, and in this first poll of 2019, the Democratic candidate for President is ahead by 10 points, 51 to 41 percent, with 5 percent volunteering third party candidates. (Just 3 percent are undecided in a generic presidential ballot against Trump.) That leaves the Trump vote 5 points short of 2016, which would push him back dramatically back behind the Electoral College blue wall. He is losing independents by 11 points and is losing a quarter of moderate Republicans. Voters are nationalized politically. Fully 92 percent of those who voted for Democrats in 2018 are voting for a Democratic presidential candidate, and 90 percent of those who voted Republican in 2018 are voting for Donald Trump in 2020. All voters of both camps have fully polarized and translating their preferences nationally. The re-alignment continues. The Democratic candidate is winning Hispanics 62 to 32 percent, millennials 64 to 26 percent, millennial women by a daunting 79 to 16 percent, unmarried women 71 to 22 percent, and even white unmarried women by a two-to-one margin (62 to 30 percent). Every one of those numbers in the Rising American Electorate pushes the 2018 blue wave a step further. White working class women are sending a message. They currently give the Democrat a 3-point lead over Donald Trump, 49 to 46 percent. Historic level of engagement already. The most stunning development is the historic level of voter engagement in the first month of the election of the cycle. The percentage who say they are following the election at the highest possible level is already higher than in the last months of 2018 midterms that produced historic levels of off-year turnout. The high level of engagement recorded here for registered voters exceeds what we received for likely voters in 2016. So, by our standard definition of likely voters in a presidential election, we show virtually all registered voters as likely voters. This suggests an historic level of turnout in 2020. Political turmoil spiked in Venezuela this afternoon, after the leader of the Venezuelan armed forces declared loyalty for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and called the US-supported transitional government under Juan Guaid\u00f3 an attempted coup. The US State Department has now called for all non-emergency government employees to leave the country and issued a warning to American travelers advising them to leave Venezuela or to stock supplies and \u201cshelter in place\u201d. The move followed declarations from Maduro that he was planning to close the Venezuelan Embassy and all consulates in the US. Venezuela has had two presidents since Jan 10, when Maduro declared himself the winner of a largely-boycotted election, internationally considered to be a sham. Maduro has received financial, diplomatic, and military support from Moscow, and the Kremlin has cautioned US officials not to intervene, the New York Times reports. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ignored the admonitions and intensified the Trump administration\u2019s call for other countries to accept Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and renounce Mr. Maduro. \u2018His regime is morally bankrupt, it\u2019s economically incompetent, and it is profoundly corrupt, and it is undemocratic to the core\u2019 Mr. Pompeo told a meeting of the 35-member Organization of American States in Washington\u201d. The Washington Post is reporting that the Koch political network, one of the most powerful rightwing funders, will not support President Trump in 2020. The decision reflects a narrow path that the influential network led by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch has sought to walk in the Trump era: aligning with the president on some policy issues while withholding its electoral firepower on his behalf. The network\u2019s plan to stay out of the 2020 race was quietly relayed to major donors in recent months, according to people familiar with the conversations. It comes as the network has sought to shift attention from its political activities to its investments in education and philanthropy. Donors say they expect to discuss the issue at a retreat for top network contributors this weekend.\u201d The group will still offer significant investments for Senate and House races, along with a new initiative to reduce poverty. Gabrielle Canon here, taking over for Lauren Gambino for the rest of the evening. As negotiations with top Democrats over funding for the border wall continue at an impasse, CNN is reporting that the Trump Administration has already drafted a backup plan. Should Congress fail to grant the president a down payment for his wall, he may be prepared to declare a national emergency and try to secure $7 billion: Trump has not ruled out using his authority to declare a national emergency and direct the Defense Department to construct a border wall as Congress and the White House fight over a deal to end the government shutdown. But while Trump\u2019s advisers remain divided on the issue, the White House has been moving forward with alternative plans that would bypass Congress. \u2018The massive amount of aliens who unlawfully enter the United States each day is a direct threat to the safety and security of our nation and constitutes a national emergency\u2019, a draft of a presidential proclamation reads\u201d. In early January, Trump moved away from his threat to declare a national emergency saying he wanted \u201cCongress to do its job\u201d. But speaking to reporters today, the president said if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached between McConnell and Schumer he might employ other options. \u201cI have other alternatives if I have to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have a wall in this situation\u201d. The Senate failed to pass two measures that would have re-opened the government, one backed by Trump and the other by Democrats. The latter earned support from six Republicans. Donald Trump and the Senate leaders are in discussion over re-opening the government on a temporary basis after the president\u2019s plan failed in the Senate. The White House said it would only agree to a short-term resolution if it included a \u201ca large downpayment on the wall\u201d. Elsewhere in Washington, the annual US Conference of Mayors turned into a cattle call for potential 2020 presidential candidates. VP Joe Biden and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti were among several politicians who painted an aspirational vision of America in remarks that could double as as a stump speech. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders weighs in on ongoing Schumer-McConnell summit. She states that any solution must come with a \u201clarge down payment on the wall\u201d. Trump has repeatedly asked for $5.7bn but this statement doesn\u2019t name a price. Senator Johnny Isakson, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic proposal, has raised another reason for re-opening the government as quickly as possible. It\u2019s a point Lewinsky made herself earlier this week. In the absence of progress there is movement, literal movement, from the floor of the Senate to the Majority Leader\u2019s office. Summing up the day\u2019s events: We\u2019re right where we started when we got here today.\u201d Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas A Democratic plan that would extend current funding levels for two weeks and open the shuttered departments has failed, albeit by a smaller margin than Trump\u2019s proposal. The Senate voted 52-44, falling short again of the 60-vote threshold. Six Republicans voted for the measure, including senators Johnny Isakson, Mitt Romney, Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Cory Gardner. A proposal that would have given Trump funding for his wall and re-open the shuttered departments of the government failed in a 50-47 vote*. The measure needed 60 votes to pass. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the long Democrat to break ranks and support the bill while Republicans Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mike Lee of Utah voted against the measure. Now the chamber will proceed to a vote on the Democratic measure to reopen and fund the government for two weeks. It offers no money for the border wall. We\u2019re watching now to see which measure garners more support from across the aisle as a possible starting point for negotiations to end the 34-day shutdown. *The outcome was incorrectly announced in the chamber as 51-47. It was 50-47. Michael Ertel, Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s newly appointed Secretary of State, has \u201cresigned after photos emerged of him posing as a Hurricane Katrina victim in blackface at a private Halloween party 14 years ago,\u201d according to the Tallahassee Democrat. The paper obtained photos taken of Ertel in 2005, eight months after he was appointed Seminole County supervisor of elections and two months after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. The Democrat showed the photos to the governor\u2019s office and hours later received a statement that DeSantis had accepted Ertel\u2019s resignation. The paper said it sent the photos to Ertel last week and he identified himself in the photo as the white man in blackface and red lipstick, wearing earrings and a New Orleans Saints bandanna, and falsies. The fallout from Wilbur Ross\u2019s comments this morning continue. Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, a freshman Democrat from Virginia, invited Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to join her at the Capital Area Food Bank this weekend \u201cto meet with and help serve federal employees who have been affected by the government shutdown\u201d. \u201cTo express confusion over why these hard-working Americans \u2013 many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck \u2013 would seek assistance in feeding their families demonstrates an uninformed understanding of their situation,\u201d Wexton said in a statement. \u201cI hope Secretary Ross will join me this weekend to lend a hand to our federal employees and learn just how the shutdown has turned their lives upside-down.\u201d A vote on the first measure is underway but several senators are still making their way to the floor so this could take several more minutes. In the meantime, here\u2019s the fiery exchange from moments ago between Senators Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, and Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas. Ahead of the vote, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, is on the floor urging Republicans to support their short-term plan to re-open the government. \u201cSupporting our amendment doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t support strong border security. To the contrary: it starts funding that effort once again,\u201d he said in a plea to Republicans. Democrats have vowed not to negotiate on border security until after the government is opened. Several House Democrats, led by the chamber\u2019s appropriations chair, Nita Lowey, are watching from the floor of the Senate as they vote. For those keeping track at home, another pearl of wisdom from America\u2019s most quotable senator. In 2020 news, senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren will propose a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on those making more than $50m in an effort to tackle soaring income inequality, the Washington Post reported. It\u2019s getting heated on the Senate floor ahead of a vote on dueling bills to re-open the federal government. Here\u2019s what to expect in just a few short minutes. The majority leader will first bring up the first proposal designed to meet Trump\u2019s demands for $5.7bn for a wall along the southern border. It would also provide temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants who came to to the country illegally as children and would pause plans to end \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d (TPS) for some Latin American and African nations. The Democratic measure would extend the current funding levels for all shuttered departments until 8 February, allowing the government to re-open and federal employees to return to work. It would provide no additional money for border security. The bill does not address the state of DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, or TPS holders. Neither are expected to pass. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the only Democrat so far who has said he would vote for Trump\u2019s measure, though he will also vote for the second proposal. Three Republican senators have said they would vote for the Democratic proposal \u2013 but that won\u2019t be enough to reach the 60-vote threshold. After that, a bipartisan group of senators will reportedly press for a possible short-term resolution. We\u2019re turning back to the Conference of mayors where LA Mayor Eric Garcetti is delivering remarks that could very much serve as the foundation of a campaign stump speech. \u201cIt\u2019s time to demand that Washington follow our lead, instead of the other way around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time that our nation is led from the bottom up, rather than the top down. It\u2019s time to flip Washington on its head.\u201d \u201cAmerica right now is crying out for leadership, leadership I know exists in this room,\u201d he continues. \u201cThere are two Americas: Washington and the rest of us.\u201d Guardian reporter Erin Durkin sends this report about the difficulties federal employees face when applying for loans. \u201cOne of the challenges the workers are going to face in getting loans is they have zero income right now. Your income is the most important driver of your ability to get a loan,\u201d said Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. He said that while some local banks and credit unions around the country have offered interest-free loans to affected federal workers, that is not something all workers can count on. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s few and far between in terms of availability, Gillis said. Getting a loan is not as simple as walking into a bank and asking for one, even for people with once-steady incomes. \u201cFor virtually every loan, you need some collateral. The concept of walking into a financial institution and saying, \u2018I need a loan for 30 days to carry me through\u2019 is a ludicrous concept,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have collateral, which is why some people may tap into second mortgages on their homes. But the fastest and easiest way to obtain cash is through high-cost payday lending institutions, which is a horrible position for consumers to be in.\u201d He warned that federal workers may be ensnared by notorious payday loan operations, which charge sky-high interest rates. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very easy for some of these folks to become victims of payday lenders, and end up paying 200%, 300% interest because they need the money fast and they may not have the credit rating necessary to get a personal loan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the perfect environment for payday lenders to wreak havoc.\u201d Wilbur Ross tries to clarify his comments from earlier, which has attracted a lot of criticism. An hour before the Senate is expected to vote on two bills that would re-open the government, the Vice President is on the Hill. Politico is reporting that the number of federal employees filing for unemployment has \u201cmore than doubled in the second week of January,\u201d according to government data published Thursday. More than 25,000 federal employees filed for unemployment as of Jan. 12, up from 10,500 the week prior, the Labor Department reported. By comparison, fewer than 1,700 federal workers filed for unemployment during the same period last year. Jim Acosta has some follow-up comments on the Trump administration, writes the Associated Press. CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, who has frequently and publicly clashed with Donald Trump, as well as other officials, has a book coming out June 11. He\u2019s calling it \u201cThe Enemy of the People,\u201d Trump\u2019s inflammatory insult for the cable network and other mainstream media outlets whose reporting displeases him. HarperCollins Publishers (owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp) told AP on Thursday that Acosta would describe the \u201cnear-constant conflict\u201d in covering Trump (is that news? Regardless, there\u2019s appetite) and offer portraits of press secretary Sarah Sanders and others. One wonders what that will do for the Trump-Murdoch bromance... The ripple effect from the 34-day shutdown: Here\u2019s a summary of the main events in American politics so far today: \u2022The Senate will press ahead with votes this afternoon on competing bills to end the government shutdown, one from the Trump camp (with wall), one from the Pelosi camp (no wall), with negligible hope of either passing. \u2022 Michael Cohen has been subpoenaed to appear before the Senate intelligence committee, one day after he asked to postpone an appearance before the House oversight committee. \u2022House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, was pleased the president agreed not to deliver the State of the Union address until after the government opens again, though Republicans criticized her move to block it. \u2022The United Nations will head an \u201cindependent international inquiry\u201d into the murder of Saudi Arabian dissident and journalist for the Washington Post, Jamal Khashoggi. Michael Cohen\u2019s attorney Lanny Davis has called for Congress to censure Donald Trump for \u201cwitness tampering\u201d, related to alleged intimidation against the family of Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer. And Davis wants a criminal investigation into the president\u2019s current highest-profile lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. \u201cToday I am calling for an immediate House resolution against Trump for congressional witness tampering and obstruction due horrible multiple threats to Michael\u2019s family, and an immediate criminal investigation and possible indictment of Giuliani for the same conduct, since he does not have likely presidential immunity,\u201d Davis said in a statement to CNBC. He had earlier spoken on the topic on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. In other news, the American people have spoken and they want Cardi B to give the State of the Union rebuttal. Late night host Stephen Colbert started the petition to get the singer to deliver the response. It now has more than 24,000 retweets and nearly 47,000 likes. The Senate Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena for Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen, his attorney Lanny Davis has confirmed. \u201cThis morning the Senate Intelligence Committee served Michael Cohen with a subpoena,\u201d Davis said in a statement. The subpoena comes one day after Cohen asked to postpone an appearance before the House Oversight Committee, which had been scheduled for next week. Cohen cited \u201congoing threats against his family\u201d from the President and his attorney Rudy Giuliani. Cohen pleaded guilty last month to lying to Congress about how long into Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency he and his advisor pursued a deal to develop a tower in Russia\u2019s capital. The committee declined to comment. Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, who represents conservative West Virginia, said he will vote for both measures today. \u201cEven though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov &amp; get WVians back to work,\u201d he said on Twitter. The House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is calling on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders to stay in Washington this weekend and hash out a resolution to the shutdown. He called her letter uninviting the president from delivering his state of the union address a \u201clow point in history\u201d but said recessing without a solution to the shutdown was an even \u201clower point\u201d. Echoing Trump\u2019s boast, he says the Congressional leaders could reach an agreement in just \u201c45 minutes\u201d. Asked if Americans should feel safe while traveling given the chaos the shutdown is causing at airports, McCarthy said he\u2019d leave that to the experts. \u201cMy travel has been very safe,\u201d he added. He said he had not seen the commerce secretary\u2019s comments about federal workers but said that they are certainly being hurt by the ongoing closures. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m staying here and I want every other leader to be in the room,\u201d he said. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has \u201chope\u201d that his chamber will pass a funding bill that has a prayer of being signed in to law by the president. CNN is reporting that the president\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen has been subpoenaed by the Senate Intelligence Committee, citing a \u201csource close to Cohen\u201d. Earlier this week, Cohen postponed his appearance before the House Oversight Committee after claiming that he and his family felt threatened by the president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. The CNN report says Cohen has the same concerns regarding the safety of his family and it is unclear how he will respond. A spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment on the report. Reuters is reporting that the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions will travel to Turkey next week to head an \u201cindependent international inquiry\u201d into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the nation\u2019s consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. \u201cI will be heading an independent international inquiry into the killing of Saudi journalist Mr. Jamal Khashoggi, commencing with a visit to Turkey from 28 January to 3 February 2019,\u201d independent U.N. investigator Agnes Callamard said in an email reply to Reuters in Geneva. Callamard said that she would evaluate the circumstances of the crime, and \u201cthe nature and the extent of states\u2019 and individuals\u2019 responsibilities for the killing\u201d. \u201cMy findings and recommendations will be reported to the U.N. Human Rights Council at the June 2019 session,\u201d she said. The bill passed largely along party lines and is all but certain to go nowhere in the Senate. The measure the latest in a series of measures passed by the Democratic-controlled House to restore funding to the closed departments. The vote was 231 to 180, with five Republicans supporting the bill and one Democrat, freshman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, voting against it. Meanwhile, likely 2020 contender, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper is speaking at the Conference of Mayors in Washington. As an aside, the former governor likely asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the opposite of woe,\u201d which is the title of his memoir. At least one White House resident was watching Pelosi\u2019s press conference: But maybe he tuned in late and missed her reference to Ross\u2019 comments. \u201cAs you know last night the president accepted the fact that the State of the Union should be at a *time* when we can talk about the State of the Union,\u201d Pelosi said in opening remarks at her weekly press conference. \u201cI\u2019m glad we got that off the table.\u201d Pelosi goes after Wilbur Ross for his widely criticized comments questioning why federal workers are going to food banks. \u201cIs this the let-them-eat-cake-kind of attitude ... or call your dad for money?\u201d she said. In an appearance on CNBC, Ross said he \u201cdidn\u2019t quite understand\u201d why workers would need to resort to that. He suggested struggling federal employees borrow from a bank or credit union, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no real reason why they shouldn\u2019t be able to get a loan against it\u201d. Pelosi also urged Senate Republicans to support legislation that would extend funding for two weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for Senate Republicans not to pass this legislation,\u201d Pelosi said. She reiterated that Democrats support stronger border security. \u201cLet\u2019s have that discussion after we open up government.\u201d Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has signed a letter urging the president and Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which was shuttered as a result of the shutdown that began on 22 December. In the letter, Kelly, who headed the department before becoming chief of staff, and four past DHS secretaries, called it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that DHS employees are struggling to care for their families while being asked to protect and secure the nation\u2019s borders. \u201cDHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWe call on our elected leaders to restore the funding necessary to ensure our homeland remains safe and that the Department\u2019s critical national security functions continue without compromise.\u201d The letter did not go unnoticed by Democrats. Virginia senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, who represent the largest number of federal employees in the country, are at Reagan National Airport this morning to raise awareness about the impact the shutdown is having on the government workers who make air travel possible. Last night, union leaders representing air traffic controllers, pilots and flight attendants issued a dire warning: \u201cWe cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented.\u201d Democrats are planning to unveil a package on Friday that will include at least $5bn in funding for border security \u2013 roughly the same amount Trump is asking for his wall. Mississippi congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told reporters the allotment would help fund immigration judges and drone technology. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no money for the wall,\u201d he said. The head of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s opioid advisory team says officials are risking American lives by continuing to approve new high-strength opioid painkillers, according to an exclusive interview with veteran Guardian reporter Chris McGreal. Dr Raeford Brown told the Guardian there is \u201ca war\u201d within the FDA as officials in charge of opioid policy have \u201cfailed to learn the lessons\u201d of the epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people over the past 20 years and continues to claim about 150 lives a day. Brown accused the agency of putting the interests of narcotics manufacturers ahead of public health, most recently by approving a \u201cterrible drug\u201d, Dsuvia, in a process he alleged was manipulated. \u201cThey should stop considering any new opioid evaluation,\u201d said Brown. \u201cFor every day and every week and every month that the FDA don\u2019t do the right thing, people drop dead on the streets. What they do has a direct impact on the mortality rate from opioids in this country.\u201d For more read the piece here or read his book on the subject, American Overdose: The Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts There are nine Democrats running for president and more are jumping in to the race seemingly every day. But there\u2019s a constituency waiting, somewhat impatiently, on the decision of one man in particular: Bernie Sanders. His supporters are staging another \u201cWeekend of Action\u201d to nudge the senator into the presidential race. Organizing for Bernie, Our Revolution, Progressive Democrats of America and The People for Bernie Sanders will host house parties and canvassing events designed to remind Sanders that he has an \u201carmy\u201d ready to deploy as soon as he gives the signal. A Florida politician was formally condemned over disparaging remarks she made about congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, according to the the Miami Herald. Hallandale Beach voted Wednesday night to condemn one of its city commission members over remarks she made on social media that denigrated the first Palestinian-American woman elected to the U.S. Congress. In a 3-2 vote, the commission officially condemned the comments of Commissioner Anabelle Lima-Taub who said in a Facebook post that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Detroit, might become \u201ca martyr and blow up Capitol Hill\u201d. Tlaib is one of the first of two Muslim women who was elected to Congress in November. Lima-Taub has remained unapologetic for the viral Facebook post, stating Tlaib\u2019s support for boycotting Israel equates her with terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, who may or may not have some big 2020 news to make later this afternoon, is planning to throw \u201cthe best party you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d if the LA Rams win the Super Bowl. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see this town come alive,\u201d he told TMZ, who caught the mayor on his way to DC for the Conference of Mayors. \u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing that LA doesn\u2019t have sports fans. We love sports and we love the Rams.\u201d The Fox News poll found that 3 in 4 Americans consider the government shutdown an \u201cemergency or major problem\u201d. Meanwhile, 51% of respondents blame Trump for the mess compared to 34% who blame Democrats. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado who faces a tough re-election in 2020, will break with his party and vote for the Democratic plan to re-open the government without funding for Trump\u2019s border wall, according to an editorial published on Wednesday night by the Denver Post. \u201cColorado Republican senator Cory Gardner\u2019s spokesman told us Wednesday he intends to vote for a clean funding bill that would open the government with no increased border-security funding attached,\u201d the editorial board wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Gardner was the first Republican to break with his party over the shutdown. The Associated Press reports that \u201cthe number of people seeking jobless benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since November 1969, a sign the job market remains strong despite the partial government shutdown, now in its fifth week\u201d. The labor department said Thursday that weekly applications for unemployment aid declined 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000. The four-week average, a less volatile figure, dropped 5,500 to 215,000. The tally of furloughed federal employees requesting unemployment aid jumped to 25,419, more than double the previous week. Those figures are tracked separately from other unemployment claims. Weekly applications for jobless aid are a proxy for layoffs. The data suggests employers are confident enough about the economy to hold onto their workers. The labor department was funded before the shutdown and is still releasing its weekly report. Joe Biden is speaking now amid speculation that he will run for president in 2020. \u201cI ran for the United States Senate because being a local official was too hard,\u201d the former VP quips, drawing laughs from the mayors in the crowd. \u201cThey know where you live.\u201d He then appears to handicap his own candidacy. \u201cNo one ever doubts that I mean what I say. The problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean.\u201d He then addresses a story in the New York Times that detailed a paid speech he gave to a Republican-leaning audience in the battleground state of Michigan three weeks before the 2018 midterm elections. During his remarks he praised Republican congressman Fred Upton who was at the time facing the toughest race of his political career. He won the race by 4.5 points. \u201cI read in the New York Times today that if I run for president, one of my problems will be that I like Republicans,\u201d he said, then made the sign of the cross. \u201cBless me father, for I have sinned.\u201d Biden speaks at length about the urgency of climate change before concluding: \u201cI think we gotta start to believe in our people again.They\u2019re tougher than you think they are. They\u2019re ready to do great things. They\u2019re looking to be lead.\u201d From the Department of Lacking Empathy: In 2017, the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, reported about $700m in assets (though he claims he\u2019s worth about $2bn more than that). Donald Trump has been up and tweeting since at least 6.30am. He began his morning with a tweet plugging the new book Game of Thorns by Doug Wead. \u201cThe book covers the campaign of 2016, and what could be more exciting than that?\u201d Trump said. He then complained that the media isn\u2019t covering the \u201cgreat\u201d economy before turning his attention to his longtime former lawyer, Michael Cohen. He then again complained about the media coverage of his summit with Kim Jong-un before then returning to one of his favorite subjects: the Wall. Good morning and welcome to day 34 of the partial government shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks. Late last night Donald Trump announced that he would postpone his State of the Union address after a day of escalating tension between the president and the Speaker of the House. This afternoon the Senate will vote on a pair of dueling bills that would fund the shuttered agencies and re-open the government. Both are likely to fail. Meanwhile, many of the nation\u2019s most prominent mayors are gathered in Washington for the annual Conference of Mayors. The event was already the launch pad for one presidential campaign, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and on Thursday we\u2019re expecting to hear from several more 2020 hopefuls starting, with former vice-president Joe Biden at 8.45am. After that, the speakers include former governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Senators Jeff Merkeley and Cory Booker.",

If our neighbours are known as \u2018Macedonians\u2019 who speak the \u2018Macedonian\u2019 language that in the future could be the basis for territorial claims.\u201d Tsipras\u2019s minority administration, which controls 145 MPs in the 300-seat house following Kammenos\u2019s departure, needs the support of six opposition deputies to pass the draft bill into law and with the backing of centrists and Independent Greek party defectors is expected to win the vote. But the response could be combustible and unexpected in a country that that has become increasingly polarised as general elections loom. \u201cWe will take to the streets as they have done in France,\u201d said Orfanoudakis, the Cretan farmer. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be chaos. After eight years of financial crisis, of having foreigners pauperise us, they are not going to take our Macedonia away too.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Welcome back, Mr Hazard. We\u2019ve been expecting you. On a chilly, boisterous night under the low white lights at Stamford Bridge Chelsea reached the final of the Carabaou Cup. They did so thanks to a first half during which they scored twice and played with an unmannered freedom, not so much Sarri-ball as a team settling back into a comfortable old pair of shoes.</p> <p>Crucially Eden Hazard was restored from the start to a place on the left flank he never should have left. And for 45 minutes Hazard was sublime, a player reaching out into those old familiar spaces and reminding his manager that in this stitched-together Chelsea team there are some things you can only break by trying to fix.</p> <p>One step beyond, the PA blared at the end of this tie. For Spurs that step will have to wait. Chelsea had strolled their way through the penalty shootout, Jorginho, Willian and finally David Luiz producing wondrously impudent spot-kicks. By contrast Eric Dier will, no doubt regret opting to take his while apparently wearing a pair of mud-clogged fishing waders, all the better to punt the ball high into the Matthew Harding end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">Chelsea\u2019s David Luiz books Carabao Cup final spot in shootout win against Spurs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Penalties aside, this was a tie Hazard did most to win, leading Maurizio Sarri to a first domestic cup final and perhaps also, to a moment of clarity. For the last few weeks Sarri has watched in apparent bewilderment as Hazard struggled as a No 9, spluttering and stalling like a Maserati trying to bump its way through a field of turnips. In the buildup Chelsea\u2019s manager had questioned the leadership capacities of his best player, although there has been a degree of cultural misunderstanding over this. Sarri did not blast or slam or roast Hazard. It is simply the way he communicates, a manager who feels an he can and must speak from the heart and the spleen. Whatever Sarri\u2019s motivation it worked in the first half as Chelsea tried repeatedly to find the space behind Tottenham\u2019s full-backs. It was here that Hazard lurked, ambling that familiar coiled way.</p> <p>The opening goal arrived just before the half hour via a deflected shot from N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Hazard had taken the corner that led to it. He made and finished the second, taking the ball in Hazard Country, that deep inside-left channel, rolling it to Pedro, who funnelled it on to Cesar Azpilicueta.</p> <p>The cross was skimmed perfectly in to Hazard\u2019s path. His finish was lovely, letting the ball travel across his body and pinging it away into the far corner, a finish so relaxed it might have been executed from a prone position, paperback in one hand, left foot lolling over the edge of his favourite inflatable swan.</p> <p>After which Hazard ran the game for a while in his urgent, scurrying way. He dropped deep and passed crossfield with a flourish. He dropped even deeper and floated another long pass, Pirlo-style, into Kant\u00e9\u2019s run. This was, for a while, Total Hazard, a left-sided forward free to make the game up in front of him, and looking in those moments like the only grown up on the pitch, a footballer playing under a slightly different gravity to everyone else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-win-players-enthusiasm\">Maurizio Sarri says Chelsea win can help players find \u2018enthusiasm\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spurs pressed back hard and Fernando Llorente scored with a wonderful header to make it 2-2 on aggregate. Hazard kept on running hard. Chelsea might have won it in normal time. They never looked like losing it on penalties.</p> <p>At the end of which Hazard\u2019s performance here felt like a regal rebuke. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used to fret that Hazard was not nasty enough, that he was too mild and too sane to ever really become an attacking machine in the <em>gal\u00e1ctico</em> mould. You do not have to be an obsessively driven narcissist to score 30 goals season after season in pursuit of undying sporting fame.

      "bodyText": "Welcome back, Mr Hazard. We\u2019ve been expecting you. On a chilly, boisterous night under the low white lights at Stamford Bridge Chelsea reached the final of the Carabaou Cup. They did so thanks to a first half during which they scored twice and played with an unmannered freedom, not so much Sarri-ball as a team settling back into a comfortable old pair of shoes. Crucially Eden Hazard was restored from the start to a place on the left flank he never should have left. And for 45 minutes Hazard was sublime, a player reaching out into those old familiar spaces and reminding his manager that in this stitched-together Chelsea team there are some things you can only break by trying to fix. One step beyond, the PA blared at the end of this tie. For Spurs that step will have to wait. Chelsea had strolled their way through the penalty shootout, Jorginho, Willian and finally David Luiz producing wondrously impudent spot-kicks. By contrast Eric Dier will, no doubt regret opting to take his while apparently wearing a pair of mud-clogged fishing waders, all the better to punt the ball high into the Matthew Harding end. Penalties aside, this was a tie Hazard did most to win, leading Maurizio Sarri to a first domestic cup final and perhaps also, to a moment of clarity. For the last few weeks Sarri has watched in apparent bewilderment as Hazard struggled as a No 9, spluttering and stalling like a Maserati trying to bump its way through a field of turnips. In the buildup Chelsea\u2019s manager had questioned the leadership capacities of his best player, although there has been a degree of cultural misunderstanding over this. Sarri did not blast or slam or roast Hazard. It is simply the way he communicates, a manager who feels an he can and must speak from the heart and the spleen. Whatever Sarri\u2019s motivation it worked in the first half as Chelsea tried repeatedly to find the space behind Tottenham\u2019s full-backs. It was here that Hazard lurked, ambling that familiar coiled way. The opening goal arrived just before the half hour via a deflected shot from N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Hazard had taken the corner that led to it. He made and finished the second, taking the ball in Hazard Country, that deep inside-left channel, rolling it to Pedro, who funnelled it on to Cesar Azpilicueta. The cross was skimmed perfectly in to Hazard\u2019s path. His finish was lovely, letting the ball travel across his body and pinging it away into the far corner, a finish so relaxed it might have been executed from a prone position, paperback in one hand, left foot lolling over the edge of his favourite inflatable swan. After which Hazard ran the game for a while in his urgent, scurrying way. He dropped deep and passed crossfield with a flourish. He dropped even deeper and floated another long pass, Pirlo-style, into Kant\u00e9\u2019s run. This was, for a while, Total Hazard, a left-sided forward free to make the game up in front of him, and looking in those moments like the only grown up on the pitch, a footballer playing under a slightly different gravity to everyone else. Spurs pressed back hard and Fernando Llorente scored with a wonderful header to make it 2-2 on aggregate. Hazard kept on running hard. Chelsea might have won it in normal time. They never looked like losing it on penalties. At the end of which Hazard\u2019s performance here felt like a regal rebuke. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used to fret that Hazard was not nasty enough, that he was too mild and too sane to ever really become an attacking machine in the gal\u00e1ctico mould. You do not have to be an obsessively driven narcissist to score 30 goals season after season in pursuit of undying sporting fame. But it helps. There is a strong suspicion Hazard really will make that move to Real Madrid at the end of the season. Here he showed enough edge to suggest some unfinished business before he does.",

      "bodyText": "British taxpayers face a \u00a324bn bill for tax relief awarded to oil and gas companies removing hundreds of North Sea wells, rigs and pipelines, the UK public spending watchdog has said. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the figure would climb if companies collapse and are unable to pay for cleaning up their operations, leaving the government to pick up the tab. The industry has contributed more than \u00a3300bn in tax revenues to the Treasury since the 1960s. North Sea production peaked in the mid-1980s and the late 1990s, and has been declining ever since. Tax revenue peaked at about 3% of GDP during the 1980s, but slumped as output from the region declined. A combination of low oil prices and decommissioning costs resulted in the industry becoming a net drain on the government purse for the first time in 2016. The NAO, in a report on the cost of decommissioning the region\u2019s oil and gas fields, said the Treasury faced a \u00a324bn bill because of tax arrangements. About half of the figure comes from decommissioning reducing companies\u2019 taxable profits, with the rest from tax reliefs based on the large sums of tax paid historically. Those reliefs allow companies to offset decommissioning costs against revenue, cutting the amount of tax they pay on their profits. The vast majority of the costs will land over the next 20 years, with a small amount falling as late as the 2060s. However, the watchdog warned the \u00a324bn estimate was \u201chighly uncertain\u201d as it relied on factors that are hard to predict, such as future oil prices. The bill could also be bigger if oil and gas companies become insolvent, leaving the government liable for clean-up costs. \u201cTaxpayers are ultimately liable for the total cost of decommissioning assets that operators cannot decommission,\u201d the NAO said. The report revealed there have already been cases of companies defaulting on their clean-up obligations. The Treasury had to pay out \u00a35.4m in 2016 and \u00a345m in 2017 for decommissioning because of unnamed companies not meeting the costs. Decommissioning involves everything from plugging old wells to removing the miles of pipelines on the seabed in the region. The industry has been a set a target of reducing the total costs of decommissioning \u2013 pegged at \u00a359.7bn in 2017 \u2013 by 35% in three years\u2019 time. However, decommissioning experts said the target is very ambitious. The Oil and Gas Authority, the industry regulator, has rejected freedom of information requests by the Guardian seeking to discover how many decommissioning projects are coming in on budget, on the grounds the data is commercially sensitive. Labour said the government needed to rethink changes last year that allow buyers of oil and gas fields to inherit the seller\u2019s tax relief. Clive Lewis, the shadow Treasury minister, said: \u201cThe obvious issue looming over all of this is the climate emergency. We know we need to urgently be ending the UK\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, not offering yet more tax breaks for big oil companies.\u201d Much of the regulation requiring companies to remove oil and gas structures stems from the response to the 1995 proposal by Shell to sink the Brent Spar oil storage platform in the North Sea. The plan was abandoned after widespread protests by environmentalists. Decommissioning experts said to meet cost targets, more infrastructure may in future need to be left in the North Sea. \u201cOne way of spending 35% less is doing 35% less. If the public purse is getting involved, we owe the public to look at it and not to dismiss it out of hand,\u201d one industry source said. The trade body Oil and Gas UK said it was \u201cwholly committed\u201d to making decommissioning cost-effective and environmentally responsible.

But we may get some insight this Saturday, when the best English player of his generation could play for his new club against Accrington Stanley. While it would be wonderful to see Cole close to his best, the right and proper thing to hope for is a dramatic victory for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/accrington-stanley-dump-charm-fa-cup-derby-county\">the League One side</a>, who, thanks to victories in previous rounds against Colchester, Cheltenham and Ipswich, have a chance to advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history. Accrington operate in a different world to your Coles and your Frank Lampards \u2013 the \u00a3180,000 in prize money they would get for beating Derby would surpass their entire season-ticket revenue \u2013 and the scenes of joy that would accompany a home win on Saturday would be priceless. <strong>PD</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1588a525f3ca842fb6726d657f117fd59025a99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1588a525f3ca842fb6726d657f117fd59025a99/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Accrington players train on the pitch they use at nearby Hyndburn Leisure Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Accrington players train on the pitch they use at nearby Hyndburn Leisure Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Repeat at the Etihad, but different circumstances</h2> <p>It\u2019s deja vu all over again as Manchester City meet Burnley in the FA Cup at the Etihad for the second season in succession. Last year, the sides met in the third round and City ran out easy winners despite going behind. At the time Burnley were seventh in the Premier League while their opponents were coasting towards an easy title win. A little over a year on and much has changed: Pep Guardiola\u2019s men are playing catch-up against a Liverpool team currently enjoying a sunshine break, while Sean Dyche\u2019s squad are fighting for their Premier League lives. While both men treated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/manchester-city-burnley-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">last year\u2019s FA Cup tie</a> with the utmost seriousness, circumstance and necessity suggest they may not do so on Saturday. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>4) Ongoing Arnautovic uncertainty for West Ham</h2> <p>Now Manuel Pellegrini has shown Marko Arnautovic that no individual is bigger than the team, the next task for West Ham\u2019s manager is to restore the Austrian\u2019s hunger. Arnautovic\u2019s attempts to force through a move to China have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/18/marko-arnautovic-bournemouth-china-west-ham\">an unwelcome distraction</a> for West Ham and there are no guarantees the 29-year-old will knuckle down after being dropped against Bournemouth last weekend. While the forward is in contention to feature against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday night, it remains to be seen if strong and decisive management from Pellegrini will draw the right reaction from a seasoned professional whose dismay at being denied a transfer left him unable to play a Premier League game. He could return with a point to prove or could just leave Pellegrini thinking he should have taken the money by sulking for the rest of the season. Only one thing is certain: West Ham need a motivated Arnautovic after witnessing the very worst of Andy Carroll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/19/bournemouth-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\">against Bournemouth</a>. <strong>JS</strong></p> <h2>5) Ricketts hopes to haunt former employers</h2> <p>Following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/07/wolves-liverpool-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">their victory over Liverpool</a>, Wolves travel to New Meadow on what promises to be a bumper payday for Shrewsbury Town. Currently 18th in the third tier, they are managed by Sam Ricketts, who will attempt to mastermind a famous victory over the club he skippered to the League One title in 2014. Ricketts has already made plenty of headlines in this year\u2019s competition, having first been told to stay away from Wrexham\u2019s defeat at the hands of Newport County after being approached by the Shrews while still manager of the Welsh club. Upon taking up his new role, he watched from the technical area as they came from 2-0 down to dispatch Stoke City in a third-round replay. With former Wolves and Wales teammate Dave Edwards now on his playing staff but nursing a minor groin injury, Ricketts has a big decision to make. A player with Wolves for nine years, Edwards is desperate to be involved on Saturday but for his manager it could be a case of ruling with his head rather than his heart. <strong>BG</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fd4cfc7d4d886e0e5fc109b85584fb353f70b9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fd4cfc7d4d886e0e5fc109b85584fb353f70b9e/0_105_3505_2244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shrewsbury manager Sam Ricketts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shrewsbury manager Sam Ricketts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) A loud night under the Den\u2019s lights</h2> <p>While Millwall are battling to stay in the Championship, it would be a mistake for Everton to underestimate Neil Harris\u2019s side. The south Londoners have been on a good run since the festive period and will relish the opportunity to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/21/millwall-close-agreement-lewisham-council-stay-at-the-den\">an evening at the Den</a> as uncomfortable as possible for their Premier League opponents, just as they did when they knocked Bournemouth and Leicester out of the FA Cup two years ago. The banana-skin potential is high. It will be loud and intimidating and Everton will be in trouble if they start with the wrong attitude. Marco Silva, who is under scrutiny after a few disappointing results and toothless displays, must make sure his stars understand what Millwall are about. <strong>JS</strong></p> <h2>7) Newcastle to get stung by Hornets?</h2> <p>It might look like Newcastle have had Watford\u2019s number this season \u2013 they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/03/newcastle-united-watford-premier-league-match-report\">beat Javi Gracia\u2019s team</a> at St James\u2019 Park in November and then held them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/29/watford-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">a draw at Vicarage Road</a> the following month \u2013 but a key feature of each of those games was Watford\u2019s wastefulness. Gerard Deulofeu was the main culprit, repeatedly goofing in front of goal in both matches. If he plays on Saturday, he can expect to get opportunities to atone because Watford are the better team, much happier and far more likely than Newcastle to win a trophy in the foreseeable future, facts that are always worth mentioning to anyone who whines about the nefarious influence of foreign owners in English football. <strong>PD</strong></p> <h2>8) Hall for another popular Hoops return?</h2> <p>Having been thrashed 4-1 at home by Preston last weekend, QPR will hope to avoid further embarrassment on Saturday when League One leaders Portsmouth visit Loftus Road. While Steve McClaren may well give fringe players such as Matt Ingram, Osman Kakay and Bright Osayi-Samuel a game, the QPR player fans would probably most like to see lining up against Pompey is Grant Hall. The defender, once a first-team staple, has completed 90 minutes just twice this season following a 2017 diagnosis of tendonitis which left him sidelined for the best part of two years. Hall has revealed the injury led to him struggling with a bout of depression he felt unable to talk about until QPR director of football Les Ferdinand pointed him in the right direction. The player received a rapturous welcome when he completed the duration of his side\u2019s third-round win against Leeds. He has not played since but fitness permitting should start against Portsmouth. <strong>BG</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53facd24463c12e91530d344616415c9f165247a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53facd24463c12e91530d344616415c9f165247a/330_107_2417_1450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grant Hall, right, celebrating during QPR\u2019s victory over Leeds United in the third round.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grant Hall, right, celebrating during QPR\u2019s victory over Leeds United in the third round.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Newport miss home comforts after third-round shock</h2> <p>Newport County\u2019s punishment for their<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/newport-county-leicester-city-fa-cup-match-report\"> third-round victory over Leicester City</a> is a 540-mile round trip to the Riverside Stadium, where on Saturday they will take on a Middlesbrough side 56 places above them in the league. Having made almost \u00a3500,000 already from this year\u2019s FA Cup, Michael Flynn\u2019s men treated themselves to a night of luxury at The Belfry on Thursday and were due to train at St George\u2019s Park before continuing their journey to Teesside. Despite this pampering, their players would almost certainly prefer to be playing at Rodney Parade, an inhospitable, hostile environment that both Tottenham and Leicester have struggled to deal with in the past year. Getting a result against whatever side Tony Pulis fields will be a tall order, but the prospect of a money-spinning home replay you\u2019d give them every chance of winning will be all the motivation this battling Welsh side needs. <strong>BG</strong></p> <h2>10) Bees v Bees at the Hive</h2> <p>Barnet are the only remaining non-league club in the FA Cup and their most recent match was a 4-0 spanking by Braintree Town, the worst team in the National League. But we should not read too much into a result skewed by a red card shown to their goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, in the third minute. Their form prior to that game was decent, with six wins in nine matches, including that splendid counterattacking triumph at Sheffield United <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/06/sheffield-united-barnet-fa-cup-match-report\">in the third round</a>. They will no doubt aim to do something similar against Brentford on Monday but the Championship side will arrive with ominous momentum. Thomas Frank struggled after replacing Dean Smith as head coach in October, mustering just four points from his first 10 matches in charge, but he has stabilised the side in recent weeks and they are unbeaten in their last seven matches. But has the balance been upset again by the sale of key defender Chris Mepham to Bournemouth? Barnet hope so. <strong>PD</strong></p>",

PD 3) Repeat at the Etihad, but different circumstances It\u2019s deja vu all over again as Manchester City meet Burnley in the FA Cup at the Etihad for the second season in succession. Last year, the sides met in the third round and City ran out easy winners despite going behind. At the time Burnley were seventh in the Premier League while their opponents were coasting towards an easy title win. A little over a year on and much has changed: Pep Guardiola\u2019s men are playing catch-up against a Liverpool team currently enjoying a sunshine break, while Sean Dyche\u2019s squad are fighting for their Premier League lives. While both men treated last year\u2019s FA Cup tie with the utmost seriousness, circumstance and necessity suggest they may not do so on Saturday. BG 4) Ongoing Arnautovic uncertainty for West Ham Now Manuel Pellegrini has shown Marko Arnautovic that no individual is bigger than the team, the next task for West Ham\u2019s manager is to restore the Austrian\u2019s hunger. Arnautovic\u2019s attempts to force through a move to China have been an unwelcome distraction for West Ham and there are no guarantees the 29-year-old will knuckle down after being dropped against Bournemouth last weekend. While the forward is in contention to feature against AFC Wimbledon on Saturday night, it remains to be seen if strong and decisive management from Pellegrini will draw the right reaction from a seasoned professional whose dismay at being denied a transfer left him unable to play a Premier League game. He could return with a point to prove or could just leave Pellegrini thinking he should have taken the money by sulking for the rest of the season. Only one thing is certain: West Ham need a motivated Arnautovic after witnessing the very worst of Andy Carroll against Bournemouth. JS 5) Ricketts hopes to haunt former employers Following their victory over Liverpool, Wolves travel to New Meadow on what promises to be a bumper payday for Shrewsbury Town. Currently 18th in the third tier, they are managed by Sam Ricketts, who will attempt to mastermind a famous victory over the club he skippered to the League One title in 2014. Ricketts has already made plenty of headlines in this year\u2019s competition, having first been told to stay away from Wrexham\u2019s defeat at the hands of Newport County after being approached by the Shrews while still manager of the Welsh club. Upon taking up his new role, he watched from the technical area as they came from 2-0 down to dispatch Stoke City in a third-round replay. With former Wolves and Wales teammate Dave Edwards now on his playing staff but nursing a minor groin injury, Ricketts has a big decision to make. A player with Wolves for nine years, Edwards is desperate to be involved on Saturday but for his manager it could be a case of ruling with his head rather than his heart. BG 6) A loud night under the Den\u2019s lights While Millwall are battling to stay in the Championship, it would be a mistake for Everton to underestimate Neil Harris\u2019s side. The south Londoners have been on a good run since the festive period and will relish the opportunity to make an evening at the Den as uncomfortable as possible for their Premier League opponents, just as they did when they knocked Bournemouth and Leicester out of the FA Cup two years ago. The banana-skin potential is high. It will be loud and intimidating and Everton will be in trouble if they start with the wrong attitude. Marco Silva, who is under scrutiny after a few disappointing results and toothless displays, must make sure his stars understand what Millwall are about. JS 7) Newcastle to get stung by Hornets? It might look like Newcastle have had Watford\u2019s number this season \u2013 they beat Javi Gracia\u2019s team at St James\u2019 Park in November and then held them to a draw at Vicarage Road the following month \u2013 but a key feature of each of those games was Watford\u2019s wastefulness. Gerard Deulofeu was the main culprit, repeatedly goofing in front of goal in both matches. If he plays on Saturday, he can expect to get opportunities to atone because Watford are the better team, much happier and far more likely than Newcastle to win a trophy in the foreseeable future, facts that are always worth mentioning to anyone who whines about the nefarious influence of foreign owners in English football. PD 8) Hall for another popular Hoops return? Having been thrashed 4-1 at home by Preston last weekend, QPR will hope to avoid further embarrassment on Saturday when League One leaders Portsmouth visit Loftus Road. While Steve McClaren may well give fringe players such as Matt Ingram, Osman Kakay and Bright Osayi-Samuel a game, the QPR player fans would probably most like to see lining up against Pompey is Grant Hall. The defender, once a first-team staple, has completed 90 minutes just twice this season following a 2017 diagnosis of tendonitis which left him sidelined for the best part of two years. Hall has revealed the injury led to him struggling with a bout of depression he felt unable to talk about until QPR director of football Les Ferdinand pointed him in the right direction. The player received a rapturous welcome when he completed the duration of his side\u2019s third-round win against Leeds. He has not played since but fitness permitting should start against Portsmouth. BG 9) Newport miss home comforts after third-round shock Newport County\u2019s punishment for their third-round victory over Leicester City is a 540-mile round trip to the Riverside Stadium, where on Saturday they will take on a Middlesbrough side 56 places above them in the league. Having made almost \u00a3500,000 already from this year\u2019s FA Cup, Michael Flynn\u2019s men treated themselves to a night of luxury at The Belfry on Thursday and were due to train at St George\u2019s Park before continuing their journey to Teesside. Despite this pampering, their players would almost certainly prefer to be playing at Rodney Parade, an inhospitable, hostile environment that both Tottenham and Leicester have struggled to deal with in the past year. Getting a result against whatever side Tony Pulis fields will be a tall order, but the prospect of a money-spinning home replay you\u2019d give them every chance of winning will be all the motivation this battling Welsh side needs. BG 10) Bees v Bees at the Hive Barnet are the only remaining non-league club in the FA Cup and their most recent match was a 4-0 spanking by Braintree Town, the worst team in the National League. But we should not read too much into a result skewed by a red card shown to their goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, in the third minute. Their form prior to that game was decent, with six wins in nine matches, including that splendid counterattacking triumph at Sheffield United in the third round. They will no doubt aim to do something similar against Brentford on Monday but the Championship side will arrive with ominous momentum. Thomas Frank struggled after replacing Dean Smith as head coach in October, mustering just four points from his first 10 matches in charge, but he has stabilised the side in recent weeks and they are unbeaten in their last seven matches. But has the balance been upset again by the sale of key defender Chris Mepham to Bournemouth? Barnet hope so. PD",
